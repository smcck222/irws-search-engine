FT  16 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: VW taps Yankee sector for
Dollars 250m

<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's largest manufacturer of motor vehicles, has become the
first German company to access the US corporate bond market.
The move reflects German companies' growing desire to gain access to the US
capital markets, the largest in the world. It follows Daimler-Benz's recent
decision to seek a full listing for its shares on the New York Stock
Exchange and the store group Kaufhof's move to establish a sponsored
American depositary receipt programme in the US.
Volkswagen sold a total of Dollars 250m of 'Yankee' debt securities last
week via a two-tranche rule 144a bond offering. Such an offering allows a
company to sell securities to large US investment institutions without being
obliged to comply with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission's full listing
requirements.
Mr Rutbert Reisch, VW's group treasurer said: 'A full listing would require
disclosures which we are not willing to make.'
Daimler's decision to seek a full listing required it to publish its
accounts under US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. This move
towards greater disclosure irritated other German companies, which were
displeased that Daimler had reached unilateral agreement with the SEC on the
the terms of a listing.
'It is not the disclosure (of our profit and loss account) which bothers
us,' said Mr Reisch at VW yesterday. 'It is the hidden reserves. Say we get
into a price war with the Japanese later in the decade: I don't want them to
know just how far we can go. It is not worth a listing.'
Despite the publicity surrounding Daimler's listing, the group has not yet
raised any cash directly from the US market. Deutsche Bank, 28 per cent
shareholder in Daimler, will be placing a 3 per cent stake worth DM1bn in
the US market early next year.

FT  16 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Swaps market may be bigger
than estimated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SWAPS market may be substantially larger than is generally recognised,
according to a survey of the world's leading derivatives dealers by Swaps
Monitor, a New York-based publication.
The survey says the size of the market stood at more than Dollars 7,000bn at
the end of 1992, substantially higher than the widely-quoted estimate of
Dollars 4,500bn given by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association
(ISDA), the industry's trade group.
The Swaps Monitor survey took the ISDA figure as a base and added the volume
of swaps by non-ISDA members and by ISDA members who did not participate in
the survey. The total is made up of Dollars 6,000bn in interest rate swaps
and Dollars 1,100bn in currency swaps.
Based on these figures, the capital requirement under BIS rules for the
world's commercial banks is estimated at Dollars 4bn for interest rate swaps
and Dollars 3bn for currency swaps.
The survey also used company results to rank the amount of swaps outstanding
on financial institutions' balance sheets (although variations in accounting
standards mean that banks from some countries, such as Japan, may be
under-represented).
According to the survey, JP Morgan has the highest level of outstanding
swaps, at over Dollars 450bn, followed by Paribas and Chemical. Of the top
10 dealers, seven are American and three French.
Barclays, the largest UK participant in the swaps market, comes eighth in
the table for interest rate swaps with Dollars 247bn.
The 10 largest dealers in interest rate swaps account for 49 per cent of the
total while the 10 largest currency swap dealers account for 40 per cent,
according to the survey.

<TEXT>
SONY Music Entertainment, the entertainment arm of Sony, the Japanese
consumer electronics company, said earnings and sales fell for the first six
months to September due to the lack of Japanese hit records.
Pre-tax profits for the first half plunged 21.8 per cent to Y9.9bn (Dollars
93m) on a 1.7 per cent fall in sales to Y49.9bn. After-tax profits declined
16.1 per cent to Y5.9bn.
For the full year to next March, the company is pessimistic over prospects
for music hits, and projects a drop in profits and sales for the first time
in 12 years. Unconsolidated pre-tax profits are expected to fall 21.6 per
cent to Y17.6bn on a 6.5 per cent drop in sales to Y94.2bn.
Teac, a leading Japanese audio equipment maker, fell into the red for the
first six months to September due to the appreciation of the yen and
prolonged economic slump.
The company saw a non-consolidated pre-tax loss of Y4bn, compared to a Y460m
profit a year earlier. Sales fell 9.7 per cent to Y54bn, while it posted a
loss of Y4.1bn on an after-tax level, against a profit of Y190m the previous
year.
Teac said sales of its mainstay computer and information equipment fell 12.6
per cent from a year earlier, while exports declined 7 per cent as the
higher yen undermined overseas demand.
For the full year to March, the company expects a pre-tax loss of Y6.3bn on
a 12 per cent decline in sales to Y105bn.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SUMITOMO Realty and Development, the Tokyo-based property developer,
suffered a 31.5 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y5.1bn (Dollars 48m) for
the first half, despite a 47 per cent increase in sales during the period.
The sales figure of Y190bn was boosted by sales of its land holdings,
intended to reduce the company's debt and to assist in covering losses
incurred by a finance subsidiary which is under reconstruction.
Eight commercial buildings were completed during the period, and another 11
are scheduled to be finished in the second half, putting pressure on
Sumitomo to find tenants in a weak property market.
Sumitomo officials estimated yesterday that the company's 147 buildings had
a vacancy rate of 10 per cent, compared to 7 per cent in March. It sold 368
apartments in the first half, and hopes to sell more than double that figure
during the second half.
Demand for residential apartments in Tokyo has recovered this year, after
three years of decline, but the vacancy rate for commercial space is
continuing to rise. In areas rapidly developed during the bubble years of
the late 1980s, the vacancy rate is as high as 50 per cent.
But developers which purchased land at the price peak in 1990 have been
under pressure to complete projects to ensure a return on their initial
investment, creating a continuing flow of building completions and
increasing the pressure on commercial rents.

<TEXT>
ISETAN, a leading Japanese department store, saw sharp falls in interim
sales and earnings due to continued weak consumer confidence and the
unusually cool summer, writes Emiko Terazono.
The company reported a 51.9 per cent plunge in non-consolidated pre-tax
profits for the first half to September to Y654m (Dollars 6m) on a 5.9 per
cent fall in sales to Y200.5bn. After-tax profits fell Y56.3 per cent to
Y227m. Profits at large retailers have suffered as Japanese consumers are
opting for cheaper goods available at discount retailers. All of Isetan's
sales divisions saw falls in revenue. Sales of clothing, Isetan's mainstay,
suffered a 6.8 per cent fall to Y92.1bn, while household goods sales
declined 6.3 per cent to Y15.8bn.
For the full year to March, Isetan expects a 30.4 per cent fall in
non-consolidated pre-tax profits to Y3.5bn on a 5.1 per cent drop in sales
to Y420bn. After-tax profits are projected to fall 51.9 per cent to Y1.7bn.

<TEXT>
STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, has placed Walt Disney, the US
entertainment group which owns 49 per cent of the troubled EuroDisneyland,
on CreditWatch with negative implications. Disney's Dollars 1.2bn of
long-term debt is currently rated AA-, writes Tracy Corrigan.
Moody's, the other leading US rating agency, put Disney's debt under review
for possible downgrade last week, following EuroDisneyland's announcement of
a FFr5.3bn loss in its first year of operation.
S&amp;P cited the potential for a more extended period of negative cash flow and
possible pressures on Disney to provide increased financial support to
EuroDisneyland in debt restructuring negotiations with its bank group.
However, Disney's own operations have continued to perform in line with
expectations, with 'good momentum in operating cash flow', S&amp;P noted.
Any change in rating will depend on the final outcome of renegotiations with
banks and the degree of further business and financial support Disney may
agree to provide. S&amp;P added that it does not expect the senior debt rating
to fall below A+.

UNITED Communication Industry (Ucom) yesterday became the latest Thai
telecommunications group to announce an initial public offering of its
shares to help finance expansion in the fast-growing Thai market.
Ucom, whose parent company is 25 per cent owned by Motorola of the US, said
it planned to raise about Dollars 120m by offering 17m new shares to be
traded on the Stock Exchange of Thailand in January. The new shares will
account for 14 per cent of Ucom's enlarged capital.
Between 30 and 35 per cent of the shares issued will be sold to foreign
investors, Ucom executives said. SG Warburg is lead underwriter for the
foreign tranche, and a roadshow to publicise the offering starts in Hong
Kong next week before moving on to London, Edinburgh, Boston and New York.
Ucom supplies telecommunications equipment to Thai clients and operates
wireless communications systems. The company said it would use the money
raised to finance its new digital cellular telephone concession and to
develop its two-way radio business aimed at such markets as airports,
construction sites and the police.
TelecomAsia, the Charoen Pokphand subsidiary which has a concession to
install 2m new telephone lines in Bangkok and owns 6.25 per cent of Ucom,
recently announced plans to raise at least Dollars 400m through its own
partial public flotation.
Loxley, whose subsidiary Thai Telephone and Telecommunication is
concessionaire for 1m new lines to be installed in the provinces, is also
going public and intends to raise about Dollars 50m by selling 22.5 per cent
of its shares.

FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Barlow Rand posts 15% decline
before unbundling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN its last report before unbundling, Barlow Rand, South Africa's largest
industrial group, yesterday announced a 15 per cent decline in earnings per
share to 367 cents in the year to September, from 432 cents last year.
While the results need to be seen against the background of a domestic
economy in recession for four years, they provide further evidence of why
the group has decided to restructure.
Since 1989, when earnings peaked at 544 cents per share, they have declined
steadily to their current level, 48 per cent lower. The 1993 dividend was
maintained at 173 cents per share, virtually unchanged from 170 cents in
1989.
Turnover rose only 7 per cent in 1993 - the lowest increase in a decade - to
R38bn (Dollars 11.3bn) from R35.4bn. Although costs were well controlled,
margins were under pressure and operating profit, before interest, fell 9
per cent to R2.5bn from R2.7bn. After-tax profit fell 7 per cent to R1.6bn
from R1.7bn, but the higher portion of earnings due to minorities caused
attributable income to fall 14 per cent to R721m, from R839m.
Mr Warren Clewlow, chairman, said the recession had affected virtually all
markets in which the group operates, with coal group Randcoal, and
Finazauto, the Spanish caterpillar dealership, worst hit.
Of the two companies now split from Barlows, Reunert (electronics) and CG
Smith (food, packaging and pharmaceuticals and textiles), Reunert did well
to increase attributable earnings by 17 per cent to R108m, while CG Smith
increased earnings by 7 per cent to R443m.
Mr Clewlow said three factors had caused the R18m loss at Finazauto, the
main drag on results: very poor trading conditions, restructuring, and high
finance charges. Predicting an improvement, he said trading was unlikely to
get worse, the restructuring had been completed, and the reorganisation of
J. Bibby, the parent company, which should raise R80m to R90m, would remove,
or considerably reduce, Finazauto's debt.
Looking at the 1993 earnings in terms of the new structure, of the 364 cents
(slightly lower than the actual figure because of an accounting adjustment)
per share earnings, 120 cents would have been attributable to CG Smith, 57
cents to Reunert, 28 cents to Rand Mines, 8 cents to Rand Mines properties,
and the balance, of 151 cents, to the 'new' Barlows.
Turnover at the new Barlows would have been R12.3bn, compared to R11.2bn,
and attributable earnings R297m, against R396m.
Mr Clewlow said he believed group earnings were sustainable, and predicted
'real growth' in the coming year. The group's longer term future is closely
tied to the country's levels of infrastructure spending, currently at an
unprecedented low. Mr Clewlow said: 'A new government has got to look at
infrastructure spending, otherwise it won't be here next time round.'

FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: WMC in out-of-court settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ORD MINNETT and Western Mining Corporation are paying ADollars 20m
(USDollars 13m) to settle a court case in which it was alleged that a report
by the Sydney-based stockbroker - stating that WMC's sale of a 50 per cent
interest in the Lady Bountiful gold mine for ADollars 201m was 'fair and
reasonable' - was negligent.
Although neither party admitted liability, the out-of-court settlement is
the latest in a series of setbacks for WMC. Earlier this year, for example,
the Melbourne-based mining house was forced to relinquish its interest in
the valuable Ernest Henry copper/gold mine following litigation with Savage
Resources. The Ernest Henry debacle also ended in a settlement, and WMC took
a Dollars 20m charge in its 1992-93 accounts to cover the costs of this.
The latest lawsuit centres on the Lady Bountiful gold mine near Broad Arrow,
in Western Australia. In 1984, WMC acquired a half share in the Lady
Bountiful project from a small exploration company called Consolidated
Exploration, and became the mine's operator. Three years later, WMC sold the
stake back to Consex for ADollars 100m in cash and 27m Consex shares - then
worth about ADollars 101m.
At the time, Consex directors commissioned an independent valuation report,
for the benefit of non-WMC shareholders, from Ord Minnett. This stated that
the price of the WMC stake was fair and reasonable.
However, production forecasts for Lady Bountiful, which were once put at
120,000 ounces of gold per year, were never met, and the mine was closed in
1991. Consex shares, which reached almost ADollars 6 in 1987, slumped to a
few cents.
Consex itself underwent management changes, shifting its base from Melbourne
to Perth, and the new regime began the legal action which alleged that the
broker was negligent in preparing the valuation report and failed to
exercise reasonable skill and care. Ord Minnett joined WMC in the action,
and hearings began in the Victorian Supreme Court last month.
Under yesterday's settlement, Ord Minnett and its insurers will pay ADollars
10m to Consex, while WMC will put up a similar amount. Ord Minnett said that
the broking firm is fully indemnified for the cost of the settlement. WMC's
shares in Consex - which now represent a stake of around 18 per cent - will
also be cancelled. The mining house said that it has already written off
this stake, although it has not previously provided for any settlement
costs.
Yesterday, Mr Kevin Troy, Ord Minnett's chairman, said that there was a
related law suit, from a Consex shareholder, which was still outstanding.
This, he said, was being contested 'vigorously'.
Meanwhile, in Perth, Consex said that proceeds from the action would help
the company continue in the gold exploration business.
Consex shares, which had been buoyed on hopes of a lucrative victory, eased
1 1/2 cents to 7 cents. Western Mining added 9 cents to ADollars 5.85.

quarter

<TEXT>
JOHN FAIRFAX, the Australian newspaper and media group in which Mr Conrad
Black, the Canadian media mogul, holds a minority interest, yesterday
announced that profits after tax and abnormal items more than doubled in the
first quarter to end-September.
The Australian group made ADollars 38.9m (USDollars 25.6m), compared with
just ADollars 17.4m in the same period of 1992.
This year's figures benefited from a ADollars 13.4m 'abnormal' income tax
gain, and also from lower interest charges, which fell from ADollars 14.6m a
year ago to ADollars 10.6m this time. However, earnings before interest and
tax were also up by 12 per cent, at ADollars 49.5m, while operating revenues
advanced by 7.6 per cent, to ADollars 209.2m.
In a brief statement, the company said that classified and display
advertising volumes carried by The Sydney Morning Herald and by the Age in
Melbourne, two of its flagship newspapers, had increased 'in line with
improving trading conditions'.
'The increase in advertising volumes, together with rate and cover price
increases, account for the increased revenue,' Fairfax added.

FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: US Pru to partially float
reinsurance unit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE PRUDENTIAL, the US insurer, plans to retain a majority stake in its
reinsurance arm in a partial flotation that would value the unit at more
than Dollars 1bn.
The company, which earlier this year pursued a private sale of the whole
unit, said it would sell 20m of Prudential Reinsurance's 50m shares in a
public offering, 4m of them outside the US. An over-allotment provision
allows for the sale of a further 3m shares.
The Prudential abandoned its pursuit of a private sale in August after it
was unable to raise the Dollars 1.2bn target sale price.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it
would sell the shares at a maximum of Dollars 21 each, putting proceeds from
the offering at Dollars 420m and the value of the unit at Dollars 1.05bn.
By floating the company while keeping a majority interest, the Prudential
will be able to value its holding as an investment, helping to boost its
capital position.
This echoes moves by other insurers to boost their capital ratios ahead of
the year-end introduction of standardised risk-based capital rules for the
US insurance industry.
The Prudential said it wanted to sell more shares in the unit after the
flotation.

FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Hollinger drops to CDollars 6.8m
in third term

<TEXT>
HOLLINGER, the inter-national newspaper group controlled by Mr Conrad Black,
blamed a drop in nine-month earnings on the decline in the pound sterling
and weak advertising in its Canadian publications.
Third-quarter earnings dropped to CDollars 6.8m (USDollars 5.2m), or nine
cents a share, down from CDollars 9.1m, or 13 cents, a year earlier.
Revenues dipped to CDollars 213.6m from CDollars 218m.
Nine-month earnings, excluding unusual items, edged down to CDollars 33.8m
from CDollars 34.5m.
The company said operating results showed an 'encouraging improvement' in
its non-Canadian businesses, which included a 68 per cent stake in the UK
Daily Telegraph, the Jerusalem Post and a chain of small US newspapers. The
Telegraph owns a minority interest in John Fairfax Holdings of Australia.
However, the Telegraph's net contribution to Hollinger's earnings has
increased only slightly so far this year, after taking into account the
decline in the sterling exchange rate to an average of CDollars 1.93 per
pound from CDollars 2.17 in 1992.
Hollinger raised its exposure to the Canadian newspaper market last year by
acquiring a 19 per cent stake in Southam, the country's biggest daily
newspaper publisher. Hollinger does not equity-account its interest in
Southam, which suffered a third-quarter loss of CDollars 3.7m, but reported
progress in reducing labour and other costs.
Hollinger demonstrated its confidence in Southam's future this month by
announcing the sale of CDollars 100m of debentures with a redemption value
pegged to the performance of Southam's share price. The debentures are due
to be priced shortly. Hollinger said the amount of the issue might be
slightly raised.
Mr Black said Hollinger was investigating acquisitions in the US. It made an
abortive attempt last year to buy the floundering New York Daily News.

big property deals

<TEXT>
MR Paul Reichmann still occupies the same elegantly furnished corner office
in Toronto's Exchange Tower from which he looked over Olympia &amp; York until
the world's biggest real estate developer collapsed in May 1992, writes
Bernard Simon in Toronto.
As the announcement of three big projects in Mexico City shows, the man
behind New York's World Financial Centre and London's Canary Wharf is
determined to re-establish his reputation for eye-catching property deals.
'He's really eager to get back by 1997 to where he was in 1987,' says Mr
Andrew Sarlos, a Toronto investment manager who knows Mr Reichmann well.
O&amp;Y has been in the hands of creditors since earlier this year. Only its US
subsidiary, in which the Reichmann family retains a 20 per cent stake, has
avoided bankruptcy protection procedure. The US unit is still trying to
negotiate a debt restructuring plan with its lenders.
The Reichmanns are moving on. Mr Paul Reichmann's nephew Philip and his
son-in-law Mr Frank Hauer are building a new property management company,
Olympia &amp; York Properties.
Mr Reichmann earlier this year set up Reichmann International (RI), which
combines his experience in large real estate projects with the financial
resources and acumen of Mr George Soros, the New York-based investor.
The two are partners in the Quantum Realty Fund, an investment fund set up
last March. It recently paid Dollars 634m for a package of commercial and
residential properties owned by Travelers Corp, the US insurance group.
RI is a modestly sized company, employing only a few dozen people. Besides
its Toronto base, it has offices in New York and Mexico City.
Mr Reichmann's ambitions are mirrored in his new employees, several of whom
had links with O&amp;Y. Mr Leonard Chazen, head of the New York office and RI's
co-chief executive, worked as a legal adviser to O&amp;Y before becoming a
partner in Tishman Speyer Properties, a large US property owner and manager.
Mr Reichmann has also re-hired Mr Ronald Soskolne, a South African-born
architect who led the design team for Canary Wharf and New York's World
Financial Centre. Mr Peter Anderson, finance specialist, spearheaded the
abortive attempt by Canary Wharf to raise money through an Enterprise Zone
unit trust.

FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Hyundai Motor aims to double
capacity by 2000
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HYUNDAI Motor, South Korea's largest maker of vehicles, plans almost to
double its production capacity to 2m cars and trucks by 2000.
The Won3,300bn (Dollars 4bn) project to build three factories and two
engineering centres would make it one of the world's 10 biggest producers of
vehicles.
Hyundai's expansion is a key element in the state-sponsored X-5 programme to
make South Korea one of the five leading vehicle manufacturers by the end of
the century. The programme is being supported by soft state loans.
Some analysts, however, question whether South Korea is heading for
overcapacity in vehicle production.
Hyundai Motor can now produce 1.15m vehicles a year at its facilities in the
south-east city of Ulsan, the manufacturing centre of the Hyundai business
conglomerate.
The new facilities will be built in the western half of the country as part
of the government's plan to promote balanced regional development.
The first factory at Wanju, North Cholla province will be completed in 1995
and produce 70,000 trucks and buses a year. It will be the centre for
Hyundai's production of large-sized commercial vehicles.
A plant at Asan, South Chungchong province, will go into operation in 1996
and produce 300,000 medium-sized cars annually for export.
The final phase of expansion will be a facility at Yeochon, South Cholla
province, which will begin producing 500,000 vehicles a year in 2000. It
will also include a research centre and test track.
The expansion coincides with efforts by Hyundai to increase sales in Europe
and Asia and reduce its dependence on the North American market. Exports
have been boosted this year by a 20 per cent fall in the value of the Korean
won against the Japanese yen.
Hyundai estimates that overseas sales will rise by 16 per cent to 330,000
vehicles. Significant growth in Asia has offset a downturn in European sales
due to the recession.
It is considering building two overseas plants, one in Europe, the other in
Asia.

FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Reichmanns take a gamble on
Mexico - Deals planned by the Canadian brothers and George Soros
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Reichmann brothers, the Canadian property developers who last week
announced three big real estate investments in Mexico City, are convinced
that Mexico is heading for an Asian-style economic boom.
But some rival developers are already saying they have arrived too late and
the decision to invest in projects worth more than Dollars 1bn, with US
financier George Soros, resembles their ill-fated investment in London's
Canary Wharf.
The Canadian developers have been warmly welcomed by the Mexican government,
which is anxious to turn the decaying capital city into a centre of
services, with world-class office space, hotels, and shopping malls.
The Reichmanns are attracted by a market that until recently has had few top
quality buildings, and where developers obtain annual returns on their
capital of around 30 - 40 per cent.
Like other developers, they expect Mexico's integration with the US (helped
but not dependent upon the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement) and
rapid economic growth to fuel demand for top class office space.
'The demand for more space and demand for international level of quality
will grow rapidly,' says Paul Soskolne, head of development for Reichmann
International. 'Top level quality does not exist in any building in Mexico.
We can bring expertise to the market.'
However, some developers warn that the Reichmanns may have arrived too late
for spectacular returns, and may be too optimistic about Mexico's economic
prospects. They suggest that one of their projects bears a striking
resemblance to Canary Wharf, the development in London's docklands that
brought Olympia &amp; York to bankruptcy.
In anticipation of an economic upturn that has yet to materialise, Mexico
has seen a construction boom for the past couple of years.
Softec, a leading property consultancy in Mexico City, calculates that the
supply of top quality triple-A office space will more than double from
5.158m sq ft in 1993 to 11.545m by 1995. Vacancy rates have already
increased from about 1 per cent in 1990 to 13 per cent now, and rents have
started to fall.
'There is a huge over-supply of office space that will take a long time to
absorb,' says Mr Gene Towle, the head of Softec. 'There are a lot of
projects that will find themselves without tenants.' Part of the problem has
been low growth: Mexico's economy is set to grow by only 2 per cent this
year, much less than originally forecast.
The Reichmanns will build a shopping, residential and office centre in an
old part of town devastated by the 1985 earthquake known as Alameda; a
42-storey office tower in Mexico City's principal financial district, on
Avenue Reforma; and a 20 acre commercial, office and residential village in
Santa Fe, on the western outskirts of the city.
Both the Alameda and Santa Fe projects are considered by many developers to
be risky. Previous plans to develop Alameda have fallen foul of local
residents' complaints. Mexico is changing government next year, and without
strong backing from the new Mayor of the city, the project could fail to
obtain the necessary momentum.
Santa Fe - a brand new 1,600 acre commercial, office and residential zone of
which the first part is already open - is about eight miles from the
financial centre of the city.
As yet there are no reliable transport links connecting it to the city, and
few restaurants or other secondary services have been set up.
Some developers say the project, like Canary Wharf, is too big and too far
away from the centre to attract necessary demand.
Mr Juan Enriquez Cabot, the city official in charge of Santa Fe, says
infrastructure will come when the development reaches a critical mass.
Unlike Canary Wharf, Santa Fe is just 10 minutes drive from the most
affluent residential zone of the City, making the site convenient for
executives.
Mr Reichmann said in a news conference in Mexico City that he will pre-sell
offices and sites before starting construction, thus reducing the risk of
being landed with unlet buildings.
The Reichmanns are looking for local partners to share the investment. Some
capital may be raised by a new Reichmann/Soros property fund.
The crucial and uncertain factor is demand for top quality space in the
future.
If Mexico's economy fails to boom, then even the most optimistic developers
admit the chances of all new buildings finding tenants is slight. The
country's property sector would then resemble more the sluggish markets in
the US and UK, and less the fast-growing high margin one the Reichmanns take
Mexico to be.

FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Cost-cutting planned by
Tabacalera after 61% fall
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TABACALERA, Spain's government-controlled tobacco group, reported a 61 per
cent drop in consolidated pre-tax profits to Pta6.4bn (Dollars 46.8m) for
the first nine months. It is to introduce a cost-cutting programme to
improve its balance sheet.
The profits plunge was blamed on an increase in contraband tobacco,
competition from imported lower-priced brands, and the increased cost of raw
materials following the peseta's depreciation.
Tabacalera, which intends to shed 500 jobs under early retirement schemes,
said it hoped to save more than Pta1bn before the end of this year through
spending cuts.
The latest figures disguised signs of improvement in the group's sales,
thanks to a recent government crackdown on tobacco smuggling.
Sales fell by 10 per cent against the first nine months of last year. In
September this year, when anti-contraband legislation came into force, sales
fell by just over 1 per cent against September 1992.
Tabacalera did not consolidate the food group Royal Brands, 50 per cent of
which was sold to RJR Nabisco of the US in July.
The Spanish group, which hopes Nabisco will buy Royal Brands outright next
year, said it considered its remaining 50 per cent stake in the food
division to be a 'short-term' investment.

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SAAB Automobile stepped up the recovery pace in the third quarter of 1993
with a 47 per cent reduction in losses after financial items, to SKr285m
(Dollars 34.8m).
The result, which compares with a SKr541m deficit in the same 1992 period,
reflects the benefits of a cost-cutting programme.
It means that losses at the company, jointly-owned by General Motors of the
US and Saab-Scania, amounted to SKr844m over the first nine months, down 37
per cent from SKr1.34bn last time.
A 20 per cent rise in sales, to SKr3.72bn, during the latest quarter helped
lift sales for the first nine months by 3 per cent to SKr11.5bn.
The improvement reflects the company's invoicing to dealers and importers,
rather than improved market conditions or any significant benefit from the
depreciation of the krona.
Retail sales were substantially lower at 53,000 cars, compared with 66,000
last year, largely because the group stopped making its old 900 series in
March.
The latest figures include some sales of the new 900 model which was
launched on the European market in September. The launch has led to an
upturn in group sales in Sweden. A positive response in other key markets,
including the UK and US, is expected in the final few months.
Car sales of between 73,000 and 75,000 are expected in the full year. This
is less than the 80,000 units originally forecast.
Although Saab expects to remain in the red for the full year, it says its
deficit will be 'substantially lower' than last year's SKr2.69bn loss.
It is looking to end a run of five consecutive years of losses next year
with at least a break-even result.

FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Slimmer Wang gets back on line /
A look at how the US computer group has re-emerged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CAIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was once America's fastest growing computer company. But when Wang
Laboratories slipped into bankruptcy 15 months ago, there were fears it had
entered a black hole from which there could be no return.
The position seemed desperate. It was one of the first victims of the
profound changes now racking the global computer industry. Its technology
was obsolete, its revenues were declining rapidly, and its debt, despite the
Herculean efforts of former chairman Mr Richard Miller - who had managed to
pay off Dollars 575m - stood at a over half a billion dollars.
Today, Wang will report its first quarterly figures since emerging from the
protection of Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code three weeks ago. The
price paid for survival includes loss of control by the family of Dr An
Wang, the brilliant Chinese-born inventor whose death from cancer in 1990
exacerbated the crisis, and a significant change of identity.
The old Wang with Dollars 3bn in sales was a manufacturer of proprietary
minicomputers tuned to run Wang's own, well-regarded office software.
Today's Wang is a slimmer computing services company with just under Dollars
1bn worth of sales, marketing a range of white-collar productivity software
and prepared to work with industry standard hardware and other suppliers to
meets customers' needs.
The chief link with the old Wang remains the commitment to computer systems
for the office and for workgroups.
Mr Miller resigned at the beginning of the year. Wang has a new chairman and
chief executive in Mr Joseph Tucci, promoted last month. Mr Tucci joined
Wang as vice-president, operations, in 1990. He was recruited by Mr Miller,
who reasoned that Mr Tucci's previous experience with Unisys, another US
manufacturer hard-hit by the changes in the industry, could help Wang
through the crisis.
Crucial to the company's survival has been the manoeuvres to eliminate the
debt burden and rejuvenate the balance sheet. The key has been a conversion
of debt to equity. Wang's principal creditors, including suppliers such as
Hewlett-Packard, were persuaded to take stock in the new company.
Before the plan was confirmed, Wang had a negative net worth of Dollars
508m, with combined short-term and long-term debt of Dollars 497m. Now,
coupled with the debt conversion, the company has raised a further Dollars
60m through the placement of preferred stock, and describes itself as having
the strongest balance sheet in the computer industry.
Its justification is a cash level at 20 per cent of total assets, compared
with 8 per cent for Hewlett-Packard and 6 per cent at IBM. Long-term debt is
1 cent of equity, against 28 per cent at IBM and 97 per cent for Unisys.
The essence of the Wang argument was that the company could successfully
move from proprietary hardware and software to open - or industry standard -
systems and 'client-server computing'.
Client-server computing is generally acknowledged as the principal direction
of the computer industry now. It implies networks of low-cost personal
computers linked through a network to larger computers which share the
processing load.
Wang has spent the past three years converting its old proprietary software
to the new client-server systems. It had to be done from scratch; papering
over the deficiencies of the old software simply leads to inefficiencies and
frustrated customers.
Mr Tucci describes negotiations with creditors as 'difficult' and talks of
the due diligence process. 'They went through every line of computer code to
see if we had really moved the software to client-server. In the end, the
survival plan gained the support of 97 per cent of the old and new
shareholders.
His strategy now is to develop the company's office productivity software -
including programs for document management, imaging, workflow and electronic
mail - while continuing to support its line of VS minicomputers.
The line will not develop much further, but there are 20,000 customers who
will continue to need maintenance and support.
Although the company will invest some Dollars 50m in research and
development this year, most of that will go on software development. 'There
will be no next generation of VS computers,' Mr Tucci says.
There is a newly-appointed board of directors.
The new, financially sound, Wang is also receptive to ideas in a way that
would have been alien to its predecessor. 'We are setting no rules.' Mr
Tucci says: 'We are open to every way of working with our customers and with
other suppliers.'

FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Cragnotti changes tack with
Mardon sale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE DECISION by Cragnotti &amp; Partners Capital (CPC) to sell its controlling
stake in Canada's Lawson Mardon packaging group to Alusuisse Lonza, the
Swiss aluminium and chemicals group, marks a change of strategy for the
Milan-based financial company.
For Mr Cragnotti, a former executive at Italy's Ferruzzi group, the purchase
of Lawson Mardon represented the first step in an ambitious plan to turn CPC
into an international financial powerhouse combining corporate finance with
industrial management skills.
Packaging, in the form of Lawson Mardon, was the first in a trio of sectors
identified as ripe for investment and internationalisation, with foodstuffs
and detergents representing the two others.
Since then, however, matters have changed. Mr Cragnotti, a close associate
of Mr Raul Gardini, the Italian entrepreneur who committed suicide in July,
has also become involved in the corruption investigations which contributed
to Mr Gardini's death.
Mr Cragnotti has been building up food interests in Italy, and had been
tipped as one of the potential buyers of parts of the state-controlled SME
foods, catering and retailing group now being privatised.
For Alusuisse Lonza the takeover of Lawson Mardon would represent a giant
step towards completing its 10-year restructuring programme begun two years
ago.
The programme was designed to move the group decisively away from its heavy
dependence on the volatile aluminium business, which then represented two
thirds of its SFr6.3bn (Dollars 4.2bn) sales.
By the end of the decade, the group aims to have sales of SFr9bn to SFr11bn.
It wants sales to be split in three equal parts among aluminium products,
chemicals and packaging.
It is currently pulling together its various packaging operations (mainly
based on aluminium) into a coherent division and to date, excluding Lawson
Mardon, has made eight acquisitions. Packaging division sales have grown
from SFr744m in 1988 to SFr1.4bn last year.

FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Former M&amp;A king opts to join
Morgan Stanley

<TEXT>
MR JOSEPH Perella, one half of Wall Street's most successful mergers and
acquisitions double act in the 1980s, moved back into the mainstream of
investment banking yesterday. He announced he would join Morgan Stanley.
Mr Perella resigned two months ago from Wasserstein Perella, the M&amp;A
boutique he founded with long-term associate Bruce Wasserstein in 1988. He
left behind his name and what he said was a 'significant' equity interest in
the firm.
Mr Perella, 52, will join Morgan Stanley's operating committee, but have no
involvement in the management of its investment banking department. He said
he had not discussed a management role with any of the banks he talked to.
The move to Morgan follows intense competition from several Wall Street
houses for his services, indicating the sharp increase in M&amp;A activity this
year after a two-year lull.
It also pointed to the ambition of a number of securities houses to expand
their investment banking operations.
Mr Perella eventually chose Morgan Stanley, an established house, over
Merrill Lynch, which has sought to graft a stronger investment banking
operation on to its substantial broking and trading activities.
He will fill the gap left at Morgan Stanley by the departure this year of Mr
Robert Greenhill, the bank's former president, who went to Smith Barney. But
both Mr Perella and Morgan Stanley said the appointment would have been made
even if Mr Greenhill had still been at the firm.
Mr Greenhill has remained the leading adviser to Viacom in its bid to
acquire Paramount, leaving Morgan Stanley with only a supporting role in the
biggest contested takeover battle since the late 1980s - advising Nynex on
its investment in Viascom.
However, the bank's work for Merck in the acquisition of Medco Containment
Services, and for AT&amp;T in its purchase of McCaw, will put Morgan back among
the leaders in the M&amp;A business for this year.
Mr Perella refuses to comment on why he parted company with Mr Wasserstein.
'I have an amicable relationship with Bruce. I just thought it was time to
move on,' he said.

FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Kmart falls 22% despite healthy
rise in sales

<TEXT>
KMART, the second-largest retailer in the US after Wal-Mart, yesterday
posted a 22.5 per cent decline in third-quarter earnings, despite a 10.5 per
cent increase in sales.
In the 13 weeks to October 27, net income was Dollars 94m, or 20 cents a
share, compared with Dollars 122m, or 27 cents, in the corresponding period
of 1992.
Sales reached a record Dollars 9.77bn, up from Dollars 8.84bn a year
earlier. On a comparable-store basis - excluding outlets opened for less
than a year - sales were up 3 per cent.
The company said the poor profits performance primarily reflected a further
substantial loss by its Pace membership warehouse division. In addition,
income contributed by the PayLess drug-store operation was down 31 per cent.
Although slightly worse than analysts had expected, the 20-cents-a-share
earnings figure did not raise undue concern on Wall Street. This was because
of the company's recent moves to shed the two underperforming businesses.
This month, Kmart agreed to sell 91 of its 113 Pace stores to Wal-Mart. It
also announced plans to close the remainder. Days earlier, a Los Angeles
investment company agreed to buy the PayLess operation for Dollars 1bn.
The retailer said it would take an estimated Dollars 450m charge against
fourth-quarter earnings to cover costs related to the divestments and store
closures.
Compared with a year ago, sales were more heavily weighted toward
lower-priced items. As a result, gross margins slipped to 24.1 per cent,
from 24.2 per cent.
Earnings also suffered from the effect of the 1 per cent increase in the
federal tax rate for corporations, enacted in August.
In the first nine months, net income before an extraordinary item was down
39.2 per cent to Dollars 246m, or 53 cents. Sales were Dollars 29bn, up 10.4
per cent.

retailer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX earnings at Toys 'R' Us, the US toy retailer, advanced 17 per cent
in the three months to the end of October. The result reflected the
continued benefits of increased sales of higher-margin products.
Although the results were close to analysts' expectations, the company's
share price, which had risen in recent weeks to a 12-month high, dipped
Dollars 1 1/2 on the news, to Dollars 41 3/8 .
Pre-tax earnings rose to Dollars 67.6m, as sales grew by 8 per cent during
the quarter from a year ago, to Dollars 1.45bn.
After a one-off charge of Dollars 5m due to the change in the US corporate
tax rate, net earnings were Dollars 37.5m, or 13 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 36.8m, or 12 cents, the year before.
US store sales saw a 'slight' increase year-on-year, said Mr Charles
Lazarus, chairman. German sales fell as the economy there slowed, though
other European and Canadian stores saw a sales increase.
The company plans to open between 100 and 115 stores next year, he said.

FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc sell-off price
fixed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government yesterday launched its second big privatisation. It
has set a price of FFr135 per share for individual investors in
Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals and pharmaceuticals group.
The price is lower than expected by most analysts and compares with the
FFr153.6 at which Rhone-Poulenc's shares closed yesterday.
It reflects the government's desire to attract the French public and
maintain momentum in its plans to sell 21 public sector groups.
Individual investors will now have six days to buy shares.
The price for institutional investors will be set by a book-building process
and will be announced next week. There may also be a clawback of shares for
individuals if, as expected, the issue is oversubscribed.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, estimated, however, that the
sale of the government's 43 per cent stake in Rhone-Poulenc was likely to
raise about FFr13bn (Dollars 2.2bn) compared with the FFr28bn received from
last month's privatisation of Banque Nationale de Paris.
Mr Alphandery described the privatisation of the first industrial group on
its privatisation list as an important step in the government's programme
and said he was confident of a successful sale.
Under the terms of the issue, the government will sell 47.6m shares through
a public offering. A further 31.7m shares will be sold to institutional
investors in France and abroad. Current and former employees will be able to
buy up to 8.8m shares.
Of the government's 43 per cent holding in Rhone-Poulenc, 6 per cent of the
company's shares are being reserved for a core of stable shareholders.
These will comprise several companies, including Fiat of Italy and Credit
Suisse, the Swiss bank, which will both hold about 1 per cent of the shares.
Both companies will join existing shareholders, such as Credit Lyonnais and
Assurances Generales de France, with the combined core of stable investors
accounting for about 24 per cent of Rhone-Poulenc's capital after
privatisation.
Fiat, which has an industrial alliance with Rhone-Poulenc in the fibres
market, is expected to have a seat on the company's administrative board.
The board is an 18-member panel which meets about once a quarter.
New investors in Rhone-Poulenc will enter the group's capital at a time when
it is faced with difficult markets and declining profits.
Yesterday the group confirmed earlier forecasts by announcing net profits of
FFr776m for the first nine months of the year, a fall of 30 per cent over
the same period last year.
The company said that a similar decline was expected for the full year as a
result of continued weakness in the chemicals, fibres and agrochemicals
markets and a slowdown of growth in pharmaceuticals sales.

FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Tiphook secures further finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIPHOOK, the debt-laden UK container and transport leasing group, has
obtained further facilities from its bankers and is in talks with an
unidentified third party about the possible sale of its container division.
The group has been struggling to refinance its overstretched balance sheet
and warned the costs of refinancing meant it was likely to make a loss in
the second half.
Tiphook said it did not expect to pay a dividend.
Tiphook has an estimated 17 per cent of the world's container rental fleet,
making it the second largest rental company in the world after Genstar, a
division of the US's General Electric Capital Corporation.
The container division, which accounted for more than half of Tiphook's
turnover last year, could fetch a substantial sum, although trading activity
is at a low point.
Tiphook said it was at a preliminary stage of discussions of various
alternatives with other parties.
This, combined with the container division talks, suggests the group's
bankers might be considering an orderly disposal of all the group's assets.
Tiphook recently obtained shareholder approval to allow debts to increase to
Pounds 1.3bn (Dollars 1.9bn), giving gearing of 600 per cent.
An obstacle to speedy disposals could come from disgruntled US bondholders,
who have lent Tiphook Dollars 700m in the last year.

FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Two Glaxo drugs to face Astra
challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASTRA, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, is in the final stages of
developing treatments to compete with two of Glaxo's top-selling drugs.
The company said it planned to submit its first dossier for its Turbuhaler
device containing a generic version of Glaxo's Ventolin, the world's
best-selling asthma treatment, by the end of the year.
It claimed the Turbuhaler was far more effective at delivering the drug into
the lungs than traditional inhalers. Ventolin generated sales for Glaxo last
year of Pounds 484m (Dollars 731m).
Astra did not say when it would submit a dossier to the Food and Drug
Administration in the US, the world's largest market. It is also planning to
submit dossiers for Turbuhaler generic versions of Boehringer Ingelheim's
Attovent, and Ciba's Foradil, a product licensed from Yamanouchi.
Glaxo said the Turbuhaler's ability to increase drug volumes reaching the
lungs was immaterial because the medicine's concentration could easily be
increased to compensate without risk of side-effects.
The company already markets its own dry-powder disk inhaler and is
developing additional asthma delivery systems. It admitted Ventolin, known
as Volmax in North America, had not had any generic inhaled competition so
far in the US.
The Swedish group also said that in 1995 it would submit the first dossier
for the eradication of helicobacter pylori, a bacterium that causes peptic
ulcers, using its anti-ulcer drug Losec and an antibiotic, amoxycillin.
A large proportion of Glaxo's sales of Zantac, the world's best-selling
drug, are to prevent the recurrence of ulcers. If the combination is
effective and adopted by doctors it could have an adverse impact on Zantac
sales, which represent 44 per cent of Glaxo group turnover.
Glaxo is developing its own eradication therapy using Zantac.

FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Italy kicks off state sales with
67% of banking group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S first attempt at a big privatisation aimed at retail investors will
start on December 6 with the sale of the IRI state holding company's 67 per
cent stake in Credito Italiano, the country's sixth largest bank.
The deal, forecast to raise about L2,000bn (Dollars 1.2bn), marks the
beginning of an ambitious and much delayed privatisation drive which should
see the disposal of two further government-controlled banks by next March.
The forthcoming privatisations include Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the
Rome-based financial services group, due for sale in February, and Banca
Commerciale Italiana, one of Italy's best-known financial institutions,
scheduled for March.
The sales will loosen the state's stranglehold on the financial services
sector. They could herald a reorganisation of domestic banking, which has
failed to match the pace of change in other big European countries because
of geographical limits on growth and political barriers to bank mergers.
Both have now been removed.
The terms of the Credito Italiano flotation, being co-ordinated by the bank
and Goldman Sachs, will be revealed on December 4.
IRI will sell between 336m ordinary shares, representing 25.6 per cent of
the total, and 840m. It will dispose of its remaining 17.4 per cent of the
bank's non-voting preference stock.
Credito Italiano's reputation is founded on corporate lending, notably to
northern Italy's leading industrial groups, and securities trading. Since
the liberalisation of branch expansion rules in 1990, it has sought to
develop its retail banking coverage by opening new branches. Net profits
amounted to L133bn in the first half of this year.
The bank has tended to be in the shadow of BCI, its slightly bigger
neighbour. That image was partly confirmed yesterday by Mr Romano Prodi,
IRI's chairman, who said BCI would have been privatised first had it not
been for the fact that the Credito Italiano deal had been announced.
Credito Italiano and its advisers have embarked on an unprecedented press
and publicity campaign to facilitate the sale. The bank's two managing
directors appeared on Italian breakfast television yesterday and branches
opened early to allow staff members to watch the broadcast.
A roadshow will kick off in Milan on Friday, when further details of the
sale plans and trading prospects are likely to be revealed.

ENERGIE-Versorgung Niederoesterreich (EVN), the Austrian energy utility,
yesterday reported higher turnover and profits for 1992-93, and promised an
increased 'winter warmer' dividend.
Turnover was Sch10.3bn (Dollars 873m), up 4.6 per cent on the previous year
in spite of the economic downturn. Operating results were up 12.4 per cent
to Sch761m. The dividend is set at 21 per cent, up from 19 per cent in
1991-92. Earnings per share rose 12.3 per cent to Sch82.
'Higher volumes of business in all areas, combined with increased
productivity and adherence to a strict cost management policy, have provided
the result,' said Mr Rudolf Gruber, chairman.
EVN has agreed to sell up to half of its 50 per cent stake in RAG, the
Austrian oil and gas exploration company in which Mobil and Shell each hold
25 per cent. The buyer is Bayernwerk, the German utility with which it will
form a new holding company. The price was not disclosed. EVN paid Dollars
98m for its stake in 1992.
Mr Gruber said the outlook was positive. EVN would benefit by about Sch100m
following Austrian tax reform.

FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Usinor sees FFr5bn loss for year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Francis Mer, chairman of Usinor Sacilor, the French state-owned steel
group, yesterday forecast the company would suffer losses of about FFr5bn
(Dollars 847m) this year and that its results were unlikely to improve until
1995.
Mr Mer said the company continued to suffer from the sharp downturn in
international steel markets which had put strong pressure on volumes and
prices.
'Second-half results are likely to be around the same levels as in the first
half of 1993,' said Mr Mer, referring to net losses of FFr2.59bn which were
recorded in the January-June period.
The first-half performance represented a sharp decline on the same period in
1992 when the group reported losses of FFr200m.
Mr Mer said that the depressed state of the international steel markets
could result in the loss of up to 100,000 jobs out of a total of 350,000
employed in the industry in Europe. But he added that Usinor Sacilor would
not have to make sharp cuts in its workforce.
'Usinor will play only a limited role in this reduction since we began our
restructuring measures in 1984,' he said.

<TEXT>
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said cutting costs and bolstering its position in
the aviation market had reduced its dependence on a partnership being
negotiated with three other European airlines.
Mr Pieter Bouw, chairman, stressed that KLM stood wholeheartedly behind
efforts to arrive at a partnership with Swissair, Scandinavian Airlines
System (SAS) and Austrian Airlines under the code name Alcazar.
However, Mr Bouw added that KLM's programme of lowering costs and improving
service to passengers meant that KLM was less dependent on the alliance than
it had been.
Internal cost-cutting had allowed KLM to take part in the talks without its
'back to the wall', he said.
'What we want to avoid, and what we have avoided, is that partnership is
KLM's only strategy for survival,' he said. He was speaking less than two
weeks after KLM unveiled a better-than-expected 20 per cent increase in net
profit for the 1993-94 second quarter.
Mr Bouw said this did not mean that KLM had changed heart about the alliance
but said his comments tried to explain why the carrier had sought to lift
productivity over the past few years.
The four-way merger talks have become bogged down by difficulties in
choosing a US partner airline. Each airline, with the exception of Austrian
Airlines, has a partner in the US.

FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Nissan Iberica deeper in red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN Motor Iberica, the Spanish arm of the Japanese carmaker, plunged to a
pre-tax loss of Pta28.01bn (Dollars 207m) in the first nine months of the
year from a loss of Pta5.44bn in the same period a year ago.
The heavy losses, which are forecast to total about Pta40bn for the full
year, are forcing the company into a drastic financial restructuring
including the write-off of about two-thirds of Nissan Iberica's equity
capital of Pta60bn.
The company said yesterday that the accumulated losses for 1992 and 1993,
which are expected to total about Pta54bn, would be funded by existing
reserves of about Pta13bn and by an equity write-off. The write-off would
reduce net worth to about Pta20bn.
Nissan, which has 70.3 per cent of its Spanish subsidiary, had planned to
inject a further Pta10bn (Dollars 73m) in new equity into the company
following the provision of Pta5bn in the summer.
Its room for financial action is being constrained by mounting losses in its
worldwide operations, in particular in Japan.
Nissan Iberica is to meet Spanish trade unions at the end of the month to
discuss its proposals to eliminate a further 500 jobs in addition to the 600
it is cutting. The workforce, which totalled 7,200 people at the start of
the year, has fallen to 6,950 and is expected to be cut by about 15 per cent
in 1993-94.
The company's finances have come under acute pressure from the sharp fall in
new vehicle sales in Spain and across west Europe, which has coincided with
heavy capital investments by the Japanese vehicle maker in Spain in new
production capacity and in the development of new models. It is carrying a
heavy burden of depreciation and financing charges.

FT  16 NOV 93 / International Company News: Holderbank expects further gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOLDERBANK, one of the world's largest cement producers, has forecast a 3.9
per cent rise in consolidated net profit to SFr405m (Dollars 270m) in 1993
and held out the prospect of further gains in 1994.
Mr Thomas Schmidheiny, chairman of the Swiss group, called this year's
expected profit rise satisfactory, considering the 'extremely difficult
conditions' in many construction markets.
Mr Schmidheiny said he could foresee a dividend increase, but was not
specific.
Cement shipments would rise 5.8 per cent to 45.6m tonnes and deliveries of
ready mixed concrete would advance 5.3 per cent to 13.9m tonnes.
The gains were coming mainly from the US and Latin American markets. Apart
from eastern Germany where sales were 35 per cent ahead of last year,
European markets were depressed.
Holderbank has operations in 30 countries, and minority interests will claim
34.6 per cent of this year's net income.
Mr Max Amstutz, deputy chief executive, said the group anticipated that the
US Holnam subsidiary and St Lawrence Cement in Canada would return to profit
next year.
Swiss Bank Corporation has made an agreed bid to acquire Seeland Bank, a
struggling Swiss regional bank based in Biel with total assets of close to
SFr5bn.
The share and cash offer values the bank at SFr193.9m.

FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Tadpole swims back into the profits stream
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TADPOLE Technology, the high technology electronics group, turned a Pounds
1.7m loss into a Pounds 749,000 pre-tax profit and almost doubled sales in
its first year after moving to the main market
The company warned, however, that it was likely to raise fresh capital from
new and existing shareholders next year, further to strengthen the balance
sheet and fund growth.
Mr George Grey, Tadpole's co-founder and chief executive, said he did not
believe the company would be forced to raise new money but it would be
prudent to do so.
The shares fell 10p to 279p.
For the year ended September 30 sales expanded 83 per cent from Pounds 12.5m
to Pounds 22.9m. Earnings per share were 3.5p compared with losses of 16.5p
a year earlier. In keeping with the practice common to most US-based high
technology stocks, no dividend will be paid.
Tadpole has its principal offices in Cambridge, and Austin, Texas.
The profit figure was helped by net interest payments of only Pounds 53,000
this year compared with Pounds 256,000 in 1992.
The company has net cash of just over Pounds 1m. Net assets are now Pounds
3m compared with Pounds 1m last year while the accumulated deficit is Pounds
2.45m (Pounds 2.84m).
Tadpole specialises in an esoteric area of electronics involving the
manufacture of high specification printed circuit boards and notebook
computers which compress the power of advanced workstations into portable
form.
Mr Grey said that most of the improvement in revenues was the result of
increasing sales of Sparcbook notebook computers based on Sun Microsystems
most powerful microprocessor.
The Sparcbook business grew by over 400 per cent during the year, despite
shortages of key components including monitor screen and disk drives.
The component problem had been solved and next year IBM would be launching a
notebook computer designed and manufactured by Tadpole based on IBM's Power
PC chip, Mr Grey said.
COMMENT
Tadpole is reaping the benefits of heavy investment in engineering and
marketing. It is still, however, an early stage in the development of the
Sparcbook market. The IBM portable workstation is an attractive proposition
but it will not be until the middle of next year before it will be possible
to judge whether the company justifies its historic p/e of 79.7. Analysts
are estimating pre-tax profits of about Pounds 5m for next year. The company
plans a Nasdaq ADR listing. Should Tadpole's notebooks achieve their
anticipated success, US interest could boost the share price substantially
if Micro Focus' experience is any guide.

FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Improved margins behind 26% advance at
Critchley
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRITCHLEY GROUP, the electrical cable accessories manufacturer which came to
market a year ago, yesterday reported a 26 per cent increase in interim
pre-tax profits, bolstered by the Pounds 1.6m acquisition in May of BT's
Label Centre business.
Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 1.27m) in the six months to
September 30 on turnover ahead 23 per cent to Pounds 13.8m (Pounds 11.2m),
including a Pounds 1.61m five month contribution from Critchley Label
Centre.
On a like-for-like basis turnover increased by 9 per cent.
Operating profits, including Pounds 142,000 attributable to Critchley Label
Centre, rose to Pounds 1.55m (Pounds 1.28m), reflecting an overall
improvement in margins, particularly overseas, and tight control of costs.
'Critchley has made good progress during the six months with an improved
contribution from all divisions,' said Mr Ian McCallum, chief executive, 'in
particular we are pleased with the progress of the Critchley Label Centre,
our first acquisition since going public.'
The core cable accessories and identification business reported a 22 per
cent increase in sales to Pounds 10.1m (Pounds 8.2m), mainly reflecting the
new acquisition and a 28 per cent increase in direct exports which helped
offset the flat UK market.
Excluding the acquisition, the business reported a modest 3 per cent
increase in sales, held back by the discontinuance of two groups of
low-margin factored products. Like-for-like sales grew by 8 per cent.
Critchley Wound Components, which manufactures coils and transformers for
circuit boards, increased sales by 22 per cent to Pounds 2.24m while
Critchley Enclosures lifted sales by 27 per cent to Pounds 1.45m (Pounds
1.14m) and moved back into profit.
The group ended the first half with net cast of Pounds 2.4m.
Fully diluted earnings per share increased by 7 per cent to 9p (8.4p) and a
maiden interim dividend of 2.6p is declared.

FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Renold resumes interim after jump to Pounds
2.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENOLD, the chain and gear manufacturer, yesterday resumed interim dividend
payments as pre-tax profits trebled to Pounds 2.4m for the six months to
October 2.
Mr David Cotterill, chief executive, said the company was starting to reap
the benefits of its Pounds 33m capital investment programme between 1989 and
1992.
However, while there was some improvement in UK and US markets, there were
no signs of recovery on the continent. The company, Europe's biggest
chain-maker, would continue to look for higher margins and new business.
The shares rose 9p to 108p yesterday.
Profits were struck on turnover of Pounds 65.4m, up 12 per cent from a
previous Pounds 58.4m, largely reflecting sterling's devaluation. At
constant exchange rates the gain was 2 per cent.
The result also included a Pounds 500,000 charge for redundancies following
a 10 per cent reduction in the German labour force. The company now employs
a total of 2,600 people, down from 4,000 in March 1989.
The chain division, which accounts for 60 per cent of the group's business,
increased profits in the UK. Cost reductions in Germany helped the business
to withstand the severe recession there.
Mr Cotterill said the gears business had 'a horrible year' in 1992-93. The
Milnrow gears business had now returned to profit in the UK.
Holroyd, which makes rotors used in air conditioning and refrigeration, was
'doing very well'.
Net borrowings fell from Pounds 14.7m to Pounds 10.1m, giving gearing of 19
per cent (28 per cent). Interest payable eased to Pounds 800,000 (Pounds
1m).
The tax charge fell from 39 per cent to 21 per cent, reflecting the fact
that much of the profit increase was earned in the UK, where tax losses are
available. Earnings per share more than quadrupled from 0.7p to 2.9p.
The interim dividend of 0.7p compares with last year's total of 1p.
Renold recently raised Pounds 400,000 from the sale of its interests in two
small lossmaking businesses.

pre-tax for the half year ended August 29, compared with previous losses of
Pounds 16,000.
Gross profits rose by Pounds 173,000 to Pounds 381,000. The improvement
reflected a combination of tighter controls on margins and costs in the
Neighbourhood Food Stores division and the elimination of losses connected
with new site developments.
There was also a Pounds 78,000 contribution to profits arising from a
surplus on the sale of properties.
The network gross turnover improved by 15.7 per cent to Pounds 12.6m. The

Earnings per share emerged at 0.1p (losses 0.1p).

FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Sidlaw edges ahead to Pounds 11m - Sales
surge but underlying margins static in oil services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Sidlaw, the Scotland-based packaging, oil services and
textiles company, rose just 5 per cent to Pounds 11.1m in the year to
September 30 in spite of an 87 per cent increase in turnover.
Sales rose to Pounds 172.9m (Pounds 92.5m), benefiting by about Pounds 60m
from an extension of the company's supply chain management business for
leading oil companies.
In October last year Sidlaw moved into chartering and managing standby and
supply vessels.
The company books all the revenue on each transaction, hence the jump in its
turnover, but retains only a management fee.
Sidlaw said underlying margins in the oil services division were static at
20 per cent.
Oil services sales rose to Pounds 94.5m (Pounds 33.7m) giving operating
profits of Pounds 7.25m (Pounds 6.7m).
The profit here included a small loss of Pounds 342,000 in the Supplylink
joint venture set up last year to offer logistics services internationally.
Drilling support work declined to about 20 per cent (24 per cent) of sales,
due partly to changes in the industry's tax structure. This figure would
always vary, the company said.
Sidlaw's packaging division saw sales ahead at Pounds 54.1m (Pounds 35.5m)
giving operating profits of Pounds 4.72m (Pounds 3.85m).
Sidlaw acquired Courtaulds Flexible Packaging just before its year end for
Pounds 78m, funded partly by a Pounds 53m rights issue and partly through
borrowings.
The move doubled the size of the company and took Sidlaw firmly into
continental Europe.
'Although it is early days with Flexible Packaging, we feel that we are
making good progress,' said Mr Digby Morrow, chief executive.
The textiles division improved sales to Pounds 24.3m (Pounds 23.3m) giving
operating profits of Pounds 564,000 (Pounds 833,000).
Interest charges rose to Pounds 1.54m (Pounds 1.17m) and gearing increased
to 73 per cent (29 per cent), lifted by the acquisition.
Net borrowings were Pounds 43.4m (Pounds 11.4m) at the year-end.
A proposed final dividend of 6.25p lifts the total from 10p to 10.5p on the
enlarged share capital.
Earnings per share slipped to 20.3p (20.9p).
COMMENTAny company confronting the aftermath of a substantial acquisition
during a period of economic difficulty may find profits more elusive than
expected in the short term. Sidlaw believes the Spanish and French economies
will remain weak for at least another year and is more confident than some
about the stability of its main market, the UK. However, the company's
recent reclassification as a packaging stock could lift the shares as they
move into the ambit of those with an appetite for the sector. Analysts'
forecasts for pre-tax profits are pitched at about the Pounds 18m mark,
putting the shares on a prospective multiple of 13.9. This looks cheap
against the packaging sector, reflecting Sidlaw's newcomer status.

FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: GRE buys US motor insurer for Dollars 100m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUARDIAN ROYAL Exchange, the insurer, yesterday made its biggest acquisition
for more than four years, paying Dollars 100m (Pounds 65m) to acquire
American Ambassador Casualty, a Chicago-based motor insurance company, from
Allianz, the German insurer.
The deal, subject to the approval of US regulators, increases GRE's exposure
to the specialised non-standard motor insurance market in the US. 'It
demonstrates GRE's commitment to controlled growth in selected markets,'
said Mr Jim McDonough, international director.
American Ambassador complements GRE's Globe American subsidiary in Ohio,
which also specialises in non-standard risks such as older drivers,
specialist cars or drivers with poor records. The two businesses are in
geographically close locations but have little territorial overlap.
American Ambassador achieved gross premium income of Dollars 88m in 1992 and
a pre-tax profit of Dollars 16m. The company has produced an underwriting
profit for each of the last five years and net assets were Dollars 81m at
the end of 1992. Premium income at Globe amounted to Pounds 39m.
After the deal GRE will derive 11 per cent of its insurance income from the
US, an increase of more than a quarter. The cash consideration is being met
from existing resources and will reduce GRE's net asset value per share by

FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Vibroplant shares dip after 27% fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIBROPLANT yesterday reported a 27 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, from
Pounds 2.03m to Pounds 1.48m, for the six months to September 30.
Mr Jeremy Pilkington, chairman of the plant hire group, described the
outcome as 'not terribly satisfactory' and 'a disappointing performance'.
The shares fell 10p to 89p.
However, Mr Pilkington said that continuing strong cash flow had further
reduced borrowings to Pounds 27m-Pounds 28m (Pounds 32m), bringing gearing
down from 58 per cent to 46 per cent.
He estimated it would fall below 40 per cent at the year-end.
Capital expenditure grew to Pounds 6m (Pounds 4m) in the half.
The interim dividend is held at 1.22p, payable from earnings of 2.08p
(2.93p) per share.
Behind the profits decline lay a slump in pre-tax profits from the US
operations to just Pounds 62,000 (Pounds 810,000), while in the UK they rose
to Pounds 1.42m (Pounds 1.22m).
Mr Pilkington said that dollar revenues were down 10 per cent, but that
translated into sterling they advanced 4 per cent.
One factor in the US decline were costs of Dollars 300,000 (Pounds 199,000)
relating to closures in the Mid-West last time.
However, the main transatlantic problem continued to be California, where
prices in hire businesses across the board had fallen some 25 per cent due
to recession in the construction, defence and aerospace industries.
'So long as we have no losses in the region, we don't want to throw the
towel in,' Mr Pilkington said.
In the UK, trading conditions continued to be poor, and the profits rise
derived from falls in depreciation to Pounds 3.38m (Pounds 3.73m) and in
interest payable to Pounds 228,000 (Pounds 614,000). Trading profits were
down at Pounds 5.03m (Pounds 5.57m).
The UK side has been refocused into six specialist businesses, a move
designed to encourage managers to 'stay close to their markets' and to
promote product innovation. Prices have been 'a little better', said Mr
Pilkington, and bad debts, which in the last full year were 4 per cent of
turnover, were now 'usefully below 3 per cent'.
Alphabet Event Hire, the toilets and corporate hospitality unit hire company
which made losses last year, had a busier summer and costs have been cut
with its back office moving into Vibroplant's Harrogate head office.
Group turnover edged ahead to Pounds 36.9m (Pounds 36.2m).

FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Queens Moat shareholders establish fighting
fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of Queens Moat Houses shareholders has set up a fighting fund and
nominated three representatives to argue on their behalf at the annual
meeting on November 29.
The three are Mr Anthony Beaumont-Dark, the former Conservative MP, Mr Denis
Woodhams, who ran a Queens Moat hotel in Stratford-upon-Avon, and Mr Peter
Bruton-Phillips, a solicitor.
The QMH Shareholders' Action Group is urging supporters to fill in proxy
forms for the meeting in favour of one or more of the three.
The group is asking shareholders to contribute 2p a share to a fighting
fund. It said it needed to take the advice of senior lawyers, property
valuation experts and accountants to ensure that shareholders' interests
were not overlooked in any restructuring.
It was particularly concerned that any debt for equity swap would dilute
shareholders' interests to an unacceptable level.
Although it recognised the importance of retaining the goodwill of creditor
banks, the group claimed insufficient attention was being paid to
shareholders' interests.
The group said yesterday that the initial response to the fighting fund
proposal had been positive. It added that it was taking legal advice on the
rights of shareholders.
The group is considering putting Mr Beaumont-Dark forward as a non-executive
director. Mr Beaumont-Dark said yesterday: 'The banks, and one understands
it, are protecting their own situation. But people feel other interests
ought to be looked to as well.'
He added: 'The banks have a certain responsibility. How well did they check
before lending money? They're not just innocent victims. The people who are
the most innocent are the shareholders.'
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, last week appointed
inspectors to investigate the group, which is talking to creditor banks
about refinancing its Pounds 1.18bn debt.

FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Aitken Hume up to Pounds 1.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AITKEN HUME International reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 871,000 to
Pounds 1.6m in the six months to September 30.
However, the banking group chose to highlight 'the profits on ordinary
activities for continuing operations' which emerged at Pounds 101,000,
against losses of Pounds 507,000 last time. Ms Jacky Beatson, group
financial controller, explained: 'This is as we are now' - just the private
banking side and some dormant companies.
Ms Beatson said that banking in the UK and the Channel Islands incurred
losses of Pounds 509,000 (Pounds 71,000), though this included provisions of
Pounds 425,000 in Aitken Hume Bank.
The corporate overhead shrank to Pounds 365,000 (Pounds 498,000) and
financial income grew sharply to Pounds 975,000 (Pounds 62,000). This income
derived from the Pounds 17.7m Aitken profited from the sale of National
Securities &amp; Research Corporation being placed on deposit.
Discontinued operations - NSR - made profits of Pounds 781,000 (Pounds
1.38m) up to its sale in May. There was also an exceptional credit of Pounds
713,000 which was the excess of the profit from the NSR sale freed by the
requirement to reinstate goodwill of Pounds 17m previously written against
reserves.
The directors said that the profit on the NSR disposal would increase when
any further amounts are released from the tax escrow account now reduced to
Dollars 11.8m (Pounds 7.8m) by the absorption into the profit from the NSR
sale of one escrow account amounting to Dollars 2.9m, from which Aitken
gains Dollars 2.24m.
After a reduced tax charge of Pounds 24,000 (Pounds 341,000) earnings
emerged at 3.08p (0.83p) per share. Again there is no interim dividend.
Sir Peter Gadsden was yesterday appointed executive chairman, Mr Bill Brown
deputy chairman and Mr David V Griffith chief executive.

FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Fenner omits dividend after drop to Pounds
315,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FENNER, the Hull-based industrial products group, is omitting its dividend
after a sharp fall to Pounds 315,000 in pre-tax profits for the year to
August 31.
The outcome compared with profits of Pounds 5.5m last year, when total
dividends amounted to 4.2p. Operating profits before exceptional items fell
from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 9.6m.
Exceptional charges of Pounds 7.92m mainly comprised restructuring costs in
the power transmission business but also included Pounds 1.2m for an aborted
merger earlier this year.
The figures were in line with the company's estimate published in September
at the launch of a rights issue, which, coupled with a 5 per cent share
subscription by European Strategic Investors, raised a net Pounds 19.8m.
The fall in operating profits reflected an operating loss of Pounds 1.8m in
power transmission, which accounted for Pounds 69m of total turnover of
Pounds 201.6m (Pounds 196.6m). Fenner is negotiating to sell the division,
which traded profitably in the second half, although no announcement is
expected before the end of the year.
Mr Mark Abrahams, finance director, said yesterday that the conveyor belt
division had come through a tough year extremely well. The loss in business
to British Coal had been replaced by exports.
The fluid power division performed well in the US and the polymer business
made operating profits of Pounds 4m on turnover of Pounds 30m.
Net interest payable dipped from Pounds 3.91m to Pounds 3.62m. Net
borrowings were up from Pounds 23.2m to Pounds 26.2m. Following the rights
issue pro forma gearing was down from 54 per cent to 10 per cent.
The results also include a contribution of Pounds 635,000 from Fenner India
and Pounds 1.6m from the sale of Fenner Industrial Controls in the US.
Losses per share were 7.86p, compared with earnings of 0.1p. Excluding
exceptionals, earnings would have been 6.83p (5.08p).

FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Exchange makes first changes to new FT-SE
Actuaries indices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK Exchange yesterday made the first changes to the proposed new
FT-SE Actuaries share indices which will become effective from January 4
next year.
By changing the name of certain sub-sectors and removing another, the
Exchange is likely to have appeased many of the most vociferous critics of
the classifications.
Out goes the Copper Mining sub-sector, incorporated into the Other Mineral
Extractors and Mines sub-sector of the Extractive Industries sector, which
deals with the misgivings of RTZ, the diversified mining company.
The Conglomerates sector is now to be called Diversified Industrials,
thereby removing a point of contention with BTR, the industrial holding
company.
Rank Organisation, the diversified leisure and office products group which
was among the most distressed by its earlier classification, moves from the
provisional Office Machinery sub-sector to Leisure.
Classification of Inchcape, the motors and business services group, remains
the biggest outstanding issue. Its position will be studied by the Stock
Exchange's classification committee when it meets again on the next two
Mondays.
Inchcape had asked to be put in the Conglomerates sector.
After the review, all 2,375 listed and USM-quoted companies will have been
found new homes within seven economic groupings, 40 sectors and 76
sub-sectors.
Companies are allocated to a sector according to the business area from
which they derive the majority of their profits.
Also on the move are Morgan Crucible and Glynwed International - both from
Building Materials to Engineering Diversified; Charter and Cookson go from
Building Materials and Chemicals Speciality respectively to Diversified
Industrials.
The Print Services sub-sector is renamed Printing and moves from the Support
Services sector to Paper &amp; Packaging which has been renamed Printing, Paper
&amp; Packaging.
Retailers, Multi-Department and Retailers, Chain Stores have been merged to
form Retailers, General Sector. Multi-Department and Chain Stores will be
sub-sectors.
The Retailers, Vehicle Distributors Sector is disbanded and Vehicle
Distributors becomes a sub-sector of the Distributors Sector.

FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Swithland flotation plans scuppered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS to float Swithland Group, the Midlands-based new and used car
retailer, have lapsed after an attempt to place the company's shares with
institutions failed.
The shares were priced at 81p each and the company would have been valued at
about Pounds 21m.
The placing was not underwritten.
It was conditional on a minimum of 48 per cent of 18.5m shares to be placed,
or 67 per cent of the 26.4m total share capital, being placed by November
12.
It is not known how many shares were placed.
The company could not be reached yesterday but former sponsors, Ionian
Corporate Finance, said: 'The position is that Swithland Group has withdrawn
its application to the London Stock Exchange for the ordinary share capital
to be admitted to the Official List.'
Swithland will issue a statement in due course. Ionian added that it had
ceased to act for Swithland Group.
It is thought that adverse press comment about the company is being blamed
for the lack of institutional interest in the stock.

FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Telegraph advances to Pounds 38.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER and DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TELEGRAPH newspaper group said it had seen little sign of recovery from
recession and promised to match price-cutting by competitors with even more
active promotion of its daily and Sunday titles.
The group's pre-tax profit increased by 28 per cent to Pounds 38.7m in the
nine months to September 30, excluding the Pounds 6.5m profit on the
investment in Trinity International Holdings. Turnover increased by 7 per
cent to Pounds 188.3m.
Circulation, which accounted for 47 per cent of total newspaper revenue, had
held up well 'in spite of severe price cutting elsewhere in the market.'
In September, News Corporation cut the weekday cover price of The Times from
45p to 30p. The Daily Telegraph's weekday price remains 48p.
The Daily Telegraph sold 1.01m copies a day in September, down from 1.05m
copies last year. The Sunday Telegraph's circulation edged ahead from
590,000 to 591,000.
The figures suggested that its strategy of increased promotion and the offer
of enhanced reader value would 'maintain the position of The Telegraph's
titles in the quality newspaper market.'
Advertising revenue was 6 per cent ahead, with improvements in display
advertising and, more recently, financial advertising. The classified
recruitment market was flat.
The share of associates' profits rose from Pounds 3.8m to Pounds 8.2m,
mainly reflecting an improvement at John Fairfax Holdings, the Australian
publisher in which The Telegraph's interest rose from 15 to 20 per cent.
Yesterday the Telegraph said it had exercised all its outstanding options to
acquire shares or non-voting convertible debentures in John Fairfax. By the
end of the year, the Telegraph expects to hold 25 per cent of the company.
Third quarter profits from Southam, the Canadian newspaper group in which
the Telegraph has a 9.36 per cent stake, 'continue to move in the right
direction,' the group said. It does not expect to see a sizeable return on
its Pounds 67m investment this year, but 'we are confident that Southam
offers potential for 1994 and beyond.'
Earnings per share were ahead from 15.7p to 19.3p.

FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Scottish bus-maker en route to new stage of
life - Walter Alexander
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK bus building industry has been a turbulent place in the past decade.
But Walter Alexander, the privately-owned Scottish bus maker, is one of the
survivors.
Its sales should rise by 55 per cent this year to Pounds 47m and profits are
growing.
Alexander, one of the familiar names in UK bus building, is based at a large
plant on the outskirts of Falkirk in central Scotland, where it was founded
in 1924. It also has a plant in Belfast.
In 1990 the Alexander family pulled out and the Walter Alexander group, then
a mini-conglomerate, ceased to be quoted on the Stock Exchange. It was sold
for Pounds 32m to Spotlaunch, a syndicate formed by Granville, the venture
capital group. Mr Ian Galloway, an experienced manager in large engineering
companies, came in to run the bus building subsidiary.
At the time he believed the task was just a matter of improving the
company's efficiency and waiting for the market to improve. But the bus
market fell by 21 per cent between 1990 and 1991 because of recession and Mr
Galloway had to cut Alexander's Falkirk workforce from 763 to 525, many of
whom were put on a three or four day week. The possibility of closure
loomed.
The bus market had been devastated in the mid-1980s by the government's
deregulation of bus services and the privatisation of bus companies.
Orders for single and double deck buses collapsed as bus operators extended
the working life of their vehicles and ordered new mini- and midi-buses,
which Alexander was slow to start making. In 1990 recession came just as
orders were beginning to recover.
Alexander's recovery began when the company launched a new midi-bus in 1991
and won an order for the first 255 vehicles from Stagecoach, the Perth-based
company which is one of the biggest groups in the privatised bus industry.
The order enabled Alexander to end short time working. Since then staff
numbers have risen to over 700, plus 220 in Belfast.
The group rebuilt its export sales with orders for large buses from Hong
Kong and last year gained an order for 200 double deck bus kits from
Singapore.
Exports now account for about half its Pounds 50m order book and most are in
the form of kits for local assembly.
In April 1992 Mr Galloway led a Pounds 7.4m management buy-out of Alexander
from Spotlaunch, backed by Standard Life and other institutions, including
Granville. But profits are still small, with pre-interest profit of Pounds
925,000 last year, expected to reach Pounds 1.6m this year. A Pounds 2m
profit is expected for 1994.
Alexander now claims to be the UK market leader with a 32 per cent share of
the domestic bus market, as well as being the only UK bus manufacturer to
export. Mr Galloway feels things will improve for surviving British makers.
Although the tail end of privatisation may cause further disruption to the
market, the new private operators are becoming more mature and are following
consistent ordering policies.
Stagecoach was floated on the Stock Exchange in the spring and Badgerline is
now coming to the market. They have been the two biggest purchasers of
Alexander buses in the past two years.
Mr Brian Souter, chairman of Stagecoach, has said that for every new bus the
company buys its operating costs go down by Pounds 6,700 a year because of
greater fuel and maintenance efficiencies.
Having had three years of organic growth Alexander would like to expand in
continental Europe by acquisition.
'We would like to get a little bigger before we move to the next stage of
our gameplan, which is a Stock Exchange flotation,' says Mr Galloway. The
company is aiming at a float in late 1994 or early 1995.

FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Yasuda to invest in Lloyd's - Japanese
group plans capital injection into insurance market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS TO introduce corporate capital to Lloyd's of London received a further
boost yesterday when Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance, Japan's second
largest insurance group, announced it was intending to invest money in the
insurance market.
The news came amid further indications that the limit of UK institutional
and retail investment interest in Lloyd's plans has been reached, when two
investment trusts - New London Capital and CLM Insurance Fund - announced
they had raised less capital then expected.
Yasuda will invest Pounds 1.5m (the minimum possible under Lloyd's rules) in
its own corporate fund, committing Pounds 3m to eight Lloyd's syndicates
managed by the Wellington, Murray Lawrence and Kiln managing agencies. Kiln
Cotesworth Members Agency will advise the Japanese on syndicate selection.
It is understood that the syndicates will tend to be those which already
have Japanese business links.
'Yasuda has been trading with Lloyd's for many years and considers that the
introduction of corporate capital provides an excellent opportunity to
reconfirm our support and long-term commitment to this important market,'
said Yasuda.
'Although modest in size the investment has immense importance in strategic
terms,' said Mr Andrew Fleming-Williams of RJ Kiln. Kiln Cotesworth is also
working with Cazenove and Baring Brothers on a Pounds 10m investment trust.
New London Capital, the investment trust sponsored by SG Warburg, published
its listing particulars but announced that only Pounds 60m had been placed
with institutions, compared with an original target of between Pounds 100m
and Pounds 150m.
Mr Bruce Schnitzer, chairman, conceded that the company was 'smaller than we
would have ideally liked.'
New London, which is advised by Chartwell Advisers, a subsidiary of
Chartwell Re Corporation, will raise Pounds 60m before expenses by issuing
60m shares at a price of 100p. Minimum subscription is for 20,000 shares.
The trust will provide up to Pounds 105m of underwriting capacity to
approximately 20 syndicates.
Separately, CLM Insurance Fund, the investment trust sponsored by Barclays
de Zoete Wedd, announced that only 6.2m of the 30m shares available under
its offer for subscription had been sold, raising more than Pounds 6m. CLM
had earlier reduced the size of its placement with institutions, raising
Pounds 80m, compared to an earlier target of Pounds 200m.
BZW took a 15.01 per cent stake in the fund, subscribing for 12.94m shares.
Mr Jeremy Mead, a director of BZW, conceded that 'we would have hoped for a
little more, but there has been a lot of competition for public funds.'

FT  16 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Third quarter increase for ADT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADT, the security and car auction group which does much of its business in
the US but retains a UK quote, yesterday reported a 10.5 per cent increase
in third quarter pre-tax profits but a slight decline in earnings per share.
The Bermuda-registered group announced pre-tax profits of Dollars 36.9m
(Pounds 24.4m) in the three months to September 30, up from Dollars 33.4m,
on sales ahead 4.8 per cent to Dollars 354.9m (Dollars 338.5m). This boosted
the profit figure for the nine months to Dollars 105.6m against Dollars
109m.
However, a higher Dollars 5.4m (Dollars 2.5m) tax charge at three months,
coupled with the issue of 20.7m new shares as part of the August refinancing
package, resulted in a fall in earnings per share from 24 cents to 22 cents.
Nevertheless, ADT's share rose 3p to close at 603p.
Mr Michael Ashcroft, chairman and chief executive, said ADT's businesses
'continued to perform in line with management's expectations'.
The main increase in operating profits came in the security services
division which reported operating income of Dollars 39.1m (Dollars 36.9m) on
sales which increased to Dollars 231.3m (Dollars 225.3m).
In North America a further 37,000 new residential alarm systems were sold
during the third quarter, representing a 26 per cent increase over last
year.
Commercial sector sales were stronger in the US Midwest, south-east and
western regions with some signs of improvement in the north-east and
mid-Atlantic regions.
In Canada, however, the directors said that business was unlikely to be up
to expectations until there were more positive signs of an economic upturn.
Operating profit in the vehicle auctions division dipped to Dollars 15.1m
(Dollars 15.8m) although sales increased to Dollars 84.4m (Dollars 80.2m).
The number of vehicles consigned to ADT auctions in the US rose by 20 per
cent over the 1992 period while in the UK the volume of vehicles sold
increased by 7 per cent. Exchange rate movements, however, meant that the
contribution from the UK in dollar terms fell.
ADT's other expenses, less income, figure moved from a net expense of
Dollars 6m in the third quarter last time to a gain of Dollars 200,000, more
than offsetting an increase in net interest.

FT  16 NOV 93 / BAA may manage Rome airport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BAA, the privatised British Airports Authority, is in talks with IRI, the
Italian state holding company, over acquiring a stake in Rome's Fiumicino
airport and a management contract.
BAA has been seeking to market its expertise in airport management as part
of its efforts to expand internationally.
It is today expected to unveil an 8-10 per cent increase in interim pre-tax
profits to about Pounds 235m.
The negotiations over Rome airport follow BAA's management contract to
develop retailing at Pittsburgh airport in the US and talks in China to help
modernise and develop Chinese airports through joint ventures.
Although the eventual privatisation of Rome's Fiumicino airport remains a
highly complex issue, BAA is understood to consider an equity investment and
management of the airport as an attractive long-term opportunity.
Rome airport handles about 19m passengers a year of which 60 per cent
involve international flights. BAA sees considerable potential at Rome for
retail development, which has become one of the main sources of income at
its UK airports.
IRI, which controls the Rome airports authority, insisted yesterday that any
deal would depend on the passing of new legislation, since existing law
stipulates ownership must be held by a public body.
IRI controls the Rome airports authority through a 56 per cent stake held by
Alitalia, the Italian national carrier, and a further 43 per cent held by
Iritecna, the state holding company's construction arm. The pressure for the
airport sell-off comes from the financial plight of Alitalia and Iritecna,
which are both losing money.
The airports authority is also the type of activity that Professor Romano
Prodi, the head of IRI, is anxious to privatise. Rome airport is undergoing
costly redevelopment and the authority needs financial assistance.
The Rome airports authority, already under fire from Italy's anti-trust
monitors, has traditionally been regarded as an important source of
political patronage. One problem in any privatisation will be the fate of
the 6,693 staff. BAA employs directly only 4,000 at London Heathrow airport,
which handles twice as many passengers as Rome.

FT  16 NOV 93 / GM plans Dollars 5.7bn move on pension deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors plans to transfer its interest in the future earnings of its
Electronic Data Systems subsidiary to its pension plan in a Dollars 5.7bn
deal aimed at holding down its pension fund deficit.
In a briefing of financial analysts yesterday, the company also revealed
that its pension deficit is expected to reach Dollars 24bn by the end of
this year, up from Dollars 14bn at the end of 1992.
GM, which has the largest unfunded pension liability of any US company, said
it had formulated the plan after discussions with the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation, which covers private sector pension fund shortfalls.
Under the plan, GM would transfer 185m of its class E shares to the pension
plan. The dividend on these shares is based on the earnings of EDS, a
company founded by Mr Ross Perot.
The carmaker said it would retain full ownership of the systems company. It
will also continue to hold 45m of the class E shares in reserve to satisfy
the possible conversion of a separate class of stock it issued earlier this
year. The shares transferred to the fund will be managed by a separate
trustee and eventually sold in instalments on the stock market. It added
that it expected to maintain an orderly and liquid market in the shares.
The plan, which needs the approval of tax and regulatory agencies as well as
GM's board, received initial support from analysts, who welcomed it as a
creative partial solution to GM's pension difficulties.
GM's pension deficit has grown largely because of falling US bond rates,
which are used to calculate the company's future pension fund liability.
Each 1 percentage point fall in bond rates adds Dollars 5bn-6bn to pension
liabilities, said Mr Richard Wagoner, chief financial officer.
Of the Dollars 10bn increase in the deficit this year, Dollars 8bn resulted
from lower US rates, he said. A further Dollars 1bn was due to lower
interest rates elsewhere in the world, while the remaining Dollars 1bn
increase in the deficit resulted from improvements in benefits and early
retirements.
The increase in the deficit comes in spite of Dollars 4.4bn of contributions
made to the plan so far this year.

FT  16 NOV 93 / BA rises to Pounds 172m as traffic picks up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Airways yesterday reported a sharp rise in second quarter pre-tax
profits from Pounds 136m to Pounds 172m, helped by cost-cutting and some
recovery in traffic.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, said there were 'signs of recovery in our
two major markets, the UK and the US'. But he warned: 'Trading conditions
overall this winter will remain difficult as a result of over-capacity in
the industry,
For the six months to September 30, pre-tax profits rose 3.5 per cent to
Pounds 235m. Operating profits were nearly 30 per cent ahead at Pounds 344m
on a 14.1 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 3.29bn.
But the company suffered Pounds 32m of losses largely from its French and
German regional airline operations.
Mr Robert Ayling, BA's managing director, said its French partner, TAT, was
about to launch a programme to reduce costs and improve the airline's
profitability.
Passenger numbers increased 12.1 per cent to 15.4m in the first half. But
with a slightly higher rise in capacity, the airline's passenger load factor
slipped 1.8 percentage points to 72.8 per cent.
The relative weakness of sterling improved yields and first and business
class premium traffic showed some strengthening in the second quarter with
an average 2 per cent growth over last year. However, Mr Ayling said the
main growth in the first half had come in economy class travel.
Sir Colin stressed the importance of increasing efficiency. BA's target this
year was to achieve savings of Pounds 150m. 'We have already identified
savings of over Pounds 100m. This added to savings over the last two years
of more than Pounds 400m means that we will have taken more than half a
billion pounds of costs out of our company over a three-year period.'
He said BA was leading the way in forming a global airline system with its
partners in the US, Australia and Europe. This was likely to lead eventually
to a rationalisation of the partners' fleets, particularly in the commuter
and regional turbopropeller aircraft sector.
Shareholders will receive an interim dividend of 3.18p a share, up 8.5 per
cent.
Fully diluted earnings per share were 0.5 per cent down at 20.4p, reflecting
last May's Pounds 442m rights issue.
Gearing stood at 51 per cent at the end of the first half showing an 11
point improvement since the end of March.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Tiphook may sell container division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIPHOOK, the debt-laden UK container and transport leasing group, has
obtained further facilities from its bankers and is talking to an
unidentified third party about the possible sale of its container division.
The group, which has been struggling to restructure its overstretched
balance sheet, also warned that the costs of refinancing meant it was likely
to incur a loss in the second half of this financial year and confirmed it
did not expect to pay a dividend.
Tiphook has an estimated 17 per cent of the world's container rental fleet,
making it the second largest rental company in the world after Genstar, a
division of General Electric Capital Corporation of the US. The container
division, which accounted for more than half of Tiphook's turnover last
year, could fetch a substantial sum, although trading is at a low point.
Tiphook also said it was at an early stage of discussions about alternatives
with other parties. This, combined with the container division talks,
suggests the group's bankers might be considering an orderly disposal of all
assets. Tiphook recently obtained shareholder approval to allow debts to
increase to Pounds 1.3bn, giving gearing of 600 per cent.
An obstacle to speedy disposals could come from disgruntled US bondholders,
who have lent Tiphook Dollars 700m (Pounds 463m) in the past year.
Tiphook said the group and some directors were the subject of four
shareholder class actions in the US, which they intended to defend, but
declined to give details. In view of the preliminary stage of these
proceedings, the company said it was unable to determine the impact, if any,
which these actions might have.
Tiphook said it had obtained facilities of Pounds 32.3m from its principal
banks. It had also obtained a further amount to meet immediate working
capital requirements, including finance payments.
However, the group was in breach of some banking covenants and required the
further support of these banks to enable it to meet its commitments through
to April 30, and discussions were continuing.
Tiphook's announcement came as the London market closed, but in New York -
where the majority of the stock is held - Tiphook ADRs fell Dollars  5/8 to
Dollars 3 7/8 .

FT  16 NOV 93 / Open season on the fate of goodwill: Andrew Jack explains
why a UK accounting practice which has proved popular with acquisitive
companies is under threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Christmas season of goodwill is likely to be rapidly transformed into
one of illwill for finance directors as the UK Accounting Standards Board
tackles one of the most controversial topics in financial reporting.
At issue is goodwill: the difference between the purchase price of a company
and the net assets on its balance sheet. 'We've got to lance this boil once
and for all,' says Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the board.
Reforms could cut British companies' profits, and reduce the advantages they
have traditionally held. The UK's anomalous treatment of goodwill has given
them an edge in acquisitions over their foreign competitors.
In a discussion document scheduled for release on December 16, the board is
proposing to take a measured line, weighing three options. They are:
Write-off goodwill immediately on acquisition to reserves in the balance
sheet.
Capitalise goodwill on the balance sheet and amortise it through the profit
and loss account over a fixed period - probably 20 years.
Maintain goodwill as an intangible asset in the balance sheet and depreciate
if regular re-evaluations show it has diminished.
At present, the first two approaches are permitted under SSAP 22, the
existing statement of standard accounting practice on goodwill.
Immediate write-off is by far the most popular in the UK. According to a
sample of 500 most recent accounts by Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based
monthly monitoring service, just 4 per cent of companies with goodwill
capitalised and amortised it. Mr Paul Rutteman, technical partner with
accountants Ernst &amp; Young, says companies dislike the approach because it
reduces earnings and introduces an arbitrary period for writing off
goodwill.
But amortisation is the favoured approach elsewhere in the world, with the
period varying between five years in Germany (where there are tax incentives
to go for the short period) to 40 years in the US.
The International Accounting Standards Committee will endorse the
capitalisation and amortisation approach over 20 years in IAS 22, its own
version, to be issued in January. Mr David Cairns, the committee's
secretary-general, says: 'No one else does it the British way. There is a
feeling that if companies have paid for something worthwhile, it is
misleading to write it off. It should be in the balance sheet.'
The third approach to goodwill requires companies to develop a 'ceiling
test' based on projected cash flows to examine whether the value of the
goodwill has fallen. The problem is whether these measures will be
sufficiently robust. It will also raise the spectre of whether, for the sake
of consistency, companies should include internally generated goodwill, such
as home-grown brands, on their balance sheets.
There is also a legal difficulty: the seventh EC directive on company law
seems to permit only the first two approaches. It does not allow intangible
assets to be held at market value without amortisation. The ASB's lawyers
are struggling with a way to permit the third approach.
The board is split internally about which approach it favours. An
illustration of this tension is that it has still not approved a final
version of the text of the discussion document. This will only take place in
two weeks' time, at its next full meeting. It has yet to decide whether to
favour one of the three options over the others.
At the earliest, a proposed exposure draft of a standard on goodwill could
be issued by autumn next year. But that assumes there is a clear consensus
on which of the three approaches to adopt.
More likely, it will take many months, during which the ASB will be faced
with one of the toughest tests of its legitimacy and democracy. Mr Tweedie
says if there is strong disagreement, there may well be open hearings at
which interested parties will be forced to debate in public.
The current policy of discussing accounting issues behind closed doors could
damage the board's credibility if followed on an issue as contentious as
goodwill.
Judging by previous accounting standards that have touched on the topic,
disagreement will be rife and reforms strongly contested. In 1989, ED 47, an
exposure draft of a proposed standard by the Accounting Standards Committee,
the board's predecessor, which would have made amortisation compulsory, was
widely criticised by industry.
More recently, the board's urgent issues task force - which tackles
loopholes in existing standards - introduced UITF 3 in late 1991 to great
consternation. This requires companies to write off goodwill through the
profit and loss account when they subsequently sell an acquired business.
Companies have been forced to comply, but many did so only with clenched
teeth. The ructions have forced the board to consult on its proposals far
more widely since then. A number of companies have also bent the rules to
obey the letter rather than the spirit.
That said, if the ASB is to tackle the issue, the timing is probably right.
Companies might do well to prepare themselves now for any change of
accounting policies, while acquisition activity is subdued compared with the
late 1980s. The impact on profits could be far more damaging if they wait
for the next wave of purchases.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Profitable British Steel warns on overcapacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Steel yesterday reported a better than expected recovery in profits,
but warned that governments must stop subsidising overcapacity in the
European steel industry.
The company, which was privatised in 1988, made pre-tax profits of Pounds
27m in the six months to October 2, compared with a loss of Pounds 51m. It
also paid an interim dividend of 0.5p, having passed it last time. Turnover
slipped from Pounds 2.56bn to Pounds 2.45bn.
The group said UK demand recovered markedly in the first half, but this
largely reflected an increase in stock.
The underlying improvement in UK steel demand remained modest. In mainland
Europe markets were very depressed and no recovery was expected this year.
Mr Brian Moffat, chairman and chief executive, said: 'The company continues
to demonstrate its ability to deal with extremely difficult market
conditions, but the critical ingredient for a return to adequate
profitability and increased dividends remains the political will of
governments to end the proliferation of state subsidies.' The group said
progress on solving overcapacity and subsidies had been slow, particularly
regarding state-owned companies in Italy, Spain and Germany.
Mr Moffat said: 'While strenuous efforts are being made by the European
Commission to uphold existing restrictions on state aid, subsidies continue
and the Council of Ministers must now bring matters to a head to prevent
insolvent state-owned companies forcing some private sector producers out of
markets.'
British Steel has improved its performance by pushing through price
increases and cutting costs. The group workforce at the period end was
41,400, compared with 46,500 last time.
Capital expenditure fell from Pounds 110m to Pounds 42m, reflecting a
reduced programme focused on small schemes with quick paybacks. Cashflow of
Pounds 97m from operations helped cut debt by Pounds 20m to Pounds 62m,
giving gearing of 2 per cent.
Earnings per share were 1p, compared with a loss of 2.4p.

FT  16 NOV 93 / EU told to act on jobs or risk social unrest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Union risks social unrest and the end of its dreams of a single
currency unless it tackles unemployment immediately and restores economic
competitiveness, according to a confidential draft by the European
Commission.
In a blunt assessment, it says the present and short-term economic outlook
in the 12 member states is 'dismal'. The number of people out of work, now
nearly 18m, is likely to remain at 'alarming' levels for the next three to
four years.
The Commission document is intended as a macroeconomic blueprint for the
European Union to the end of the century. It will be submitted to heads of
government for approval at the Brussels summit next month, as required by
the Maastricht treaty.
Among the paper's chief recommendations are:
A reduction of short-term interest rates of between 2 and 3 percentage
points in the EU average. Interest rates could fall 'substantially' in
Germany, but only if wage rises are curbed and the public deficit reduced.
Real wage increases to be increased by 1 percentage point less than
productivity growth, as 'an acceptable rule of thumb'.
A progressive increase in national savings, in particular through lower
public deficits. The paper also calls for stronger public investment and an
inflation target of between 2 and 3 per cent.
More flexible labour markets and a broadening of the tax base. That would
make it cheaper to hire labour, improve women's chances of finding work and
increase employment in small to medium-sized businesses.
The Commission paper confirms earlier reports that Brussels has set itself a
goal of creating at least 15m new jobs, halving the present rate of
unemployment by 2000. The Commission paper warns that the goal implies very
high rates of job creation to be maintained 'over many years'. At present,
the European economy can only manage growth rates of little more than 2 per
cent without inflationary overheating.
Failure to act, the paper says, may trigger a political crisis that would
postpone the goal of Emu indefinitely. 'The Community would be plunged into
the deep divergent conditions that prevailed 20 years ago, after the first
oil price shock, but with a much worse social situation,' it adds.
The paper, Restoring Growth and Employment - Strengthening Convergence, has
assumed added significance as a guide to macroeconomic policy after the
collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism.

FT  16 NOV 93 / UK tailor to the tsars buys stake in biggest Russian
suitmaker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH supplier of overcoats to Russian tsars and Politburo chiefs
yesterday acquired 49 per cent of Russia's biggest suitmaker as part of the
gradual emergence of foreign investment in the country's mass privatisation.
Despite its name, which literally means 'Bolshevik Woman', the Bolshevichka
factory today produces only menswear - 350,000 suits a year. It may expand
to women's clothing.
The investor is Illingworth Morris, a British company created by a
Lithuanian emigre early this century. It makes menswear sold under labels
such as Crombie and Christian Dior.
Links between Illingworth Morris and Moscow are already strong; 60,000
Crombie coats were once supplied to the former Soviet Union each year.
Customers included Mr Mikhail Gorbachev and other Communist leaders as well
as at least one tsar.
Mr Alan Lewis, chairman and owner of Illingworth Morris, is investing
Dollars 5.5m (Pounds 3.64m), mostly in technological knowhow, training and
licensing. His aim is to ensure a presence in a country which 'could become
a centre of production for western Europe in the next decade and beyond'.
The Dollars 5.5m, to be invested over five years, includes Dollars 2.5m for
the right to produce the Crombie label, which belongs to Illingworth Morris,
and Christian Dior, for which it has the UK licence.
The price tag on Illingworth Morris's retail network and the establishment
of Bolshevichka's own western marketing structure is Dollars 1m.
Transferring knowhow and setting up a production line to make an extra
35,000 suits at Bolshevichka's existing plant is valued at Dollars 2m in the
tender documents. The remaining 51 per cent of the company is owned by
Bolshevichka's staff and management.
The deal is the latest chapter in the extraordinary story of Illingworth
Morris. Mr Lewis, a born-again Christian and one of Britain's richest men,
won control of the company in the 1970s after a long battle with Mrs Pamela
Mason, widow of film actor James Mason. She was a Hollywood chat show
hostess and heir to Isadore Ostrer, a penniless immigrant who rose to become
a merchant banker, film impresario and textile magnate in pre-war Britain.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Eurotunnel chief leads private finance initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON, Industrial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Alastair Morton, chairman of Eurotunnel, is to chair the government's
private finance working group, established to create a closer partnership
between the public and private sectors.
Announcing the initiative yesterday at the Confederation of British
Industry's annual conference, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said the
government was determined to break new ground in developing public sector
projects with private finance.
'Just as privatisation broke new ground, so will private finance. This
working group will turn the project into reality,' he said.
Other private sector members of the working group are Mr Howard Davies, CBI
director-general; Mr Pen Kent, associate director of the Bank of England; Mr
Allan Gormly, chief executive of Trafalgar House, Mr Neville Simms, chief
executive of Tarmac; and Ms Sheila Masters, a partner of KPMG Peat Marwick,
the accountants.
Mr Steve Robson, deputy secretary at the Treasury in charge of private
finance projects, will head the Whitehall side of the committee and be
joined by civil servants from the departments of Trade and Industry,
Transport, Employment and Health.
Whitehall officials acknowledge that there is resistance to the project from
both the public and private sectors. They argue, however, that just as there
were big gains for those who took part in privatisation, so will there be
big rewards for companies that take part in the private finance initiative.
To that end, the Treasury published a new guide to private finance, Breaking
New Ground, which highlights the possible opportunities for companies that
decide to take part. Mr Clarke hoped the working group would be able to
speed up public sector projects with private finance.
Sir Alastair said that since the 'public purse' was only a fraction of what
it had been, it was his aim to look at new ways of financing public sector
projects.
He planned to identify areas of activity where it might be possible to make
immediate progress as well as to encourage potential private sector
participants in the initiative.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Alastair Morton has not struggled to hide his frustration at Britain's
failure to build a high-speed rail link to the Channel tunnel. So he will
doubtless have a few choice words to say on the subject when his new
committee on private finance for public projects starts to meet. In his
other guise as Eurotunnel's chief executive, however, the repeated delays in
the fast link are by now simply a fact of life.
The gentle amble through Kent will reduce Eurotunnel's attractions to short
haul air travellers, but the ferry services are Eurotunnel's initial target.
Yesterday's announcement that Stena Sealink is putting an extra ferry on the
Dover-Calais route coincides with Eurotunnel's proposal to charge by the car
rather than the passenger. Both groups are manoeuvring for position rather
than signalling a price war. Once the tunnel is open, co-operation between
the ferry companies seems likely, and Stena may only be ensuring its
equality with P&amp;O.
If the government allows some kind of ferry merger, costs of the competing
Channel operators will be substantially reduced. Even then, the economics of
the Channel links - which have seen a huge increase in fixed capacity and
capital employed - are finely balanced on the prospects for traffic growth.
That is hardly a comfortable position for those Eurotunnel investors who
subscribed project finance equity capital on different assumptions in 1987.
The point should not be lost on anyone considering giving government schemes
another whirl.

FT  16 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Credito Italiano
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After Spain's success with Argentaria and that of France with BNP, Italy
needs a good banking story to tell in its first privatisation. There must be
some doubt whether it has found one in Credito Italiano, which is saddled
with a low return on capital of only 4.5 per cent and an exposure to the
Ferruzzi group equal to nearly a quarter of its net equity.
Arguably Istituto Mobiliare Italiano would have been a better choice to
launch Italy's privatisation programme. Though smaller, its return on
capital is about twice as high as that of Credito. An IMI sale might have
been used to whet appetites for less attractive offerings which also include
Banca Commerciale. But Credito better fulfils the political requirement for
a large deal which spreads share ownership broadly among the Italian public,
without leaving large blocs in the hands of particular interest groups.
Some hefty promotional discounts may thus be in order for Credito's
employees and depositors. These might then be able to convince themselves
they are buying a recovery stock, on the same principle whereby Barclays has
outperformed Lloyds by over 40 per cent since its dividend cut in March. But
by then Barclays had confronted the worst.
Credito cannot yet discern the full dimensions of its Ferruzzi problem; nor
will it easily repeat this year's bond market gains. Besides, selling the
stock cheap to retail investors could backfire without a strong
after-market. That will not come naturally to a share which has lost a third
of its value this year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British Steel has reached the limits of what can be achieved by self-help
alone. A return to profit in the first half shows the benefit of
rationalisation, but was achieved with a fair wind nonetheless. Sterling's
devaluation was worth around Pounds 20m at the level of operating profit.
Demand for steel at home was supported by a mini-cycle of stock building
which has petered out since the summer. The joint venture with Avesta
Sheffield in stainless steel flatters the improvement in trading performance
by shifting losses into an associate company.
The future now turns on the thorny questions of state subsidies to
loss-making European producers and closures of uneconomic plant. Without
capacity reduction meaningful price increases are unlikely. Rises introduced
this year are sticking, but average UK steel prices are only now back to the
levels of 1986. The outperformance of British Steel's shares this year
demands something more than a consolidation of these gains.
As a low-cost producer British Steel certainly stands to gain from higher
prices. Restructuring elsewhere might also bring opportunities to put its
balance sheet strength to work. With the share now on a dizzy rating,
though, the downside risks cannot be ignored. Delay in reaching agreement
among governments on subsidies could carry more than an opportunity cost.
Big producers have shown uncommon discipline on pricing, but that common
front must be vulnerable to cracks if demand in continental Europe continues
to slide.

FT  16 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: BA above the clouds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The clouds are beginning to part for British Airways, which is just as well,
considering the recent surge in its share price. The carrier's half-year
figures confirmed several encouraging trends, with a 2 per cent rise in
premium traffic being the most comforting. The global balance of supply and
demand appears to be returning to some semblance of sanity. BA, too, is
moving back towards equilibrium. After increasing capacity by 13 per cent
this year, BA will add just 4 per cent next, making it easier to fill seats
and raise prices as traffic recovers.
Some dark clouds remain on BA's horizon, however, notably surrounding its
stakes in associated airlines. BA's investment in TAT is currently looking
none too clever. Between them TAT and Deutsche BA lost some Pounds 32m in
the first half. Remedial action is promised. But any aggressive cost-cutting
at TAT may prove politically difficult after the Air France fiasco.
Meanwhile, Lufthansa can only emerge as a more formidable competitor as it
trundles towards privatisation. With its investments in USAir and Qantas yet
to prove their worth, BA's globalisation thrust remains a high-risk strategy
with no guarantee of financial return.
Investors lacking the head for such dizzy heights may prefer BAA, which
reports today. BAA's operational gearing may not be as high as BA's and its
shares are relatively dearer. But comfort can be drawn from an airport
operator which keeps its feet firmly on the ground and has a quasi-monopoly.

telephone traffic buzzing in and out of the UK, elicited an apologetic
response from the duty officer. 'I'm sorry,' he said, explaining why an
earlier call had not been answered, 'our man was trying to get back to you
but his phone wouldn't work.'

It's not often that a City gent gets to be in a world premiere as opposed to
at one. However, tonight sees the debut of Chris Chapman, managing director
of discount house Seccombe, Marshall &amp; Campion, in a new musical about Jane
Eyre which is being presented at The Royal Naval School, Haslemere. Chapman
plays the wicked parson, Mr Brocklehurst, in a cast which includes his wife
and two daughters. Kitting him out has not been a problem. Not only is
Chapman's father a Suffolk clergyman but Chapman also gets a chance to wear
his City top hat - the hallmark of a billbroker - without feeling silly, for
a change.

Scottish secretary Ian Lang, who launched his department's first annual
report yesterday, must try harder. The volume on the Scottish Office is
intended to remind the Scots how much administration is devolved to
Scotland.
But the numbers are disappointing, consisting only of expenditure figures.
Since governments, unlike companies, make great public play of their budgets
it would have been nice to know what St Andrew's House had intended to
spend. All Lang would say about that is that 'We wanted to compare like with
like'.

Hilmar Kopper, boss of Deutsche Bank, does not miss a trick. Like any other
sensible banker, he is mindful of the topsy-like growth of those
clever-clever instruments such as yield curve swaps, look-back options and
forward rate agreements, lumped under the catch-all name of derivatives.
Hence, quizzed recently as to whether he had yet thought of a nickname for
the Trianon tower, the bank's third skyscraper in Frankfurt opened earlier
this month, Kopper hesitated not a moment. Given that the newcomer is taller
than the existing pair, dubbed 'Soll und Haben' (assets and liabilities),
why not call it 'derivatives'?

Isn't Sedgwick sounding a mite defensive about the composition of the board

To be sure, Joe Palmer, the new PIA chairman, Cadbury committee member
Jonathan Charkham, Lord Rees, chairman of Lasmo et al are all fine fellows.
The only trouble with also adding Sedgwick vice chairman Jim Payne to the

reinsurance brokers Bland Payne, was criticised in the DTI report into the

Given that the cost of the Channel Tunnel, Britain's biggest-ever private
sector project, has overrun by more than 60 per cent and the opening date
has already been put back twice, Sir Alastair Morton, chairman of
Eurotunnel, may seem an odd choice to head up the new government working
committee on private finance.
Sir Alastair freely admits that if Eurotunnel were to start again in
building the Channel Tunnel he would do it differently. Indeed, he says it
is precisely because he has learnt a lot of lessons of what not to do that
he argues he is so well suited to take on his latest job promoting private
finance in public sector projects. Full marks for honesty.

Jacques Delors' failure to turn up at the CBI conference in Harrogate
inevitably led to a suspicion that he had been struck down by a diplomatic
illness. Better to make himself scarce than risk further jeopardising an
already shaky reputation in Britain by being drawn into a row between the
CBI and the government over Europe.
But such speculation was wide of the mark. The European Commission president
really did have the flu and it was up to his secretary-general David
Williamson, once a polished British civil servant, now an equally polished
Eurocrat, to deliver Delors' message.
The script was strictly followed until Williamson reached the bit where
Delors sounded his version of Harold Wilson's reds under the bed scare - the
accusation that there were political scavengers eating away at the
distressed heart of Europe.
Hence the 'unscrupulous individuals and groups' of Delors became the 'some
less than scrupulous' individuals of Williamson. And the 'dangerous forces'
which Delors had at work became less menacing with the thought that 'some
forces may be at work'.
Who these forces are is less than clear beyond the fact that they must
disagree with Delors. Williamson certainly would not elaborate on the plot,
but then he is an Englishman and has a different notion of the sinister from
Delors. Certainly he was careful to tell the CBI that he is not a Frenchman,
not a French intellectual and not a Catholic.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Leading Article: China shuffles on
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS tempting to interpret the result of this weekend's secret Central
Committee meeting as a victory for reform. The commitment by the Chinese
communist party's senior policy-making body to deepen market-based reforms,
and continue to build the 'socialist market economy' which Deng Xiaoping
began 15 years ago, should guarantee that the 89-year-old elder statesman
will leave a lasting legacy. Meanwhile, vice-premier and central bank
governor Zhu Rongji appears successfully to have traded an easing of
monetary policy for a commitment to implement his reforms.
But appearances can deceive. Even if a conservative leader were to emerge
from the inevitable struggle that will follow Mr Deng's death, there is
little prospect of a return to a planned economy. But the outcome of the
weekend plenum does not suggest that the next round of reforms is assured.
The communique, which emerged late on Sunday night, was disappointingly
bland. It promised 'a programme of action to restructure the economy in the
1990s', including commercialisation of the state enterprises and
rationalisation of the financial system. But the promised 50-article
manifesto, detailing these reforms, was notably absent.
How will China commercialise a state enterprise sector, at least a third of
which is loss-making, without the widespread bankruptcies that officials
reject? How, without the end of subsidies to these enterprises, can the
banking sector run along commercial lines or the central bank run a
market-based monetary policy? Or will the subsidies be paid through the
budget, in which case how does Beijing propose to raise taxes from unwilling
provinces? Only if China's communist party can provide detailed answers to
these and other questions will the commitment to further reforms be more
than just words.
The reality is that woolly commitments from public or party officials to
market-based reforms, or economic liberalisation, are two-a-penny in today's
China. What has been lacking, and remains so if the communique reflects the
consensus view, is a willingness by central and regional officials to allow
enterprises to go bankrupt, to accept that richer provinces must pay higher
taxes, and to obey central bank directives.
Of course, the communique reflects, not a consensus, but a failure to agree.
Not only are the next steps difficult, but the need to agree to take them
comes at a time when state enterprises and local officials are complaining
bitterly about the painful consequences of the government's stabilisation
measures. It was to soften these blows that Mr Zhu risked easing the credit
squeeze too early. But the quid pro quo from provincial leaders must be an
agreement now to implement reforms which will prevent another boom-bust
cycle. They have yet to deliver.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Confidence may do the trick: Has the German economy hit
bottom and will the recovery arrive next year? / A look at the uncertainties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's so-called five wise men, the government's council of independent
economic advisers, are not providing much good cheer for the coming
Christmas season.
Zero growth in west Germany next year is about the best they can offer, and
even then they are not quite convinced that the worst is over. Last year
they forecast zero growth for 1993, and the outcome was a sharp decline of
minus 2 per cent, so they do not want to make the same mistake again.
They are slightly more hopeful for east Germany, predicting a continued
recovery of 7.5 per cent in gross domestic product, compared with 6.5 per
cent this year, but even that is from a desperately low economic base. The
downturn in the west has undoubtedly slowed the entire investment drive in
the east.
An increase in unemployment from 3.5m today to 4.02m next year is decidedly
grim tidings for the German workforce, already seeing their real wages and
traditional fringe benefits withering in the cold blast of recession.
It is not good news for the German government, facing a mammoth re-election
year in 1994, with no fewer than 19 national, state, and European polls in
the offing. Chancellor Helmut Kohl is in need of a few green shoots of
recovery to bolster his re-election chances next October.
The five wise men are certainly more pessimistic than five of the six
leading German economic institutes, which less than a month ago forecast a
west German economic recovery next year to the tune of modest 1 per cent
growth. They are slightly more optimistic than the Keynesian economists at
Berlin's Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung (DIW), who fear a
further downturn of 0.5 per cent in 1994.
They are also decidedly more pessimistic than the Frankfurt stock exchange,
where the DAX index of 30 leading shares has shot through the 2,000 mark in
recent weeks, from 1,545 at the start of the year.
On the other hand, the forecasts of the five wise men are closely in line
with those of the business and industrial community itself. The German
association of chambers of commerce and industry (DIHT) recently said there
was no sign of recovery, even if the downturn had slowed. Mr Franz Schoser,
chief executive of the DIHT, backed the DIW in its forecast of minus 0.5 per
cent for next year. He said there were simply 'signs of stabilisation at a
low level'.
So who has got it right, and when will the turnround come? Has the sharpest
downturn in the German economy since the post-war economic miracle hit
bottom, or is there a real danger of a double-dip recession, or at least a
prolonged period of stagnation?
The wise men - five leading economists from Germany's universities and
economic institutes, headed by Professor Herbert Hax, of the Institut fur
Mittelstandsforschung, the small business research institute in Bonn - are
certainly erring on the side of caution. Will there be an economic recovery
in 1994? 'We cannot answer the question at the present time with adequate
assurance, either yes or no,' they say. 'We see chances of turning the
corner, but whether they will be realised in the near future is highly
uncertain.'
That is scarcely helpful to the government or to the other economic
analysts. And yet there is perhaps reason in their indecision, and method in
their pessimism. For they are clearly convinced that their repeated words of
warning in recent years to all levels of government in Germany - the federal
government in Bonn, the 16 state governments, and all the local authorities
 -on the need for drastic control of public spending, continue to fall on
deaf ears.
First they set out what went wrong in 1993. A year of stagnation in 1992 was
clearly not enough to cool down the overheating in the economy which
coincided with German unification: public money was poured into east Germany
to revive the collapsed economy, and wage deals were pushed up far beyond
the rise in productivity, both in the east and the west.
Capacity utilisation in west German industry in 1991 was higher than in any
year since 1970. When pressure began to ease in 1992, demand fell and spare
capacity became available but inflation remained stubbornly high. The German
Bundesbank was determined to abide by its counter-inflationary duty, and
pushed up short-term interest rates to almost 10 per cent.
The trouble was that the downturn in the German economy coincided with a
continued decline in German exports - partly a reflection of the sluggish
world economy (and the sluggish European economy held hostage not least by
the high German interest rates), and partly a result of falling German
competitiveness. Hopes for an export-led revival evaporated.
Foreign sales were not helped by the effective revaluation of the D-Mark,
particularly in western Europe. In 1993 there was a 12 per cent drop in
exports, with Germany's traditional sales of investment goods particularly
hard hit.
The wise men are not prepared to blame the Bundesbank for its tight monetary
policy. Rather, they pin the blame first on the trade unions, for excessive
wage demands, and above all, on the political establishment, for failing to
bring spending under control, to cope with the unique challenge of
unification.
It was the failure of the politicians, they believe, to give clear signals
on controlling government spending, which particularly undermined the
confidence of both industry and consumers.
The public sector deficit in the current year they estimate at DM160bn,
including central, state and local governments, and including borrowing for
the German unity fund, but excluding the Treuhand privatisation agency.
'On the one hand, the high level of public sector deficits will have helped
stimulate demand, although a large part of the DM160bn deficit was merely
making up for recession-related declines in revenues, and therefore cannot
be seen as an active expansionary measure,' they say.
'On the other hand, and it seems far more important, the increasingly
swollen budget deficits contributed to the general insecurity about the
economic perspectives . . . which contributed to the restraint of both
investors and consumers, and therefore aggravated the recession.'
The professors remain profoundly sceptical about the government's
much-trumpeted success this year in agreeing first on a 'federal
consolidation programme', and second on a modest savings package - above all
focused on cuts in social benefits - in bringing public spending under
lasting control.
Some private sector analysts believe the wise men have erred on the side of
pessimism, precisely in order to hammer home their policy prescriptions to
the government.
'I am surprised to see the council take quite such a cautious view on what
will happen next year,' says Mr Thomas Mayer, senior economist at Goldman
Sachs in Frankfurt. 'The latest data actually indicate that the economy is
not doing too badly. So the council must assume that there will be renewed
weakness.
'They have a rather pessimistic view on government deficits over and above
what the government is prepared to acknowledge. Perhaps they feel that if
there are doubts, it is better to err on the side of pessimism to get the
message across to the policy makers, that adjustment really has to be made
now.
Again and again, the wise men stress the need for a 'convincing' course of
budget cuts, and the link between a reliable public sector spending
programme, and confidence in the private sector.
They gave the government more support for its efforts to promote greater
deregulation, and more privatisation, as part of its campaign to make
Germany more competitive. But they still think present proposals do not go
far enough.
The debate on shop opening-hours is a case in point. The restrictive
legislation enforcing early evening and weekend closing should be
liberalised, the wise men believe, but there are already signs that
Chancellor Kohl is going back on the liberalising plans of his government
colleagues.
As for privatisation, the greatest potential is at the level of the states
and local government. Yet they have done practically nothing to privatise
the properties and services they control. As for the privatisation of
Deutsche Telekom, the telecommunications company, the wise men warn that the
plan to maintain a state holding company could undermine the whole venture.
'In that way Telekom could see itself subordinated to political influences
which will collide head on with its private-sector goals,' they say.
Their other main theme is the crisis in the labour market. They admit that
there is a clear increase in the incidence of long-term, structural
unemployment within the overall recession-related rise in joblessness. But
they are decidedly sceptical about the new trade union panacea of
introducing shorter working hours, even a four-day working week, to tackle
joblessness.
'Shorter working hours are certainly not any general recipe to cure
unemployment,' Professor Hax said yesterday. 'They will simply lead to
further cost increases if there is no comparable cut in incomes.'
Rather, he said, the present system of industry-wide wage agreements must be
opened to 'individual enterprise solutions'.
Professor Juergen Donges of Cologne University, one of the wise men,
dismissed the argument that 'there is not enough work to go round, and
therefore it must be more fairly divided. The truth is work is not short.
Work is in short supply at the current wage rates,' he said. 'We must make
sure that we do not price ourselves out of the world markets.'
The truth is that the five wise men are again proposing familiar
prescriptions to familiar problems. They say in effect that Germany has for
too long been living beyond its means.
Cost-cutting and deregulation in the public sector, as in the private, is
the main prescription. But there is a clear feeling that the private sector
has done far more than government to put its house in order.
All agree that it is crucial to revive private sector investment, which saw
a dramatic slump this year - down by no less than 15.5 per cent as far as
investment in plant and equipment is concerned. The wise men fear that it
will still decline by a further 2 per cent in the coming year, and
government policy must focus on turning it round.
One proposal they make is for a clear programme of corporate tax reform to
be put in hand immediately, even if real tax cuts are only realistic once
the economy has recovered - possibly not before 1997. Mr Theo Waigel, the
finance minister, seized upon the idea yesterday and promised proposals
before next year's elections.
Yet it is uncertainty about what will revive the confidence of the private
sector which is at the heart of the differences between the forecasters over
the speed and timing of the German economic recovery.
The pessimists at the DIW, and in the opposition Social Democratic Party
(SPD) are convinced that an upswing must be primed by a public spending
programme, even if that means a short-term increase in the deficit. Mr
Rudolf Scharping, the SPD leader, has called for a revival of 'concerted
action' between industry, labour, government and opposition, to draw up a
common approach.
The trouble is, it is almost certainly politically too late for such
co-operation. For the elections are almost here - the first local poll is in
Brandenburg next month, followed by Lower Saxony next March - and economic
consensus looks likely to be the first casualty.
That means the private sector will have to rediscover its confidence on its
own, and even the wise men do not know when that will be.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S drive to shake up the UK civil service appears to be losing
momentum, with numbers of civil servants again rising. Productivity
increases have allowed similar organisations in the private sector to shed
staff despite increasing workloads. Yet the number of white-collar civil
servants has not fallen in 10 years.
Market-testing was supposed to expose the civil service to competitive
pressure by putting central government work out to tender. The programme has
fallen woefully behind schedule, with less than half the target for the
first 18 months completed on time. Savings have been much lower than the 25
per cent predicted at the outset. Contractors have complained that the
tendering process favours in-house teams and discourages innovative bids
which would bring greater savings.
Measures to open the top ranks of civil servants to outsiders have also
stalled. A Cabinet Office efficiency unit report recommended that all senior
jobs should be advertised. This encountered stiff opposition from the
permanent secretaries who make the appointments. It has been rewritten to
preserve the present system.
The treatment of Whitehall is in sharp contrast to that meted out to local
government and the health service. They are forced to contract out much of
their work under rigorous rules designed to discourage anti-competitive
practices. Top jobs in both local government and the health service are
almost invariably advertised and filled by open competition. Different rules
appear to apply to the civil servants who drafted the rules for town halls
and health authorities.
Progress on reforms has been obstructed by top civil servants, according to
Sir Peter Kemp who managed the reform process until he was sacked last year.
He recommends the stimulus of a 25 per cent cut in the staffing of core
government departments. This would remove some 30,000 posts in recognition
that the bulk of civil service work has shifted to executive agencies. Such
staffing targets are crude but effective: they enabled Mrs Thatcher to cut
more than 100,000 civil service posts between 1979 and 1984. It is hard to
avoid the conclusion that the only way of forcing Whitehall to improve its
efficiency is to impose new targets in the future.
As for open advertising of top posts, the present secretive system cannot be
allowed to survive. All public jobs should be publicly advertised unless
there is an over-riding reason for not so doing. As in business, many -
perhaps most - would go to insiders. But new blood would be brought in and
the divide between public and private sector would be narrowed.
Finally, Sir Peter's suggestion that a high-profile individual reporting
direct to the prime minister be made responsible for civil service reform
should be implemented. Reform under the present system seems hopeless. It is
time for a new approach.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Mr Delors in absentia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ANNUAL conference of the Confederation of British Industry provides a
curious snapshot of British attitudes to Europe. Ostensibly, all is now
sweetness and light between the CBI and the UK government. Last week's
squabble over the CBI director general's alleged criticism of the government
has been ostentatiously forgotten. Each side loads the other with
compliments and assurances of unanimity. Both are united in criticism of Mr
Jacques Delors, whose speech to the conference, delivered by proxy from his
sick bed yesterday, was the only jarring note in the universal harmony.
But Mr Delors' speech slyly inserted the wedge: complimenting the CBI on its
enlightened stance to Europe, and welcoming Mr Davies's remarks of last
week. In his original text, Mr Delors also referred to the 'dangerous
forces' and 'unscrupulous individuals' out to block European integration.
Shorn of invective, this was a reminder that there are real divisions within
both the British industrial community and government. The CBI's leaders
cannot hope to represent all the industrial rank and file, and pro-European
ministers like Mr Clarke and Mr Heseltine, both speakers at the conference,
certainly do not represent the whole cabinet.
But the British camp is probably united in repudiating the imposition of
additional social costs on business. As it happens, this formed the most
interesting part of Mr Delors' speech, particularly in the light of the
Commission's forthcoming white paper on European competitiveness. The CBI
president and the chancellor reserved their greatest contempt yesterday for
the notion that in the depths of recession and after a decade of
underperformance, European industry should be loaded with shorter working
hours, longer paternity leave and so forth - 'the economics of the
madhouse', as Mr Clarke put it.
But there is one point in Mr Delors' favour. Implicitly, he is saying what
many European business leaders are starting to say for themselves: that if
the price of industrial success is the creation of a marginalised class, the
fruits of that success will not be either enjoyable or sustainable.
Mr Delors' error, which it must be hoped he will avoid in his forthcoming
white paper, has been to place too much emphasis upon mechanisms of social
protection, high non-wage costs, restrictions on working time and minimum
wages, which merely exacerbate the forces of marginalisation.
But he is right that European business will not escape from its current
malaise merely by cutting costs. That will take a better-trained workforce,
more productive research and development and a more developed
infrastructure. Above all, it will take economic recovery.
It is to be hoped that Mr Delors' white paper recognises the blind alleys
down which much EU social policy has led. If it does, business in Britain
and in the rest of the European Union will respond.

FT  16 NOV 93 / If the dunce's cap fits . . .
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY

<TEXT>
England is a nation of thickheads, dunces, ignoramuses, feather-brains,
numbsenkulls, duffers, dimwits and know-nothings. I do not, of course, refer
to you or me, but to those other folk over there. Her and him and them.
Where else would football hooligans breed so profusely? Who else would buy
British tabloids? Who else would watch Jeremy Beadle? Who else would elect
our politicians?
We know the answer. It could only be the great semi-educated, half-literate
core of England. 'In Germany,' it was noted by a Royal Commission on
Technical Instruction in a report delivered in 1884, 'the dense ignorance so
common among workmen in England is unknown . . .' Wait a minute. That was,
er, let me see . . . 1993 take away 1884 . . . where's my calculator . . .
109 years ago. No comfort there. The story is not very much more encouraging
today. Take some statistics from 1990. In that year about 68 per cent of
young Germans obtained an upper secondary school qualification at age
18-plus. The comparable figure for Japan was 80 per cent, and for France 48
per cent. Hold your breath. The British score was 29 per cent.
These statistics are reproduced in a table in the report of the National
Commission on Education, published yesterday. We must digress for a moment
on the origin of this commission. Sir Claus Moser, born in Berlin and
recently retired as warden of Wadham College, Oxford, is a distinguished
statistician who has spent half a century in British public life. In 1991,
as president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, he
called for a royal commission of inquiry into the lamentable state of
education and training. The government turned his idea down flat.
Undeterred, Sir Claus encouraged the British Association to set up its own
study. The British Academy, the Royal Society, and the Royal Academy of
Engineering lent support. The Paul Hamlyn Foundation picked up the tab. In
consequence, the privatisation of royal commissions may have been
established. A fresh source of material for British political debate has
been opened up. Mr David Sainsbury and other creators of cash-rich
foundations will doubtless be presented with ingenious new ways of spending
their money. The lesson is well-learned from the Fords, Rockefellers and
other American benefactors.
That is a fringe benefit. We must all be grateful to Sir Claus and the names
in his contact-book for the report itself. Published as a paperback by
Heinemann at Pounds 4.99 it is serious stuff. It presents a convincing case
for shifting another billion or three into education, on the ground that the
present level of expenditure, even allowing for the improvements implicit in
the government's reforms, is not adequate in a global market in which
competitive advantage will accrue to the countries with the best-educated
workforces.
Before anyone has apoplexy, let me dispose of those few billions. The report
suggests that the extra spending might be phased in, reaching a rate of
Pounds 3.2bn a year by the year 2000. About a quarter of it would finance
pre-primary schools, making Britain, which offers publicly-funded places to
less than half its toddlers, competitive with France and Belgium (95 per
cent), Denmark (85 per cent) and Germany (77 per cent). Most of the rest
would go into primary schools. The commission suggests 'improved efficiency'
savings of Pounds 500m and the payment by students and private patrons of
Pounds 1.3bn towards higher education. Net addition to public spending at
the end of the century: Pounds 1.4bn.
Impossible, says the education secretary, Mr John Patten. That is helpful.
If Mr Patten opposes something, we can be sure that it is an excellent
suggestion. His principal achievement since joining the cabinet in April
1992 has been to stop the reform of education in its tracks. He managed this
all alone. The prime minister, in a tightish spot himself, is keeping Mr
Patten on a while to see if he can preside over the undoing of the damage.
If he fails, it will make nonsense of the government's protestations that
rigorous education is one of the basics it intends to get back to.
Let me say at once that, as the Moser commission acknowledges, the reform
process initiated by the Conservatives two years before they booted out Lady
Thatcher is the most encouraging event in Britain's educational history
since the Butler education act of 1944. More structured teaching, a national
curriculum and regular testing are all necessary components of any sustained
effort to improve British state education. It has always been evident that
this is a quiet revolution which will not have completed its task for a
generation.
Alas, the reforms have become bogged down by Mr Patten's pride, the
consequent recalcitrance of the teaching unions, the Treasury's
unwillingness to finance change, and the Conservatives' obsession with their
campaign to obliterate local authorities. The process will surely recover
from all of these ailments. The logic of Mr John Major's focus on education
reform should see to that. What the government should now take on board is
the extra push, the freshly radical look, that Sir Claus's report provides.
The money, even in the febrile atmosphere of a Pounds 50bn budget deficit,
is a bagatelle. A few miles a year off the roads programme would take care
of it. That way, less of England would be paved over, and more English minds
would be opened. Anyhow, there are many sensible suggestions that would cost
little or nothing. One is the proposed merger of education and training at
all levels of government, starting at the top and reaching down to local
education and training boards. Another is a broader school-leaving
qualification, to replace A-levels, which are too academically focused. The
new General Education Diploma would recognise vocational achievements.
Teachers should be graduates, professionally-trained, and, in due course,
properly paid.
The report is not only about education for employment. It addresses the
breakdown in society, the 'family' and 'crime' and 'inner city' matters
about which there has been so much Tory hand-wringing in recent weeks. Its
proposals go to the heart of these problems. Watch our politicians for a few
days. Mark as dummkopf any who ignore the thrust of the National
Commission's report.

FT  16 NOV 93 / A fall-out among friends: Chernobyl's legacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chernobyl's reactor number four, which caused the world's worst nuclear
disaster, is tamed for the moment. The temperature in the core has cooled
from some 3,000 degrees centigrade on the night of the explosion, April 26
1986, to about 100 degrees.
But the concrete sarcophagus erected hurriedly over the ruined shell is now
cracking, and the red-and-white-striped chimney is propped up with metal
girders. This summer the Ukranian government called for suggestions from
international companies on how to repair the crumbling structure, but
believes none of the suggestions so far would contain the radiation. 'The
government is now inviting institutions and scientists to brainstorm a
solution,' says Mr Vladimir Holosha, deputy minister in the town of
Chernobyl.
But patching up the sarcophagus may be the least troublesome consequence of
the Chernobyl disaster. The explosion heavily contaminated much of Belarus,
Ukraine and Russia with radiation; and the consequences for the local
populations' health are still unknown.
Last week, a delegation from the European Commission and European Parliament
spent three days in Kiev and the contaminated zone, accompanied by western
cancer and radiological scientists, some of whom have been studying the
effects of Chernobyl since the accident. For two years, the the European
Union, which has contributed Ecu 14.2m (Pounds 11m) to 16 research projects
in the region, has been attempting to help the republics prevent
contamination spreading, to advise on medical treatment, and to help
estimate the long term effects on health. Now many members of the team
believe a critical point is near if the environmental problems are not to
worsen and if the impact on health is ever to be properly assessed.
The environmental problems were brought home to the Ukrainian government
earlier this year when 6,000 hectares of the highly contaminated pine forest
surrounding the plant caught fire in the summer heat, sending a new cloud of
radioactive dust over the region.
The immediate danger to Kiev's water supply has been alleviated by a 12km
dyke built to trap and divert water from the abandoned fields north of the
plant. Radioactivity in those areas from the strontium and caesium in the
soil, which seeps into the water, deliver the same dose in four hours that
people in the UK receive from background radiation in a year.
But the worst problem may lie in the 600 pits of waste from Chernobyl and
the surrounding area buried hurriedly near the plant in the months after the
explosion. Scooped out of the sandy soil, some of the pits are not lined
with clay. The danger is radiation will wash down into the water table. Mr
Rolf Linkohr, one of the leaders of the delegation, says: 'Today,
contamination of the acquifers is not a problem, but it may be in 10 years.'
Even harder to predict is the effect of the disaster on the population's
health. The effect of radiation on the human body, particularly in damaging
the cells' genetic material, may not be visible for years.
According to the western scientists with the delegation, only 42 deaths so
far can definitely be attributed to the Chernobyl accident. This is in sharp
contrast to the Ukrainain government's claim that 8,000 people have already
died because of the disaster. 'We are not saying there will be no effect -
just that much of the cancer we expect will not show up for years,' says one
member of the European group.
Scientists are agreed on one count: there has been a sharp increase in
thyroid cancer in children from exposure to radioactive iodine, a disease
that is normally extremely rare. A panel of experts working for the European
Commission has confirmed 186 cases in Belarus between 1986 and mid-1993.
Ukraine and Belarus report that three children have died. Mr Jaak Sinnaeve,
head of the Commission's radiation protection research unit, says
'scientific consensus is that there is a link with the accident'.
However, other claims by the republics are not backed by such firm data.
Part of the problem is the republics lack good historical health data on
which to base comparisions. For instance, Belarus says it has detected an
increase in hepatitis, and in breast and stomach cancers, while Ukrainian
officials report 'high psychological stress' among their people.
According to some of the scientists accompanying the European team, these
illnesses cannot be linked to the radiation, or, in the case of increased
stress, cannot be measured scientifically.
Mr Hans Storm, an epidemiologist with the Danish Cancer Society, who
accompanied the visiting team, says: 'Hepatitis is not linked to radiation
exposure, and cancers caused by Chernobyl are not expected to show up for
years.' He adds that the increases in breast cancer may be real, but may be
attributable to other causes.
The European delegation wants the joint research programmes to improve the
quality of health and environmental data quickly so that the effects of the
radiation can eventually be measured. Several scientists with the group
emphasised that, if the health of the population was not accurately assessed
now and the most-exposed people identified and monitored, even that modest
aim may be frustrated.
'A third of people get tumours anyway. Our best guess is that there may be a
1 per cent increase in that number, or some may get cancer earlier than they
would have done. We will miss that if we don't put monitoring systems in
place now,' one scientist said.
But some of the group have also asked whether the republics are tempted to
claim more than is scientifically justifiable to attract more western money.
One member of the group said privately: 'There is a gap between what we are
offering and what they want. To them, this is a problem which touches every
part of their society. But we are equipped only to study the effects of
irradiation.'
At the heart of the three republics' problem is that they have only recently
begun to shake off a culture where scientific research was employed to meet
political ends and where official statistics were mistrusted both by the
population and by outside observers. Lack of comprehensive data on the
population has left the region ill-equipped to estimate the environmental
and health impact of the disaster; it may, also make it harder to get
outside financial support.
Mr Storm says: 'There is no question Chernobyl was a disaster. The land is
closed and poisoned, maybe forever. But for the people living there, we just
do not yet know how big a disaster it may be.' The three republics do not
need to persuade the outside world that Chernobyl was a catastrophe; they
may need urgently to repair the shortcomings of their research if they are
to get the help that they need.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Tax switch would undermine pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RON AMY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, For the past two years, since Pounds 400m disappeared from the Maxwell
pension funds, the pensions industry has not wavered in its pursuit of
restoring confidence, stability and security.
We were dismayed by the Pounds l0bn of actuarial asset value which was
stripped from pension funds in the last budget and which is now costing
British companies and pensioners Pounds 500m a year. And now, John Maples
(Personal View, November 12) suggests that the government go further and
takes Pounds 100bn from Britain's pension funds - the equivalent of 250
Maxwell scandals.
He says the government should tax pension contributions instead of payments.
But could we trust future governments to resist the temptation to
reintroduce tax on pensions payments - ultimately bringing a higher tax
yield? Like the Maxwell pensioners, millions of people would have no
guarantee that their pension would not be hit when they retired.
Mr Maples suggests that there would be no public outcry. Even if the
government did not go anywhere near as far as he recommends, there is clear
evidence that there would be an angry reaction from pensioners and pension
scheme members - as there was with Maxwell.
Taxing pension fund contributions, rather than pensions, is an idea which
has, in the past, been rejected out of hand. With more need for private
provision as state pensions decline in real terms, the government should not
be undermining the efforts that individuals are making in order to provide
for their retirement by seeking to raise further revenue from pension funds.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: A better vision of Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From LORD HASKEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am sure that many of your readers shared my surprise at the
hysterical tone of Mr Alan Sugar's attack on Mr John Smith after his
statement at the Congress of European Socialists (Letters, November 10). Mr
Sugar was obviously outraged that there should be any view on unemployment
in the European Union other than one which relates to his narrow personal
business interests. Certainly the views of Mr Sugar may prop up his share
price but the cost is paid by us all at the thousands of social services
offices throughout Europe where the the debris of unemployment is picked up.
Thankfully there are people like Mr Smith and his colleagues who have more
vision. They take the wider view that during this recession all of us in the
European Union should act together and make sacrifices to try to preserve
jobs because this is less wasteful of the investment in equipment and
training which has gone into those jobs. It also causes less human misery.
They hope that these jobs will flourish after the recession and, indeed,
have proposals for a fund to help their plan succeed.
This broader vision deserves serious consideration and will get it from the
majority of people who work in industry - perhaps even from some of Mr
Sugar's employees.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Small is not best council structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms JANET JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Margaret Singh's claim (Letters, November 5) that the Association of
District Councils does not wish to squabble with counties will cause a
hollow laugh in county councils which have watched the Association of
District Councils and its member authorities do little else for the last six
years in their sordid campaign to abolish county councils. So will her claim
that the districts' prime concern is with the provision of quality services.
I remind Margaret Singh that Labour party support for unitary authorities is
linked to the establishment of regional government. The two go together.
Since the last thing Mr David Curry, the local government minister, will
give us is regional government, the last thing we need is the small unitary
councils advocated by the ADC. What is needed is a local government
structure capable of the strategic planning and effective delivery of key
services. That is what county councils do well.
Whatever political parties may propose, there is no evidence that the
British public has any enthusiasm for changing local government structures
or for paying the inevitably large bills this entails. Quite the opposite.
People are more concerned to have good and responsive services provided at
the lowest possible cost. If the ADC is serious about promoting better
services it should set aside its obsessions with reorganisation and
encourage its member authorities to get on with the job for which they have
been established and democratically elected - and in which they will
continue to find county councils willing partners.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Local authorities risk prejudging
Tupe issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TONY BALDRY MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'Rule clash may force tendering change' (November 12)
contains several factual errors that unless corrected are bound to mislead.
There is no conflict between the transfer of undertakings regulations (Tupe)
and the EC Procurement Directives. Certainly, councils prejudging the Tupe
issue risk breaching those directives, which require fair competition
between contractors in different member states. Authorities cannot insist
that a contractor employs existing staff.
It is not for local authorities to dictate in advance whether Tupe applies
when they put their services out to tender. This will depend on the
contractor's proposals. Most local authorities are taking the proper
approach, allowing contractors bidding for local government work to put
forward their own ideas about the best way of carrying it out.
In March, the government issued guidance stating that the way the work is to
be done would determine whether the Tupe regulations would apply. Therefore,
it is not possible to decide whether Tupe applies until the contractors'
proposals are seen. We have issued further guidance to councils about this:
if they prejudge the issue, and restrict the range of proposals they are
prepared to entertain, I will not hesitate to use the powers available to me
in law to take action against them.

Sir, The initiative of Clive Lewis, president of the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors, in establishing a review of valuation procedures is
laudable (Letters, November 10).
The Queens Moat valuation controversy is, however, current and should not
await the outcome of Michael Mallinson's review. I would urge Clive Lewis to
ensure that the assets valuation standards committee fully reviews both
Queens Moat valuations and that its report carries a clear explanation of
the differences and is made public.
If this does not occur then the surveying profession will lose credibility

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr P J ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In 'A bureaucratic legacy' (November 5), the authors assert that the
growth in building society staff numbers between 1989 and the present day is
a result of those societies' inability to adjust their management structures
and bureaucratic practices, better to reflect the current business
environment.
This view is two-dimensional at best. It takes no account of diversification
into related financial activities or growth, both organic and by merger.
For my own society, the four years between 1989 and 1992 have seen
substantial changes. No fewer than seven subsidiary companies, spanning life
assurance to unit trusts and French mortgages to savings in the Channel
Islands, have been established. In addition, the society has undertaken an
important merger and has seen assets increase by 54 per cent.
Taken overall, rationalisation following the merger has resulted in a
reduction of staff numbers in real terms, illustrated by a 46 per cent
increase in assets per head.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Arts: 'Kentucky' conquers Broadway - Karen Fricker finds
Robert Schenkkan's epic play about American history a triumph
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
New York has been waiting so long for the opening of Robert Schenkkan's The
Kentucky Cycle that by now the facts are well known here. It is the first
play ever to win the Pulitzer Prize (in 1992) without having played in New
York, and at Dollars 2.5m is the most expensive non-musical ever mounted on
Broadway. The six-hour, two-part epic spans 200 years in the lives of three
families in the Appalachian region of eastern Kentucky, played by a cast of
21 led by Stacy Keach and directed by Warner Shook, who also directed it in
Seattle and Los Angeles.
All this we knew before its opening last Sunday, but the Dollars 2.5m
question remained: was The Kentucky Cycle to join the ranks of plays that
garnered extravagant praise in the regions only to meet critical and
audience indifference on Broadway?
Its financial fate still hangs in the balance, but this much is sure:
artistically, The Kentucky Cycle is a triumph, a gorgeously written,
ingeniously structured play given a reverent production featuring some of
the most remarkable acting seen on New York stages in several seasons. Full
of action, humour, danger and pathos, it is a searching journey through
American history told through scene after riveting scene of people pushed to
the extremes of human experience. The Kentucky Cycle joins Angels in America
in reclaiming Broadway as the place where American theatre's best and most
uncompromising visions can be displayed.
Shook's staging, on Michael Olich's elegantly spare set, flows so naturally
from the script that it is hard to imagine another interpretation, let alone
a better one. When the audience enters, the stage is exposed - no curtain -
to reveal a simple scaffolding structure that creates a large, bare playing
area centre stage. The actors enter, while the house lights dim, and face
the audience. A spotlight grabs a single actor, who announces the first of
the play's nine sections: ''Masters of the Trade'. The year is 1775. A small
clearing in a thick forest somewhere in eastern Kentucky. A creek flows
nearby . . . ' This introductory ritual is performed before each section.
The actors perform all set changes in view of the audience and never leave
the stage, taking seats around its periphery to observe the action while
they are not performing.
'Masters of the Trade' introduces the scion of The Kentucky Cycle's central
family line, Michael Rowen (Keach), and establishes the play's cracking
pace. By the section's end, Rowen has ruthlessly killed two men to lay claim
to the homestead that will provide his family its identity - and its strife
 -over the next 200 years. In the brief second section, 'The Courtship of
Morning Star', Rowen literally drags a Cherokee woman into his home to be
his wife; she bears Rowen a son, Patrick, who is, as we soon see, 'born with
teeth'.
The barrel-chested, basso-voiced Keach is in commanding form; in the course
of the play he will give impressively varied portrayals not only of the
first Rowen but of four of his descendants; it is one of the production's
delights to watch the 12 core cast members transform into generation after
generation of characters.
These first two sections, however necessary, are not the play's most
compelling; it is in the third, 'The Homecoming', that the Cycle really
begins to spin. Patrick Rowen, now aged 16, commits a bloody act which
recalls the house of Atreus and entails similar results on his and future
generations. 'The Homecoming' also sets in motion a feud between the Rowens
and their nearest neighbours, the Talberts, and introduces the third family
line that figures in the Cycle in the form of Sallie, a black woman whom
Michael brings home to be the family's slave.
The play is now in its stride: the final chapter of Part I, 'God's Great
Supper', which takes the play through the Civil War years, is its most
action-packed; the first two sections of Part II, 'Tall Tales' and 'Fire in
the Hole', which chronicle the mining industry's destruction of the land and
the rise of the unions, are equally gripping; Gregory Itzin gives the play's
outstanding performance as a salesman who hoodwinks the Rowens out of the
mineral rights to their land.
The pace wanes in its final two sections. The penultimate, 'Which Side Are
You On?', is so heavy with union/owner machinations that we lose track of
the family story: that of Josh Rowen, whose choice of corporate
responsibility over family loyalty brings about a tragedy that severs the
family line. And in the final chapter, 'The War on Poverty', set in 1975,
there is too much banter before the play moves to its inevitable, and
inevitably moving, end as Josh Rowen literally buries his past while his
ancestors bear witness.
While situations and relationships in The Kentucky Cycle echo Shakespeare
and Greek drama, in scope at least, its specific theatrical reference points
are distinctly American: its themes of workers' struggle to maintain
self-respect and identity, the debt owed to family, and the moral price of
betrayal recall, in turn, Odets, O'Neill, and Miller. The play's most
affecting message is its debunking of that most American of myths: the
eternal frontier. The world of the play sickens as man's distance from the
land grows; the play's most heroic characters are those closest to nature;
and the only closure possible for the last of the Rowens is achieved alone
on his land with his hands in the earth.
It is appropriate that a play with such a strong environmental theme should
be produced on Broadway: what could bring its message home more fully than
emerging with a sickening jolt, to the urban monstrosities of West 45th
Street?
The play can be viewed in a day-long marathon or on successive evenings.
Tickets come dear - Dollars 100 - but there is nothing on or off-Broadway
that matches The Kentucky Cycle for entertainment, theatricality and food
for thought.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Arts: Wayward spirit from St Ives - Review of Roger Hilton
at the Hayward Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The opening last summer of the Tate's new gallery at St Ives and the Ben
Nicholson retrospective running on into the new year at the parent Tate on
Millbank have emphasised the role of the school of St Ives as a crucible of
British modernism. The somewhat smaller retrospective of the work of Roger
Hilton that has just opened at the Hayward can only keep that interest
alive.
While any serious reassessment of the received critical wisdom is
necessarily a good thing - especially of whether or not that immediate
post-Nicholson, post-war generation of which Hilton was a part made a
significant contribution on an international scale - the effect upon
Hilton's own standing is not quite so certain.
The difficulty with Hilton is that his reputation carries with it a romantic
aura of wildness, dissipation and talent cut off unfulfilled. The curious
thing is that this works to his advantage independent of the paintings
themselves. We look at the collective achievement of his peers, at Heron,
Frost, Lanyon, Gear and Scott, who proved more consistent, dogged and
workaday in their careers, and still we tend to say: ah, but Hilton's was
always essentially the more original, the more brilliant talent: what a pity
he died so soon. In fact, he was 64 when he died of a stroke in 1975.
There is certainly no denying him his place in British abstraction of the
1950s and 1960s, in particular in the evolution of the imagery and
sensibility peculiar to St Ives. In his work almost from the start we find
that characteristic, decorative lightness of touch, those swooping linear
motifs, the flat, frontal, unmodulated areas of paint, those combinations of
colour, so bold and pure, white and black, ochre and umber, orange and
scarlet. And there, too, is the intelligent, sensitive response to the
abstract expressionism that in the 1950s was sweeping in from New York. The
St Ives position was sympathetic, but properly independent and distinctive
and in international terms it has still to be given its due acknowledgement.
Hilton was part of it.
But he is no longer so special. The curious effect of this selection of his
work is to make that of his absent friends, of Terry Frost in particular,
seem the more substantial, thorough and sustained.
The chronology is a revelation. Through the late 1940s he was picking up
again the interests and contacts he had formed in Paris before the war, and
was responding particularly to the newer, post-Picasso abstraction of such
painters as Bissiere, Manessier and Bazaine, Poliakoff, de Stael and
Constant. In London at the turn of that decade he was clearly influenced by
Victor Pasmore at just the moment when he was 'going abstract' so
controversially, and he was also in touch with William Gear, Patrick Heron,
Adrian Heath and Terry Frost.
So he was one among many, an artist responding to the currency of the visual
debate rather than leading and influencing it. He was certainly quick on the
uptake, intelligent, sensitive and, above all, articulate in his responses
and blessed with a marked technical facility. Wearing his New Statesman
critic's hat, the painter Patrick Heron said as much in his review of
Hilton's show at Gimpel Fils in 1952: 'Roger Hilton is a natural painter.
That is to say he cannot put a brush to canvas without creating a splotch,
smear, streak, stain or smudge . . . that is charged with expressive quality
. . . The precise character, the texture, size, colour, tone, direction and
rhythm of each ragged touch is his main conscious preoccupation.'
The trouble was that this preoccupation became more and more perfunctory as
the years went by - the line, whether in paint or charcoal, more suggested
than certain and established, the painted surface often barely more than an
indication of intent. He had his successes, certainly, for he was being
shown widely abroad by the early 1960s, both commercially and officially, at
the Documenta of 1959 and the Venice Biennale of 1964. And yet time and
again in this show we find that what was once construed as energy and
commitment to be manifest desperation. With his alcoholism an ever-present
and worsening condition, he had plenty to be desperate about; but the old
energy, fluency and invention never quite deserted him. It was only the
final resolution of promise into real achievement that was missing.
Indeed he, and we, might have been better served by a comparative study that
set him alongside his peers, Frost, Gear and Pasmore, in the context of the
1950s. By a happy chance, two new, albeit small, displays at the Tate at
Millbank and at St Ives drawn from the permanent collections, offer us at
least a view of the work of Terry Frost in that period. 'A Walk along the
Quay' at St Ives is especially useful, focusing upon Frost's imagery at the
critical stage in its evolution from associative to absolute abstraction.
The boats rocking in visual counter-point on the tide, or tipping all ways
on the sand, the gulls swinging on the sea breeze, the sunshine glancing off
the waves - it is all there. Frost saw and responded directly to it. More to
the point, while lacking Hilton's conspicuous fluency of touch and
statement, he worked upon it consistently to produce over a period a body of
work of true substance and creative authority. And having established it, he
has stuck to it all these years.
Roger Hilton: The Hayward Gallery, South Bank Centre SE1, until February 6,
then on to the Ikon, Birmingham, and the Whitworth, Manchester. Terry Frost:
'A Walk along the Quay', The Tate Gallery, St Ives.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Arts: 'Cenerentola' finds a star - Opera in Geneva
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No sooner has Marilyn Horne made her European farewells as queen of
Rossinian bel canto than another American picks up the crown. Jennifer
Larmore is no stranger to this side of the Atlantic: her Handel recordings
have announced a voice of exceptional beauty, and her initial stage
appearances showed promise. But it is only recently that her talents have
come into focus, confirmed by her Angelina in the new production of La
Cenerentola at Geneva's Grand Theatre.
She has a perfectly-formed figure, a natural smile and a gracious manner:
this Cinderella is Princess Charming from her first appearance, no matter
what her dowdy servant-clothes might say. The sincere stage persona helps
win the heart not just of her prince, but of the audience  - a major advance
on her Dorabella in Cos fan tutte two seasons ago.
Rossini's demure damsels seem Larmore's natural territory, with Teresa
Berganza her model rather than Horne. The timbre is aristocratic - plush
velvety and even throughout the range. She may lack Horne's exciting top and
stentorian chest register, but she is no mechanical note-spinner: the
musical syllables fall naturally within the framework of unbroken lyrical
melody. All she needs now is a more pronounced theatrical personality.
Larmore will be lucky to find a production as good-humoured as Jerome
Savary's in Geneva: it is one of the best things he has done. Using Ezio
Toffolutti's unostentatious painted sets, Savary goes unashamedly for
laughs, without overshadowing the musical quality. Unlike some of his recent
Offenbach productions, he never runs out of ideas, even if the scampering
crescendos gather a farcical momentum more in keeping with French operetta
than Rossini's melodramma giocoso. That the result is so satisfying owes
much to the alert accompaniments provided by Jesus Lopez Cobos and the
Lausanne Chamber Orchestra.
Carlos Chausson's Don Magnifico is a crusty old devil with split-second
comic timing. As the sisters, Jeannette Fischer and Claire Larcher make a
virtue out of vulgarity. Kristinn Sigmundsson is a benevolent, bear-like
Alidoro, Alessandro Corbelli the diminutive Dandini. Rockwell Blake's reedy
timbre may be a matter of taste, but he is a suave stylist and looks the
part of the handsome prince. Cenerentola is an opera of ensembles - and
Geneva has assembled as good an ensemble as you will find.
Performances tonight, Friday, Sunday

FT  16 NOV 93 / Arts: Jessye Norman - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Festival Hall is hardly ever used for solo vocal recitals these
days. In the 1970s an attempt to put on a week of singers met with
disastrous attendances and a description of the hall as looking like a
'deserted aircraft hangar'.
It is clearly important to know one's audience. Not only was the hall packed
for Jessye Norman on Sunday afternoon, there was a queue for returns
(despite a Pounds 50 top price). Inside the atmosphere reeked of adulation.
There comes a point where it is difficult to hear the music for the clamour
of applause that greets a star singer whose fame has spread beyond the usual
boundaries of her art.
To Jessye Norman's credit, she managed to hold off the temptation to play
the celebrity until the end. She takes her song repertoire seriously and has
always wanted to be recognised in it. Unfortunately, seriousness of intent
can lay a dead hand on a singer's best efforts in the world of the German
Lied and it was a while before this programme showed much sign of life.
Dutiful enunciation of the words, careful gradation of tone, nothing
flagrantly out of style: all manner of worthy descriptions could be given to
the the first half Schumann and Strauss songs, but the music simply failed
to come alive. Norman is not good at keeping the momentum going at slow
speeds and pensive songs tended to drift without purpose. Strauss's
'Cacilie', fast, loud, exuberant, sparkled like a firework after the gloom.
For the second half, the programme turned to Messiaen and Schoenberg - a
daring choice, amply rewarded. The music of Messiaen's Poemes pour Mi
inhabits a post-Wagnerian hot-house of opulent harmonies, which support
grand and sensuous vocal outpourings of a kind that Jessye Norman can not
just handle, but positively enjoy. The whole recital lifted and that was not
least thanks to Geoffrey Parsons's effortlessly stylish support at the
piano.
The Messiaen had unlocked the singer's personality; the Schoenberg (his
Brettl Lieder, recently recorded together with Erwartung) allowed it to
blazen forth for her admirers. Jessye Norman made sure that the songs had an
impact at the back of the top tier. The date for her 1994 recital has
already been set and so have the prices (the same again). Clearly she has an
optimistic view of inflationary trends in the UK over the next 12 months.

<TEXT>
Peter Medawar said that psychoanalysis was the most stupendous confidence
trick of the century. He was a proper scientist of course who won the Nobel
Prize. He could see what the analysis addicts can't: that Freudianism has
more in common with astrology and religious faith than with real science.
Eventually Freud will be seen as an influence on twentieth century
literature and an irrelevance in mental health. In the excellent C4 series
Without Walls (9.00) Peter Swales considers the absurdity of the Freud
craze.
If you thought last night's opening episode of the American serial Wild
Palms (BBC2, 9.00) was surreal and gripping then you will want to watch Part
2 today. If you thought it pretentious claptrap then you won't.
In the first series of Between The Lines (BBC1, 9.30) Tony seemed to be
getting his leg over almost every week and Mo offered the first sympathetic
portrait of a lesbian in peaktime drama. Now Tony is being desperately
long-winded with Angela and Mo seems to have become bisexual. Good job there
is a police story to sustain the interest

FT  16 NOV 93 / Technology: Industry on the cutting edge - The waterjet
process has come of age and is creating interest worldwide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the LVD machine tool factory in Belgium, engineers have produced a jigsaw
puzzle map of Europe, adorned with the company logo, that has been cut on a
piece of blue foam rubber about half an inch thick.
A long way further east in Ukraine, automatic dismantling lines designed by
Ingersoll-Rand, the big US industrial equipment group, will soon be in place
to begin dismantling more than 200,000 tons of surplus Ukrainian ammunition.
The link between these two events is water. LVD is one of the most recent
entrants, while I-R was one of the pioneers in waterjet cutting technology.
This process is in use by, or being considered by, a wide range of
industries from fish-finger manufacturers to stone and glass cutters. So
far, automotive and aerospace companies have been the biggest users of the
process.
As is also the case with most technologies involving water, the basics of
the process are simple. Water is filtered, then passed through a powerful
pump and intensifier. It is then squeezed out of a nozzle with a diameter
varying from 0.1mm to 0.3mm, at a pressure of up to 4,000bar.
The result is a stream of water travelling at speeds ranging between Mach
two and three. Alone, the water will cut through paper, frozen foods, thin
wood, car interiors, sponge and rubber and certain plastics, but if
abrasives are added it will cut through steel up to 150mm thick. Waterjet
cutting is not that new - I-R introduced its first waterjet cutting systems
in 1971 and found some of its first applications in the furniture industry.
But the technology has come of age and is generating increased interest
worldwide.
I-R is one of the leading players, along with another pioneer and US rival,
Flow International. This pair dominates the industry, which also includes
companies such as Indiana-based ASI Robotic Systems and Bystronic Maschinen
of Switzerland. There are many smaller players offering niche products and
buying in the pumps.
ln the 1970s, the system was perceived to be too slow, says Paul Etchells,
UK, Ireland and Benelux sales manager for ABB I-R Robotised Waterjet
Systems, a joint venture between I-R and Asea Brown Boveri, the
Swiss-Swedish engineering group.
'But the initial problems have been resolved and since the early 1980s,
we've had highly reliable systems being used in high-volume production,' he
says.
The introduction of abrasives has been the main driving force for the
industrial development of waterjet cutting. A powdered abrasive known as
garnet is introduced through a tube into a tiny mixing chamber before the
water leaves the nozzle. The water then acts as a carrying agent for the
abrasive, which moves almost as fast as the water and does the cutting.
This process has coincided with the growing use by automotive and aerospace
companies of materials ranging from sophisticated plastics and composites to
aluminium and titanium. It has offered faster and more accurate cutting than
traditional methods such as sawing, routing, or cutting with a hot wire.
At Rockwell International, for example, I-R's waterjet cutters were used on
titanium components for the B-1B bomber, which would previously have been
produced through a four-stage process of inking, scribing, hand cutting and
filing. Waterjet cutting eliminated the first two stages and reduced the
filing, so that 12 parts could be cut and finished in the time taken to
polish one part produced by sawing.
Aerospace companies have also found that by using waterjets, they can cut
composite materials without delaminating the edges. Delamination is an
anathema as it can weaken the whole piece: 'It would be like having a piece
of cardboard with a wet edge,' says Ivan Lockett, LVD's UK managing
director.
The second important development has been the tie-ups between robotics
suppliers and vendors of waterjet cutting systems, such as the two-year-old
ABB I-R joint venture. Once attached to a sophisticated, computer-controlled
robot, a waterjet can move around and across a three-dimensional part such
as a car dashboard, cutting the outline and creating the holes for the
instruments.
Along with car carpets and headliners - the inside of the roof - dashboards
are the most popular applications for waterjet cutting in the automotive
industry.
The advantages of waterjet cutting include its flexibility and easy
maintenance. It produces no dust or toxic fumes and the component is not
affected by heat distortion. There is no cutting tool to wear out, although
the nozzle has to be changed occasionally.
But there are drawbacks. The process is noisy, although that can be reduced
by cutting underwater - with the component just below the water surface.
Although the basic running cost without abrasive is only Pounds 3 an hour,
the cost rises to Pounds 10-Pounds 18 with abrasive, says Etchells.
Also, while the process uses very small amounts of water, because the jet is
so thin, the abrasive cannot be recycled, and a typical metal-cutting
application will use 1kg every three minutes, according to LVD. Research is
under way in Germany to find ways to recycle the abrasive, which ends up wet
and contaminated with bits of the component.
For thin metals - for example, steel up to 16mm - cutting with a laserjet
can be five to 10 times faster. Beyond that, however, laserjets are much
slower and rarely used, while the shininess of metals such as copper, brass
and aluminium make it possible to cut only very thin sheets with lasers.
There are occasional problems, too, with the continuation of the waterjet
after it has cut through the component. In three-dimensional work,
situations can arise where the jet will damage a part of the robot, but
cutting in water may provide the solution.
Nevertheless, waterjet cutting has built up an impressive reference list
after more than 20 years. Most US-built airliners, for example, will have
components produced by waterjet. Boeing will be using three big ASI robotic
waterjet cutting machines for the tail section supports and other large
parts for the new 777 airliner.
In I-R's Ukrainian contract, high-pressure waterjets will remove explosives
from tank ammunition artillery shells and mortar rounds without detonating
it. The machines have been ordered by Alliant Techsystems, the big
Minnesota-based munitions manufacturer.
LVD, meanwhile, entered the waterjet cutting market through an agreement
with ASI last year to market the systems in Europe. The Belgian company is
one of the world's biggest producers of machinery for cutting, punching and
bending sheet metal and sees waterjet cutting as complementary to its
laserjet cutters.
In September, it introduced the Aquarius range of machines, mainly for
cutting flat surfaces, but will also market ASI's 3-D systems in Europe.
According to Jean-Pierre Lefebvre, LVD's president, Europe is a step behind
the US in the application of waterjet cutting and the process could
represent 10 per cent of LVD's business in 10 years.
In the future, waterjet cutting is likely to become increasingly integrated
with other parts of the production process. This is already happening -
ASI's system for the 777 tail section, for example, inspects the parts after
they are cut, using a probe from Renishaw of the UK to carry out co-ordinate
measuring.
Not to be outdone, the ABB I-R joint venture recently won an order from
Statoil Europarts, based in Sweden, for a robotised system that cuts,
cleans, washes and dries vehicle instrument panels. It claims that this is
the first time all four operations have been carried out in the same piece
of equipment.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Technology: A catalogue of developments - Computer moves in
the British Library
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM CLAYTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Computers can prise out nuggets of information from databases at speeds that
narrow information searches down to seconds. This was just what the British
Library wanted to achieve by computerising its catalogues, a process which
has just been completed.
But the volume of information to be handled was vast. The size of the
catalogues from the library's various sites - such as the reading room at
the British Museum, the science library in central London and the newspaper
library in north London - was one of the biggest problems to be overcome. It
claims to have 150m items in its collections, ranging from papyrus to
CD-Rom, in every written language.
Most local libraries have a computer system to keep track of items loaned
out, but in many cases the only way users can see what is in the catalogue
is by searching card indexes or microfiches. This is because putting an
existing catalogue on to a computer system is time-consuming and expensive.
Another problem is that the British Library must also cater for
inexperienced users. The solution is its recently unveiled Online Public
Access Catalogue (OPAC) which uses equipment provided by Digital Equipment
as part of a Pounds 1m sponsorship
deal.
This enables the user to search catalogues by responding to questions on a
computer. Using software developed in-house, the system asks for details
such as subject, author, title or publisher and finds the relevant material.
The user looks at this and asks the system to note items of interest.
This throws up a further problem. Since much of the material is of foreign
origin, searches must be possible in the appropriate language. If a document
was published in Russian, the system can display a Cyrillic 'keyboard' on
the terminal screen and this can be used to type in a request. The user's
first language may not be English, so the system will be able to talk to
users in one of six languages, currently English, four other western
European languages and Russian.
OPAC covers 6m items from the catalogues of recent material in the science
and humanities collections - 80 per cent of the printed books held in
London. The system, which has just gone live, also includes earlier
humanities material and the recent printed music catalogue.
OPAC will really come into its own when the British Library moves to its new
site at St Pancras, due to be completed after lengthy delays in 1996.
Equipped with 150 terminals, it will be linked to a book-ordering and a
mechanical handling system. The aim will be to have 90 per cent of all
requested material delivered to the users within half an hour.
The system will also be linked to reader admission software so that it can
build up an awareness of the level of skill of each individual user. By this
means, it will be able to offer much more help to novices, while allowing
advanced users to build up complex searches with the minimum of prompting.
One further development means some users will not have to visit the library
at all. A trial has just begun which uses the Joint Academic Network (Janet)
to make OPAC available to other libraries, initially at University College
London and Brunel University, near London.
At first, librarians will act as gatekeepers to handle the system at these
sites, but there is no reason why the facility should not be made available
later on networks outside these libraries. The system will be formally
launched on Janet at the beginning of next year with about 20 UK
institutions taking part. There are also plans to offer similar access over
public networks such as Internet.
Most users will welcome the advantages the new technology will bring, but
some will miss the studious atmosphere of the old reading rooms. Maybe they
can compensate by using a home computer to browse through the catalogues
surrounded by their own books.

FT  16 NOV 93 / People: Whitbread rings the changes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whitbread, the brewing and retail group, is to make a series of senior
management changes in its public house operations following the retirement
next February of Len Oliver, managing director of Whitbread Pub Partnerships
for the past three years.
Oliver was previously managing director of Thresher and has been with the
company for 19 years.
Oliver, 53, who joined Whitbread in 1976 after 20 years with J Lyons, was
largely responsible for the reorganisation of Whitbread's leased pub estate
to meet the requirements of government legislation. That restructuring
followed on the heels of a report from the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, an inquiry into the brewing industry.
Oliver is to be succeeded by Bill Shannon, 44, who is at present managing
director of the group's Beefeater restaurants and pubs, and former managing
director of Thresher, the off-licence chain. Shannon, right, will join the
group's executive committee on December 1.
Simon Wood, commercial director of Whitbread Inns, the managed pub estate,
will take over as managing director of Beefeater.
Wood joined Whitbread Inns in 1990 from Chef &amp; Brewer, where he had been
managing director.
Stewart Miller, 40, operations director of Beefeater will become sales and
marketing director of Whitbread Inns.
He will be replaced by Ian Webster, 39, currently director and general
manager of Sherwood Inns in Sheffield, where he is responsible for more than
280 managed pubs.
David Livingstone, 48, operations director of Whitbread Inns, takes up a new
post of business development director, and will concentrate on the
division's expansion plans.
All the management changes are due to be in place by the start of
Whitbread's financial year on March 1 1994.
Peter Jarvis, chief executive, said: 'Each of the new appointments is
designed to bring fresh impetus to the growth plans of the operating
companies concerned. We are fortunate in having management strength in depth
to make such a series of changes from within the company's own resources.'

FT  16 NOV 93 / People: Texas Homecare selects its new finance director
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Coleman, new chief executive of Ladbroke's DIY chain Texas Homecare,
has brought in another colleague from his days at the Dorothy Perkins chain,
David Adams, to join his team as finance director.
Coleman, formerly chief executive of Dorothy Perkins, announced earlier this
month that he had recruited Stephen Hibbert, operations director at the
Burton group's fashion chain, to be his operations director at Texas.
Adams, 39, has worked with Coleman for five years, first as finance director
of the Top Man and Top Shop chains, and later as FD at Dorothy Perkins.
After gaining an economics degree from Edinburgh University, Adams began his
career at British Leyland as a graduate trainee, but moved a year later to
spend three years at ITT.
From 1981 to 1985 he held various financial planning and analytical roles at
Max Factor, the cosmetics group, before becoming an accountant with National
Adhesives, a division of Unilever. He joined Burton group's corporate
finance department in 1986.
Adams fills a post that has been vacant since June when Peter Hallett left
Texas to join Hobson, the toiletries group.
John Coleman, who joined Texas in September, has quickly assembled his team.
Earlier this month he appointed Nigel Franks as property director and moved
Andrew Kinnell, formerly operations director, to the new post of director of
systems and logistics.

FT  16 NOV 93 / People: No grouses for Ivory at Highland Distilleries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brian Ivory, managing director of Highland Distilleries, is to become group
chief executive next August.
Highland Distilleries is a medium-sized quoted whisky company, with a market
capitalisation of some Pounds 342m, whose best known brand is Famous Grouse,
whose sales in export markets are expanding, already contributing 55 per
cent of profits.
The current executive chairman, John Goodwin, will reach the company's
retirement age of 62 in August 1994. But Goodwin, who has spent almost 30
years on the board, will not be a stranger in future; he has been asked to
stay on as non-executive chairman.
The move is being announced relatively early, in order to prevent
speculation.
Ivory, 44, is a member of the east of Scotland family whose name occurs in
the Edinburgh fund managers Ivory &amp; Sime and Stewart Ivory, where his older
brothers James and Ian are directors.
After education at Eton and Magdalene college, Cambridge, he trained as an
accountant before joining Highland Distilleries in 1976. He became managing
director in 1988.
Ivory considers that the arts head the list of of his non-professional
interests. He was on the Scottish Arts Council for several years, eventually
becoming its vice-chairman.
Moreover, he is also a keen practitioner of the bagpipes, and is involved in
a Pounds 3m project to house the College of Piping in a derelict church in
Glasgow.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Where the UK's venture
capitalists have failed / A look at a report which makes the case for
government backing of new technology-based firms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Something has clearly gone wrong with the UK venture capital industry.
A decade or more ago this infant financial sector seemed set to turn
Britain's rich base of scientific discoveries into a gushing commercial
success. Imaginations fired by the success of early-stage risk investment in
the emerging computer, semiconductor and biotechnology industries, disciples
of the US model were intent on exporting its magic properties across the
Atlantic.
As outlined in a report* written by Michael Hay of the London Business
School and Steven Abbot of Abbot Consulting, however, investors outside
North America have grown averse to young, technology-based firms.
In 1992, they say, just one in six disbursements by UK venture capital firms
were made to seed, start-up or early-stage firms, against two in five only
four years previously. The 1992 figure in the US, by contrast, was between
one in three and one in four.
Hay and Abbot argue that the problem is not just lack of supply, brought
about by the way the industry's reward structures favour larger and less
risky deals such as management buy-outs and expansion financings. They claim
that within the UK the difficulties facing new technology-based firms are
compounded by the high cost of long-term capital.
Drawing on work carried out by two economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York, they show that in 1988 the real cost of capital for an R&amp;D project
with a 10-year pay-off lag in the UK was 60 per cent higher than that in
Germany and about three times that in Japan. The gap, they believe, is not
likely to be much different today.
The main purpose of the report, which uses simplified quantitative models
and qualitative analysis, is to make the case for additional tax incentives
to encourage early-stage NTBF investment. Some of these are designed to fill
the gap which will be left at the end of the year when the much-abused
Business Expansion Scheme finally disappears, but levelling the cost of
capital 'playing field' and easing the exit route for venture capitalists.
Hay and Abbot go to some lengths to demonstrate the scale of the financial
benefits of NTBFs for the country as a whole. Their research estimates that
roughly 27 per cent of the present value of an NTBF's future sales accrue to
the exchequer via taxes, although the net benefit could be as high as 50 per
cent if job creation is also taken into account. They also cite analysis by
the Department of Trade and Industry of its existing 'Smart' award scheme
and of the similar German TOU scheme, which would appear to offer a generous
payback.
The report says the government is likely to get 'the biggest bang for its
buck' by concentrating relatively small sums on seed, start-up and
early-stage investments rather than on established firms, and this is in
line with official policy as outlined in May's White Paper on realising the
potential for science, engineering and technology.
The six proposed taxation reliefs are:
Equity investment relief. This would be a tax credit for the benefit of the
firm, which would be highest at the seed capital stage, but decline over the
first three years after start up. One advantage of this approach, against
giving an immediate, fixed-tax credit to the investor is that the NTBF would
have to earn the cash before it claimed the incentive. The income foregone
by the exchequer would be scaled down for unsuccessful investments.
Since the vast majority of tax generated by NTBFs are employment taxes -
notably National Insurance contributions - the authors claim that to some
extent this relief is based on the extent of employment creation.
Capital gains tax relief. This would be available to existing NTBF
shareholders, equivalent to the amount of tax paid by the company and its
employees over the course of its trading history.
Portfolio relief. Put simply this would allow capital losses incurred as a
result of investment in one or more NTBFs to be offset against capital gains
generated in one or more similar investments.
See-through relief. Its provisions would be similar in many ways to those
already allowed under the S corporation election in the US and via silent
partnership formation in Germany. NTBF equity investors would be allowed to
benefit from the immediate 'pass-through' of the company's net operating
losses to their own individual returns.
Interest relief. At present entrepreneurs borrowing money to buy shares in
their new firm are allowed to offset interest charged on those funds against
earned or unearned income, provided the company is either 'close' or
employee controlled. This proposal would extend that relief by allowing all
equity investors to do the same and by exempting exempt from tax interest
received by medium and long-term lenders.
Illiquid company shares relief. The lack of liquidity in small company
shares has prompted many proposals, but this one would reduce, initially to
zero, capital gains tax on ICSs. Qualification would be by reference to the
'total' and 'free' market capitalisation of a company's equity and the
average daily trading volume, by value, over the preceding year, as measured
by the London Stock Exchange.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Make mine a python -
Exporting from the periphery of Europe is not easy. A company that has
succeeded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eleven years after starting his business in a Northern Ireland farmhouse,
Robert Beckett was last week toasting the developed world's taste for cold
beer.
Beckett's company, Valpar Industrial in Bangor, County Down, had just won
the Northern Ireland section of an excellence award sponsored by the
Institute of Export, the Financial Times and NatWest Bank. Valpar, which has
picked up six business awards since 1989, has succeeded in spite of its size
and the logistical handicap of being on the periphery of Europe.
It has done so by, among other things, developing a clever product in a
niche market, appreciating the importance of quality, investing heavily in
research and bringing in outside help to enhance its strategic thinking.
Valpar, which has 43 employees, now exports 60 per cent of its Pounds
3m-a-year turnover and claims a 50 per cent share of the domestic UK market.
'This proves you don't have to be a giant to do things right,' says Ian
Campbell, director-general of the Institute of Export and one of the judges.
'We were looking for excellence. Valpar demonstrated it in efficiency,
quality, education, innovation and in ensuring that exporting was a general
direction of the company, not just a bolted-on function.'
Valpar makes a product known in the trade as python - a prefabricated line
cooling system for dispensing drinks which looks like a thick snake and is
similarly flexible. It consists of several plastic tubes - which carry beer,
or any other type of beverage, from storeroom to tap - bundled round two
inner tubes through which a coolant flows to keep the beverages in the
surrounding tubes cool. The whole bundle is encased in insulating foam,
forming a thick, black, cable.
Beckett's innovation, which he patented, was to automate the bundling and
insulating process. Others, such as the brewers themselves, still make
python by hand. Beckett has offered them an outsourced solution to a
troublesome, labour-intensive problem.
His own problem in marketing it, meanwhile, was that of a small business
selling to big business in the food industry. Credibility was all,
particularly over quality, so Valpar dispelled any doubts by becoming
accredited as soon as it could under BS5750, the UK quality standard, and
ISO9002, its international equivalent, in 1989.
Siobhan McAleer, an international business studies graduate of the
University of Ulster who did a project for Valpar and is now business
development manager, says this is now paying dividends in export markets
because quality can be taken for granted.
An impressive list of customers also helps. It includes most of the UK's
leading brewers, as well as continental giants such as Heineken. Northern
Ireland's relative remoteness has not proved to be a disadvantage. The
company was used to long-haul delivery to UK domestic markets; shipping
farther afield was not much more difficult.
In the US, Valpar's production is licensed to the supplier of python to all
McDonald's restaurants, where Coca Cola is the main beverage carried. The
chilled Coke dispensed by Moscow McDonald's flows through python made in
Northern Ireland. So do all the chilled drinks at Euro Disney.
Another secret has been Valpar's decision to opt for a vertically integrated
structure, so that, for example, it manufactures its own plastic pipes. This
enabled the company to win German health and safety approvals for its
python, helping it to sell into Europe's biggest beer market.
Beckett believes in sharing some of the company's profits - normally above
10 per cent of sales - with his employees. Performance-related pay accounts
for up to a quarter of senior managers' earnings. But most of the remainder
is ploughed back into the business, notably into research. Valpar sponsors
several postgraduate research students at Queen's University, Belfast or the
University of Ulster with a view to improving its products. It is currently
developing a nylon-based pipe that will be almost self-cleaning, saving
downtime.
It is also diversifying into fuel lines for the automotive industry, as well
as pythons down which telecommunications companies can propel optical fibres
using compressed air. This means cheap python can be installed anywhere,
with expensive optical fibre blown down it only when the customer wants it.
Not everything has gone smoothly, but when trouble hit, Beckett wisely
sought outside advice. 'Three years ago I was not enjoying things as I had
before,' he says. 'I brought in consultants to interview all the staff and
was forced to conclude that the problem was me. I was starting to get a bit
dictatorial.'
He decided he needed someone to keep him in check and help the company stay
focused. KPMG Peat Marwick, his accountant, helped in headhunting Peter
McKie, the Northern Ireland-based managing director of Du Pont UK, who
became non-executive chairman in 1991.
Simultaneously, Beckett started five-year corporate planning under the
guidance of KPMG and Ledu, the Local Enterprise Development Unit which runs
Northern Ireland's small business support services. At 38, and with most of
Valpar's workforce under 30, he says he still has a long way to go. The
question, as with any successful young entrepreneur, is where. If Valpar is
not a candidate for flotation, it must surely risk becoming a target for
predators.
'I don't want to sell,' Beckett says. 'We are a tightly-knit team and I
couldn't do it to the people who have built this company with me.' He thinks
diversification into telecommunications and automotive markets offers the
best means of both development and defence.

European Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A fundamental principle of European Union law, that an individual may refuse
to answer questions in competition proceedings if to do so would incriminate
them, does not apply to civil cases brought in national courts, the European
Court of Justice ruled last week.
The court's ruling was made in a case involving the Arrondissementsrechtbank
in Amsterdam. A customer had brought an action in the Dutch courts to have
increases in bank charges declared unlawful under EU competition law.
As part of his case the plaintiff wanted to call bank employees to show the
increases were not based on any objective justification but were the result
of an inter-bank agreement.
Under Dutch law witnesses called to give evidence are generally obliged to
do so, except in criminal cases. The bank argued that Dutch law in this
respect was incompatible with Union law because it breached its right
against self-incrimination. The Dutch court referred the question to the
ECJ.
The court said the right against self-incrimination did not exist as a
fundamental principle of EU law where it was relied on by companies in
relation to infringements - particularly of competition law - in the
economic sphere.
But the rights of defence that are also part of the fundamental principles
of EU law do not allow the European Commission in the course of competition
proceedings to compel a company to answer questions that might involve
admission of an infringement.
The question the court had to answer was whether the same principle could be
extended to cover civil proceedings in national courts relating to the
application of EU competition rules.
The court said it was for the national law in conformity with EU law to
define the appropriate procedural rules necessary to guarantee the rights of
defence for interested parties.
It was not necessary for procedural guarantees at national level to be the
same as those at Union level. The guarantees needed to respect the rights of
companies in a competition case brought by the Commission differed from
those needed to respect parties' rights in national civil proceedings.
In particular, in a case such as the present, in which the proceedings only
concerned private dealings between individuals which could not directly or
indirectly result in the imposition of a sanction by a public authority, an
individual concerned could not take advantage of the right against
self-incrimination as a matter of EU law.
The right that existed under EU law was specifically designed to protect the
individual from measures taken by a public authority to cause that
individual to admit the existence of certain types of behaviour, thereby
exposing that person to penal and administrative sanctions.
The bank had also argued that the effect of such a ruling would be to
deprive individuals of their rights under Union law with regard to
self-incrimination, as the commission could simply obtain through national
proceedings what it could not obtain through its own procedures.
The Court rejected that argument. The Commission, or any national authority,
could not use information thus obtained to prove a breach of competition law
in the framework of proceedings which could result in the imposition of
sanctions, or even as a reason for justifying the opening of a preliminary
inquiry.
C-60/92: Otto BV v Postbank NV, ECJ FC, 10 November 1993.
Compatibility of service station agreements of indeterminate length with EU
law.
A pre-accession service station agreement would be compatible with the
exclusive purchasing block exemption even though the agreement was of
indeterminate length, because the general rules relating to the duration of
agreements had been amended for pre-accession agreements. Thus, as long as
the agreement met the other requirements of the block exemption, it would be
valid.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Business and the Law: Whiff of controversy hangs in the air
 -The MMC's decision to allow perfume manufacturers to maintain a 'complex
monopoly'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Quite a few eyebrows have been raised in response to last week's rejection
by UK competition authorities of the complaint by Superdrug, the discount
drug store retailer, that perfume manufacturers were unfairly refusing to
supply it in order to maintain high prices and make monopoly profits.
Many observers found it hard to reconcile the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission's two central findings: that a 'complex monopoly' existed under
which the leading perfume houses acted as a group in refusing to supply
retailers they had not authorised themselves, and recommended resale prices;
yet that these practices did not operate against the public interest.
Consumer organisations, Superdrug and other retailers were incredulous. The
Consumers' Association said it was 'an inconsistent, incoherent and badly
argued report'. It accused the MMC of putting the interests of the industry
before those of the consumer and of strengthening a market where people were
paying 20 per cent more than necessary.
But competition lawyers were less surprised. The MMC, they said, was bound
to take into account the fact that the European Commission had exempted the
distribution systems of the perfume houses from Rome Treaty competition
rules since 1974.
The MMC was boxed in, particularly in the light of the recent approval by
Brussels of the distribution arrangements of two leading perfume
manufacturers, Yves Saint Laurent and Givenchy.
Mr Steven Sidkin, a partner of City solicitors Fox Williams which
represented German manufacturer Meuhlens during the MMC inquiry, was
delighted with the outcome. But he conceded that, if the MMC had concluded
the complex monopoly operated against the public interest, it 'would have
had a devil's own job making recommendations which didn't conflict with the
European Commission's position'.
The fact that the MMC would have found it difficult to go against Brussels
underscores the problems of achieving subsidiarity in competition policy.
It also suggests the MMC was prepared to ignore the fact that the issue of
special treatment for the distribution of perfumes is still far from cut and
dried. The European Commission's approval of the YSL and Givenchy regimes is
being challenged in the European Court of Justice by Leclerc, a French
supermarket chain. And the issue is still under debate inside the European
Commission itself, where many officials cannot see why perfumes should
benefit from rules originally designed to apply to technically complex
products.
The basis of selective distribution systems is that the supplier limits the
distribution of goods only to those wholesalers and retailers which satisfy
certain criteria and which, as a result, have been allowed to join the
system.
They constitute probably the only group of restrictive agreements which are
allowed to remain outside the scope of the Rome Treaty competition rules
because of the advantages they are said to confer on the distribution of
certain types of goods.
The main category of goods they are said to benefit are consumer products
which are expensive, technically complex and require sales and service
facilities of a high standard to ensure customers get satisfaction from
their purchases. Goods in these categories include motor cars and consumer
electronics such as hi-fi equipment and personal computers.
At first glance it is not immediately obvious why perfume should be
included. The perfume houses argue that their products can be satisfactorily
sold only in a suitable atmosphere or ambience, where the up-market image of
the fragrances is not spoilt by association with more mundane and less
expensive goods.
They have further claimed that products that come into contact with the skin
require specialist point-of-sale advice and that, while not technically
complex, perfume requires a level of special selling expertise.
By and large the MMC has accepted these arguments. Others are not convinced.
The Consumers' Association says its own surveys show consumers are
interested in the brand of perfume, not in where they buy it: most customers
have decided on the basis of advertising what they want to buy before they
enter a shop. Many customers actually feel intimidated by sales assistants
standing behind elaborate display counters. And many 'authorised' retailers
fail to observe the conditions set by the manufacturers and are 'shabby in
the extreme'.
The CA says the manufacturers' main purpose in setting up selective
distribution systems is to prevent supplies of their perfumes from reaching
discount retailers such as Superdrug and Tesco, the UK supermarket chain.
This, the CA alleges, is an anti-competitive practice specifically outlawed
by Brussels, even in the context of selective distribution systems.
The European Commission's reasoning for continuing to exempt the perfume
houses distribution arrangements was set out in the YSL and Givenchy cases.
These decisions allow the manufacturers to take into account factors such as
the qualifications and experience of staff, the area set aside for selling
the supplier's products and the range of cosmetic products stocked when
deciding whether or not to supply a retail outlet.
The standards by which these factors are assessed must be applied in a
non-discriminatory fashion. Manufacturers are not allowed to refuse supplies
because of a retailer's pricing policy or because of the number of
'authorised' outlets in a given area.
The supplier can require the retailer to accept certain obligations, such as
participation in the manufacturers' promotional activities and carrying a
minimum level of stock. The retailer must be allowed to sell on the products
to other 'authorised' outlets.
In granting these exemptions, the European Commission accepted that the
promotion of a prestige brand image was 'an essential factor' in marketing
fine fragrances. It accepted the need for appropriate facilities, including
'specialised technical advice' at retail outlets, was 'a legitimate
requirement'. It also made clear that other manufacturers who met these
terms could apply to the Commission for 'comfort letters' confirming that
their selective distribution systems complied with the requirements of
European law.
On the strength of these decisions more than 30 perfume houses have made
applications to Brussels for comfort letters. The decisions also appear to
have played a decisive part in the MMC's thinking.
But the Leclerc case could still upset the apple cart. The 30 applications
are on hold pending the outcome of the case. Oral hearings are scheduled for
early next year but a final judgment is not expected before the end of 1994.
According to Mr Michael Reynolds, head of the Brussels office of UK
solicitors Allen &amp; Overy, it is theoretically open to the European Court to
find there is no justification for extending selective distribution
exemptions beyond goods which are technically complex.
If that is what the court decides, manufacturers of other luxury goods sold
under prestige brand names which have benefited from exemptions in the past
 -such as watches and clocks, jewellery and even porcelain - could be forced
to reassess their distribution arrangements.
Whatever the outcome of the Leclerc challenge, the whole issue of selective
distribution for perfumes will be reviewed by the European Commission in
1997 when the YSL and Givenchy exemptions come to an end. According to Mr
Reynolds, there is sufficient difference of opinion inside the Commission to
make the outcome of that review far from certain.
Meanwhile, the issue of restrictive distribution arrangements in general
will remain under the microscope both in the UK and in Europe.
Mars the US confectionery company has brought actions in Brussels and other
European capitals challenging the ice cream distribution arrangements of
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products manufacturer which is the
world's largest ice cream manufacturer.
Mars is challenging Unilever's policy of 'cabinet exclusivity', which
involves supplying freezer cabinets to small retailers free of charge on
condition that they are not used to carry competitors' products.
The US manufacturer claims cabinet exclusivity unfairly inhibits entry into
the ice cream market and penalises smaller producers.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director general of fair trading, referring the issue to
the MMC in May, appeared to agree. Cabinet exclusivity was 'a major factor'
in the growth in Unilever's share of ice cream sales and consumers would
benefit if retailers were free to stock a wider choice of products, he
suggested.
Brussels is expected to complete its examination of the issue of cabinet
exclusivity in the new year. The MMC will report in the spring. The battle
over the right of manufacturers to control their lines of distribution is
beginning to gather pace.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Curb on Trident broadly welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT plans to restrict the size of Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent
were broadly welcomed by MPs yesterday although some senior Tories sounded a
note of caution.
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the defence select committee, said Trident
was a 'sane' place to look for defence savings.
But he said the move left questions about the number of missiles and
warheads the armed forces would have in reserve and on how easily the policy
could be reversed.
Sir Geoffrey Johnson-Smith, chairman of the Tory backbench defence
committee, said his colleagues would accept such a move provided it did not
come on top of other serious cuts.
Labour welcomed the move, which it said it had been advocating for the last
four years. 'If they had listened to us in 1989 we could have saved millions
of pounds,' it said.
But Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, said: 'The sad truth is that
this decision has been forced on the MoD by the government's financial
incompetence.'
Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, said it showed
'some belated commonsense'.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, will today announce the new policy,
under which the UK is to commit itself to deploying a force with a total
explosive power no greater than the present generation of Polaris ballistic
missile submarines. This could save hundreds of millions of pounds from the
defence budget.

FT  16 NOV 93 / SIB proposes rules for commission disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFE INSURANCE sales agents will still have limited discretion about when
they tell a prospective client their sales commission, provided that this is
done in writing before any proposal is signed, under draft proposals from
the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog.
Guidance on how the proposals would work and two examples of how information
about policies and commissions might be made available to potential
investors was issued with draft rules for consultation yesterday.
The board was told by the Treasury in late July to submit draft proposals to
it by the end of the year. These were to address how all sales agents -
independent advisers, authorised representatives and those based at banks
and building societies - could accurately portray to prospective customers
the commission on sales.
The life insurance industry has vigorously resisted disclosure of
commissions.
In one respect the board's draft goes beyond the Treasury's instructions, by
proposing that the requirement to disclose commissions should apply not only
to life insurance but to term assurance policies as well. These are taken
out for protection rather than for investment, and policyholders surviving
beyond the period of their policies do not receive any payment.
As commissions for selling these policies are lower than for selling life
insurance, disclosure is not so controversial.
The draft has been sent to about 200 organisations, including major life
offices, banks, building societies, and consumer bodies, with responses due
by November 25.
Board officials intend to combine the conclusions of this consultation with
the results of market research on the presentation of information to
potential buyers before proposals are put forward for agreement at a board
meeting next month.
Methods of disclosure
The consultation papers cover two ways of providing information about the
commission and other aspects of the policy, both of which are still the
subject of market research. Either way, or a combination of the two, could
be the final result.
In each, the information would have to be given in writing and before a
proposal or application form was signed, though agents could hold initial
discussions with a potential customer without giving an exact commission
figure.
The two methods are:
The 'key features' approach - in this method the precise way in which the
information should be given would not be specified, and the commission could
be disclosed either in the document or in a separate letter.
The key features document would be shorter and more basic than the
prospectus. It would cover questions such as what the potential investor
might pay, and what the company would pay if the policy was maintained until
the end.
The prospectus approach - the prospectus would give a broader range of
information, including a general table of illustrations of commission,
investment return and cash-in values for every year until the end of the
life of the product. It would also include a warning against cashing in the
policy early on, and an indication of how much charges and expenses would
cost the investor.
Calculating commission
The draft rules go into some detail about how to calculate the cash figures
that should be disclosed as commission, in order to give the potential
investor a clear and fair picture of the arrangements through a range of
different distribution channels.
They say that the amount disclosed to the prospective buyer should include
not only payments and personal benefits, but the full commercial cost of
assistance and services provided to company representatives which
independent advisers would have to pay for themselves, such as
administrative support, computer systems and accommodation.
Where the amount of commission is not known at the time of the transaction,
as would be the case if it depended on a particular volume of sales over a
certain period - perhaps for someone selling through a bank or building
society - then the amount disclosed as commission should not be less than
the average figure that someone in that position would receive.
On other issues covered in the remit from the Treasury, the board proposes:
To amend its rules to allow product providers to reflect in the price of a
product the distribution costs through different 'tied' distribution
channels.
To press ahead with consulting the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries over
the detail of how to provide examples of life insurance products using the
provider's own charges rather than industry averages.
To use cash surrender values to meet the requirement that potential
investors be given an indication of the surrender value, although they would
be accompanied by warnings that the figures given were not guaranteed
amounts.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Ex-Levitt chief 'not competent' to defraud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MARK REED, former group managing director of the Levitt Group, the
collapsed financial services company, was too incompetent to be guilty of
fraud, Mr Brian Lett, defending, told the Old Bailey yesterday, John Mason
writes.
Mr Reed, Mr Roger Levitt, former chairman, and two other former directors,
Mr Alan McNamara and Mr Robert Price, all deny fraudulent trading by
producing bogus accounts to make the Levitt Group appear profitable.
Mr Lett said Mr Reed was a long-standing staff member kept on in spite of
not being up to the job. He signed cheques and spoke to the auditors and
Fimbra, the watchdog, Mr Lett said. However, his activities meant telling
others to do things he did not understand.
He spent much time trying to cut expenses - including chasing Mr Sebastian
Coe, the Tory MP, then a director of a Levitt subsidiary, about a parking
ticket and telling Mr Adam Faith, the entertainer and another subsidiary
director, why he could not have expensive curtains in his office.
The trial continues.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Sainsbury considers action against Shell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J. SAINSBURY, Britain's largest food retailer, is considering legal action
against Shell over advertisements by the oil company which claim that petrol
sold by supermarkets can damage car engines.
Sainsbury said the advertisements, carried in several national newspapers
yesterday, wrongly suggested that petrol sold by supermarkets was inferior.
The advertisements quote a recent article in The Times, which said a
comparative test had found that supermarket petrol led to a bigger build-up
of carbon on engine inlet valves than did Shell's 'Advanced' brand of fuel.
Although the article in The Times said the test had been carried out at the
newspaper's request by Ricardo Consulting Engineering, an automotive
consultancy, Shell conceded yesterday that it had arranged and paid for the
test. It did not think it necessary to mention this in the advertisements.
Although the advertisements do not name Sainsbury, the retailer said they
were unfair because they implied that its petrol did not contain detergents
designed to reduce carbon deposits and engine wear.
Sainsbury said it had been selling petrol that contained detergents at 80 of
its 130 supermarket service stations for the past week, and would soon be
doing so at all sites. It had decided to do so after the car industry had
told it that detergents could improve engine performance.
Sainsbury said it was objecting to Shell and was 'considering its options'.
These included legal action and lodging a complaint with the Advertising
Standards Authority.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Labour upset by Mirror health offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR party's traditionally close relationship with the Daily Mirror
newspaper was undermined yesterday after Mr David Blunkett, Labour's shadow
health secretary, criticised it for promoting private health insurance.
His attack came after the Mirror sponsored a Pounds 10m promotion of private
health schemes in yesterday's edition. Readers were invited to apply for one
of a range of policies.
He said that the Daily Mirror was playing into the government's hands by
scaring people into believing that they could no longer trust the National
Health Service.
Mr Blunkett said: 'Ten million pounds used in the NHS would do a lot more
good than building future profits for private insurers.' He planned to take
the paper to the Advertising Standards Authority.
The paper said in the article accompanying the offer: 'The Mirror has always
been proud of the NHS. We have been in the front line of the battle to save
and improve it. We will go on doing that.'

FT  16 NOV 93 / Yorkshire Water may appeal over conviction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YORKSHIRE WATER is considering an appeal after the High Court yesterday
upheld its conviction in a case where poisonous waste was illegally poured
into a sewer owned by the company.
The case has wide implications for the water industry.
The waste, which the company says was not readily treatable, passed through
the waterworks at North Bierley near Bradford, Yorkshire and polluted the
river Spen.
Yorkshire Water was convicted by Batley and Dewsbury magistrates of causing
the pollution, but Wakefield Crown Court overturned the conviction because
it said the company was not responsible.
That judgment was successfully appealed by the National Rivers Authority
yesterday. The High Court found that Yorkshire Water 'caused' the pollution
by allowing the waste to pass through its works. Mr Justice Buckley said,
however, that the size of the penalties imposed might be affected by the
fact that the company could not have known of its presence.
Yorkshire Water said there were points of law to be decided, and it might
appeal to the House of Lords.
It said: 'At question is whether a sewerage under-taker has a statutory
defence where it receives an illegal discharge by a third party. Yorkshire
Water believes that it and other water companies which regularly face this
situation cannot be liable on the charge of 'causing poisonous, noxious or
polluting matter to enter controlled waters'.'

FT  16 NOV 93 / Bottomley calls for more work on health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE HARD work will be needed to meet some of the government's Health of the
Nation targets, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said yesterday.
The Health of the Nation strategy is intended to produce measureable
improvements in the areas of coronary heart disease and strokes, cancer,
mental illness, sexual health and accidents.
Mrs Bottomley told a review of its first year that 16 of 19 targets where
new figures were available were moving in the right direction. But this was
not the case with obesity, suicide and smoking among young people.
More people were obese than previously thought - 13 per cent of men and 15
per cent of women compared with 7 per cent and 12 per cent in 1986-87.
Suicide figures showed a slight increase, while there had been only marginal
changes in smoking among 11-to-15-year-olds between 1990 and last year.
In addition to the three problem areas identified by Mrs Bottomley, a
government report yesterday shows faster progress will be needed elsewhere
to meet the targets.
In the past year there was a 4.8 per cent reduction in the number of people
under 65 dying from coronary heart disease, but the document says 'the
current rate of progress will have to improve' to meet the targets.
The report brought fresh calls from Dr Sandy Macara, chairman of the British
Medical Association Council for a ban on cigarette advertising.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Business school reduces its deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANCHESTER Business School ended its 1992-93 financial year with a deficit
of Pounds 111,779 on Pounds 11.03m of income, after cutting costs in the
wake of last year's controversy over proposals to federate the school with
parts of Manchester University. In 1991-92 the school achieved a surplus of
Pounds 238,439.
The school was heading for a deficit of Pounds 326,700 at the end of March,
Pounds 706,700 under budget. But it cut costs from Pounds 11.22m to Pounds
11.14m to help offset a 4 per cent fall in income.
The accounts show gross income from short courses run for experienced
managers fell more than Pounds 600,000, or 13 per cent, to just under Pounds
4m. These are generally paid for by employers and are therefore likely to be
less in demand in a recession.
There was a 19 per cent fall in course fees, from Pounds 1.35m to Pounds
1.09m, from UK and other European Union students taking the school's Master
of Business Administration postgraduate degree. This was offset by more
non-EU students taking MBA places, producing a 27 per cent rise in income to
Pounds 1.03m.
Professor Martin Harris, who took over as the university's vice-chancellor
after last year's controversy, said yesterday a Manchester Federal School of
Business was planned for October next year. The business school would be
able to operate as usual within the federal school and would benefit from
the economies of scale.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Budget fears deepen gloom: Another cut in mortgage tax
relief is the industry's worst nightmare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ashworth Construction, a Manchester builder which specialised in
refurbishing public houses, recently joined more than 2,000 construction
companies estimated to have failed in the first 10 months of this year.
The shutters are drawn at the company's deserted headquarters and rubbish is
already piling up outside. It collapsed in September, the victim of a
recession that has cost almost 500,000 construction jobs since 1989. Few
other sectors have been hit as hard over such a prolonged period.
It is with even greater trepidation than usual therefore, that construction
company executives and trade union leaders await the outcome of a Budget
which they fear could reverse the beginnings of a fragile recovery in the
industry.
The number of construction company failures recorded by the Department of
Industry's insolvency service is expected to fall this year, for the first
time since 1988.
Even so, liquidations are likely to exceed 3,000 for the third year running
 -almost twice the 1,590 failures recorded in 1988.
Moreover the few areas where construction orders have improved -
housebuilding and public sector contracts - are the ones most vulnerable to
cuts.
The spending decisions of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the
exchequer, on housing and infrastructure, particularly road construction,
will be critical. The builders' biggest nightmare is that he might announce
further reductions - or even a complete abandonment - of mortgage tax
relief, overturning the tentative gains made in the housing market this
year.
Judging by conveyancing figures from the Inland Revenue for the first nine
months, house sales in England and Wales are expected to rise by about 5 per
cent this year. House prices, following gains over the summer, are forecast
to rise about 2 per cent, according to Halifax, the UK's largest mortgage
lender.
Mr Neville Simms, chief executive of Tarmac, one of Britain's biggest
housebuilders, said: 'I cannot believe the government would risk damaging
the housing market just as it appears to be on the point of recovery - and
hit many of their own voters.'
The rate of mortgage tax relief, available on the first Pounds 30,000 of
borrowings, is already due to fall from 25 per cent to 20 per cent next
April. This will still cost the exchequer about Pounds 3.5bn in 1993-94 and
will be worth a maximum of about Pounds 50 a month to home owners. Each
further 5 percentage point cut would save the government about Pounds 1bn.
One alternative might be to reduce the high cost of mortgage interest
payments made by the Department of Social Security.
Instead, home owners might be asked to pay for their own mortgage insurance
against becoming unemployed. This, however, would increase the cost of
buying a house just as hesitant purchasers were being tempted back into the
market.
Ministers have been examining other ways of reducing public spending on
construction. Inner-city spending plans for 1994-95 have already been cut by
Pounds 300m to Pounds 1.4m as a result of moves to unify urban spending
programmes in a single Budget. Spending on roads and social housing, two
areas of construction that improved this year, are also thought to be
vulnerable.
About 80 per cent of homes purchased by housing associations are built by
private contractors or purchased from housebuilders. Mr Simms said: 'Any cut
in associations' budgets would be damaging, for the country and the
construction industry.'
Spending targets for English and Welsh housing associations in 1994-95 were
reduced in the government's last Autumn Statement from Pounds 2.05bn to
Pounds 1.83bn. Now the industry fears that this could be cut by another
Pounds 300m, equivalent to the construction of about 9,000 new homes.
Just as damaging would be a cut in trunk-road spending, forecast at more
than Pounds 2bn for 1994-95. Central government's contribution to local
authority road spending is expected to provide a further Pounds 1bn. A 10
per cent reduction in these programmes could cost contractors Pounds 300m in
lost orders.
Mr David Cawthra, chief executive of Miller Group, one of Britain's biggest
privately-owned construction companies and former chief executive of Balfour
Beatty, construction arm of BICC, said: 'Spending cuts of this magnitude on
roads and social housing would more than wipe out the 1 per cent to 2 per
cent rise in construction output forecast for next year.'
This could rebound on building material producers, which in the past 12
months have managed to raise prices of structural steel, concrete, glass,
aggregates and plasterboard by an average of 5 per cent - after huge cuts in
manufacturing capacity during the recession.
Competition for work among contractors, by comparison, remains intense, with
many companies taking work at little better than cost or even at a loss just
to keep cash coming into the business.
Mr Howard Seymour, construction analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said
the public sector's share of new orders had fallen to about 35 per cent,
following the privatisations of water, gas, and other industries.
'The public sector, together with housing, remains a very important part of
the market at the moment as these are the only two areas to show any
growth,' said Mr Seymour.
According to the Department of the Environment the total of new construction
orders rose by 5 per cent in the first eight months of this year.
Within this total public-sector orders rose 23 per cent while private-sector
orders fell 3 per cent in spite of a 10 per cent rise in private
housebuilding.
The industry fears that the government will seek to distract attention from
cuts in public-sector budgets by launching more initiatives to encourage
private-sector investment in infrastructure projects. These are unlikely to
deliver much work for several years, however.
Meanwhile, prospects of construction starting on very large rail projects
such as the Channel tunnel link and CrossRail look further away than ever.

UP TO a fifth of construction companies could disappear in the next 18
months as a result of company failures and enforced mergers, says a report
to be published this week by Price Waterhouse, the accountants.
The report warns that receiverships and liquidations are likely to remain at
a high level because of overcapacity in the industry, even when construction
output starts to recover.
Mr Colin McKay, Price Waterhouse partner responsible for construction, said
cuts in social housing and road and rail investment in the Budget would only
make matters worse.
Recession in continental European construction markets and the removal of
European trade barriers meant that competition from continental contractors
had increased in British markets, he said.
The recent award of tunnelling contracts to continental European contractors
for London Underground's Jubilee Line extension has prompted criticism from
British civil engineers, who argued that they did not have the same
opportunities to win work in other European Union countries.
Price Waterhouse estimates that there is up to 30 per cent overcapacity
among British contractors in spite of record levels of receiverships and
liquidations.
The number of construction company failures this year, although likely to be
lower than the peak of 3,830 recorded by the Department of Trade last year,
is still expected to exceed 3,000 for the third year running. This compares
with 1,590 company failures in 1988 and 1,638 in 1989.
Price Waterhouse says construction company failures could rise again as the
industry comes out of recession, and as banks step up pressure on companies
for repayment of long-standing borrowings. Construction output is forecast
by the industry to rise by up to 2 per cent next year.
Mr McKay said such a small increase would not be sufficient to reduce
overcapacity in the industry, and could be reversed if the government cuts
construction expenditure in the Budget.
He said: 'Cashflow pressures, irrespective of what happens in the Budget,
are likely to remain intense. Contractors have been taking work at cost or
even at a loss just to keep cash coming in to help meet overheads and pay
wages. This cannot continue.'
Mr McKay added: 'The logical outcome is that the numbers of companies
competing for work must reduce and that means more mergers or an increase in
company failures.'

FT  16 NOV 93 / Trade bodies win Pounds 500,000 to aid competitiveness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to provide nearly Pounds 500,000 to British trade
associations to help companies improve their competitiveness.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, announced yesterday that
13 associations had won a government competition aimed at helping them to
establish 'benchmarking clubs'. The clubs are intended to enable companies
to compare their business methods across a range of activities to identify
best practice.
Benchmarking clubs are used extensively in the US to promote
competitiveness. In a bid to encourage the development of similar clubs, Mr
Heseltine offered up to Pounds 50,000 to each winner.
The government received entries from 38 trade bodies representing more than
55,000 companies. The schemes had to identify areas, such as production
efficiency, product quality or customer relations, that they wished to
improve. The department said companies should be actively involved in the
formation and development of the clubs.
An important measure was the value the schemes would add to business
performance in the view of the customer.
The winners were: British Footwear Manufacturers Federation; British
Clothing Industry Association; British Constructional Steelwork Association;
British Iron &amp; Steel Producers Association; Fenestration Benchmarking Club
(seven trade bodies in window production); General Aviation Manufacturers
and Traders Association; Metal Finishing Association; Confederation of
Suppliers to the Printing, Publishing, Pulp, Paper-making and Converting
Industry; Semiconductor Businesses Association; Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders; Society of British Aerospace Companies; UK Spring
Manufacturers Association.

SCHOOLS IN Shetland and Orkney continue to achieve the highest percentages
of top grades in the main examinations for 16-year-olds in Scottish schools,
official exam results published by the Scottish Office yesterday show.
The results, which cover the past three years, give detailed figures on the
results for all Scottish secondary schools.
They cover 'standard grade' examinations and 'highers', which are normally
taken one year after standard grade and are the main examination for
university entrants.
While Shetland and Orkney, as well as Western Isles and Borders region,
emerge well from the tables in terms of the percentage of pupils getting top
grades, Strathclyde and Lothian, the two largest regions in Scotland, come
at the bottom.

<TEXT>
THE FIRST Singapore-based company to set up a manufacturing plant in Britain
has chosen a site in East Kilbride near Glasgow for its European
manufacturing and research and development headquarters.
PCI, which claims to be one of the largest contract electronics
manufacturers in the world, will initially employ about 100 people and hopes
to employ 300.
The company designs and makes telecommunications equipment, handheld
terminals, office automation equipment and automotive electronic equipment.
It employs about 3,000 people in Singapore, the Philippines and Indonesia.
Customers include AT&amp;T, Motorola, Nokia and Rank Xerox.
Mr Jiun Jeng Parng, chief executive, said PCI intended to use its East
Kilbride plant to attract customers and demonstrate its abilities in design
and manufacturing.
He was attracted to Scotland because of its large number of good electronics
engineers, he said. Between a third and half of the first 100 staff would be
executives.
Mr Parng said PCI, after establishing its European headquarters in East
Kilbride, was likely to set up a large manufacturing facility in a low-cost
European country such as Hungary, the Czech republic or Portugal.
'The UK is OK cost-wise if you're employing hundreds of people, but if
you're employing thousands you need to go somewhere cheaper,' Mr Parng said.
PCI has an annual turnover of about Dollars 100m (Pounds 66.2m) and claims
to be among the top 20 contract electronics manufacturers in the world, the
biggest being SCI of the US.
Mr Parng said it concentrated on 'stable growth products such as
telecommunications equipment rather than personal computers, disk drives or
toys'.
Hoskyns, the UK computer services company which provides outsourced
information technology services, is to set up a business process outsourcing
centre at Forres, in Grampian.
The centre expects to employ 200 people within two years. It will cost
Pounds 3.2m, of which Pounds 1.5m is coming from Highlands and Islands
Enterprise, the development body.
The centre will be linked to clients via the Highlands' advanced
telecommunications network. It will carry out some council tax
administration for Grampian Regional Council and and Moray District Council,
and is hoping to attract work from other local authorities, insurance
companies and businesses with a big administrative load.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Shetland and Orkney schools top main exam league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHOOLS IN Shetland and Orkney continue to achieve the highest percentages
of top grades in the main examinations for 16-year-olds in Scottish schools,
official exam results published by the Scottish Office yesterday show.
The results, which cover the past three years, give detailed figures on the
results for all Scottish secondary schools. They cover 'standard grade'
examinations and 'highers', which are normally taken one year after standard
grade and are the main examination for university entrants. Shetland and
Orkney score well on the standard grade tables, although their results for
highers vary sharply from year to year because of the small numbers of
pupils involved.
The results tables include the performance of Scottish independent schools
in standard grade and highers, but does not take account of those doing the
equivalent GCSE or A-levels set by examination bodies in England.
The Scottish Education Department has published no conclusions drawn from
the tables on the performance of the schools, although Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton, the education minister, said the 1993 results showed 'a
reasonably encouraging trend'.
While Shetland and Orkney, as well as Western Isles and Borders region,
emerge well from the tables in terms of the percentage of pupils getting top
grades, Strathclyde and Lothian, the two largest regions in Scotland, come
at the bottom.
The statistics by region and island council areas give only a broad picture.
The detailed information from each school is a more useful guide to
performance.
The exam tables include statistics on the proportion of pupils staying to
secondary year five after taking standard grade in secondary year four.
These show that the staying-on rate across Scotland has risen from 54 per
cent in 1991 to 60 per cent in 1993.
The issuing of the results tables is controversial because the results can
easily give a misleading impression of schools' performance. For this reason
the results booklet is replete with warnings and qualifications.
The Scottish Education Department issued tables showing the percentage of
pupils in each area gaining five or more highers in bands A to C.
Shetland - which topped the regional tables for the percentage of pupils
gaining three or more standard grades at high grades - was bottom of this
league, Dumfries and Galloway topped this league with 8.5 per cent.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Radical education report welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF THE most ambitious reports on education in England and Wales met with
a broadly positive response from the educational establishment yesterday.
The independent National Commission on Education's proposals are radical and
cover every level of schooling. University heads, the main teachers' unions
and the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties voiced strong support.
However, Mr John Patten, the education secretary, had not been sent a copy
of the report by the end of its press launch and was unable to comment,
although he confirmed that he would take the recommendations seriously.
The commission made numerous proposals, which it estimates could be
introduced at a cost of Pounds 1.4bn.
Nursery education
Universal nursery education should be introduced as the basic building block
for the rest of the system, it says. Within five years nursery places should
be available for all children in deprived areas. By 2010, 95 per cent of
four-year-olds and 85 per cent of three-year-olds should be at school.
Class sizes
Within five years, the commission says, no primary school should have a
class size of more than 30. In inner cities, however, and schools with a
high proportion of children speaking English as a second language, classes
should have a maximum of 20 for the first two years of primary school.
Twenty should be the ultimate maximum size for all primary school classes.
Curriculum/qualifications
All the present qualifications - GCSEs usually taken at 16, and A-levels at
18, along with vocational qualifications - should be put under the umbrella
of a new General Education Diploma (GED). This would have ordinary and
advanced levels, and normally be taken at the ages of 16 and 18.
The age of 14 should become the main educational watershed, rather than 16,
with pupils setting out on a series of GED modules, intended to lead to
advanced level in four years.
The target is that by the year 2000, 90 per cent or more of young people
will be working for 'nationally recognised qualifications' at least until
the age of 18.
Departmental organisation
The commission says education and training have no clear dividing line
between them. To recognise this, and to avoid problems in co-ordinating the
two, it would merge the Department for Education with the training section
of the Department of Employment to create a Department of Education and
Training.
Other bureaucratic streamlining would involve the merger of the National
Council for Vocational Qualifications, the training quango, and the Schools
Curriculum and Assessment Authority, which administers the national
curriculum and its tests.
Local education authorities
The government is already urging schools to opt out of local education
authority control. Under the commission's proposals local education
authorities would be abolished and replaced with education and training
boards which would eventually have a similar remit as Training and
Enterprise Councils. The boards would have less power than local education
authorities.
All schools would therefore have the fiscal benefits and independence of
'opted-out' schools, and these would no longer have separate status.
Higher education funding
The commission favours introducing loans which graduates would use to pay
for their tuition. These would be repaid through a higher rate of income
tax.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Organic farmers warn on funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ORGANIC FARMERS could become 'an endangered species' unless the government
provides more financial support for the sector, Mrs Gillian Shephard,
agriculture minister, was told yesterday.
Representatives of the Soil Association, which registers organic producers,
met Mrs Shephard to complain about the proposed organic aid scheme which
will pay Pounds 1.5m a year to farmers who convert to organic methods but
will do nothing to help existing organic farmers.
Some organic farmers were reverting to conventional practices or setting
aside because it brought greater financial rewards, they said.
The association said: 'The growing UK market for organic food will be
supplied by subsidised organic farmers in Holland, Germany and Denmark.'
Demand for organic produce is increasing although the recession has held
back the pace of growth. A recent survey by Mintel, the consumer research
analysts, said sales of organic foods in the UK had increased nearly
fivefold since 1988 to about Pounds 105.1m this year.
Under the government's proposals announced in August, English producers
converting to organic methods will initially receive Pounds 70 a hectare,
falling to Pounds 25 a hectare in the last year of the five-year scheme.
That compares with proposed payments in Germany of about Pounds 150 a
hectare for existing producers and Pounds 200 for new entrants, the
association said.
Mr Francis Blake, association secretary, said: 'If we want a decent
incentive for farmers to go organic and stay organic, that's the sort of
figure that's needed at the moment.'
The ministry said after the meeting that the government felt it best to use
available resources to encourage conversion, although it would keep under
review the idea of help for existing farmers.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Harvesting profit from set-aside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CROP of willow coppice, which is being grown to make productive use of
set-aside land, is cleared by Mr Neil Roberts (above), manager of
Ingerthorpe Hall Farm, near Harrogate in North Yorkshire, Alison Maitland
writes.
The farm is growing 70 acres of willow and poplar. The crops can be used to
provide wood chips for burning in combined heat and power systems and for
use in paper pulp. The young wood is coppiced, or cut frequently, to
increase the harvest.
Under last year's reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy arable farmers
are required to leave 15 per cent of their land uncultivated to cut
overproduction.
The policy is expected to cost the taxpayer Pounds 130m in payments to
British farmers this year and is resented by many producers, who dislike
seeing their land idle. Set-aside payments to farmers across the European
Union are due to rise to about Ecu1.2bn (Pounds 930m) in 1995.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Clarke warns on export prices: Chancellor expects steady
expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, yesterday warned that the
weakness of European markets was one of the biggest risks to Britain's
fragile economic recovery.
In a speech to the Confederation of British Industry conference in
Harrogate, North Yorkshire, he said: 'Britain is the only major country in
Europe where the economy is recovering. But that is a cause only for subdued
celebration since more than half our trade is with other EC countries.'
Mr Clarke voiced concern that in the past year exporters had raised their
prices by 10 per cent while inflation was less than 2 per cent and wage
increases at a historic low. The rise could not reflect cost pressures at
home.
He said: 'It provides a vivid reminder that British management, no doubt
under shareholder pressure, always tends to prefer return to volume when
competing in overseas markets.
'If our recovery is to be strong and sustained, we need to export as well as
consume. And if our recovery is to be a job-creating recovery, we must do
everything in our power to maintain our competitive advantage and to expand
our share of world trade.'
Mr Clarke said he doubted whether the recovery would lead to a sharp upturn
and a period of rapid growth. His view was that much of Europe was likely to
see an expansion that was steady, but slow. 'The challenge will be to
sustain it. The nineties will not be an easy decade in which to earn a
living.'
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, told the conference
that companies that wanted to generate their own electricity would no longer
need a supply licence.
He said the decision was evidence of the government's determination to
deregulate.
'Like competitiveness, deregulation has no end date. There is always more to
do,' he said.
The electricity decision removes a requirement that companies generating
electricity for their own use need a licence if they consume less than 51
per cent of the output themselves.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Manchester bus sale angers union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION LEADERS attempting an employee buy-out of half of Greater Manchester's
buses are to complain to the Office of Fair Trading about the planned sale
of some operations to British Bus.
They say that the sale would give British Bus, which owns Bee Line and North
Western, a monopoly in some parts of Greater Manchester, including 70 per
cent of the market in Wigan. They want the OFT to rule the sale against the
public interest and will be asking local MPs to help them.
Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Authority was told by the government
earlier this year to split municipally owned GM Buses, which has more than
4,000 employees, into two businesses and privatise them.
Services in the south of the conurbation are being sold to their employees,
but the authority has named British Bus the preferred bidder for the
northern business.
Mr Frank Moore, joint chairman of the employee buy-out team, said yesterday:
'The point of splitting up GM Buses was to increase competition. This does
the opposite. It cannot be in the public interest.'
The sums involved are not being disclosed, but British Bus is understood to
have bid one-third more than the employees.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which has been advising the employee bids, said: 'This is
not just sour grapes. There is a genuine grievance. We also understand the
rival bid has yet to be finalised.'
The sale of Mainline, the bus service operated by the South Yorkshire
Passenger Transport Authority and centred in Sheffield, to its 2,200
employees is expected to be announced tomorrow. Following the decision to
split the sale of GM Buses, Mainline was the last metropolitan service being
sold intact.
The government yesterday approved the sale of Leicester CityBus by Leicester
City Council to GRT Holdings. Leicester CityBus has 217 vehicles. GRT
Holdings operates buses in the Aberdeen and Falkirk areas.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Sealink lowers fares to meet tunnel threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STENA SEALINK, the cross-Channel ferry operator, yesterday announced a 20
per cent fare cut for some travellers on its Dover-to-Calais sailings in the
latest move by ferry operators to meet the threat of the Channel tunnel.
The company, the second largest passenger carrier on the route, is to
introduce a cheap Apex fare for a car and up to five passengers for
travellers who book 28 days in advance and return within five days. This
will reduce the cheapest fare from Pounds 88 to Pounds 70, and the most
expensive from Pounds 200 to Pounds 160.
The ferry companies which operate on the short cross-Channel routes are
striving to secure passenger loyalty before the tunnel opens next May. Apart
from fare cuts they have increased the frequency of sailings, reduced
check-in times and introduced 'superferries'.
In spite of these efforts the ferries can expect to lose half their
passenger business and perhaps a quarter of freight traffic to the tunnel,
according to some estimates.
As the ferry companies move to defend their market share Eurotunnel is
keeping them guessing about the exact level of fares it will charge. It has
promised that fares will be similar to those charged by the ferries, but
said yesterday it did not expect to announce full fare details until January
12, when the tickets go on sale.
Eurotunnel confirmed yesterday that car drivers using its shuttle service
between Folkestone and Calais would be charged a standard fare regardless of
passenger numbers, while fares would vary by sea-son rather than time of
day.
Seven months ahead of the planned start of its shuttle Eurotunnel is forcing
ferry companies to squeeze every possible marketing advantage out of their
fare structures. While Eurotunnel stresses the advantage of not having to
book in advance, Stena Sealink yesterday said its Apex fares were intended
'for people who want the comfort of a reservation'.
Stena Sealink, which has 36 per cent of Dover-Calais passenger traffic
against just over 50 per cent for P&amp;O, calculates that it has spent Pounds
200m on new ships - including a fifth superferry due to enter service next
year - and port improvements over the past 30 months.
A restructuring of Stena's operations, prompted in part by the threat posed
by the tunnel, led to 2,000 job cuts and a sharp reduction in operating
costs.
P&amp;O said it had spent Pounds 400m in the past five years improving service
quality on short sea routes. Last spring it launched a shuttle service
offering 25 crossings a day and a sailing every 45 minutes at peak periods.
In September it reduced fares on its five-day return sailings by up to 25
per cent.
A system of bar-code labelling of travellers' cars, which means that they
are only checked once instead of twice on quayside arrival, is being
introduced.
By the time the tunnel opens the ferry operators, including Hoverspeed, will
be offering up to 70 return sailings a day between Dover and Calais. Even
allowing for the expected expansion of total cross-Channel passenger and
freight traffic it is unlikely that they will be able to keep this up for
long.

FT  16 NOV 93 / PM stresses links between traditional values and success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, yesterday sought to infuse fresh life
into his 'back to basics' campaign by linking traditional values firmly to
economic success.
Delivering his annual speech at the Lord Mayor's banquet in the City of
London, Mr Major also warned Europe to act quickly to restore
competitiveness, and held out the prospect of a reinvigorated London.
Mr Major dismissed claims that his campaign for a return to traditional
values was an exercise in nostalgia, recalling that his own working-class
upbringing gave him 'no reason to be nostalgic'.
The prime minister said the campaign was aimed at inculcating respect for
basic economic values such as low inflation, free markets and a climate that
encouraged free enterprise. These values were linked to social values such
as self-discipline, respect for the law, concern for others and greater
acceptance of personal responsibility.
'Some will say these values are obvious. If so, why have so many people
forgotten them,' he said.
Mr Major said huge strides had been made towards 'commonsense policies' in
the 1980s. But traditional values were equally relevant to the urgent tasks
of the 1990s, such as declining competitiveness.
In the only explicitly party political section of his speech, Mr Major
launched a strong attack on the manifesto for next year's European elections
issued by the European socialist group, to which the Labour party belongs.
He said Europe's competitors in Japan, south-east Asia and the US 'must be
astonished by the group's call for the introduction of a 35-hour or four-day
week. And I must say it takes my breath away too.'
It was 'past time to sound the alarm' about the declining competitiveness of
the European Union, which risked being overtaken as an economic power by the
countries of the Pacific basin.
Mr Major said the EU would be economically outpaced by the year 2000 if it
continued to lose its share of world trade at the present rate.
The prime minister said the government would shortly begin a wide-ranging
consultation exercise to determine how to improve prospects for London.
He said businesses were still coming to London, bringing jobs and growth,
but he said that if London was to stay ahead it had to develop and compete.
The prime minister added that the government would help to establish the
inward investment agency which has been mooted by the City corporation and
others.
Mr Tony Blair, Labour's home affairs spokesman, said Mr Major's
back-to-basics campaign was 'going nowhere fast'. He said the government was
'uncertain whether it is going back, or what it is going back to'.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said Mr Major's speech was 'a
mixture of wish lists and nostalgia, when what Britain needs is a firm
lead'.

MORE HARD work will be needed to meet some of the government's Health of the

The Health of the Nation strategy is intended to produce measureable

Mrs Bottomley said that figures for 16 out of 19 targets were moving in the
right direction. But this was not the case with obesity, suicide and smoking

FT  16 NOV 93 / Names accept Pounds 1.77m for losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 500 Lloyd's Names yesterday won Pounds 1.77m in compensation for
their insurance losses after agreeing to accept an out-of-court settlement
offered by the Aragorn Agencies and its errors-and-omissions insurers,
Richard Lapper writes.
Under the offer Aragorn and its insurers, which cover legal awards for
negligence, acknowledged that the Names should not have been responsible for
83 per cent of the losses incurred on one particular contract underwritten
by Aragorn syndicate 384.
'This is a significant success,' said Sir Michael Bunbury, chairman of the
Aragorn Action group, which represents 494 of the 633 Names - individuals
whose assets support the market - on syndicate 384 in the 1985 year of
account.
Names will also receive substantial interest and legal expenses, said Sir
Michael. The Names have lost Pounds 13.8m on business underwritten in 1985
but took legal action over a specific reinsurance contract underwritten in
1984 by Mr Graham Potter, the 384 underwriter. The case had been due to come
to court next month.
Separately in the opening day of a court action against four Names Lloyd's
denied that it owed a contractual duty to Names to act in good faith.
The Names are resisting writs issued by Lloyd's to draw down their deposits
in order to meet insurance losses. This week's hearing before Mr Justice
Saville concerns a series of preliminary issues.
Mr Michael Freeman, the solicitor representing the four Names, said the
admission was 'both surprising and startling'. He said it contradicted
statements by Lloyd's in other legal actions against Names.
Lloyd's explained: 'Lloyd's is denying that as a matter of contract it owes
the implied contractual duties pleaded against it. The duties alleged
include an implied duty of good faith.'

FT  16 NOV 93 / Senior Tories risk fresh Euro row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR Conservatives drafting the party's manifesto for next June's European
parliament elections have thrown down a gauntlet to Tory Euro-sceptics by
ruling out a review of links with the federalist European People's Party.
The internal committee which is drawing up the manifesto has decided there
is no question of disowning the EPP and that the strategy of aligning with
it is 'rock solid'.
The move will anger Tory Euro-sceptics, some of whom are declining to
canvass for candidates suspected of being 'soft' on federalism.
It follows the decision this month by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, to
sign a common European socialist manifesto calling for a European foreign
and security policy, a single currency which all member states can join and
urgent measures to cut unemployment.
Tory tacticians believe Mr Smith's endorsement of this document will enable
them to wage an effective and united campaign by highlighting pronounced
differences on how best to engineer economic recovery.
The contrast, they say, would be between a Tory prescription of deregulation
and market-based measures and a Labour-endorsed reflation package. According
to one official: 'The philosophical divide is becoming clearer and clearer.'
Though heartened by the socialist manifesto, Conservative leaders are keenly
aware that continuing divisions on Europe could lead to an embarrassing
defeat next June in a contest which could have important repercussions for
Mr John Major.
Conservative MEPs are aligned to the EPP - the confederation of centre-right
and Christian Democrat parties in the European Union - but are not part of
it and will not be bound by the EPP manifesto.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Call to reduce regulation of employment: Heseltine stresses
government's determination to deregulate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARP DIFFERENCES of approach to pulling the European Union economies out of
recession and ensuring growth are emerging between British business and the
European Commission.
Sir Michael Angus, CBI president, told the conference: 'To make European
business more competitive we need to make labour more flexible, reduce
over-regulation - especially from Brussels - and scale down the burden of
so-called social costs which industry has to bear.'
The differences will crystallise later this month when the commission
presents the main points of its long-awaited white paper on growth,
competitiveness and employment to EU economy and finance ministers.
The commission thinks that the British approach to securing economic growth
lays too much emphasis on cutting costs.
Mr David Williamson, the secretary-general of the commission who was
speaking on behalf of Mr Jacques Delors, commission president, said:
'Europe's long-term strategy cannot be one of competing solely on costs. An
effective long-term policy to generate growth and employment must be geared
also to increasing productivity. Competitiveness should not depend on low
pay.'
The differences seem likely to cause further political difficulties for the
government in its talks with EU members over economic policy.
Speakers in Harrogate chastised the commission for what they saw as
over-regulation and for failing to ensure that regulation was not uniformly
applied country by country.
However the commission's white paper will seek to jump over immediate
economic difficulties. It will suggest means of coming to terms with the
effects of technological change and the shift in economic power to the
Pacific Rim.
In a obvious reference to UK government uneasiness about future European
economic integration, Mr Williamson warned the CBI that 'future increases in
prosperity will not be generated by focusing only on cyclical or immediate
concerns or by adopting increasingly inward policies'.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Lucas workers reject pay offers

PAY RISES of between 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent have been rejected at
several plants of Lucas Industries, the automotive and aerospace components
company, and ballots on industrial action are being carried out at four
plants in Birmingham.
About half of the 35 Lucas plants have, however, settled for rises of
between zero and 2 per cent.
The AEEU craft union in Birmingham says that there is a centrally determined
pay band even though the company changed to plant-level pay bargaining
several years ago. The company denies that it has a pay norm.
Meanwhile, members of the TGWU general union at Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port
plant will start an overtime ban from Thursday, having rejected a pay offer
of 2.5 per cent this year followed by a 3 per cent rise and a 1 per cent
cash bonus next year.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Former accounts body chief censured
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEADING member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales has been criticised for failing adequately to supervise one of his
employees, who was convicted of forgery and deception.
Mr Brian Worth, a former head of the institute's investigation committee,
was 'admonished' by its disciplinary committee in connection with his
supervisory action while he was chairman of Clark Kenneth Levanthal (CKL),
an international network of accountants including Clark Whitehill in the UK.
The investigation was triggered in late 1991, at which point Mr Worth
resigned his institute position. It followed the conviction at the Old
Bailey of Mr Nicholas Young, a former executive director of CKL.
Mr Young used CKL's address and stationery to attract investors and claimed
their money would be invested in offshore trusts. In fact it was spent on a
system of horse-race betting.
The findings against Mr Worth were privately announced to those involved on
Thursday last week, but were made public in a statement yesterday by Cameron
Markby Hewitt, his solicitors, issued 'in order to quell speculation'.
The statement said that the disciplinary committee had found that 'Mr Worth
should have made further enquiries into the explanation by Mr Young that
money which he paid to CKL came from the performance of clerical services
for friends based overseas'.
It said Mr Worth had been 'genuinely misled' by Mr Young, and that the
committee had concluded there was no evidence that further enquiries would
necessarily have uncovered Mr Young's true activities.
Mr Richard Hornsby, of the CKL Victims Group, which is suing Clark Whitehill
and CKL for compensation, said: 'I think this is good news. It shows there
were no security procedures at CKL.'
Legal action is expected to start early next year. More than 60 investors
are suing for more than Pounds 8.5m plus interest in money taken by Mr
Young.
Mr Worth, who is considering whether to appeal against the ruling, hired two
expert witnesses for his defence alongside Cameron Markby, which has been
defending Clark Whitehill against the civil action.

FT  16 NOV 93 / BT wants 'grotesque' alliance of its rivals banned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecommunications yesterday stepped up its campaign against what it
called the 'grotesque' proposed link between the world's three largest
telecommunications operators.
Mr Iain Vallance, BT chairman, made his most outspoken attack yet on Project
Atlantic, the putative alliance between France Telecom, Deutsche Telekom and
American Telephone and Telegraph. 'I trust that the European Commission will
have no truck with this grotesque proposal,' he told the CBI conference.
BT later said it had had a series of meetings with senior officials at the
commission's competition directorate, to protest against the proposal to
create what it described as 'the biggest telecommunications monopoly in the
world'.
Mr Vallance plans to meet Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European
Commission, to press BT's case. The BT chairman is also confident of
enlisting the support of Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary.
Mr Vallance paid tribute to the commission's role in achieving 'such
progress as there has been to date' in moving towards liberalising Europe's
telecommunications.
But he added: 'It should be a matter of deep concern that the commission has
been pushed into a position where it has to defend the basic tenets of the
Treaty of Rome, that there should be open and free competition across
Europe, rather than the phone companies having to defend why they should
enjoy a continuing monopoly.'
He said he believed his European counterparts recognised that liberalisation
was inevitable. 'But their approach seems to be that of St Augustine, 'Oh
Lord, let me be chaste, but not yet'.' To leave the telecommunications
infrastructure in the hands of the state phone companies, he argued, was 'to
condemn Europe to the lifestyle of Jurassic Park'.
He said it was dismaying that the new directive of telecommunications
service liberalisation would not come into effect until 1998.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT plans to restrict the size of Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent
were broadly welcomed by MPs yesterday although some senior Tories were more
cautious, David Owen writes.
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the defence select committee, said Trident
was a 'sane' place to look for defence savings.
But he said the move left questions about the number of missiles and
warheads the armed forces would have in reserve and on how easily the policy
could be reversed.
Labour welcomed the move, which it said it had been advocating for the last
four years.
Mr Menzies Campbell, for the Liberal Democrats, said it showed 'some belated
commonsense'.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, will today announce the new policy,
under which the UK is to commit itself to deploying a total explosive power
no greater than the present generation of Polaris ballistic missile
submarines.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Civil servants 'fear the sack'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIVIL servants should have the right of appeal to the Privy Council against
carrying out ministerial decisions which they consider unethical, a trade
union leader said yesterday.
Mrs Elizabeth Symons, general secretary of the Association of First Division
Civil Servants, which represents middle- and high-ranking officers, said
recent experience was that civil servants were 'afraid to question their
ministers for fear of losing their jobs or being prosecuted'.
Ms Symons was speaking after her union submitted a report to Lord Justice
Scott urging a new code of ethics for Whitehall in the light of evidence
emerging in the arms-for-Iraq inquiry.
'It is clear that recent developments within the civil service have led to
some doubt as to whether the accountability of ministers is as robust a
concept as used to be the case,' the report says.
The union released its submission to the Scott probe in response to a report
by Sir Peter Kemp, former second permanent secretary in the Cabinet Office,
which accused Whitehall of inefficiency.
Sir Peter claims that senior civil servants give poor quality advice to
ministers, who would be better served by 'political advisers'.
Ms Symons said that the Scott inquiry had put pressure on civil servants to
explain publicly their responsibility for conveying the truth of government
policy.
'The whole point is that the responsibility lies with ministers. If civil
servants have to go along with half-truths it is because they fear being
sacked or prosecuted,' she said.
The union report reveals for the first time the existence of guidance notes
in all government departments which deal with the handling of intelligence
information covered by the Official Secrets Act.
The union argues that in the absence of a Civil Service Act or a written
constitution, guidelines to civil servants are 'in some cases, if not
contradictory, not wholly consistent'.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Doncaster pit closure announced
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BENTLEY colliery near Doncaster, South Yorkshire, is to close on December 3,
British Coal said yesterday.
The pit, which employs 450 people, was one of 12 for which the government
announced a reprieve in March.
Bentley's pithead stocks of 600,000 tonnes are equivalent to more than six
months' production and about three-quarters of the pit's weekly output of
20,000 tonnes is being added to the stockpile.
British Coal also announced that 60 jobs are to be lost at Tower colliery in
Mid Glamorgan to reduce production because of overcapacity. Tower is the
last working pit in south Wales and has a stockpile of about 500,000 tonnes.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Supply licence no longer required for companies generating
their own electricity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES that want to generate their own electricity will no longer need a
supply licence, Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary,
announced yesterday, Paul Cheeseright writes.
Mr Heseltine told the CBI that the decision was evidence of the government's
determination to deregulate.
'Like competitiveness, deregulation has no end date. There is always more to
do,' he said. The electricity decision removes a requirement that companies
generating electricity for their own use need a licence if they consume less
than 51 per cent of the output themselves.
Mr Heseltine said the rule distorted investment decisions. It made it more
difficult for companies to choose the most economic generation plant, such
as combined heat and power schemes. This in turn reduced their
competitive-ness.
He said: 'Competitiveness is the key to prosperity.'

FT  16 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Paris woos farmers with more aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE French government yesterday moved to soothe its farmers' anxiety about
the impact of a possible Gatt trade deal by granting them an extra FFr1.5bn
(Pounds 170m) in aid next year.
The extra aid, which will take the form of lower welfare charges and
increased pensions for farmers, comes on top of the government's plan to
increase its 1994 agriculture budget by FFr3bn to FFr47bn.
Government and farm union officials denied it was a pay-off for French
farmers agreeing to scale down their demands for revision of the
controversial Blair House farm trade accord with the US. They stressed that
the aid was designed to help French farmers adapt to the European Union's
earlier reform of its common agricultural policy.
But the farmers' unions have been remarkably docile since September when
France's European Union partners partially endorsed Paris' demands for
change in the Blair House accord.
This has left observers puzzled as to whether the farmers really believe the
government will stand in the last ditch with them over Gatt, or whether they
have come to regard concession by France as inevitable.

FT  16 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Brittan warns Japan, US - Resist
Washington pressure for managed trade, Tokyo urged
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SIR Leon Brittan, European Commission vice president, warned yesterday that
any agreement between Japan and the US that sought to increase market share
of foreign companies was likely to be at the expense of the EC and called on
the Japanese government to resist US pressure for such managed trade.
'We would be very concerned about any agreement that would guarantee
increases in market share because. . . that could only be at the expense of
the Community,' Sir Leon said.
The US has been pressing Japan to accept market access targets for US and
other foreign companies in specific markets in Japan. US proposals on
increasing market share in vehicle parts, in particular, call on Japan to
set specific targets for non-Japanese US parts makers.
Even where such targets may in principle be aimed at increasing market share
for all foreign companies, given the relationship between US and Japanese
industry, such agreements 'will arouse suspicion that it is intended to
benefit the US', Sir Leon said.
Sir Leon also renewed pressure on Japan to help bring the Uruguay Round
trade negotiations to a successful conclusion by accepting tarification of
its rice market and implementing in full a market access package agreed this
summer by the EC, Canada, Japan and the US.
In meetings with top Japanese officials, including Prime Minister Morihiro
Hosokawa in Tokyo, Sir Leon said it would be difficult for Japan to seek
exemption from tarification of its rice market.
Recently, however, speculation has been growing in Japan that the government
is preparing a compromise deal on opening up the rice market that would call
for a six-year moratorium after which Japan's rice market would be gradually
subjected to tarification.
Sir Leon himself was confident a compromise could be found on opening up
Japan's rice market which would satisfy the need for tarification while
taking into consideration special Japanese sensitivities regarding rice.
Although no such proposal was actually put to him by the Japanese
authorities, 'I do not believe that. . . is impossible to resolve,' he said.
With regard to progress on the Uruguay Round, Japan still needed to
implement cuts in peak tariffs on goods including leather, textiles and
processed foods which were agreed in Tokyo in July by the US, the EC, Canada
and Japan, in a market access deal aimed at pushing the stalled trade talks
forward.
Nevertheless, Sir Leon was 'satisfied that Japan does have a genuine sense
of urgency' and recognised the need to make a big effort in bringing the
Uruguay Round to a successful conclusion, he said.
Sir Leon also called on Japan to play a role in a regular dialogue between
the EC and members of Apec, which Europe is very keen to have.

FT  16 NOV 93 / World Trade News: US reassures Japan and China on Asia
policy - Apec meeting shows importance to Washington of economic security
issues, says Christopher

THE US yesterday assured both Japan and China that they remain central to US
policies in Asia in spite of current difficulties.
At a press conference prior to his departure for the Apec summit in Seattle,
Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, also asserted that the US
'remained unyielding' in its determination to retain its current security
posture in the region.
The Apec meeting itself, the secretary of state said, 'represents an
important but first step towards a more open liberal trading regime.' This,
he added, would take time to evolve but was another indication of the
administration's elevation of economic security issues to the front rank of
foreign policy priorities.
Mr Christopher reassured Japan that it remained 'the cornerstone of our
Asia-Pacific policy'. While he described the current Japanese bilateral
trade surplus as 'unacceptable', he said the US goal was to place economic
issues on the same sound and co-operative basis that characterised other
aspects of the relationship.
Similarly, on China the US wanted 'a comprehensive relationship that permits
resolution of differences in a broad strategic context'.
Nevertheless he also again warned China 'of the need to make early progress
on the human rights front' if the annual battle over the renewal of most
favoured nation trading status was to be avoided.
The US yesterday called on Pacific countries to co-operate in a programme of
simplification and harmonisation of customs regulations in order to reduce
obstacles to trade, Alexander Nicoll reports from Seattle.
Mr Ronald Noble, assistant treasury secretary for enforcement, told a
customs-trade symposium that such measures would not undermine national
sovereignty. They would recognise that Asia/Pacific countries, although they
had differences, were 'neighbours with more that unites us than divides us.'
The symposium was being held by Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation, the
15-member grouping which holds its annual ministerial meeting in Seattle
this week, to be followed on Friday and Saturday by an informal summit of
Apec leaders.
Mr Noble called for a four-part programme to:
Repeal obsolete laws so that customs procedures conform with current
business practices.
Introduce uniform standards in areas such as safety and packaging in which
national laws often created barriers designed to protect domestic markets.
Such standards would ensure that legitimate health and safety concerns were
still protected.
Co-operate on systems procedures and data exchange.
Work together to eliminate trade fraud in areas such as counterfeit
trademarks and falsification of country of origin to evade Multi-Fibre
Arrangement quotas.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WWF-World Wide Fund for Nature yesterday called on the Apec summit to
ensure any new trade arrangements reflect environmental considerations from
the start.
Addressing environmental degradation as an afterthought was short-sighted,
as had been amply demonstrated by the North American Free Trade Agreement
and the Uruguay Round of Gatt trade talks, the Swiss-based environmental
organisation said .
Nafta negotiators were obliged to negotiate sub-optimal side agreements
later and these 'remain a source of dispute'. Uruguay Round negotiators
'have frequently claimed the initial omission of environmental issues cannot
be rectified later', according to Mr Charles Arden-Clarke, WWF policy
analyst.
The WWF is urging Apec to seek ways of making trade and environment policies
mutually supportive, as agreed at the UN 'Earth Summit' in Brazil last year.

FT  16 NOV 93 / World Trade News: 'Chaos' if Uruguay Round fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HARROGATE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE failure of the Uruguay Round next month would mean 'lurking chaos', Mr
Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Trade and
Tariffs, said yesterday.
In a speech to the British CBI conference in Harrogate, Mr Sutherland warned
of a return of the economic conditions which provoked the 1930s depression
and the second world war.
The deadline of December 15 was final, Mr Sutherland said. 'When I say the
end I mean the end. No further chances are going to be offered negotiators
and world leaders this time. The political and legal chemistry allows for no
further adjournment.'
Failure in December would not mean the status quo being maintained in trade
policies or growth, he said. 'We will be on a very slippery slope indeed,
and there will be no multilateral system of sufficient weight and
credibility to stop the world sliding into a mire of protectionism and lost
economic opportunity.
'I fear that it would provoke the kind of tensions which led us in the late
1920s from economic nationalism through high tariffs and competitive
devaluations in the Great Depression of the 1930s. Some say these tensions
led us ultimately into the second world war.'
Mr Sutherland appealed to the US and European Union to give a lead. 'They
have been lecturing the world since the last war,' he said. 'It is perhaps
an irony that they are the ones we have to call upon to deliver the
(Uruguay) Round today. The developing world now seems convinced of the need
for an open trading system.
'The EU and US have to recognise that purely domestically enforced
anti-dumping rules without any oversight or objective control is a slippery
slope to unilateralism and the law of the jungle. If that's what we want for
international trade, we will pay a heavy price.'
Tomorrow's US Congress vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement was
important for Gatt, he said. 'Beyond the immediate economic consequences for
the three countries involved, the potential knock-on effects of a loss of
Nafta would not be good for the Uruguay Round. If the protectionists taste
blood on Nafta on one side of the Atlantic, is there not a risk that it
would incite those on the other, and even further afield?'
He rejected calls for a compromise by which the most contentious areas such
as agriculture could be left on one side.

FT  16 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Mirroring the rise of Pacific nations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASIA Pacific Economic Co-operation, the grouping holding its annual
ministerial meeting in Seattle this week, was founded four years ago at the
suggestion of Australia.
Its aim is to increase multilateral co-operation in view of the economic
rise of Pacific nations and growing interdependence within the region. The
US was keen to head off any moves to create Asian groupings from which it
would be excluded.
This year, for the first time, leaders of most member states will attend an
informal summit at the invitation of President Bill Clinton after the
ministerial meeting is concluded.
Original Apec members were Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea, New
Zealand and the US, together with the six members of the Association of
South-east Asian Nations: Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore and Thailand. Two years ago, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan were
admitted simultaneously. Other countries, including Papua New Guinea and
Mexico, are seeking to join.
Chairmanship of Apec is held for a year in rotation. After the Seattle
meeting, the chair will pass to Indonesia.
This year, an Apec secretariat was set up in Singapore with an executive
director whose nationality will also change annually.
Apec also has 10 working groups covering data in investment and trade, trade
promotion, investment and industrial science and technology, human resources
development, energy co-operation, marine resource conservation,
telecommunications, transport, tourism, and fisheries.

FT  16 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Beijing responds to Clinton's change of
approach - Seattle meeting reflects China's delight that the US is to stop
preaching and start talking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAT Mr Bill Clinton and Mr Jiang Zemin should meet this week on friendly
terms is a remarkable turn of events which could help to end a turbulent
period in Sino-American relations.
Deep divisions will certainly remain between the US and Chinese presidents
on issues such as human rights and trade. But Beijing's welcome for Mr
Clinton's abrupt decision this autumn to stop preaching to China and start
talking instead has set the stage for a possible lessening of friction in
some important areas.
The two men are due to meet in Seattle at the end of the week during the
informal meeting of Pacific leaders which follows the annual ministerial
gathering of the 15-member Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation group.
The rapid growth of China's economy, trade and investment is a central
element of the development of the influence of the Asia/Pacific region. It
is raising China's status as a world power and attracting massive interest
from US companies, which could suffer heavily from a sharp deterioration of
relations. Such a worsening seemed well under way as little as three months
ago.
Relations have been tense since Washington imposed sanctions on Beijing
after the June 1989 massacre of demonstrators in Tiananmen Square by Chinese
troops.
President George Bush pursued a minimalist approach to China policy which
both irked Beijing and failed to satisfy either the US critics of Chinese
human rights policy or those who favoured closer engagement.
As part of his failed bid for re-election, he allowed the sale of military
aircraft to Taiwan in order to preserve American jobs.
Mr Clinton, who had pledged to stop 'coddling' Beijing, faced conflicting
demands. On the one hand, the human rights lobby expected him to fulfil his
campaign promise by revoking China's Most Favoured Nation trading status. On
the other, a large number of American experts on China in academia, the
military and business saw it as vital to US interests to develop a broader
and more constructive relationship with Beijing.
Mr Clinton proceeded to make a series of moves which angered Beijing.
He placed conditions on MFN renewal in 1994 including 'overall, significant
progress by China' in human rights. In particular, he wants to see progress
towards implementation of a joint memorandum aimed at preventing exports of
goods manufactured in Chinese prisons, and passports being made available to
all Chinese citizens who are entitled to them. China rejects any linking of
trade and human rights.
Washington also imposed sanctioned on Beijing over alleged sales of missiles
to Pakistan, and then shadowed a Chinese ship which it suspected of carrying
poison gas ingredients to the US. An inspection found no trace and China
demanded an apology.
Other factors in the deterioration included US opposition to Beijing's
unsuccessful bid to host the 2000 Olympics, and China's arrest of dissidents
and journalists, its failure to re-admit a dissident, and its explosion of a
nuclear device in defiance of US requests not to carry out further testing.
Then came Mr Clinton's about-face, which followed a review of policy led by
his national security adviser, Mr Anthony Lake. Since October, US officials
have been talking of the need for 'engagement' with China. A cabinet member
as well as senior human rights, trade and defence officials have visited
Beijing and more such trips are planned.
US officials say the aim is not to reduce US pressure over human rights,
nuclear proliferation and trade but to make them part of a broader
relationship in which efforts are made to build trust and understanding.
Mr Mike Espy, the agriculture secretary, said in Beijing: 'You can't preach
and criticise standing 7,000 miles away. You have to engage on a more
personal level. I assured all the officials with whom we met that the visits
to China by the Clinton administration at very high levels would increase.'
China has responded positively to the US initiative. Mr Jiang accepted Mr
Clinton's invitation to Seattle, and China has termed the bilateral meeting
a summit. Mr Li Peng, the premier, said that 'a meeting between top leaders
of the two countries itself is a good thing and is of great significance.'
The latest sign of detente came last week when Mr Qian Qichen, foreign
minister, said China was prepared to discuss allowing the International
Committee of the Red Cross to visit Chinese prisons.
The US State Department responded: 'Access to Chinese prisons by the ICRC
would certainly be an important factor in determining whether or not there
has been overall significant progress in human rights.' Meanwhile, the US is
considering whether to cancel the sanctions imposed over sales to Pakistan.
US officials caution that Mr Clinton still faces pressures which could force
him to revoke MFN, despite the consequences for US trade and investment, if
his conditions are not met. Small gains made recently in talks with Beijing
on individual issues, particularly over trade, coupled with the overall
visible improvement in social conditions in China, have to be set against
strong feelings in Washington about human rights.
A US official says: 'Lots of congressmen do believe that this (MFN) is not
the right instrument to use. But Clinton is a domestic president and he
would not put his domestic programmes at risk for foreign policy
considerations when the result would be to lose the support of significant
numbers of members of Congress.'
However, both US and Chinese officials believe sufficient groundwork has
been done, albeit in a short time, for this week's meeting to mark a new
phase of a long-standing love-hate relationship. Mr Wu Jianmin, Foreign
Ministry spokesman in Beijing, says: 'We believe that to address the
differences between China and the US it is necessary to increase contacts.
The difficulties should not hamper co-operation.'

FT  16 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Spectacular rise in regional trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE gathering of Pacific leaders and ministers in Seattle this week
underlines the growing economic importance of Asian countries for the rest
of the world and for one another.
Not only has trade of Asian countries with other regions of the world been
growing much faster than elsewhere, the acceleration of trade by Asian
countries with one another is spectacular - albeit from a low base.
Meanwhile, investment has poured into the region - with the most recent
surge into China. Again, investment by Asian countries in their neighbours
has been increasingly important, first with more advanced countries such as
Japan, South Korea and Taiwan shifting their manufacturing capacity to South
East Asia, and now with all regional countries - and especially their ethnic
Chinese communities - investing in China.
According to World Bank figures, the growth of exports from the US and the
European Community to East Asia/Pacific countries averaged 11 per cent and
10.1 per cent respectively in the years between 1981 and 1991. These rates
were well above the 5.5 per cent average annual growth in overall US exports
and 5.2 per cent growth in exports of EC countries.
In return East Asian/Pacific countries increased their exports to the US by
7.8 per cent and to the EC by 9.4 per cent annually. The growth of trade
between East Asia/Pacific countries was much higher at an average 14.3 per
cent.
The growth of East Asian economies has pushed up income per head to an
average Dollars 650 (Pounds 430) compared with Dollars 320 in South Asia,
although this figure masks wide gaps, with some countries overtaking
industrialised nations in GNP per capita while others are still very poor.
Economists at international financing institutions say that despite Asia's
economic growth, poverty still remains the region's number one problem. It
will take many more years of rapid growth, and consistent policies to erase
it.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Argentina's president eyes a second term: Mr Menem's hope of
changing the constitution has come a step closer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DEAL with an old rival has improved President Carlos Menem's chances of
standing for re-election when his term ends in July 1995.
Mr Menem signed an agreement at a Sunday evening summit with his predecessor
Mr Raul Alfonsn, now leader of the opposition Radical party. In return for
Mr Alfonsn's promise of Radical support for a lifting of the ban on
successive presidential terms, Mr Menem will abandon a plebiscite scheduled
for next Sunday on constitutional reform.
Opinion polls say the government would have taken 65-68 per cent of votes,
leaving the Radicals with another crushing defeat, their fifth since 1987.
Despite the disastrous end to his 1983-89 term as president, when
hyperinflation forced him from office five months early, Mr Alfonsn remains
the only Radical leader of national stature. He clearly hopes to be the
candidate to challenge Mr Menem in 1995.
The Peronists dominate the Senate, which has already voted two-thirds in
favour of changing the constitution. But the Peronists lack a majority in
the lower chamber of deputies, making an agreement with the Radicals
essential.
The salient points of the accord are:
Changing the constitution to allow re-election of the president for a second
term. The six-year term to be cut to four years.
Creation of a 'co-ordinating minister' - or prime minister - as link between
government and congress. Mr Menem yesterday said he would offer a Radical
this job.
Greater independence of the judiciary. Selection of judges to be by
independent panel, not by government. Opposition politicians would head
semi-autonomous bodies like the audit office, whose independence would be
entrenched in the constitution.
Curbing the president's right to issue decrees with force of law.
Reform of the constitution along these lines is far from a fait accompli. Mr
Alfonsn must still deliver the Radical vote he promised Mr Menem, and last
night Mr Menem said he might still hold a plebiscite if the Radical party
reneged on the deal.
Assuming Mr Alfonsn can rally the required support, elections must be held
for the constituent assembly that would write the new constitutional text.
Some observers worry the assembly could declare itself sovereign and exceed
the terms of the Menem-Alfonsn accord.
Mr Menem's unquestioned control of the Peronist machine ensures he would be
its candidate in 1995 and his current high standing in the polls would make
him almost assured of a second term. Furthermore, his deal with Mr Alfonsn
may further divide the already fractured and demoralised Radicals.
Radicals say the agreement could actually strengthen their chances of
victory in 1995. Some believe the government's market-oriented economic
policies will unravel soon, making Mr Menem an easier opponent than other
Peronists.
Younger Radicals hope another electoral defeat would sweep Mr Alfonsn's old
guard from the scene, allowing a younger generation to win the 1999
elections.
The business community is divided. Some say Argentina's political immaturity
requires Mr Menem to stay in office until 1999 to maintain economic reform.
Others want a smooth handover to a new administration that would maintain
his economic policies.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Puerto Rico seeks closer US links
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Miguel Hernandez Agosto, leader of Puerto Rico's opposition Popular
Democratic party, is to ask the US Congress to expand the island's
'commonwealth' link with the US by increasing tax incentives for industry,
removing limits on food stamps and imposing tariffs to protect agriculture.
This follows Sunday's referendum in which Puerto Ricans indicated by a slim
margin that they favoured an enhancement of their current quasi-colonial
ties with the US, rather than becoming the 51st state of the union. The
third option of political independence was soundly rejected.
Figures published yesterday by the State Elections Commission indicated that
the commonwealth option received 48.4 per cent of the 1.7m votes cast,
statehood was supported by 46.2 per cent and independence by 4.4 per cent.
The result was a setback for Mr Pedro Rossello, the island's governor, whose
incumbent New Progressive party advocated statehood.
'The people have spoken on status and I heed the result,' Mr Rossello said.
'It was my commitment to hold this plebiscite, and I assume full
responsibility for its results.' The governor said he would pursue his
government's programmes based on the mandate he received in last year's
election.
Mr Agosto said he would begin negotiations soon with congressional leaders
in Washington to extend and make permanent tax incentives which have brought
mainland manufacturing companies to the island, but which are subject to
frequent review and changes in Washington.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Mexico cuts 1993 growth forecast to 1.1%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S government has cut its estimate for economic growth this year to
just 1.1 per cent, while forecasting 3 per cent expansion next year,
according to figures released in the annual budget.
The budget sets out a conservative macroeconomic policy for the year ahead,
geared towards achieving the modest pick-up in growth and a 5 per cent
inflation rate. The budget document expects inflation this year to end up at
7.7 per cent .
The government plans to run a balanced budget in 1994, from an expected
surplus of 1 per cent of GDP this year, and says monetary and exchange rate
policy will continue to be directed towards price stabilisation. Net debt as
a proportion of GDP is expected to fall below the current level of 21 per
cent.
The forecast for this year's growth is lower than most private sector
estimates, and suggests the government expects the sharp slowdown in the
second quarter to have continued throughout the year.
The government blames the weak growth on industrial restructuring that
Mexico's private sector is going through in order to compete in world
markets.
The government said that with or without the North American Free Trade
Agreement, Mexico's opening to trade would be maintained and consolidated.
It claimed that the impact of the agreement would only be felt in the long
term, although most economists expected approval of the treaty to increase
short-term growth.
This year's low economic growth helped contain the current account deficit,
which is expected to reach 5.4 per cent of GDP this year, or about Dollars
19.5bn. Next year, the current account deficit is forecast to fall to 5 per
cent of GDP, in absolute terms a little more than this year.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Inquiry ordered into New Jersey poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FEDERAL judge and the state attorney general yesterday ordered
investigations into the possible suppression of the black vote in the
governor's election in New Jersey two weeks ago.
It was not immediately clear if the investigations would call into question
the validity of the election, in which Mrs Christine Todd Whitman, the
Republican candidate, ousted Governor James Florio, the Democratic
incumbent, by a mere 2 percentage points.
But at least one prominent black civil rights organisation in the state has
urged the new governor not to take office in January as scheduled but to
wait until the results of the investigations are known.
The judge, sitting in Newark, yesterday ordered that Mr Ed Rollins, Mrs
Whitman's campaign manager, testify under oath about post-election
interviews in which he asserted that the campaign had paid up to Dollars
500,000 (Pounds 330,000) to assorted black ministers in implicit return for
their not exhorting their parishioners to vote for Mr Florio.
Under pressure from Mrs Whitman, Mr Rollins subsequently retracted his
statement and apologised for any offence. Later the Whitman campaign issued
figures showing that about Dollars 48,000 had been disbursed on election day
in what is known as 'street money' to poll watchers and others working to
get out the vote.
Mrs Whitman herself spent part of Sunday visiting black churches. Though she
spoke at none of them, her attendance was obviously designed to make amends.
At the very least, she would be starting her term under a cloud.
She beat Mr Florio by about 30,000 votes in a total turnout of around 2.5m,
the second closest governor's race in New Jersey history. The black
component amounted to about 8 per cent of the vote, down from the 12 per
cent of the 1989 election, a decline in numerical terms far greater than her
margin of victory given the usually overwhelming black preference for
Democratic candidates.
Mr Rollins, meanwhile, is in seclusion and, according to several reports, in
disgrace, with several lucrative TV contracts summarily withdrawn. Just 10
days ago this veteran Republican political consultant, who briefly defected
to Mr Ross Perot's independent presidential candidacy last year, appeared
thoroughly rehabilitated.
Not only had he directed Mrs Whitman to a come-from-behind victory but he
had in the process vanquished in head-to-head confrontation the hottest
manager in the business - Mr James Carville, campaign director for Mr Florio
and, last year, for Mr Bill Clinton.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Figures show US growth accelerating: Biggest rise in output
since last November
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US factory output rose a sharp 0.8 per cent in October, providing further
evidence of the accelerating pace of US economic growth.
In its most buoyant assessment of industrial trends since late last year,
the Federal Reserve yesterday also said output rose 4.4 per cent in the year
to October, and revised figures for September to show a gain 0.4 per cent
rather than the 0.2 per cent initially reported.
Output was boosted by a vigorous rebound in production of motor vehicles and
parts, which rose 3.9 per cent in September and 7.3 per cent in October
after four months of stagnation.
The rise in overall production - the largest since November last year -
exceeded Wall Street forecasts but prompted little reaction in share prices
as investors awaited the outcome of tomorrow's congressional vote on the
North American Free Trade Agreement.
The Fed also reported a sharp rise in the rate of industrial capacity
utilisation to 82.4 per cent, the highest rate since the peak of the
previous business cycle in mid-1990. Capacity utilisation is now 0.5
percentage points higher than its long-run average, which is one reason why
some investors fear upward pressure on inflation.
'The figures are consistent with economic growth at an annual rate of 4 per
cent in the current quarter,' said Mr Richard Berner, chief economist at
Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
However, growth was likely to decelerate early next year because 'job growth
was not sufficient to support the current very strong growth of consumer
spending'. The sustainable annual pace of growth was only 2.5-2.75 per cent,
he said.
The surge in vehicle production is likely to be temporary partly because it
reflects a rebound at General Motors, the largest US car company, following
weakness during the summer when production was depressed by disputes with
parts suppliers.
Excluding vehicles industrial production rose 0.4 per cent last month and
0.3 per cent in September.
However, production of durable goods generally was strong, reflecting recent
falls in long-term interest rates.
Production of consumer durables other than cars rose 1.3 per cent last
month; production of information-processing equipment was up 0.9 per cent.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Top China meeting 'falls a bit flat'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S just-ended Central Committee meeting was billed the most important
since the 1978 party plenum which launched the country's reform drive, but a
bland communique issued after four days' talks provided little substance.
The tone of the communique, which contented itself with repeating
well-established positions, has fuelled speculation about divisions in the
leadership over the pace and scope of economic reform.
Delays in releasing a promised 50-article manifesto of reform suggest
further discussion is required, hence the lack of detail in the statement
and the conspicuous absence of supporting documents.
A Western official in Beijing said the much-heralded third plenary session
of the 14th Central Committee appeared to have 'fallen a bit flat.' There
appears to be 'quite a lot more sorting out to do,' the official added.
Among contentious issues debated in closed session by the 182-member
committee were those dealing with a new federal-style tax regime to divide
revenues between the centre and the provinces, and a re-definition of the
limits on reform of faltering state enterprises to facilitate a process of
corporatisation and privatisation.
Both these issues are certain to have produced some sharp exchanges among
China's rulers. Provincial leaders are wary about allowing Beijing to
strengthen its grip on the purse strings through far-reaching reforms of the
tax system.
A state enterprise lobby is nervous about proposed reforms of the public
sector, fearing that additional pressures on faltering industries will drive
many into bankruptcy and cause widespread unemployment and social unrest.
Many officials also owe their party status to their association with
industries which are having difficulty adapting to the demands of a market
economy. These officials are fighting to preserve their fiefdoms.
Western officials say it is premature to judge the importance of this latest
party plenum until supporting documents have been released, but they add the
delays show there are significant pockets of resistance to the reformers
such as Mr Zhu Rongji, senior vice-premier in charge of the economy.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Corporate bankruptcies increase as demand sinks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORPORATE bankruptcies in Japan are rising steadily, as consumer and
industrial demand continues to sink, the latest economic statistics say.
The number and size of corporate casualties rose from September to October,
but are still well down on the same period last year, according to two
credit research agencies yesterday.
Bankrupt companies' unpaid debts rose 12.2 per cent to Y485.8bn (Pounds 3bn)
from September to October, according to Tokyo Commerce and Industry. But the
total, up for the third month running, was 39 per cent less than October
last year.
Teikoku Databank, another credit researcher, recorded a 6.2 per cent rise to
1,258 in the number of bankruptcies, the second highest since the turn of
the year.
Both agencies believe business collapses will worsen in the next few months
because the recession shows no signs of abating. Neither survey includes the
collapse two weeks ago of Muramoto Construction, the largest post-war
financial failure, with debts put by Teikoku at Y590bn.
Another sign of the economy's weakness came yesterday with a 4.5 per cent
year-on-year fall in domestic orders for industrial machinery in the six
months to September.
Orders overall, at home and overseas, were stagnant, up 0.2 per cent to
Y3,238bn. But that was entirely because of a rise in contracts to build oil
and chemicals plants in the Middle East and sales of power generation
equipment in south-east Asia, said Japan Society of Industrial Machinery
Manufacturers.
Consumer spending continues to slide, according to the Japan Department
Stores Association. Department store sales in Tokyo, a bellwether of
national consumer sentiment, fell for the 20th month running in October.
Sales declined by 10.4 per cent last month from October last year, said the
association. The decline took place in all departments, though association
officials said consumers were still attracted by cheaper goods.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Palestinians, Israel start economic talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAELI and Palestinian economists were set to begin talks in Paris last
night to determine economic relations between Israel and the new Palestinian
self-governing authority which will take over administration of the Gaza
Strip and West Bank area of Jericho next year.
Mr Avraham Shochat, Israeli finance minister, was expected to meet Mr Ahmed
Qurie (Abu Ala), PLO economics chief, for the first face-to-face economic
negotiations since the two sides signed the historic Israeli-Palestinian
peace accord two months ago.
Among issues to be discussed are an Israeli proposal for a customs union and
harmonisation of customs duties and taxes, rules on trade between the two
entities, migrant Palestinian labour to Israel, the tax regime of the
'autonomy', aid and development projects and currency, and banking and
financial sector policies.
The meetings coincide with resumed talks in Cairo on Israeli withdrawal from
Gaza-Jericho, seeking to define the territorial delimitation of 'Jericho'
and agree how many Israeli troops can remain in Gaza to protect up to 5,000
Jewish settlers. The economic agreements and all matters on the withdrawal
from Gaza-Jericho must be agreed in a protocol in less than four weeks.
At the heart of the Paris talks, which begin formally this morning, is the
customs union. Israel wants the Palestinians to accept one, along with
harmonisation of all external customs and taxes. The Palestinians have
criticised the proposal, saying adopting Israel's customs duties would make
consumer goods too expensive for Palestinians, with a per capita income of
Dollars 1,500 (Pounds 993)-Dollars 1,800, against Israel's Dollars 13,000.
Israel has warned that if the Palestinians reject a customs union, the
Israelis would have to put heavy controls on border crossings to stop cheap
untaxed goods passing from the Palestinian economy into Israel.
The Israelis also want curbs on Palestinian exports into Israel of farm
products such as eggs and poultry. The Palestinians say any such curbs would
result in Palestinians taking measures against Israel's industrial exports.
The Palestinians will focus their demands on winning greater access for
Palestinian migrant labourers to the Israeli economy and on better terms for
those workers. Israel and the PLO have expressed considerable scepticism
about the possibility to bridging the wide gap on these issues.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Reform deal fails in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of Japan's coalition government and the opposition Liberal
Democratic party failed to reach agreement on electoral reforms early today,
setting the scene for a parliamentary showdown that could again shake the
country's political system.
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa met Mr Yohei Kono, the LDP leader, for two
hours in an attempt to resolve disputes over proposed legislation, but the
two leaders were left far apart on important sections of four bills intended
to clean up Japanese politics.
'It's very disappointing,' Mr Hosokawa said. 'We have given them a lot of
time to discuss these things.'
Mr Hosokawa has indicated that he will resign if reforms are not introduced
by the end of the year, and his coalition needs to have the bills passed by
the Lower House of Japanese parliament this week if the prime minister is to
keep to his timetable.
He said that unless the LDP was prepared to make concessions, the coalition
would break with tradition and attempt to push the bills through the
parliament without reaching prior consensus with the opposition.
The meeting of the two leaders was seen as a last attempt to settle disputes
amicably, and while Mr Kono said the discussions were 'useful', Mr Hosokawa
said the LDP had failed to respond to the government's offer of concessions.
Even before the meeting, the Nikkei average lost 2.3 per cent, partly on
fears that if the reform bills do not pass through the lower house in the
next few days, there will be big delays in decisions over measures to boost
the economy.
The government wants the present scandal-prone multi-seat constituency
system to be replaced by a mix of single seats and proportional
representation, with 250 representatives chosen through each method, making
a total of 500 members in the Lower House.
However, Mr Hosokawa offered to have 274 seats chosen through small
constituencies, bringing the government closer to the LDP demand for 300
single-seat representatives, which should favour it as the largest party. Mr
Kono, under pressure from party elders, rejected the government offer.
'I don't think there is much more we can do. We have offered concessions,'
Mr Hosokawa said.
Both sides fear a compromise could provoke a split in their own ranks.
Government concessions to the LDP's demands for a higher proportion of
single-seat constituencies might anger the Social Democratic party, largest
partner in the seven-party coalition. Socialists feel they will do best
under proportional representation.
The LDP's Mr Kono fears losing young reform-minded politicians to the
coalition if he fails to make a contribution to reform. Several older LDP
members could abstain if the party leans too far to reform, for fear of
losing their seats.

FT  16 NOV 93 / UK generator in Rs30bn Indian power station venture

<TEXT>
NATIONAL Power, the UK generating company, and Ashok Leyland, the Indian
operating company of the London-based Hinduja trading company, are due today
to sign a memorandum of understanding for a Rs30bn (Pounds 645m) power
station project in India.
The agreement is expected to be a commercial highlight of a two-day visit to
India by Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, who has made the trip
partly to promote Indo-British trade and investment.
The UK and India have put a high priority on strengthening commercial links
since Mr John Major, British prime minister, visited Delhi earlier this
year, and together with Mr P V Narasimha Rao, his Indian counterpart,
launched the Indo-British Partnership Initiative, a forum for boosting
business ties.
Mr Hurd yesterday met Mr Rao and other ministers and discussed subjects
including economic ties and the troubled northern Indian state of Kashmir.
He also exchanged documents for the ratification of an extradition treaty.
Today Mr Hurd is due to travel to Bombay, India's commercial capital, where
he planned to address an audience of leading British and Indian businessmen
aboard the Royal yacht Britannia, which has sailed to India to help promote
a week of British-linked business events in Bombay.
The agreement between National Power and Ashok Leyland is for a 1,000 MW
coal-fired power station at Visakhapatnam in the central Indian state of
Andhra Pradesh. The project is one of 46 which private investors have put
forward since the Indian government last year opened up the power sector to
private capital in an effort to alleviate widespread electricity shortages.
However government officials and the promoters of various projects have yet
to settle important issues such as the terms of agreements for financing,
fuel purchases and electricity sales.
While National Power and Ashok Leyland have made more progress with their
scheme than many others, the project has still to be finalised.

MR Paul Keating, Australian prime minister, yesterday called on the nation
to use high court recognition of Aborigines' land rights as 'an opportunity
to transcend the history of dispossession' for Australia's indigenous
people.
In a rare televised address to the country, Mr Keating - who has taken a
large personal role in negotiations between the government and Aborigine
leaders over the highly-contentious native title issue - said that
Australians could not ignore the matter, either 'legally or morally'.
However, he provided no advance details of the government's bill on
Aboriginal land rights, which is due to be introduced into parliament later
this week, possibly today.
The proposed legislation follows a High Court ruling last year, which did
away with the notion that Australia was uninhabited before European
settlement and said native title could exist where there had been 'close and
continuing' association with the land.
Despite Mr Keating's claims that there needed to be a national standard for
land rights determination, the recalcitrant Western Australian government
maintained its opposition to the federal package yesterday. Western
Australia is the area most likely to be affected by the land rights
legislation. In theory, about 40 per cent of the state could be subject to
native title claims.
Mr Richard Court, the Western Australia's premier, threatened to speed the
passage of his own state's rival land rights legislation if the commonwealth
denied full public and parliamentary debate on the federal legislation.
The Western Australia government has already published a bill which would
extinguish native title, but recognise in law the rights to 'traditional
usage' of the land by Aboriginal people. Mr Court has been emphatic that the
states should retain control of land management, and should not be
constrained by any commonwealth measures.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Cocom: a brute turned super sleuth - Plans to abandon a web
of controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COCOM'S historic role of economic attrition against the Soviet Union and its
allies, and of blocking their access to military technology, will be
formally swept aside this week.
In The Hague today, the 17 members of the Co-ordinating Committee on
Multilateral Export Controls are expected to unveil their plans for a more
flexible successor institution.
Former targets of the Cocom regime, notably Russia and China, are likely to
be invited to join the new body, with its focus now turning to countries
such as North Korea, Cuba, Iran, Iraq and Libya.
The dramatic emergence of Iraq as a global security threat with a potential
nuclear capability, during and after the Gulf war, was as important in
forcing change as the dismantling of the Berlin Wall.
As one UK-based academic noted, this brought into sharp focus the fact that
Cocom and its sister bodies dealing with nuclear proliferation, chemical
weapons, and missile technology had - in their obsessive concern with the
Soviet block - allowed a number of militarily threatening third world
countries to slip through the net.
They were shaken by the use of chemical weapons by Iraq in its war with
Iran, and by the scale on which they threw ballistic missiles at each other:
over 1,000 were fired during the Iran-Iraq war.
They were also shocked to learn - on the defection of an Iraqi engineer
after the apparently successful Operation Desert Storm - of the extent of
Iraq's nuclear weapons programme, and the capacity which remained intact at
the end of the war.
Such discoveries have led to calls for new ways of identifying threatening
activity, and of detecting potential mis-use of dual-technology goods.
In prospect is a lighter set of nationally-enforced arrangements which will
lift regulation from a large number of products on the existing Cocom lists
of restricted exports. They will reduce the paper work and delay in
obtaining licences where they remain necessary. But they will improve
information-sharing arrangements, alerting governments more quickly to the
emergence of suspicious buying activity.
At the heart of the new regime against proliferation will be demands for
comprehensive export control arrangements, and effective enforcement.
'In France, Germany, Japan, the UK and the US, revelations about illegal or
indiscreet exports to threatening states brought public debate that led to a
reconsideration and tightening of export controls,' said Mr Gary Bertsch and
Mr Richard Cupitt from the University of Georgia in a wide-ranging paper on
non-proliferation in the Washington Quarterly.
They call for a 'new typology' to deal with the more-fluid post-Cold war
alliances. This would distinguish between co-ordinating states,
collaborating states, sensitive states, threatening states and peripheral
states.
They note that while Russia is currently a collaborating state, 'one can
easily imagine developments that might move it into the category of
sensitive or threatening states'. New arrangements will need to cope with
this 'extreme flux'.
One of the greatest challenges of the new regime will be to marshal
proliferation through former Soviet republics such as Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Georgia, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and
Uzbekistan.
'Most of these states are racked by internal and external conflict, and are
not in a position to put export controls in place even if they intend to,'
the Georgia academics note. Given the pressure on them to earn hard currency
by exporting arms, and their 'porous' borders with Russia, preventing
leakage of sensitive technologies through this region presents the new Cocom
with formidable challenges.
'Export controls are only likely to delay the acquisition of critical
dual-use technologies if a state is determined to acquire them,' the
academics note. 'Unless the US and its co-ordinating allies address the
demand for weapons of mass destruction and dual-use technologies, and
pressures to supply those demands, non-proliferation policy will be
incomplete.'
Cocom officials are pressing for improved channels of information to
identify at least four facts: the end use of any exported commodity; the
location of the end user; possible sensitive applications; and possible
re-exports.
'We will be looking for a matrix of suspicious information,' one
London-based official said. In place of Cocom, 'a brutal thing that brutally
succeeded', she predicted that 'the new regime will be more gentle - an
education process, pooling information and trying to discern patterns and
trends to detect an emergent threat'.
For those exporters who for decades have been frustrated by cumbersome and
time-consuming Cocom licencing rules, such changes should be welcome. 'We
will be controlling hardly anything anymore,' said the Cocom official,
predicting that licences will in future be needed on just 5 per cent of
those products currently on the Cocom list.

OCTOBER price rises pushed Spain's year-on-year 'headline' inflation up by
0.1 per cent to 4.6 per cent, reversing the downward trend of recent months,
despite the country's continuing recession and high unemployment.
However, the economy ministry said October's rise was 'transitory' and
stressed the fall in the year-on-year underlying inflation index, which
excludes volatile energy and non-processed food prices, from 5.4 per cent to
5.3 per cent, the lowest underlying level since May 1988.
Food prices in October last year were unusually low, and kept the October
1992 rise down to 0.1 per cent.
The ministry said October figures nevertheless stressed that Spain's
inflation-prone economy required structural reforms to deregulate the labour
market and the services sector as well as an agreement on wage restraint.
The worst figures facing the government concern unemployment. Registered
jobless rose by 95,969 in October, the highest monthly rise since 1982, said
the National Employment Institute, to total 2.6m or 17.2 per cent of the
working population.

AMNESTY International, the human rights organisation, said yesterday it had
received a large number of complaints of torture and ill-treatment of
detainees by Portuguese police and prison service officers.
'It is unusual and highly disturbing to receive such a large number of
allegations from a European (Union) member.'
It said the most common forms of alleged ill-treatment were repeated kicks,
punches, kneeing, pistol-whipping and beatings with truncheons. Detainees
have also reported beatings with rubber and flexible metal hosepipes. Others
have claimed to have had objects forced into the anus and to have been
threatened with physical - including sexual - assault.
Portugal will answer the charges in Geneva today before the UN Committee
against Torture. Mr Fernando Duarte, Portugal's director of prison services,
said the treatment of prisoners had greatly improved and there had been no
fresh allegations of ill-treatment in recent years.
'Public service officers from all branches of law enforcement and prison
services are acting with virtual impunity - despite the Portuguese
government's voluntary accession to the UN Convention against Torture in
1989,' Amnesty said.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Warring Tajiks slide to economic collapse: A second winter
of civil strife in the absence of energy and hard currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Tajik people do not yet have an everyday word for 'economic collapse.'
In the coming months, however, they may need to invent one.
As Tajikistan enters the second winter of a civil war that has claimed up to
100,000 lives, out of a population of 5m, and left many more homeless, the
republic, which was once one of the most pleasant in the Soviet Union, has
become one of the most tragic.
As an international aid worker based in the capital Dushanbe says: 'Because
the western TV cameras haven't been here, the rest of the world has been
ignoring it. But what's happened here is as bad as Georgia - and in some
ways parts of Bosnia as well.'
The current Tajik government, stung by these comments, are at pains to point
out that the worst may be over. After a year of bitter fighting between the
government and opposition, the rebels have mostly been pushed south to
Afghanistan, and the gunbattles confined to the border and eastern
mountains.
Some 50,000 refugees have returned to their homes, and two-thirds of the
cotton crop, and most of the grain, has been salvaged.
But fighting may flare up as snow pushes the rebels down from their mountain
hideouts, and a political solution is still nowhere in sight.
Even by the standards of the former Soviet Union, the battle in Tajikistan
has been viciously convoluted. Although both sides have been quick to use
'anti-Communist' and 'anti-Islamic fundamentalist' tags, the issue at stake
has not been ideology, or even nationalism, so much as regional rivalries.
On one side is a shaky alliance of the Tajiks from the Kulyab and Khodjent
regions, heirs to the former Communist regime and the government. On the
other side are the people of the south-west and Garm regions, who overthrew
the Communists 18 months ago, but were then overthrown by Russian and Uzbek
backed troops.
The government and Russians label the opposition 'Islamic Fundamentalist,'
and claim they are supported by international Islamic groups - a claim given
credence by western intelligence sources, who say not only are Afghan
leaders such as Gulbuddin Hekmatyar involved, but also groups in Pakistan
and Iran.
'The key to the conflict is in Afghanistan. The fundamentalists there have
managed to use Tajikistan for their work,' says Mr Abdulmalik Abduladjanov,
Tajik prime minister.
In practice, though, the opposition includes not just Islamic groups, but
also secular democrats taking refuge in Moscow, the people of Pamir in the
east, which is pushing for independence from Tajikstan, and a huge number of
apolitical Tajiks.
Mr Abduladjanov says he is willing to negotiate with the rebels. But after a
year of suffering atrocities and ethnic cleansing, the rebels seem set on a
revenge in arms.
'We have bases across the country and all the strength we need,' says Mullah
Davlat Usmon, military 'minister' in the opposition, in his stronghold in
Pamir.
Time may be on their side. Resentment on the part of the Khodjentis, the
former soviet era leaders, at the Kulyabis' new power is threatening the
government alliance. And though the rebels are no match for the Russian
peacekeeping troops stationed on the border, their guerrilla campaign is
steadily pushing the country into economic crisis.
With 93 per cent of the republic covered with mountains, Tajikistan has
never been rich - in Soviet days it sent its cotton and minerals to Russia,
receiving energy supplies and some 80 per cent of its budget subsidies.
However, the war has now left it critically short of energy and hard
currency. The capital, Dushanbe, is virtually without heating, and
electricity in much of the country is erratic. There is virtually no air
service, due to the lack of petrol. Industrial production has slumped
sharply, by 50 per cent in Dushanbe alone. The 1993 budget deficit is
expected to exceed 50 per cent of GDP.
In an effort to relieve the energy crisis, the Tajik government recently
travelled to Turkmenistan to beg the Turkmens not to charge hard currency
for gas and petrol supplies. A deal was signed - partly because Tajikistan
controls part of the water supply to Turkmenistan - but as one Tajik
minister said: 'What can we offer them? Just fresh air.'
The key effect of this crisis has been to push Tajikistan back into the arms
of the Russians. In spite of speculation last year that Persian-speaking
Tajikistan could fall within the orbit of Iran or Turkey, the Iranian
presence in the republic remains low key.
Tajikistan is in no position to print its own currency, and wants to remain
part of the rouble zone. But with the republic unable to match the Russian
Central Bank's tough new fiscal demands, Russia has refused to issue
Tajikistan with any new roubles, forcing it to use pre-1993 Russian tender,
now technically invalid in Russia. Inflation is spiralling and its economic
isolation is growing.
Mr Abduladjanov himself sadly concludes: 'Tajikistan is rich in many
resources. But to attract any investment we need stability - and that will
take a while yet.'

FRENCH STUDENT leaders yesterday called for further demonstrations on
Thursday after leading a protest march through Paris' Latin Quarter to the
National Assembly which was debating next year's education budget.
Elsewhere students briefly blocked trains leaving Rennes in Brittany and in
the south students occupied part of the university of Aix-en-Provence. But
the demonstrations in protest at what students see as the Balladur
government's neglect of higher education did not draw the massive support
that its leaders had hoped.
Mr Jean Glavany, the Socialist party spokesman, denounced the government for
abandoning the previous Socialist government's priority for education, and
described as 'laughable' the present government's attempts to deal with
understaffing in France's universities.
The main problem sparking yesterday's demonstrations seems to be the surge
of students embarking on courses this autumn in social sciences and
psychology, whose university faculties have become very overcrowded, while
many vacancies exist in universities' technical faculties.

MORE THAN 1,500 candidates have claimed the right to stand in the elections
for the 225 seats in the Russian parliament's lower house which are to be
elected from single-member constituencies.
The list for the elections on December 12 includes leading figures from both
government and opposition.
The lists were closed as Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, re-opened
the possibility of his standing as president in elections next June before
his term of office expires. He told the daily Izvestiya in an interview that
the decree on holding a presidential election had not been cancelled, and
that he wanted to hear the new parliament's opinion on the issue.
He said, however, that his 'heart was not in pre-term elections' - since it
would be yet another referendum in trust in the president. He said the
decision to call the election had been made when he was seeking a compromise
with the former parliament - a situation which no longer applied.
The candidates for the lower house, or State Duma, will be elected both by
party lists - chosen from 13 groups cleared to stand - and from
first-past-the-post constituencies. Conservative figures such as Mr Yuri
Voronin and Mr Valentin Agafonov, former senior officials of the dissolved
parliament, are seeking seats - as is Mr Sergei Baburin, a former leader of
the hardline Russian National Unity group.
Two of the ringleaders of the parliamentary rebellion, Mr Ruslan
Khasbulatov, former speaker, and Mr Ilya Konstantinov, a leader of the
National Salvation Front, both in Lefortovo prison awaiting trial, were said
by news agencies to have collected enough signatures to allow them to stand.
However, Mr Andrei Byeloborodov told Reuters that Mr Konstantinov - and
presumably also Mr Khasbulatov - would be barred from standing.
Opinion polls from throughout the country show much confusion and a huge
proportion of people undecided as to how to vote - though Russia's Choice
usually comes out well.
However, the Communist party also polls relatively highly, as does the
pro-Communist Agrarian party.

A SWEDISH court yesterday approved controversial plans to build a Dollars
3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) road and rail bridge between Denmark and Sweden, but laid
tough environmental conditions on the project.
Sweden's prime minister Carl Bildt said his right-centre coalition, which is
split on the issue, would soon take a final decision on the 17km link
between Malmo and Copenhagen, on which construction is supposed to begin
next year.
Sweden and Denmark agreed to build the bridge in 1991, but it has faced
strong opposition, particularly in Sweden, because of fears it would hinder
vital salt water flows into the already heavily-polluted Baltic Sea and
break international agreements on limiting vehicle exhaust emissions.
The so-called Water Court, which rules on all projects effecting waterways,
gave the go-ahead, but insisted on changes in the construction proposals
drawn up by the Swedish-Danish consortium planning the bridge.
It called for a shift in the planned site of an artificial island, tight
controls on spillage from dredging, and three-dimensional computer models of
the construction process to be commissioned from two independent
institutions before construction went ahead.

<TEXT>
LORD OWEN, Europe's peace envoy in former Yugoslavia, yesterday warned that
the world community would have to decide how long it could sustain
intervention in the war-torn countries.
In a speech to the Confederation of British Industry in Harrogate, northern
England, Lord Owen said there was a danger that intervening in civil wars
only worsened the situation. 'Europe can help, above all with humanitarian
aid. But let us not forget we are feeding the warriors, we are interfering
with the dynamics of war . . . becoming more and more unjustified as it
becomes a battle for smaller elements of territory, smaller elements of
principle.
'There will come a moment when the world community will have to decide how
long we can sustain intervention.'
Lord Owen argued that the UN could not settle other peoples' problems - 'all
it can do is help them to settle their own problems'. He added: 'You have to
realise that they operate under the same dynamics as we have operated in our
history and rightly or wrongly - and I believe wrongly - these people are
still intent on fighting each other.'
However, no one should feel 'totally ashamed' of what Europe was trying to
do in former Yugoslavia. In response to calls for greater military
intervention, Lord Owen said: 'Do not believe that we can solve the problem
from the safety of 10,000 ft from an aeroplane.' Nonetheless, the European
Union's policy towards former Yugoslavia showed the difficulties of trying
to impose a single foreign policy.
This led to the mistake of recognising Croatia and then Bosnia because
member states wrongly believed they needed to have a common foreign policy.
'It's time to realise that there is no need to feel guilt-ridden if all 12
countries do not make the same decisions.'

BELGIAN unions yesterday took part in the first of a planned series of
strikes to protest against proposals to cut wage costs and improve
industrial competitiveness.
Ministers from Belgium's centre-left coalition were last night said to be
entering the final stages of talks on measures which should cut social
security payments and increase indirect taxes.
Foreign investors and currency markets are watching the negotiations
closely. Analysts believe that if the government does not attack Belgium's
central problem of a looming budget and welfare deficit, the Belgian franc
will come under renewed speculative pressure. During September and October,
the Belgian central bank had to fight hard to maintain its strict policy of
shadowing the D-Mark.
Some market analysts said yesterday they feared Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene,
Belgium's Christian Democrat prime minister, might have to water down his
strict line on government spending, to avoid a schism with his Socialist
coalition partners.
Yesterday's industrial action was particularly successful in Wallonia, the
French-speaking southern part of Belgium, paralysing the region's industry.
That only emphasised the difficulties for the government, because the
French-speaking Socialist members of the coalition are the most uneasy about
the government's plans.

HITACHI, the Japanese electronics group, yesterday launched a co-operative
programme aimed at improving the competitiveness of European electronic
component manufacturers.
Mr Toru Fukui, general manager of Hitachi's European office, warned that
without a guaranteed reliable and stable supply of components from western
Europe, both Japanese and European consumer electronics groups would be
forced to seek supplies in Asia or eastern Europe. He said manufacturers
based in Europe, whether Japanese or European, had 'a very serious common
headache'.
The Japanese group yesterday invited its own European suppliers - and
component manufacturers nominated by any European users - to take part in
the year-long programme.
Hitachi will promote exchanges of information between product manufacturers
and their suppliers, while asking its own engineers in Japan and at its
plant in Wales to guide suppliers on what manufacturers require. The Hitachi
programme is inspired by the EU-Japan joint initiative to strengthen
European components suppliers, launched in 1991. That programme has
encouraged Japanese and European consumer electronics groups, government,
European Commission officials and trade organisations to pool views on the
strengths and weaknesses of the European industry.
Mr Toru Fukui pointed out that more than 80 per cent of the VCRs
manufactured in Europe were now made by Japanese companies, and two-thirds
of the colour televisions.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Moslems to sue Britain over arms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BOSNIA'S Moslem-led government will sue Britain before the World Court for
'failing to prevent genocide' through its Balkans policy, Bosnia's UN
delegate announced last night. Mr Mohamed Sacirbey cited the convention
against genocide and asserted that UK opposition to lifting the arms embargo
against Bosnia was responsible for a massive loss of life.
He accused Mr John Major, UK prime minister, of opposing lifting the arms
ban for domestic political reasons. He said other countries were not
blameless but Britain was accused because it was 'at the forefront' in
maintaining the embargo.
The UK foreign office last night indicated that the delegate's legal
challenge brought the Bosnia debate back on to familiar territory.
'Ministers have defended many times our policy of not lifing the arms
embargo. The policy issue is clear, and the right approach is not to lift
the embargo.'

<TEXT>
THE European Commission has cleared a joint venture between 12 of the
world's largest telecommunications groups, aimed at providing specialised
communication services between financial centres.
But the Financial Network Association, which includes six European
companies, had to give special undertakings that it would not discriminate
against private service suppliers. The FNA also undertook not to use revenue
from 'reserved' monopoly services to subsidise services such as data
transmission, which are already open to competition.
The FNA, set up in March 1992, will offer worldwide services to financial
institutions through the networks of the companies involved. They are:
France Telecom, Belgacom, the Belgian state telecoms company, Italcable of
Italy, Mercury Communications of the UK, Telfonica of Spain, Deutsche
Bundespost Telekom of Germany, Telstra of Australia, Hong Kong Telecom, KDD
of Japan, MCI of the US, Singapore Telecom and Stentor of Canada.

FT  16 NOV 93 / It's springtime for Prague privatisation: The Czech
government's determination to promote a new wave of sell-offs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITALISM may have lost its gloss for Prague intellectuals infuriated by
the demise of state support for film makers, but the Czech government has
lost none of its fervour for sweeping privatisation.
Now free of its entanglement with Slovakia - although not of the asset
disputes that followed the divorce of the two republics on January 1 this
year - the government is launching a wave of mass privatisation by vouchers.
Around 770 companies are up for sale, with a book value of CzK145bn (Pounds
3.3bn), using voucher books on sale since October 1. The first of five
bidding rounds for shares are due to start in February and investors should
receive their shares by the end of next year.
A similar scheme in the former Czechoslovakia, in 1991, drew 8.5m Czech and
Slovak investors. But critics say the process is too slow, and prone to
manipulation and delays.
Shares of companies sold in the first wave were only transferred to
individual investors and privatisation funds - which control more than 70
per cent of privatised stock - this summer. 'We're only starting to look at
the numbers. We're all discovering what we really own,' says one fund
manager.
Mr Viktor Kozeny, whose Harvard Capital &amp; Consulting company is the third
largest fund in terms of asset value with stakes in 51 companies, says he
wants to sack about one-third of his companies' managers and employees to
make them more efficient and profitable.
Other funds prefer to wait and see how their companies perform, encouraging
managements to adapt to the new market conditions gradually, rather than
forcing boardroom revolutions.
Critics say such caution may be commendable, but it is delaying
restructuring and the rationalisation of companies deeply in debt. The
collapse of traditional markets in the former Comecon trade bloc, and the
disruption caused by the transition to an emergent market economy, have led
to a huge amount of inter-company debt, variously estimated at
CzK80bn-CzK150bn. No one really knows the exact amount.
Estimates of the private sector's share in the national economy vary from 40
per cent to 60 per cent, but its share of industrial production remains
below 20 per cent and almost two-thirds of the workforce is still employed
in the public sector. The government believes, however, that the scheme is
the quickest way of off-loading a large volume of state assets, even if its
impact on the economy is delayed.
Meanwhile, privatisation funds have to come to grips with managing their
newly acquired portfolios. The biggest fund backed by Ceska Sporitelna, the
large savings bank, has more than 1m shareholders and 514 companies in its
portfolio; three other funds have stakes in more than 260 companies each.
Vested interests, and the fear that precipitate action could unleash an
uncontrollable wave of bankruptcies, have encouraged a wait-and-see
approach, disappointing those hoping for more rapid change.
A new bankruptcy law, which came into force in April, was designed to help
encourage companies to settle their accounts or face insolvency proceedings,
but until now there has been only a trickle of business closures.
The government would like the process to be speeded up, but institutional
investors are more guarded. The banks, which are owed about CzK130bn in
loans, are reluctant to start bankruptcy proceedings which may embroil them
in costly and lengthy litigation with little prospect of recovering their
money.
'The banks provide financial backing for the funds which own important
stakes in a large number of companies which owe money to each other and to
the banks. So nobody wants to rock the boat,' says one analyst.
No one knows how long this state of affairs can be maintained, but it is a
potential cause of instability in an already fragile structure.
Uncertainty has been reflected in erratic trading on the Prague Stock
Exchange and the rival over-the-counter RM-System. Trading volumes have been
small, with sudden bursts of activity caused by a few large transactions in
a handful of shares. Share prices, which had been in the doldrums for
months, have risen sharply recently as investment funds consolidate their
positions. However, analysts believe that on the current rate of increase
some shares may soon be overpriced.
One drawback is that foreign investors have stayed away, preferring to deal
off the exchanges and directly with the funds, making it difficult to know
what is really happening in the market.
'There is a split market with two systems, not enough transparency, and
there are no custodian facilities for foreign investors. If people trade off
the exchanges, there's no way to know what's going on,' says one fund
manager.
This may not worry Czech investors paying CzK1,000 plus a small fee for
their voucher books. Lured by the hope of quick prosperity, millions of
Czechs contributed to make the first voucher privatisation a resounding
success, but the appeal may have faded.
About 2.1m Czechs have registered since voucher books went on sale last
month. The authorities hope up to 3.5m people will register by the end of
November deadline.
A full picture will only be available once the official list of investors is
published in January or February. Until then, investors will have to wait to
know whether they have made a wise choice.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Belgian strike campaign launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIAN unions yesterday fired a warning shot across the bows of the
country's government with the first of a planned series of strikes to
protest against proposals to cut wage costs and improve industrial
competitiveness.
Ministers from Belgium's centre-left coalition were last night said to be
entering the final stages of talks on measures which should cut social
security payments and increase indirect taxes.
Foreign investors and currency markets are watching the negotiations
closely. Analysts believe that if the government does not attack Belgium's
central problem of a looming budget and social security deficit, the Belgian
franc will come under renewed speculative pressure. During September and
October, the Belgian central bank had to fight hard to maintain its strict
policy of shadowing the D-Mark.
Some market analysts said yesterday they feared Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene,
Belgium's Christian Democrat prime minister, might have to water down his
strict line on government spending, to avoid a schism with his Socialist
coalition partners.
Yesterday's industrial action was particularly successful in Wallonia, the
French-speaking southern part of Belgium, paralysing the region's industry.
That only emphasised the difficulties for the government, because the
French-speaking Socialist members of the coalition are the most uneasy about
the government's plans.
Public transport in the cities was also hit by the action, although the
state railway, and Sabena, the national airline, were almost unaffected.
However, Socialist and Christian unions have promised a series of strikes
over the next few weeks, targeted on different regions of Belgium. The
unions say their action will culminate, 'if necessary', in a general strike,
to coincide with the summit of European Union leaders in Brussels on
December 10.
The French-speaking and Dutch-speaking Socialist parties are keen that
reductions in social expenditure should be offset by increases in property
and withholding tax. Christian Democrats are calling for savings of BFr75bn
(Pounds 1.4bn) on social security expenditure, while the Socialist parties
want to raise at least BFr30bn through indirect taxes on investment.
The unions yesterday attacked Belgian industry for hiding behind the
government's proposals. The employers' federation said the industrial action
was negative for industry as well as for the majority of Belgian citizens.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Move to let schools mortgage buildings for funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECONDARY schools in England and Wales are to be allowed to mortgage their
buildings to raise funds under plans the Department for Education is
preparing.
According to Whitehall officials, Mr John Patten, the education secretary,
and Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, are working on
a plan to allow schools to raise private sector finance for building
projects.
The move is part of the government's 'private finance initiative' aimed at
increasing private investment in the public sector and finding new ways of
cutting the Pounds 50bn public-sector deficit.
Many school buildings are in severe disrepair and private funds are seen as
necessary.
At first, only schools that have opted out of local education authority
control will be able to use the facility. Buildings of maintained schools
are still officially owned by local authorities. More than 1,000 schools
have opted out so far.
However, the government is understood to want eventually to extend the move
to all 4,000 schools in England and Wales, including local authority
maintained schools. It is also considering proposals to remove
grant-maintained schools' funding from the public sector borrowing
requirement.
An announcement is hoped for within weeks. The new loan facilities might be
possible for the next financial year, although 1995-96 is more likely.
Two crucial factors will determine whether the scheme succeeds: the
valuation banks place on school buildings, some of which can by law be used
only for educational purposes, and whether the government will underwrite
the loans.
Banks would worry about repossessing a school that failed to keep up with
its payments, especially if it could not be easily used for another purpose.
Banks reacted cautiously to the prospect last night. Barclays said the bank
already had numerous business customers among grant-maintained schools and
was interested in extending within the sector. It already lends widely to
universities and colleges.
The Department for Education was uncertain whether the Treasury would
underwrite any loans made to schools.
According to Barclays: 'If the government offered guarantees, then that
would make it very attractive.'
Similar measures to relax controls over using publicly funded assets as
securities for loans have already been introduced to aid investment in
universities and other higher education colleges.
They now receive more than Pounds 1bn each year from private sources,
according to Mr Patten.

FRESH efforts by Mr John Major to inject momentum into the

Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, chose the night that the prime
minister made his first explicit offer to negotiate with the IRA's political
wing - in return for an end to violence - to claim that Sinn Fein had been
in 'protracted contact and dialogue' with the government.
Mr Adams said it was Mr Major who broke off the dialogue.
The claim, which followed reports in the province that such meetings had
taken place earlier this year, brought an immediate denial from Downing
Street, which said there had been no negotiations between the British
government and Sinn Fein. It said the only contacts made had been those
permitted at local and constituency level. It would not comment on a
separate claim from republicans in Belfast that documents had been
exchanged.
Earlier last night Mr Major told the Lord Mayor's banquet in the City that
'there may now be a better opportunity for peace in Northern Ireland than
for many years'.
In his speech, Mr Major ruled out any secret deals with terrorists, and
insisted that the government would 'never' talk to organisations which
declined to renounce violence.
His remarks brought a mixed response from unionist leaders. Mr Ken Maginnis,
security spokesmen for the Ulster Unionist party, said he had found 'nothing
new' in them.
The Reverend Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, said he
would never talk to Sinn Fein. He had 'some evidence' of secret meetings
between the Northern Ireland Office and Sinn Fein, he added.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, welcomed Mr Major's comments, and
said he agreed that everyone would have to show courage and take risks to
try to secure peace.
Mr Major stressed that the government would insist on a permanent cessation
of violence before talking to Sinn Fein. 'But if the IRA end violence for
good, then, after a sufficient interval to ensure the permanence of their
intent, Sinn Fein can enter the political arena as a democratic party and
join the dialogue on the way ahead,' he said.
His speech confirmed that the government was prepared to press ahead without
the participation of the DUP.
The possibility that the British and Irish governments might be willing to
talk to Sinn Fein was first raised in a joint declaration in Brussels last
month by Mr Major and Mr Reynolds.
Downing Street said Mr Major's comments were intended as a clear
demonstration that the government was 'very serious' about the peace
process. However, Mr Adams responded that Mr Major's speech was 'little more
than an attempt to camouflage his rejection of peace'.
'This is not about a place for Sinn Fein at the conference table. We will be
there. Our electorate have decided that,' he said.
'Indeed, representatives of Sinn Fein have been in protracted contact and
dialogue with the British Government. It was John Major who broke off that
contact at the behest of his Unionist allies.
'Mr Major cannot dodge his responsibilities so easily. He must grasp the
opportunity for peace, not play politics with it,' Mr Adams said.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Frozen silence lingers over the wasteland of Chernobyl:
Bronwen Maddox visits the site of nuclear disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the town of Chernobyl, the silence is so complete it is hard to break it
by talking. You breathe more shallowly, partly because it is 15 degrees
below zero, and partly for fear of the radioactive dust, although the
scientists who are the town's only inhabitants say there is no danger if you
do not stay long.
Seven years after the world's worst nuclear disaster at the power plant 20
kilometres to the north, Chernobyl is a ghost town. China figurines are
visible through the curtained windows of the two-storey green and white
houses, but the grass has grown over the garden paths and the frozen roads
are unmarked by tyres. Radiation meters show readings five to 10 times above
natural background levels - in some spots the readings leap to 5,000 times
higher than normal.
When the Ukrainian plant's fourth reactor exploded in the early hours of
April 26, 1986, it sent clouds of radioactive plutonium, iodine, strontium
and caesium drifting over Europe. The plant's isolation helps explain how
none of its operators challenged their orders to carry out ill-judged tests
on the reactor. Surrounded by frozen rivers curling in crazy oxbows, its
white concrete sheds gleam for miles across marshes and pine forests.
A team of officials and scientists from the European Commission and the
European Parliament is now working urgently with the republics of Belarus,
Ukraine and Russia, the three most affected by the explosion, to try to
limit the consequences for health and the environment.
Last week the team, which has given Ecu14.2m (Dollars 16.6m) for joint
research programmes, warned that water supplies could become contaminated
within a decade. Lack of adequate health data is handicapping efforts to
measure the effect of radiation on people's health, they say; unless
monitoring begins soon, it may be impossible ever to judge how many people
have suffered.
Mr Gordon Adam, Euro MP for Northumbria, said: 'We have to have priorities,
and thyroid cancer in children is one of them.' A Commission report prepared
by scientists in the group has confirmed 186 cases of thyroid cancer in
Belarus children between 1986 and mid-1993 - normally, the disease is
extremely rare.
But the scale of the task in combating the radiation, which has made a
wasteland of some of the most fertile land in the central European plain, is
daunting. For 30km around the plant, the land is so contaminated that all
normal human life has been driven out.
A six strand barbed wire fence bars almost everyone but for the eight-man
shifts who tend the plant's two remaining reactors, and the scientists
studying mutations in plants and animals. The Ukrainian government has
allowed a handful of people to return to their homes, but only because they
are too old for radiation-induced cancer - which takes years to develop - to
shorten their lives.
It is from the air that the true extent of the desolation becomes clear. The
fairground wheel in Pripyat, the model town built to house Chernobyl's
staff, is lashed down and the seats covered with yellow wraps. The furrows
in the abandoned corn fields are blurring as the scrub takes over.
Then there is the debris, contaminated beyond recovery. More than 100 ships
of all sizes lie anchored and abandoned along the banks of the Pripyat
river. One large field looks like a drawer of children's toys tipped over: a
heap of brightly coloured tractors, police cars, buses, fire engines and
cranes with rust marks just starting to show. In the next field, the huge
grey helicopters which dropped sand on the reactor's blazing core are parked
forever, blades drooping nearly to the ground.
The most contaminated waste is buried in more than 600 dump sites dug
hurriedly after the disaster. At the bottom of the pits are trees from the
'red' forest, named for its ferocious level of radioactivity. The 10-foot
high mounds over the waste, arranged in neat rows inside high earthen
ramparts, look from the air like the burial places of an ancient
civilisation.
Meanwhile, facing acute power shortages, the cash-strapped Ukrainian
government last month reversed its earlier decision to close Chernobyl's
remaining reactors.

FT  16 NOV 93 / Heseltine and Clarke speak out for Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON, ROLAND RUDD and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO OF the government's most prominent cabinet ministers fought back
yesterday to preserve the Tory party's pro-European credentials in the face
of recent strong criticism from industry.
Implicitly attacking the party's Eurosceptics in a speech at the
Confederation of British Industry's conference, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary, warned against alienating Britain's main business
allies with insults.
He told the conference in Harrogate: 'We will serve ourselves not at all if
the language with which we describe our Continental partners, the imagery in
which we paint them and the insularity with which we attempt to rewrite the
history of the past 40 years has the effect of alienating ourselves and our
self-interest from the very people upon whom we are most dependent.'
Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, said he continued to support economic and
monetary union, but without adhering to artificial timetables. At a press
conference before his speech to the CBI, he said: 'The next thing we should
pursue is economic convergence. That is the real day-to-day task of European
ministers now.' Mr Clarke said the argument over membership of the European
exchange rate mechanism had been dramatised in a British political context.
'A mythology has sprung up that our recession was caused by the ERM and that
when we left the ERM, happy dawn was here again. But the present recovery,
it is now plain, had started before we left.'
Referring to last week's reported criticism of the government's stance on
the ERM by Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, he said: 'There is
certainly no difference as far as I can see between myself and the CBI, or
the government and the CBI.'
The remarks by the two ministers were seen as an attempt by the left of the
Tory party to regain ground lost at the party conference. Speeches by
ministers such as Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, had drawn
applause for their attacks on the European Commission.
Some industrialists were critical of the rightwing position. Mr Iain
Vallance, BT chairman, said: 'UK business's European credentials are second
to none, which is why I and many of my business colleagues despaired at some
of the damaging and xenophobic political posturing in Westminster over the
past year.' He added: 'Britain must not allow itself to be marginalised.' Mr
Heseltine said the issue of a single European currency was one of timing.
'The British government has negotiated a position in which it can make up
its mind.
'What will happen is that either the economies of Europe will converge, or
they won't. If they do, they will either converge on the D-Mark as the
dominant currency or there will be an institutionalised currency which the
Europeans will decide to put in place of the D-Mark.'

FT  15 NOV 93 / Israel and Efta work to widen trading links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL has held its first joint committee meeting with the European Free
Trade Association to widen and deepen trade ties and economic co-operation
under the Israel-Efta free trade agreement which came into force last
January.
Ms Maria Fekter, Austrian secretary of state for economic affairs, who led
the Efta delegation, said the meeting had agreed to push for a pan-European
cumulation of rules of origin to stem mounting discrimination by the EC
against finished goods produced by Efta states, Israel and other countries.
The joint committee also agreed to work to change the EC requirement that
all products enjoying free trade must be consigned directly from one free
trade partner to another.
A number of joint technical committees were also established to work on
further co-operation in official aid, services, investments, government
procurement and the development of joint research and development projects.
Both Israel and Efta said they expected substantially increased trade under
the 10-month-old agreement. Last year, Israel imported goods worth Dollars
1.2bn from Efta states and exported Dollars 487m.
Switzerland is Israel's leading trade partner in Efta and accounts for more
than 50 per cent of exports and imports.
'We hope for increased volume and more balanced trade as Efta economies
recover from recession,' Mr Nati Sharoni, director-general of Israel's trade
and industry ministry, said.
On the future relations between Efta and the Palestinian entity, Ms Fekter
said the committee had decided to wait for further talks to decide whether
the two entities are to establish a joint customs union.
But it is clear that Efta is hoping Palestinian negotiators will accept a
customs union which will give Palestinian goods access to the Efta market on
the same terms as Israeli products.
'If the Palestinians reject a customs union we will have to do a new
bilateral agreement with them,' Ms Fekter said.
Both sides also stressed the need for greater government involvement in
encouraging businessmen to look for investment and trading opportunities
between Efta and Israel.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S student unions are planning a series of nationwide demonstrations
today to protest against conditions in universities and a shortage of
teachers.
The biggest protests are expected in Paris where students plan to march from
the Sorbonne university to the National Assembly where a debate on the
proposed 1994 higher education budget is scheduled. Demonstrations are also
expected in other cities, including Strasbourg and Bordeaux.
Student unions claim that the budget, which is set to rise by 6 per cent
over the budget for 1993, is inadequate. They are also angry about the
government's decision in June to cut spending on equipment in universities
by 40 per cent from the level outlined in plans announced last autumn.
Mr Francois Fillon, minister for higher education, said his department had
received one of the largest increases under the proposed budget for next
year, demonstrating the priority given to education by the centre-right
government of Mr Edouard Balladur.
The planned protests come at a sensitive time for the government which is
also faced with the prospect of strikes at several public sector companies
later this week. Unions have called for protests on Thursday against job
losses and the government's planned reform of the labour law.

FT  15 NOV 93 / De Benedetti warns of populist backlash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR CARLO De Benedetti, the chairman of Olivetti and one of Italy's best
known entrepreneurs, has raised the spectre of a populist backlash in his
country after new elections, expected early next year.
He warned at the weekend that it might take a second poll before Italian
politics and business returned to normal after the convulsions of the
political corruption scandal, which has cut a swath through much of the
domestic establishment.
Mr De Benedetti, who has himself been implicated after admitting his
Olivetti computers group paid more than L10bn (Dollars 6m) in bribes, was
released from house arrest last week after being briefly imprisoned in Rome.
In his first press interview since his ordeal, he said Italy ran the risk of
a social conflagration if the forthcoming elections produced the expected
upsurge in support for the regional autonomist Northern League and the
Democratic Party of the Left, the former Communists.
The two groups are forecast to dominate the new parliament, along with the
remnants of the Christian Democrat party, which is likely to become ever
more dependent on votes from the economically depressed south.
Mr De Benedetti said the danger was that the three parties would fail to
agree on appointing some form of apolitical government of technocrats, along
the lines of the present government of prime minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.
A government of that type would be the only way to steer Italy through the
difficult period ahead until stable new political groupings took shape and
the economy started to pull out of recession, he said.
Mr De Benedetti recognised a government of technocrats was 'the most rosy
scenario' among a variety of possibilities. Failing such an outcome,
populism, which would be the only unifying factor between the three -
extremely diverse - parties likely to dominate the next parliament,
threatened grave political and economic instability.
In spite of the risks, however, Mr De Benedetti said new elections were
essential as soon as possible to replace the present discredited
legislature. Only a fresh parliament could push through the new laws
required to find a popularly acceptable solution to the corruption scandal,
which otherwise threatened to drag on for years, debilitating Italian
business and damaging the country's image abroad.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Meat trade takes on the City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITHFIELD'S meat traders will next month pit brain as well as brawn against
the Corporation of London in what promises to be a Dickensian denouement to
the battle between the oldest meat market in the world and the most medieval
local authority in Britain.
The conflict has forced the Corporation to draw up unprecedented plans to
reform its voting system.
As the result of an EC directive Smithfield's bloodstained sawdust and
hanging carcases will by next year have to be replaced by a
temperature-controlled zone where meat is electronically pulleyed through
self-locking doors rather carted around the Victorian market by aproned men
with wooden wheelbarrows.
Although the Corporation has already spent more than Pounds 30m on the first
phase of the 'upgrade', the traders and Smithfield tenants are having to pay
a heavy price to meet the higher standards - both in terms of capital cost
of fitting out their stalls - up to Pounds 170,000 (Dollars 250,000 each) -
and higher rents.
After rejecting tenancy terms offered by the Corporation in April, the meat
traders are now plotting to infiltrate its decision-making body, the 132
members of common councilmen, in the annual elections to be held early next
month. They intend to pack the City's wards with their own supporters and
hope to create their own powerful cabal of 'meatiemen' within the council.
The Corporation, however, remains confident. As one of the three medieval
institutions left in England - the others are the monarchy and the House of
Lords - it is not going to cede an inch to the the meatpackers.
But the Corporation may reform its archaic system of voting and for the
first time give public companies a vote in deciding how the City is
governed.
Members are elected by the most restricted franchise in the UK, with votes
going to partnerships, sole traders, livery companies and City residents.
Anomalies mean that, for example, partners of large accountancy practices
with numerous offices in the square mile can vote in seven separate wards.
But BP, the square mile's largest employer, cannot.

FT  15 NOV 93 / PepsiCo curtails Michael Jackson tour deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PEPSICO, the US soft drinks group, said yesterday it was ending its
sponsorship of Michael Jackson's world tour following the singer's decision
to cancel its final leg because of his addiction to pain-killers.
Jackson pulled out of the tour in Mexico City on Friday, saying he would
seek treatment for his increasing dependency on the painkillers he had been
prescribed after scalp surgery for a burn he said he suffered while filming
a Pepsi commercial.
The 35-year-old performer said anguish over allegations that he had sexually
molested a 14-year-old boy had aggravated his addiction. Jackson denies the
allegations, but California police are continuing to investigate.
PepsiCo would not say how much money was involved in sponsorship, but when
it announced the deal in 1992 it called it the largest ever between a
company and an entertainer. At the time, industry analysts estimated it was
worth as much as Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.7m). It was unclear last night
whether Jackson would lose the sponsorship for part or all of the tour.
PepsiCo's relationship with Jackson dates back to 1984, when it sponsored a
tour by the singer and his brothers. Since then PepsiCo has sponsored two
world tours and run several series of television commercials broadcast
around the world. Jackson had not advertised Pepsi on television in the US,
however, since 1988.
The termination of the tour sponsorship is a blow to PepsiCo, which has
spent hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years promoting its main
Pepsi brand outside the US through the singer's concerts.
The company had described the deal as 'a key catalyst in the expansion of
our international business'. Jackson, with his appeal to young people around
the world, was seen as a powerful weapon for PepsiCo in its battle with arch
rival Coca-Cola.
The revelation that Jackson was addicted to painkillers, coming on top of
the sex abuse allegations, would have made it difficult for PepsiCo to
continue sponsoring the singer, but the company said it was Jackson's
decision to end the tour prematurely that led to the termination of its
sponsorship deal.
Mr Gary Hemphill, a spokesman for PepsiCo, said last night: 'Our agreement
with Michael Jackson was for the sponsorship of his international tour. Now
that the tour is over, there is nothing left to sponsor.' Mr Hemphill said
the deal would have ended at the planned conclusion of the tour in December.
Jackson has a long-term recording contract with Sony worth at least Dollars
65m.

Lord Justice Scott believes that the government has been over-secretive in
the handling of classified information.
But the judge appears to have become convinced that the public interest
remains best served by making an exception of some intelligence information,
both to protect the safety of his witnesses and to ensure their
co-operation.
The evidence given by an MI6 officer identified only as Mr O was heard at a
private hearing last week after Mr Simon Sherrington, the Foreign Office
official, had agreed to give his evidence in public.
Mr Sherrington said that in October 1989 he had advised the then Foreign
Office minister Mr William Waldegrave that lathes made by the Midlands
company Matrix Churchill were not necessarily defence-related and therefore
not in breach of government guidelines. Mr Sherrington said he had based his
advice on a briefing from his MI6 contact, Mr O.
The intelligence officer was questioned privately by the judge last week
after it emerged that Mr Sherrington's evidence contradicted Mr O's earlier
written submission. It is understood that last week's private hearing has
not resolved the differences.
The public hearings were adjourned last week until November 22.

PUERTO Rico's pro-statehood Governor Pedro Rossello last night conceded
defeat in the island's plebiscite on whether to become the 51st US state,
Reuter reports from San Juan.
The concession came four hours after the polls closed and with about half
the vote counted. In a high turnout of the 2.3m voters, about 46 per cent
backed statehood while more than 48 per cent voted for the Caribbean island
to remain a US commonwealth. About four per cent were in favour of becoming
an independent country.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Monday Interview: Chips with everything - The trio at the
top of Intel, the world's biggest semiconductor maker, talk to Alan Cane
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Intel Corporation, the company which gave style and identity to the
featureless, plastic-wrapped chips at the heart of most of the world's 100m
personal computers, is 25 years old and on a roll.
It dominates the global semiconductor business - the first US company to
break Japan's hold on the semiconductor business in almost a decade. The
numbers '386' and '486', which identify its most popular microprocessors,
are common argot thanks to the 'Intel Inside' marketing campaign and
relentless media adver-tising for Intel-based computers.
With revenues of more than Dollars 5bn last year, the company's brand name
is third in the value stakes, according to an annual survey of brand values
by US magazine Financial World, behind Marlboro and Coca-Cola.
However, intensified competition is the price it is paying for success.
International Business Machines, Digital Equipment and Advanced Micro
Devices are among the big companies determined to break the company's
dominance. Intel's response over the next few years will be critical for
maintaining its position. Its strategy is simple. It intends to out-spend,
out-innovate and out-perform its rivals.
The detailed execution of this policy is in the hands of three men who share
much of the credit for steering to Intel its present pre-eminence.
First, Gordon Moore, the chairman, who together with the late Robert Noyce
founded Intel in 1968. A consummate technologist, he deduced an eponymous
industry 'law'* which has so far stood the test of time in forecasting the
progress of chip technology.
Then there is Andrew Grove, 56, chief executive since 1987, a volatile
Hungarian noted for uncompromising business aggression. He is the public
face of Intel. Finally, there is Craig Barrett, 54, the chief operating
officer and a former materials scientist at Stanford University.
The three have worked together for almost two decades. All tell stories of
their personal fears about giving up secure jobs in the electronics business
to join the fledgling chipmaker.
They are hugely different in personality and focus: Moore, the courtly
long-term strategist; Grove, the driver, pushing the company forward and
facing down the competition; Barrett, the operations specialist concerned
about quality and efficiency.
If they quarrel among themselves, they do it quietly and in private,
colleagues say. Intel prides itself on an open, informal culture and
enlightened management attitudes. Grove, indeed, writes a management
question and answer column for a local newspaper.
This culture has nurtured the creativity that has made Intel a power-house
of innovation in semiconductors. It invented the high-speed memory (D-Ram)
used in every kind of computer system. It developed the microprocessor in
1971, and a decade later IBM chose Intel chips for its families of personal
computers.
The IBM link-up was to be the key to Intel's success, though few saw it as
such at the time. Grove said he barely remembers the details: 'I did not see
it as a big deal. Personal computers were not that much of a big deal then
anyway. I took more notice when IBM put our chips in its Displaywriter (an
early word processor) because there was one in our office. It was a real,
professional machine. I thought IBM might sell 50,000 personal computers.'
In the event, IBM's PC proved a global best-seller, rendering the
Displaywriter obsolete. The IBM PC was widely copied by electronics
manufacturers worldwide, each of which had to come to Intel for supplies of
the all-important central microprocessor. This was because IBM PC software
ran best on Intel's chips. Some 40m IBM-clone PCs are now manufactured each
year, more than the total global volume of passenger cars.
Intel's continued domination of the PC microprocessor market flows from a
strategic masterstroke in the 1980s. It refused to give other manufacturers
a licence to make its most powerful chips. This gave it a stranglehold on a
rapidly growing market, and underpinned its increasingly impressive
profitability.
A backlash was, of course, inevitable. Led by Advanced Micro Devices of the
US, some competitors have been building clones (functionally similar
versions) of Intel's market-leading designs without its permission. Other
manufacturers, notably Digital Equipment and IBM - in spite of the latter's
continued use of Intel chips - have launched their own designs of
high-performance chips in an effort to displace Intel's products as the
industry standard.
One consequence of this has been an avalanche of legal action and
counter-action in the US, as Intel strives to protect its intellectual
property. 'Nothing ever gets finished in this business,' bemoans Grove, who
has carried much of the load of representing Intel in the courts.
'Copying somebody else's designs is not how I would like to make my living.
If that is what you choose, however, the least you can do is be meticulous
in honouring the trade secrets and patents of the party you are going to rip
off,' he said.
Grove's anger is spurred by the cost of remaining at the cutting edge of the
semiconductor business. Intel will spend a total of Dollars 2.5bn this year
on research and development. The semiconductor industry has traditionally
invested more than 20 per cent of revenues on capital equipment, but
spending on this scale is exceptional. How long can it continue? Barrett is
sanguine: 'So long as our revenues are growing and our margins are good, it
can go on indefinitely.'
He adds: 'We will compete with the clone makers by staying at the leading
edge of microprocessor performance. It is the cannibal strategy. We have to
gobble up our older children - our current microprocessors - before the
competition does. We intend to move as fast as we can, ripping up the road
behind us.'
The chief hurdle, as Moore explains, is the physical problem of printing
smaller and smaller circuit images on silicon. The answer, some
technologists believe, is X-rays. 'That involves some fundamental problems
that need a lot of work,' Moore said. 'We will have to wait and see. In the
end, the chief problem could be the cost. That could slow things up. But
existing techniques will last until well into the next century - and after
that it is somebody else's problem.'
Meanwhile Intel is seeking new markets to conquer. Grove explains: 'We are
working to establish a presence in a related but different business which we
hope will contribute to revenues in the same way that microprocessors kicked
in when the D-Ram business slowed down.
'We are working on devices that will turn personal computers into
communication devices. Personal computer conferencing is probably the best
way to describe it.
'Business is about communications, sharing data and instantaneous
decision-making. If you have on your desk a device that enables you to
communicate and share data with your colleagues around the world, you will
have a strategic advantage.'
The first of these products is expected to be launched in the US within six
months; selected European countries will be targeted next, depending on the
speed with which Intel can get approvals from local telecommunications
authorities.
Intel has already proved itself in silicon memories and microprocessors; its
move in communications suggests that Moore, Grove and Barrett have lost none
of their hunger for the taste of innovation and success.
* Moore's Law states that the number of electronic elements which can be
written on the same size chip will double every 18 months.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Lion and dragon showdown:  stalled talks over Hong Kong's
future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only an optimist would believe that the resumption of talks on Friday
between Britain and China on Hong Kong's political future will lead to a
comprehensive agreement.
For the negotiations to be fruitful, the parties would have to undergo a
Pauline conversion on the road to Daoyutai - the location for the talks in
Beijing.
This would mean either - or both - of them reluctantly conceding
strongly-held principles on the colony's 1995 elections. After more than 150
hours of negotiations, such an outcome is unlikely.
At best, the two days of talks might result in a partial accord on Governor
Chris Patten's plans for more democracy in Hong Kong. This may allow extra
time to address the more controversial aspects of his package, such as
broadening the franchise for Hong Kong's voters. It would not amount to
complete agreement, but at least it would be some progress.
At worst, the two parties will not even achieve a partial accord. If
negotiations do founder, Mr Patten's original bill for greater democracy in
the colony is likely be presented, in defiance of Beijing, to the
Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong Kong's 60-strong law-making body, by early
next month.
Until recently Mr Patten - the target of some unpleasant abuse by the
communist-controlled Hong Kong press - has given an Oscar-winning
performance as a conviction politician who will not compromise his core
beliefs.
China has with obdurate determination played, by turns, the role of victim
of English perfidy and uncompromising guardian of the 'sacred texts' (past
Anglo-Chinese agreements).
But before, and after, last week's meeting of the British cabinet committee
which decides Hong Kong policy, both sides slipped ever so slightly out of
character. Could it be that the dragon and the lion can sit down and cut a
deal; that the storm and fury of the past year was just that?
China led the way in the days preceding the British cabinet meeting with a
sotto voce offer to accept the less contentious aspects of Mr Patten's
plans. Britain's cabinet responded by offering more time to talk if such a
deal could be stitched together at this week's talks. Hong Kong reacted
predictably.
Those who want more than the soupcon of democracy Mr Patten is offering
smelled a rat. The United Democrats, which won most of the popularly
contested LegCo seats in the 1991 elections, cried 'sell-out' - and with
some justification. They have seen tough talk of deadlines give way to
'talks about talks'. The United Democrats fear that the UK is slipping into
past habits: posturing and ultimately giving way.
Investors in Hong Kong's stock market also spotted the apparent change of
position but drew a different conclusion.
In the aftermath of Wednesday's cabinet meeting the colony's stock market
rose sharply, ending the week at a record high.
The business community, like its supporters in LegCo, wants a deal with
China on almost any terms believing, like Micawber, that all will turn out
for the best.
Yet as the week drew to a close, it became apparent that there might be less
to the Chinese offer of a deal than first thought.
For the UK, settling the easy part of Governor Patten's package would entail
agreements on aspects of the 1994 municipal poll and the more important and
broader 1995 election. An acceptable interim deal, in London's eyes, would
include reducing to 18 the age of voting in Hong Kong, (as is the case in
China); replacing appointed members with elected representatives in urban
and municipal councils in the 1994 poll; and allowing a 'fair' vote for 20
of LegCo's 60 seats in the 1995 elections.
But as of last Friday it seemed all Beijing had in mind was agreeing to the
reduction in the voting age and accepting the 1994 polls, while leaving the
more important 1995 elections unresolved - the tactical offer it first made
to Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, in September but which was
rejected.
Beijing, having made no concessions in talks that have stretched back some
seven months, needed to show the people of Hong Kong that it was prepared to
be flexible. The British cabinet had no option but to take it at face value
and offer something in return.
Viewed in this perspective, the twists and turns of the past week perhaps
amount to no more than deft diplomatic manoeuvring before the two parties
take to the negotiating table in Daoyutai. London and Beijing could simply
be positioning themselves for the battle for Hong Kong's hearts and minds
which will inevitably commence if the negotiations collapse.
In spite of all the speculation about partial deals, the realities
underlining the dispute have not changed. The world is justifiably agog at
China's headlong rush to modernise its economy. China may no longer be a
communist state; but it would be wrong to conclude that China's government
has also thrown off its Leninist mantle.
Beijing's primary aim in its protracted negotiations with London is to
secure political control in - as well as of - Hong Kong.
This is most apparent in its reluctance to concede Britain's demand to
broaden the franchise for 30 LegCo members in the so-called 'functional
constituencies' (industry-based votes), and allow democratic selection of a
committee which would elect 10 LegCo members.
This issue is the single most important obstacle to final agreement. It
seems unlikely that Beijing would agree terms for an election whose outcome
was unpredictable.
The British government, however, if it stands by Mr Patten's fine words, can
do no less.

FT  15 NOV 93 / What Nafta says about democracy: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'We can limit the powers of organised interests only by limiting the powers
of government.' Friedrich Hayek
With luck, the US House of Representatives will vote narrowly in favour of
the North American Free Trade Agreement on Wednesday. Mr Al Gore, the
vice-president, demolished Mr Ross Perot in last week's televised debate and
public opinion appears to be swinging in Nafta's favour. Yet the vote could
still go the wrong way. And if a victory is won, it will be narrow enough to
raise serious questions about the US political process.
Mexican misgivings about Nafta, while misguided, are understandable. The
treaty would expose sensitive Mexican sectors - such as cars, financial
services and telecommunications - to competition from an economy that is 25
times larger. The US position is quite different, since its home market is
already largely open. Studies consistently show that Nafta will boost US
employment and growth; there is not even convincing evidence that it will
harm low-wage US workers.
Nafta's opponents, such as Mr Richard Gephardt, the house majority leader,
are in a curious position. For years they railed about the threat from
protectionist high-wage economies such as Japan. These arguments, while
fallacious, had an aura of plausibility. But Mexico is a low-wage economy
running a trade deficit with the US that is offering to reduce its trade
barriers. If both Japan and Mexico represent potent threats, with whom can
the US trade openly? Presumably only a country with exactly the same level
of wages, exactly the same working practices and a bilateral trade account
that is always precisely in balance.
Yet if the case against Nafta is so weak, why is congressional opposition so
strong? Why did the vice-president feel obliged to challenge Mr Perot to a
debate moderated by, of all people, Mr Larry King, the CNN talk show host?
This was hardly an appropriate forum in which to determine the fate of US
economic policy.
The answer is that Nafta provides a classic example of a serious failing of
modern democracies. Advocates of democracy in the 18th and 19th centuries
felt certain that, if all the people had a chance to vote, their
representatives would have to support policies in the interests of the
nation as a whole. Democracy would thus spell the end of arbitrary rule by
despotic minorities and usher in a marvellous new age of rational
government.
In the 20th century, most democracies have fallen far short of these high
ideals. On many economic issues, democratically elected representatives feel
obliged to support the narrow sectional interests of their regions or the
groups, such as unions or professions, that lavishly financed their
campaigns. The problem is especially acute in the US, where the dominance of
commercial television forces politicians to present their case in 30-second
'sound bites'. In these circumstances, whether a policy is in the national
interest is of little consequence; what determines the outcome is whether
enough sectional interests can be lined up to push the vote over 50 per
cent. If Mr Clinton gets Nafta through, the price will be many damaging
concessions on other issues of particular interest to various lobbies.
Nafta highlights the problem of sectional interests because the pain from
trade liberalisation will be felt immediately by specific groups whereas the
(larger) benefits will be broadly spread over the whole population. But the
same destructive dynamic affects a whole range of other policies: Europe's
lavish agricultural subsidies, for example, are clearly not in the interests
of European consumers yet majority governments seem impotent to curtail
them.
How can modern democracies neutralise the power of sectional interests? Mr
Clinton's answer is to hold 'town hall' meetings and use his considerable
powers of persuasion to convince voters that policies which hurt minority
groups are sometimes essential for the national interest. Such a strategy
may help at the margin.
But it does not address the core problem, which was identified by Friedrich
Hayek, the late Austrian economist. Hayek argued that it is an elected
assembly's virtually unlimited ability to promote the interests of
particular groups that exposes it to political blackmail. The solution, he
maintained, lay in a greater reliance on general rules, perceived to be in
the nation's long-term interests, that must be applied in particular
circumstances regardless of the consequences for specific groups.
Monetary policy could serve as a model. Several nations are trying to
insulate monetary authorities from perverse short-term political pressures
by setting specific inflation targets for central banks. In principle trade
could be treated in the same way: nations, perhaps through constitutional
amendments or other devices, could make a binding long-term commitment to
free trade principles. In the face of such a general rule, sectional and
local interests would soon recognise the futility of lobbying individual
politicians who would no longer be capable of feathering their nests.
It sounds utopian and probably is. Yet the hysteria over Nafta surely shows
that something must be done to insulate modern democracies from sectional
interests and to increase their ability to pursue rational policies in the
interests of the population as a whole.

After the German call money rate eased some 20 basis points last week to
trade around 6.25 per cent on Friday, many traders were looking for a
repo-rate reduction this week of some 5-10 basis points from last week's
6.38 per cent minimum rate.
The Bundesbank's policy-setting central bank council will meet on Thursday,
but few market participants are expecting it to cut Germany's leading
Discount and Lombard rates.
However, some market participants say the Netherlands may lower its 6.10 per
cent special advances money market rate next week, independent of any
Bundesbank move. Dutch call money has been trading below the special
advances rate most of this week while the guilder remains the strongest
currency in the European Monetary System.
The UK markets are in for a busy week, with data on retail prices, public
sector borrowing, retail sales, money supply, unemployment and trade, as
well as revised data on third-quarter gross domestic product. The numbers
are expected to confirm the general picture of a slow but steady recovery.
However, sterling is widely expected to continue trading in a relatively
narrow range ahead of the November 30 Budget.
The dollar's fortunes will hinge on Wednesday's US Congressional vote on the
North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), the outcome of which is still
uncertain. The dollar is expected to press upwards against a resistance
point at DM1.7000.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Survey of Texas (7): The car remains king - Richard Tomkins
studies prospects for a Dollars 6.8bn high-speed railway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE trouble with Texans is that they don't take trains. Aircraft, yes; cars,
any time. They may even occasionally walk, but the idea of going to a
railway station and catching a train is as likely to occur to them as the
thought of commuting to work by horse.
This, in essence, is the single biggest obstacle standing in the way of the
Texas Supertrain. On the face of it, the plan to link the state's biggest
conurbations with a high-speed rail network makes sense: after all, Europe
and Japan have been doing the same sort of thing for years. But in a land
where people are wholly unused to the notion of catching trains, the private
sector project is struggling to bridge a credibility gap - and without
credibility, it will not attract the necessary finance.
The rationale for the Texas Supertrain seems straightforward. At present,
the main modes of transport in the triangle between Dallas, Houston and San
Antonio are road and air. But the highways and airports are already crowded
and a 1989 study by the Texas Turnpike Authority predicted that total
passenger movements in the triangle would more than triple by the year 2010.
The Texas Supertrain presents itself as the environmentally-friendly
solution to this seemingly intractable problem.
Plans for the high-speed network date back to the early 1980s, but they
began to gather momentum in 1991 when the state-appointed Texas High-Speed
Rail Authority awarded a 50-year franchise for the scheme to the Texas TGV
Corporation - a private sector consortium comprising Morrison Knudsen, the
US construction group, and private Texan interests. The consortium appointed
GEC Alsthom, developer of France's train a grande vitesse, and Bombardier,
GEC Alsthom's North American licensee, to provide the technology.
In the past few weeks the project has taken another step forward with the
publication of Texas TGV's preferred route. A three-spoke network totalling
469 route miles is planned, linking the main conurbations with French-style
TGV trains travelling at 200 mph. The 250-mile journey from Dallas to
Houston, for example, would take 1hr 41mins - much less than an airline
passenger could hope to achieve on the same route, city centre to city
centre.
Now, however, comes the hard part. Texas TGV says it is still working out
how much the project will cost, but the last time anyone did the sums, the
figure came to Dollars 6.8bn including financing costs and inflation to the
date of opening.
The figure might not matter very much if the private sector could be sure of
earning an adequate return. But with no contemporary experience of passenger
train projects in the US, potential backers are understandably wary.
Meanwhile, to add to its burden, the project also faces outspoken
opposition: not only from Southwest Airlines, the Dallas-based carrier that
has made a success out of its expanding network of no-frills, short-haul
services, but from a campaigning group called Derail (Demanding Ethics,
Responsibility and Accountability in Legislation) which speaks for people
who believe their lives, land or property could be adversely affected by the
railway.
Mr David Rece, Texas TGV's president and chief operating officer, believes
much of the opposition is overdone. These days, he says, Southwest Airlines
only makes 12 per cent of its revenues from its Texas routes. And by the
time the Texas Supertrain starts running, around the turn of the century,
there will be more than enough traffic for everyone. As for people directly
affected by the route, he sees no reason why Texas TGV should not be able to
reach satisfactory agreements on compensation in the overwhelming majority
of cases.
But is the project a paying proposition? On the one hand, it links three of
the biggest and fastest-growing cities in the US (Dallas, Houston and San
Antonio); the distances between them are ideal for the high-speed train,
being too long to travel comfortably by road and too short to make an air
journey worthwhile; and the railway's path is not obstructed by physical
barriers such as mountains or seas. On the other hand, Dollars 6.8bn is a
colossal amount of money.
Mr Rece acknowledges that rail travel is an unfamiliar concept to the
average Texan, but says a passenger study carried out by Charles River
Associates, a Boston-based consultancy, shows the TGV network should attract
26 per cent of the Texas inter-city travel market by the year 2010,
equivalent to 14.4m passengers annually. Based on a 3 per cent annual
inflation rate, it should be generating annual revenues of Dollars 1.1bn by
the same year.
'We are convinced that the project will pay back its costs,' says Mr Rece.
'What remains to be established is whether or not it can yield a sufficient
rate of return to attract private capital.'
In one sense, the Texas TGV looks like a project of its time. The climate of
opinion in the US seems to be shifting slowly back in favour of rail:
indeed, the High-Speed Rail Development Bill, presently under consideration
by US legislators, would have the effect of putting high-speed rail on the
same footing as other modes of transport which receive federal financial
assistance.
But whether, in practice, this will make any significant difference to the
Texas TGV remains to be seen. Under the terms of the franchise, the
consortium is required to have garnered commitments to an initial Dollars
170m worth of funding by the end of next month. So far, it has only just
passed the Dollars 30m mark and time is running out.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Survey of Texas (8): Baby breaks with the past - Profile:
Southwestern Bell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE thing about San Antonio, deep in southern Texas, is that a river runs
through it. The city has other interesting features - not least the Alamo,
the fort where 189 volunteers died fighting for an independent Texas rather
than surrender to the massed ranks of the Mexican army. But it is the river
that sets the tone of the place, winding its way through the heart of the
city a few feet below street level. Southwestern Bell's head office sits on
its banks.
Until last year, Southwestern Bell had looked as deeply rooted as ever in
its home town of St Louis, Missouri. Although the company became an
independent entity less than a decade ago with the break-up of the Bell
telephone companies into seven Baby Bells, its operations had been based in
St Louis since 1879. The company's decision to transplant its 580
headquarters staff to San Antonio was therefore as much of a shock for
Missouri as it was an economic coup for Texas.
The fact that the Baby Bells are making headlines adds another dimension to
the move. As the companies seek new opportunities outside their heavily
regulated, low growth local telephone businesses, they appear to be
competing to see which can do the biggest deal - as with last month's
multi-billion-dollar merger agreement between Bell Atlantic and
Tele-Communications Inc, the US cable television giant.
Southwestern Bell, though it has yet to match the sheer scale of the Bell
Atlantic deal with TCI, has been at least as busy as most other Baby Bells.
It has become one of the biggest US operators of cellular communications
services; it is spending Dollars 650m to buy two cable systems outside
Washington DC from Hauser Communications; it is one of the three biggest
cable television companies in the UK, and it has acquired a controlling
stake in Telefonos de Mexico, better known as Telmex, the Mexican national
telephone company.
Southwestern Bell readily acknowledges that San Antonio is an attractive
city: it would hardly have relocated there otherwise. But it says the main
reasons for the move were pragmatic, and closely related to its business
strategy.
First was the desire to get closer to the place where most of its business
is done. Southwestern Bell provides local telephone services for nearly 10m
homes and businesses in five south-western states: Texas, Arkansas, Kansas,
Missouri and Oklahoma. But according to Mr Jim Epperson, director of
corporate communications, the company's Texas business is growing much more
rapidly than the rest. Already, the state accounts for 60 per cent of total
corporate revenues, and the figure is expected to reach 70 per cent by the
year 2000.
Mr Epperson says that proximity to the company's biggest customer base is
more than a matter of convenience. 'When you're doing business in Texas, it
makes a big difference to be able to say that you're a Texas headquartered
company,' he says. 'It gives you a clear marketing edge.'
The second reason was the desire to get closer to Telmex. Southwestern
Bell's Dollars 1bn investment in this company appears to have vast
potential. In 1992, only 40 per cent of Mexican households had telephone
lines, but the proportion is growing rapidly: indeed, it is conceivable that
revenues from Southwestern Bell's stake in Telmex could overtake those from
its core business in a decade.
For a US company doing business with Mexico, probably the next best thing to
being in Mexico itself is to be in Texas - and better still, in San Antonio,
the nearest big city to the border. For although Texas is not the only state
to share a border with Mexico, it is easily Mexico's biggest trading
partner: and if, as Southwestern Bell fervently hopes, the North American
Free Trade Agreement is signed, cross-border business will boom, to the
company's great benefit.
According to Mr Michael Wagner, Southwestern Bell's director of investor
relations, the third significant factor lying behind the relocation to Texas
was a cultural one. Like all the Baby Bells, Southwestern Bell has been
trying to demonstrate that it has shaken off the sleepy, moribund management
style of its pre-1984 parent in favour of a bolder approach aimed above all
at increasing shareholder wealth.
The purpose of the move was therefore to mark the break with the past in the
most decisive way possible - by physically uprooting the business and its
employees and moving them to a new environment.
The move notwithstanding, Southwestern Bell still has difficulties to
confront. Like other Baby Bells, it is waging a campaign to shake off the
fetters of a regulatory environment that it regards as outdated in the
fast-changing and increasingly competitive world of communications: for
example, rules that govern the rate of return it is allowed to make on local
telephone services, and barriers preventing its expansion into markets for
other services such as long-distance calls.
There is also the danger that some of these big mergers and acquisitions,
like other flavour-of-the-month corporate sprees, could ultimately prove
less attractive than they appeared.
And if, on occasion, things do not turn out quite as planned, Southwestern
Bell's executives will at least be able to step outside their office block,
take a stroll down the river walk, and console themselves with the thought
that San Antonio is a very pleasant place to be.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Survey of Texas (6): Local power slips away - Financial
institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS this the future of banking in the US? Dominated until recently by a
handful of proud and independent banks, Texas's biggest financial
institutions are now owned by groups based in New York, Ohio and North
Carolina rather than Dallas or Houston.
For most other states, the steady advance of 'super-regional' banking groups
such as NationsBank and BancOne has been a phenomenon of the 1990s.
Texas, by contrast, succumbed to the outsiders back in 1987, when a real
estate collapse - coming hard on the heels of an oil bust - pushed most of
the state's biggest banks over the edge into insolvency.
Six years on, the aftermath of the 1980s banking collapse still hangs
heavily over the financial districts of Dallas and Houston.
For a state which has always boasted its spirit of self-reliance, it remains
a galling fact that several of Texas' largest banks were bailed out by the
federal taxpayer in the form of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Capital supplied by commercial banks from outside the state was also needed
 -by some estimates, 40 per cent of the capital behind Texan banks has been
provided by non-Texan institutions.
Of the 10 largest Texan banks before the collapse, only one - San
Antonio-based Cullen/Frost - remains independent.
The leading institutions now are owned by NationsBank (which acquired
Dallas-based First Republic); BancOne (MCorp); and Chemical (whose
subsidiary, Texas Commerce Bancshares, still operates under its old name.)
The aftermath of the collapse continues to haunt the banks for other
reasons. Many Texan businesses found themselves declared in default, even
though they continued to service their debts.
The reason: the collateral backing their loans, in most cases property, had
fallen in value. Rather than take on such loans with inadequate collateral,
the new bank shareholders in many cases opted to call them into default,
leaving them in the hands of the FDIC.
The resentment among Texan businesses lingers. NationsBank, which was known
as NCNB at the time of its takeover of First Republic, quickly acquired the
nickname 'No Credit to Nobody' - a joke which is still widely repeated.
'I don't doubt it affected people's relationships (with their banks). It
will take a period of time for that to heal,' says Mr Harvey Mitchell,
chairman of BancOne in Texas.
In some ways it was easier for new bank managements, coming to the state
from outside, to call troubled loans into default, he says: also, the new
shareholders would not have been prepared to put in capital if they had had
to take on weakened assets.
The names are not the only things which have changed about Texan banks.
Since the rebirth of the banks under 'foreign' control there has been a
revolution in Texan banking - in part due to changes in regulation even
before the bust.
Until 1986, restrictive state banking law did not allow banks to operate
through branches (although from the early 1970s they had been able to set up
separate subsidiaries around the state.) The result: nearly 2,000, mostly
small banks, and a handful of big institutions which concentrated on
corporate and property lending.
Now, the state's banks are mostly pursuing a strategy familiar elsewhere in
the US: build a network of branches that covers all the main urban centres,
then develop an array of 'products' (including investments) which can be
sold through those branches.
Outside shareholders, aside from putting up the capital to make such
expansion possible, have also been able to provide other resources to help
these more diverse banks develop.
'We picked up some good consumer products from Chemical,' says Mr Robert
Hunter, chief financial officer of Texas Commerce. 'We don't want to develop
all our products from scratch if we can get them off the shelf.' Mr Mitchell
at BancOne adds that the Ohio-based banking group has also brought better
management information systems to its Texas subsidiary.
BancOne and NationsBank have built the largest networks, in part by
acquiring failed savings and loan institutions.
MCorp had 56 branches before it was acquired by BancOne in 1989: it now has
200.
Texas Commerce, by contrast, has remained largely a corporate bank -
benefiting in part because, while its main rivals suffered the upheaval of
passing through the hands of the FDIC, it remained solvent.
This year, though, Texas Commerce has also been actively growing its network
through acquisition - while at the same time shedding branches in smaller
centres where it had a minor presence.
The concentrations of commercial lending which led to eclipse of Texas'
banks in the 1980s are unlikely to recur soon.
In common with banks elsewhere in the US, those in the state are making
fewer commercial loans - thanks to a lack of demand from businesses and a
full-scale retreat from property lending.
As a result, competition for credit-worthy corporate customers has been
rising in the last year, pushing down lending margins. 'You either have to
lower credit quality or lower pricing - most people would start out by
lowering pricing,' says Mr Mitchell. What demand there is comes from small
oil and oil services companies - the biggest finance themselves from
cashflow or in the capital markets - residential construction companies and
a range of small businesses.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Survey of Texas (5): Key to future prosperity - North
American Free Trade Agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the frontier town of Laredo, no one has been waiting for the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
This fast-growing agglomeration of rail yards, truck depots and warehouses,
perched just on the US side of the Transamerican highway, bears testament to
the rapid build-up in US-Mexican trade since the mid-1980s, even without a
free trade agreement between the two countries.
Yet if the North American Free Trade Agreement is not ratified, the future
prosperity of towns such as Laredo - and the Texan economy as a whole -
looks much less assured.
More than a third of US exports to Mexico pass through this ramshackle
border crossing: 671,000 trucks crossed the two bridges that span the Rio
Grande at this point last year, nearly twice as many as three years
previously.
The demand for facilities to handle this burgeoning trade flow has made the
town of Laredo probably the fastest growing in all of Texas. Based on the
building permits issued by the city government, for properties worth Dollars
150m this year, it has been growing at an average of more than 20 per cent a
year for each of the past five years.
Employment on the Texas side of the border has jumped by 40 per cent over
the same period, to about 55,000.
The reason for this feverish growth: Mexico's decision to sign the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). Joining the international trade
liberalisation movement took tariffs on US goods in Mexico down from 80 per
cent or 100 per cent in some cases to an average of only 8 per cent, says Mr
Peter Vargas, Laredo's town manager. That fall has had a far more
significant effect on trade flows between the US and Mexico than is likely
from abolition of the tariffs that remain. 'We've already seen all the
increase with Gatt,' says Mr Vargas. 'I don't think Nafta will be a dramatic
increase.'
However, even though Laredo has boomed without Nafta - and Texas as a whole
has benefited from the increased trade flows - continued prosperity may
depend on the free trade agreement being adopted. To many in Laredo, it is
like an insurance policy - a confirmation that Mexico will continue to
pursue the liberalising economic policies which have been so beneficial in
recent years.
'It will institutionalise in an international agreement the economic
practices that have been put in place by the Mexican president,' says Mr
Vargas. Like others, though, he warns of the danger of Mexican retaliation
if the US Congress refuses to ratify the treaty: 'If Mexico decided to
withdraw from Gatt, it would have a devastating effect on the Texas
economy.'
Across the Rio Grande, on the Mexican side of the border, the mirror-image
city of Nuevo Laredo has been immersed in its own pursuit of new prosperity.
It is a distorting mirror, though: Nuevo Laredo's packed-together tenements
and bustling streets are a reminder of the economic gulf that lies between
the two cities, and their respective countries.
Nuevo Laredo, like other Mexican towns along the border with the US, has
already seen the benefits of US investment. Under the Maquiladora programme,
begun in the 1960s, assembly plants along the Mexican side of the border can
receive components from the US side tariff-free, provided the finished
articles are re-exported to the US.
Some 20,000 people work in the 70-odd Maquiladoras in Nuevo Laredo. Most of
the new jobs have come since 1986, when there were only 22 plants employing
a total of 4,000 people.
Production standards and attention to quality here have been driven by
demanding US managers, for whom Mexico has become a significant source of
low-wage assembly jobs.
'Compromisos de produccion' (production targets) declares the the wall sign
as you enter the Elamex plant in Nuevo Laredo where 200 workers earn Dollars
6 a day each mending portable telephones sent across from the US side. Many
of these telephones have already been shipped back to the US for repair from
China and other countries in the Far East, before being sent on across the
Mexican border.
The target is for no more than 10,000 defects per 1m - or 1 per cent.
Another sign shows the monthly pattern so far this year, putting the average
defect rate so far at 9,300 per 1m.
Whatever the outcome for Nafta, such operations - which operate with a
skilled workforce and an attention to quality - should continue to prosper,
even though the initial reason for setting them up on the border would
disappear in a free-trade environment.
In the same way that Laredo has benefited from its position on the border
between Mexico and the US, the state of Texas as a whole has been well
situated to take advantage of the growing trade links. According to a 1991
study by Perryman Consultants, an economic consultancy based in Waco,
Texas's exports to Mexico amount to Dollars 10bn a year. Directly and
indirectly, this export business contributes Dollars 27.6bn annually to the
Texan economy and supports 290,000 jobs in the state.
The successful completion of Nafta would cement Texas' position at the heart
of trade flows with Mexico. Should the agreement fail, though, one of the
state's biggest engines of future economic growth could easily stall.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Survey of Texas (2): Second-biggest industry in the US -
Agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first sight of Texas can come as a shock to those brought up on episodes
of The Lone Ranger, an American television series depicting the adventures
of the eponymous Texan hero and his faithful Indian friend Tonto. While the
image firmly etched in people's minds is that of a barren landscape
punctuated only by the occasional cactus, the reality turns out to be
somewhat different.
True, there is dryness and dust in the west of the state for those who go
out of their way to find it, but the rest of Texas is predominantly fertile.
How else, after all, would its agricultural industry have become the
second-biggest in the US, surpassed only by California's?
Although the energy industry still ranks as the number one contributor to
the Texas economy, agriculture is not far behind. Some 78 per cent of the
state's total land area is in agricultural production, and about 20 per cent
of the workforce is in agriculture-related employment. Income from farm
sales was Dollars 11.6bn last year.
The biggest single farming activity is ranching. Texas, famously, is cattle
country: at the last count it had 14.3m head of cattle and calves, more than
twice as many as any other state, and cattle sales account for more than
half the state's annual agricultural income.
The other agricultural activity for which Texas is best known is cotton
production. In this, too, it ranks as the biggest US producer, with annual
sales accounting for 13 per cent of agricultural income.
But beyond these two dominant farming activities lie a myriad others. The
sheer size of Texas means it encompasses an unusually wide variety of
climatic conditions, and this in turn has given rise to an unusually varied
agricultural output.
In addition to cattle and calves, livestock rearing in Texas extends to
horses, sheep, goats, pigs and poultry: while crop production extends beyond
cotton to peanuts, rice, wheat, oats, sorghum, soybean, vegetables and
citrus fruits.
Even so, the Texan agricultural industry is subject to the same economic
pressures afflicting farming throughout most of the western world. Increases
in yields and productivity have led to agricultural surpluses and,
inevitably, a steady decline in prices. Profits have come under pressure and
farmers have had to become more efficient to survive - though many, in Texas
as elsewhere, have been protected from the full force of the market by
government intervention of one sort or another.
In Texas, the result of these economic pressures has been a small but
nevertheless perturbing decline in farming activity. The number of farms in
the state has fallen from 188,000 to 183,000 in the last five years. In some
cases, the farms have been acquired and merged into other, larger,
operations as part of the continuing pressure for efficiencies of scale. But
the total acreage of land in production has fallen, too - from 133m acres to
130m acres over the last five years: and last year's farm income of Dollars
11.6bn represented a 5 per cent decline on the previous year's Dollars
12.2bn.
One way in which Texas is fighting back is through diversification into new
agricultural markets. One example is fish farming: the state has 143
commercial catfish farms with 1,400 acres of water in production. Another is
bees: Texas produced Dollars 6m worth of honey last year. Deer, meanwhile,
are becoming increasingly popular for their meat, and other breeds starting
to make an appearance include ostriches and emus.
The reason why these new breeds are important is that they enable small
farmers to make money. Some 67 per cent of Texas farmland is owned by
farmers with holdings of 200 acres or less, and it is nowadays increasingly
difficult for them to make money out of the few head of sheep or cattle that
such a small acreage will support. Deer, however, require far less land per
head than cattle and their meat fetches much higher prices, so holding out
the prospect of a return to profitability.
However, according to Mr Rick Perry, the Texas commissioner for agriculture,
there is a much more important issue at stake than diversification into
unusual breeds, and that is the need for Texans to become food processors as
well as food producers.
As Mr Perry explains, out of the vast quantities of food produced each year
in Texas, only a small proportion is actually processed in the state. The
rest goes elsewhere in the US and all over the world for processing: cotton
to Carolina, for example, leather to Italy, wool and mohair to England.
'We never were a British colony but we certainly act like one,' Mr Perry
says. (Texas joined the Union after Independence). 'We only process 8 per
cent of what we grow. All the rest we send away to have the value added by
someone else.'
Mr Perry sees the introduction of more food processing as vital to the fight
against rural decline. As part of the effort, the Texas Agricultural Finance
Authority has been established to guarantee loans to new or expanding
businesses in the food processing industry. In the two years since its
formation, it has underwritten 34 loans totalling Dollars 25m and claims to
have created, or at least retained, some 4,700 jobs.
Mr Perry says his family has been ranching in Texas for five generations, so
he understands production well. 'But I also recognise that the days are past
when we could stay above the tumult of the increasing costs of doing
business simply by increasing production. For 40 years we have been doing
that, and we have just about reached the apex in terms of introducing new
varieties and achieving increases in production.
Processing has to be the answer, he says - even more so if the North
American Free Trade Agreement is signed, for increasing prosperity south of
the border is whetting the appetite of better-off Mexicans for processed
American foods.
'Some day agriculture in Texas will overtake oil in dollar receipts if we
concentrate on processing as well as growing,' Mr Perry predicts.

High-tech industries

IT would have been quite a contrast, had it happened. At ground level, 35
miles due south of Dallas, life in the picture postcard town of Waxahachie
would have continued in much the same tranquil way as ever. But beneath the
surface, scientists would have been carrying out the world's biggest
atom-smashing experiment.
The plan was to spend Dollars 11bn on the construction of a supercolliding
superconductor under Waxahachie. The town would be completely encircled by a
54-mile tunnel lined with magnets. Physicists would fire protons through the
tunnel and accelerate them to just below the speed of light before crashing
them into one another.
With a bit of luck, the result would be to produce even smaller particles,
which might resolve some basic questions about the nature of matter.
In the end, Congress decided that the cash-strapped nation could no longer
afford to indulge the scientists' curiosity, and last month it pulled the
plug on the already part-built project.
To most other states, the cancellation of such a large high-technology
project would have come as a resounding blow. But it says something about
the development of high tech in Texas that the state seems relatively
unconcerned about the effects the decision might have on its economy.
The reason is that the high-tech sector in Texas has grown to a size where
the cancellation of a single project is only a minor setback. Where once
cattle and cotton were the state's booming industries, and later oil, now
the high tech sector has become an engine of growth.
Organisations include the vast and the tiny; the public sector and the
private; the home-grown and the new arrivals: and their fields of activity
range from biotechnology to space exploration.
Some specialities have tended to cluster geographically: for example, Dallas
claims to have the world's highest concentration of telecommunications
equipment manufacturers, with 360 companies occupying a telecoms corridor in
the northern suburb of Richardson.
Houston is probably best known outside Texas for the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration space centre, presently working on the development
of a space station. But it is also home to Compaq, the computer giant; and
the Texas Medical Centre in Houston, said to be the world's largest medical
complex, has spawned thousands of jobs in medical research and
biotechnology.
San Antonio is also strong on biotechnology and biomedicine, hosting the
South Texas Medical Center, the University of Texas Health Science Center,
the University of Texas Institute of Biotechnology, and the Southwest
Foundation for Biomedical Research.
But perhaps the jewel in the Texas high-tech crown is Austin, the state
capital. Here, about 55,000 people are employed by 450 high-tech enterprises
 -among them, the home-grown Dell Computer and CompuAdd - while two
consortiums, Sematech and the Microelectronics and Computer Technology
Corporation, design the next generation of semiconductors and computers.
Although not quite yet on a par with California's Silicon Valley, the city
and its surrounding area have already been dubbed Silicon Hills.
The result of this activity is that Texas now claims to have more scientists
and engineers within its borders than any state except New York and
California. It also expects the growth to continue: high-tech industries
will provide almost half the new manufacturing jobs in the state over the
next 35 years, it believes.
According to Mr Michael Klonsinski, programme director at the Texas
Department of Commerce's office of advanced technology, the beginnings of
these inroads into high technology date back to the 1960s when Texas set out
to prove that it was more than just a roughneck ranching and oil state.
The oil money helped - for example, financing an excellent academic
infrastructure and bankrolling high-tech entrepreneurs. So did the state's
considerable political and business influence, which helped bring big
high-tech projects and contracts to the state. And an unusual alliance
between state and local government, the private sector and the academic
world has been a powerful force in building up the high-tech industry.
The number of people employed in Texas high-tech industries has grown by 20
per cent to 331,000 in the past five years. One reason is that Texas now
offers all the high-technology infrastructure that businesses require -
universities, research institutions, manufacturers and suppliers. Employers
are also attracted by the fact that Texas is one of only two states in the
US with a growing youth population (the other is Oklahoma). And the low cost
of living is attractive to employers and employees alike.
Mr Joel Kocher, worldwide sales president at Austin-based Dell Computer,
says the cost of living has become particularly important in the computer
industry because of the 'commoditisation' of the market. As computer
technology has converged and products have become increasingly similar,
customers have started to buy on price, putting manufacturers under pressure
to examine their costs as never before.
Small wonder that Silicon Valley is moving to Silicon Hills, he says.
'Silicon Valley is probably the most expensive area you could locate a
company in today except for New York City,' says Mr Kocher. 'The cost of
living there is outrageous. The median cost of housing in San Franciso is
probably twice what it is here.'
Yet can Texas hold on to its lead? Is there not a danger that other states
will jump on the bandwagon and lure companies away with even lower costs?
Possibly, Mr Kocher says. 'In this country, success breeds competition, so
there is no doubt other states will try.'
Even so, he believes the Texas high-tech sector will continue to thrive
because so few places can match it for its infrastructure and its low-cost,
highly educated labour pool.
'You go to Wyoming, and you are going to have a very difficult time
attracting talent.'

FT  15 NOV 93 / Survey of Texas (4): Living in much reduced circumstances -
Energy sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEXANS have always had a simple way of taking the pulse of their oil and gas
industry: count the number of drilling rigs scattered across the horizon.
When the numbers go up - usually in response to higher energy prices -
Texans tend to smile more broadly.
Based on this rough-and-ready test, the state's energy sector is living in
much reduced circumstances.
At the end of October, there were 860 rigs at work in the US - a far cry
from the oil boom that drove the state's economy for nearly a decade, until
1982. In that year, more than 4,000 oil rigs pierced the sky, most of them
thrown up by speculators trying to get in on the action. Texas is reckoned
to account for nearly half of all rigs in use.
The number of workers in the Texan energy industry has echoed the decline in
the rig count. In the mid-1980s, Texas lost 144,400 jobs in oil and gas
industry, nearly half of the total.
These bald figures, though, tell only part of the story. For a start, the
boom times represent a poor point of comparison: such feverish speculation
is unlikely to return. Also, the energy industry has moved forward. Advances
in the technologies used to find and drill for new reserves, and better
control of costs, make direct comparisons tenuous.
Compared with five years ago, drilling activities cost half as much and are
twice as likely to result in a find, says Mr Richard Kinder, president of
Enron, the fast-growing natural gas company.
'We don't need to get back to 4,000 because we're so much more efficient -
1,200 is now the optimum count to sustain production (at its current rate.)'
Also, drilling activity is at its highest level for the past two years,
despite the slump in the oil price. A one-year-old spike in natural gas
prices has provided the incentive to keep many of the wildcatters going. Two
years ago, about 40 per cent of rigs were searching for gas rather than oil;
now the figure is 50 per cent.
Texas also stands to benefit from having what could be the US's last big
undeveloped oilfield on its doorstep. Undiscovered reserves in deep-water
areas in the Gulf of Mexico are put by the US government at the equivalent
of 14bn barrels of oil.
Deep-water drilling in the Gulf is still in its infancy. Since 1978, when
the first well at a depth of more than 1,000 feet was drilled, only five
other projects have gone as deep. Part of the risk is that the Gulf has yet
to develop a network of pipelines to carry the oil produced. As yet only the
largest discoveries, which justify the construction of their own pipelines,
are worth developing.
The oil companies say that, given the higher risks, they need the taxpayers'
support for deep-water exploration and production. Deep-water production
already attracts a lower royalty charge than that in shallow-water areas:
the oil companies are now asking Washington for tax relief of Dollars 5 a
barrel for all oil produced in the deep-water Gulf. This would undoubtedly
provide a spur to the local energy sector - the oil companies say it would
create 100,000 new jobs in Texas and Lousiana. So far, though, the call has
fallen on deaf ears.
Big projects in the Gulf - like that announced by Shell Oil and BP
Exploration last month, to produce oil from one the deepest sites in the
world, known as Mars - are helping to make Houston a leader in the
development of deep-water drilling technology. Big investments in
exploration and production made by US companies abroad are also keeping
Houston busy: the biggest energy groups, in search of giant discoveries to
boost their reserves, are directing more of their exploration and production
budget overseas, to countries such as Russia and China.
The many companies that support the energy industry - whether drilling for
oil or building refineries and chemicals plants - have had to adapt to
become more international as a result. With the passing of the last oil
boom, the myriad small oil service companies in Texas went through a phase
of consolidation, merging to create bigger entities that could withstand the
downturn as well as afford the investment in new drilling technology.
Now, another wave of consolidation is under way, leading to the creation of
fewer, bigger companies able to take on the bigger risks
Dallas-based Dresser Industries, for example, is in the process of absorbing
Baroid to make itself the US's fourth-largest oil services group. Energy
groups now look to oil service companies to manage all aspects of an
exploration project, says Mr John Murphy, Dresser's chairman.
Dresser has also followed its biggest customers internationally in the past
decade. 'It wasn't some grand plan to shift our business internationally -
hell, that's where the market went,' says Mr Murphy.
While much exploration and production has shifted off-shore or overseas, the
downstream business of refining has also kept Houston busy - along with a
rash of construction in the petrochemical industry along the Gulf coast of
Texas and Lousiana.
The second half of the 1980s witnessed significant capital investment in new
plants, and the upgrade of existing refineries to comply with new petroleum
standards. The largest project under way in Houston at present, a Dollars
1bn joint venture between Shell and Pemex, the Mexican state oil group,
involves an upgrade of a Shell refinery.
According to Texas Commerce Bank, about Dollars 1bn a year was spent during
the 1980s to comply with the compulsory phase-out of leaded petrol or to
meet the increasing demand for higher-octane fuel.
By 1985, Texas had more capacity for making ethylene, one of the basic
feedstocks of the petrochemicals industry, than any other country in the
world, including the rest of the US, according to Mr Bernard Weinstein, an
economics professor at the University of North Texas. Much of that capacity
sat idle through the US, and then the global, economic slowdown arrived.
When conditions improve in the cyclical petrochemicals industry, the state
should benefit accordingly.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Survey of Texas (1): Tradition of self-reliance challenged -
The challenge to Texans is how to adapt to a new world, while retaining the
powerful qualities which have made their state among the most vibrant and
successful. Can Texans remain Texan despite the changes?
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TEXAS is facing something of an identity crisis. The proud inhabitants of
the second-biggest state in the union have long fed on myths of Texas's past
to nurture their sense of separateness from the rest of the nation - the
wide open frontier spaces on which vast herds of cattle were reared; the
successive oil booms that have punctuated Texan history from the first
gusher on Spindeltop in 1901 to the boom of the 1970s and early 1980s.
These are the myths that Texans embrace each time they don their cowboy
boots and hats and head off in their pick-up trucks to the local honky-tonk.
The reality of Texan society and its economic base has diverged markedly
from this self-image in the past decade. The challenge to Texans is how to
adapt to this new world, while holding on to the powerful qualities which
have made their state among the most vibrant and successful.
The social changes which are transforming Texas stem from at least three
sources. First, there has been an influx of people over the past 20 years
from other states. Many came from the rustbelt states of the north in the
late 1970s and early 1980s, as steel-making and manufacturing industries
there shrank and manufacturing and energy-related jobs in Texas boomed. The
state's population jumped from 7.7m in 1950 to 17m in 1990. These new Texans
have brought with them new aspirations, nurtured in the cities of the north.
Second, Texas has shifted from a rural to an urban society. While the myths
of Texas are still rooted in the land, the fastest-growing areas have been
the cities of Houston and Dallas. Houston's population climbed from just
over 2m in 1970 to 3.9m in 1990, making it the US's fourth most populous
city. To outsiders, these cities look like most other parts of America: vast
urban sprawls in which the car is king, and where excessive 1980s
development has left the skyline littered with many unremarkable and often
half-empty commercial property developments.
Third, the dominance of the state's white Anglo-Saxon inhabitants has been
diluted by a rapid growth in the Hispanic population. Hispanics accounted
for 18 per cent of the population in 1970: by 1990, the proportion had grown
to 25 per cent, and 30 years from now it will be 38 per cent, according to a
forecast by a group set up by state comptroller, John Sharp.
At the same time, Texas's relative wealth compared with the rest of the US
has declined. In the middle of the last oil boom, its average income per
head rose to 3 per cent above the national average: it has since shrunk back
to 10 per cent below, points out Bernard Weinstein, a professor of economics
at North Texas University. Some 18 per cent of Texans are judged to be below
the poverty level, considerably higher than the national average.
These shifts are challenging the state's traditional belief in self-reliance
and its fear of the corrosive effects of social welfare. The questions now
being asked of Texas' political and social institutions are whether they
have kept pace with the shifts in its social and economic base. The state
can still point proudly to the fact that it does not impose a state-level
income tax, and that it ranks 48th among the 50 states in terms of its total
taxes per head, some 40 per cent below the national average. However,
concern about the quality of public education is high, and many of the new
Texans who come from elsewhere in the US have brought with them a different
attitude to public spending.
The state's economy is also in the midst of a transformation. While much of
the first 157 years of Texan economic history can be summed up in three
words - cattle, agriculture and oil - the future will be much more mixed.
The traumas caused by the last boom-and-bust in the energy sector still
resonate. In 1980, oil and gas accounted for 27 per cent of the Texan
economy. By 1990, it had fallen to only 13 per cent. Nearly half of all jobs
in the energy sector were shed during the 1980s - although the past five
years has witnessed a partial recovery.
Other industries have grown and replaced many of those lost jobs.
Healthcare, electronics, transport, finance, government, retailing, clothing
 -industries which have supported modest industrial growth in other US
states as well. The Texas Medical Centre, a concentration of not-for-profit
hospitals based in the middle of Houston, employs more people in the city
than the oil and gas industry for which it has long been famous.
Texas has benefited by going through its downturn before the rest of the
nation. The property market's tumble - and the collapse of some of the
state's biggest banks - came in 1986 and 1987. While the vacancy rate in
commercial properties in Dallas is 36 per cent, the banks have long since
shed the troubled property loans which threatened to sink them.
The steady but unspectacular pace of economic growth in the state since 1987
looks very un-Texan. True, it has come at a time when the rest of the US has
been struggling to find any growth at all: but when set against the standard
myths of Texan excess, the 1.5-2.5 per cent annual growth rate seems very
anaemic.
The state has benefited greatly from the liberalisation of the Mexican
economy since the mid-1980s, which has spurred trade across the
Texas-Mexican border. If ratified by the US Congress on November 17 - an
outcome which is by no means certain - the North American Free Trade
Agreement will cement this trading relationship with Mexico, underpinning
the state's economic advance of recent years.
Nevertheless, coming after the traumas of the mid-1980s the steady pace of
growth and the more diverse economic base are welcome to most Texans. A more
diverse economic base is, however, making the state look increasingly like
the rest of the US.
Can Texas remain Texan amid all these changes? Mr Richard Kinder, president
of Enron, a natural gas company, is a new Texan, having come from the
mid-West in the 1970s. Chewing a fat cigar in his expansive office in
downtown Houston, he is typical of the outsiders who have wholeheartedly
embraced the Texan myths yet want to see the state progress further away
from its rural, redneck past. 'Texas is very good at attracting the
entrepreneurs and the dreamers,' he says. 'I hope we can throw out the
prejudice, but keep the positive.'
The spirit of Texas may find outward manifestation in the myths of its own
past, but it continues to thrive in the new era. Houston, with its
free-wheeling business culture and open society, and Texas's other cities,
thrive on the same qualities which first made the state great.
It is a spirit captured by Nicholas Lemman in a contribution in 1986 to
Texas Myths, quoted by Bernard Weinstein: 'I used to take the earliest
flight from Austin to Houston a lot, at the end of which the cargo of
businessmen would burst out of the aircraft as if it were a starting gate.
Sometimes the stewardess, after saying goodbye over the public address
system, would add sweetly, 'Hope y'all make a lot of money today'. Texas is
the only place I've been where one hears it said of someone, in a quiet tone
of sympathy mingled with pity, 'Ol' Norman works for a salary'.'

FT  15 NOV 93 / UK Gilts: Little change seen before Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADERS will be watching out for a spate of economic data this week which
will affect demand for gilts. However, they are expecting only subdued price
movements ahead of the Budget on November 30.
Many investors are hoping for a further steady upward movement in gilt
prices after the market rally on Friday, which saw long-dated gilts gain
about 1 point on the back of favourable data about UK trade and theories
that inflation pressures were subdued.
This Wednesday sees publication of the retail prices index for the year to
last month, which City economists think will show a rise of 1.7 per cent,
compared with the 1.8 per cent increase in the year to September. The
consensus view on the underlying inflation rate - the year-on-year change in
the RPI excluding mortgage interest rates - is that it will turn out to be
3.2 per cent after 3.3 per cent in the previous month.
Also on Wednesday, traders will take in data for retail sales volumes. In
September, they rose by 0.5 per cent on the month to stand 3.5 per cent
higher than a year earlier, lending weight to evidence that consumer
spending is the driving force behind the recovery. The consensus forecast is
for a slightly smaller monthly increase in October of 0.3 per cent.
Last Friday's trade data - even with the doubts about the reliability of the
new European Union system for collecting import and export figures -
generally encouraged hopes that export growth was fairly strong while import
expansion appears to be slowing down.
UK export values were at record levels in August, continuing a strong trend
since the start of the year, while on the basis of the new figures,
underlying import volumes have barely increased since sterling's devaluation
14 months ago. That led to higher expectations that inflationary pressures
were likely to be fairly modest for some time, due to only weak demand.
Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, said: 'The data are
consistent with the recovery profile being biased towards exports and with
price pressures staying weak.'
Mr Nigel Richardson, an economist at Yamaichi, said the gilt market was also
cheered by news that - even though manufacturing output increased by a
seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent in September - the recovery was
insufficient to prevent a 0.1 per cent decline in manufacturing output
between the second and third quarters.
That strengthened the view of many gilt investors that factory activity was
not about to weaken, but at the same time was still some way short of
picking up in a way that would generate inflation.
Helped by generally encouraging data on US inflation, long-dated gilt yields
fell on the week on a par basis while short-dated yields held roughly
constant. The 8.75 per cent Treasury bond due in 2017 had a yield of 7.13
per cent on Friday night, compared with 7.27 per cent the week before. The
yield of the shorter dated 7.25 per cent Treasury bond maturing in 1998 was
quoted at 6.08 per cent at the close of last week, down from 6.15 per cent
seven days previously.
Indications that the economy is continuing on a recovery path - and with
little sign that price pressures are increasing - may strengthen the chances
that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will risk a fiscal tightening in the
Budget on November 30 without worrying that this will hold back the upturn.

FT  15 NOV 93 / US Money and Credit: Attention riveted on Senate Nafta vote
on Wednesday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FATE of the North American Free Trade Agreement hangs on a cliff-hanger
vote in the US House of Representatives on Wednesday - and so, too, could
sentiment in the US stock and bond markets.
Defeat for Nafta, which will create a free trade area between the US, Mexico
and Canada, could prompt a sharp sell-off in the American securities
markets.
It is easy to see why stock markets should be upset by a 'no' vote. The
preponderance of evidence suggests that Nafta will boost US growth, and
corporate America, which usually knows which side its bread is buttered,
strongly supports the treaty.
Failure of Nafta would also throw into grave doubt the chances of agreement
in the Uruguay round of global trade liberalisation talks, which in turn
could set off a round of beggar-my-neighbour trade protectionist measures.
But why should the credit markets, which thrive on slow economic growth,
because this usually means low inflation, be concerned at a Nafta defeat?
First, because this would represent a severe setback for the Clinton
administration, which has belatedly lobbied hard for Nafta, and would cast
doubt on the administration's ability to push through the rest of its policy
agenda. The market does not like political uncertainty.
Second, Messrs John Lipsky and Robert DiClemente of Salomon Brothers,
suggest that rejection of Nafta, accompanied by rising protectionist
sentiment, would actually boost the bond market's long-term inflation
jitters.
'Stalled progress in breaking down trade barriers also would invite new
pessimism about long-term productivity trends, making it harder for the
Federal Reserve to keep inflation down.'
As it is, Wall Street last week regained some of its nerve about
inflationary trends, following the bond market's sharp sell-off the previous
week in the face of good US economic news.
The market took heart from news of a 0.2 per cent drop in the producer price
index during October - far better than the 0.3 per cent increase widely
expected - while a 0.4 per cent rise in the consumer price index was in line
with market forecasts. Many analysts expect the consumer index to rise by a
modest 3 per cent, or possibly less, next year.
However, the positive impact of these figures was largely offset by some
unsettling statistics: a 1.5 per cent jump in the Commodity Research Index,
led by increases in grain and soya-bean contracts, and then on Friday a 1.5
per cent rise in October retail sales - the biggest gain in six months.
The retail report initially pushed bond prices lower but the market rallied
later on Friday, when analysts decided the figures were due more to higher
prices, already factored into their inflation expectations, than a sudden
splurge in consumer spending. Sentiment was also helped by a drop in the
University of Michigan's consumer confidence index.
The upshot was that the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue closed on Friday
night with a yield of 6.15 per cent, down from 6.20 at the end of the
previous week.
Tomorrow, the Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee will
hold one of its regular six-weekly meetings, amid speculation that the
somewhat stronger signs of growth might encourage it to adopt a 'bias
towards tightening', while not actually raising interest rates.
The Fed funds rate is expected to remain for a considerable time yet at 3
per cent, where it has been for the past 14 months.
That, along with the relatively humdrum nature of this week's statistical
news (housing starts and industrial production) means the market's attention
will be riveted on Wednesday's Nafta vote.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Italian Government Bonds: Good response expected to 30-year
sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE concerns about the Italian government bond market's volatility,
political instability in Italy, and its poor inflation record, the signs are
that the first auction by Rome of 30-year government bonds tomorrow will be
well received by traders.
In the grey market, the new 30-year paper was trading at a yield spread of
50 - 55 basis points over 10-year government bonds at the end of last week.
By comparison, in the French government bond market, 30-year bonds trade at
a spread of nearly 70 basis points above 10-year bonds.
This means that the new Italian bonds could look rather expensive for
investors.
International investors often look at foreign debt ratings (even when
judging domestic debt): France is rated triple-A by both Moody's Investors
Service and Standard &amp; Poor's, while Italy is rated AA by S&amp;P and has
slipped, rather controversially, to A1, according to Moody's.
Investors, therefore, may baulk at paying a higher yield spread over 10-year
bonds for 30-year Italian debt than they would for French.
With 10-year Italian bonds yielding around 9.2 per cent, this means a yield
of around 9.7 per cent for the new 30-year.
The spread between the two is about the same as in the Dutch government bond
market, where 10-year bonds yield 5.8 per cent and 30-year bonds 6.35 per
cent.
No other European country has 30-year government bonds (the longest-dated
gilts mature in 2027), but there are 30-year Ecu bonds.
So why is the spread so tight in the grey market? The main reason seems to
be lack of supply.
The size of the first auction is only L2,000bn, and the novelty of the issue
appears to have attracted droves of traders ahead of the auction.
However, grey market prices are not always reflected in auction results,
according to traders.
Many fund managers are likely to stand back until prices have had a chance
to settle down.
'We are very bullish (on the Italian market) and we like the idea of a
30-year,' said Mr Andy Seaman, a bond fund manager at Guinness Flight in
London. 'Inflation will remain low and real yields are among the highest
around.'
However, Mr Seaman says he will 'wait to see what happens' before buying any
paper, arguing that off-the-run 10-year bonds appear to offer better value
currently.
The Italian government bond market has been one of the success stories of
the year, posting total returns of around 28 per cent for the first 10
months of the year, according to JP Morgan's government bond index.
But the market has also been highly volatile and it lost substantial ground
earlier this month, underperforming other markets when they were all dragged
down by US Treasury market weakness. This could discourage some investors
from buying 30-year paper, particularly if it is tightly priced.
'The inflation story in Italy is still that its track record is quite poor,
and 30-year stock will be extremely volatile and risky because these fears
will be reflected,' said Mr Jouni Kokko, an international economist at SG
Warburg.
At the end of last week, the Italian market perked up again, buoyed by
several pieces of long-awaited good news; in particular, the budget approval
by the senate, and the approval of new rules on refunding withholding tax to
foreign investors.
For the Italian government, the expected success of the 30-year deal will be
another step in its efforts to bring its heavy debt burden under control.
One target has been to extend the average maturity of its debt, which is
currently just three years. The Republic launched a successful Dollars 5.5bn
global offering of 10-year and 30-year bonds in September.
According to a Treasury official, only 26 per cent of Italian debt is
long-term and fixed-rate.
Despite the likely success of the 30-year issue, and a short burst of good
news, the chances are that the market will remain volatile. With elections
likely early next year, and political scandal still rife, investors in
30-year bonds could find that they get a rather bumpy ride.
However, given the general view that European interest rates are set to fall
further, and Italy will be one of the main beneficiaries - and given that
yields approaching double-digits are increasingly hard to come by - there
are good reasons for buying the paper, even if not at the first auction.
The Treasury is promising to provide enough paper to ensure liquidity, and
the initial L2,000bn is 'certainly not enough,' said the official.
He said that he was encouraged by the strong trading of the new bonds in the
grey market, 'but we will do more anyway'.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Risk and Reward: Study says consumers could benefit from use
of derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERIVATIVE instruments are still an unfamiliar concept to most ordinary
consumers in the UK. But the growth of the wholesale derivative markets in
recent years has had a considerable, if indirect, impact on the retail
market.
The most obvious development for UK consumers has been the ready supply of
fixed-rate mortgages at a time of low interest rates. By using the options
market, mortgage lenders have been able to offer mortgage holders the chance
to lock in lower interest rates and fix their expenditure over a period of
several years, without themselves taking on exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates.
But are consumers really getting a good deal? Mr Andrew Dobson, an
independent consultant and former investment banker, thinks not. In a study
called Derivatives for the Retail Client, published by the Centre for the
Study of Financial Innovation, an independent think-tank, he argues that
derivative instruments should play a greater role in reducing risk in the
retail market.
In the case of fixed-rate mortgages, for example, terms are not favourable:
the fixing tends to be of short duration, and with high penalties for
cancellation. Further, the consumer can only purchase the fixed-rate
mortgage from the existing mortgage provider.
Consumers, especially in the UK, have learnt the risks of mortgage debt the
hard way: many saw interest rates rise steeply at the end of the 1980s while
the value of their properties dipped.
While the advent of partial fixing is an improvement, Mr Dobson advocates
something more radical: that consumers should enter into two transactions, a
loan and a hedge against changes in interest rates, which they could shop
around for, and which could be refinanced or adjusted independently. He
believes it would be more efficient to 'separate funding from interest rate
management', as is done in the capital markets.
Further, he suggests the creation of a financing instrument or futures
contract based on an index of house prices, which would enable homeowners to
protect themselves against house price movements. Such an instrument, he
said, would also interest expatriates temporarily out of the housing market
or people saving to buy houses.
Mr Dobson also suggests that derivatives have applications in the field of
personal pensions, given the current trend away from salary-based company
pensions towards personal pensions. There is a shift of risk away from the
company towards the individual, yet, Mr Dobson notes, the individual does
not have access to derivative products to help manage those new risks.
Another potential application put forward by Mr Dobson is the hedging of
consumers' commodity-type expenditure, such as electricity, gas and
telephone bills.
He points out that while those in employment have a natural hedge in the
form of income likely to respond to inflation, those with fixed incomes may
wish to hedge these expense streams. Such a product could take the form of a
price guarantee instrument, which did not require full payment up-front, or
fully prefunded energy units.
So why, given that the technology already exists, has a retail market for
derivatives not yet developed? According to Mr Dobson, one reason is that
the wholesale markets, where derivative instruments are developed, are
isolated from the retail side of the business.
More fundamental is the fear that the risks involved in derivatives could
lead to large-scale losses for consumers, possibly because they have been
sold the wrong products.
However, Mr Dobson argues that 'the techniques and equipment already exist
to make such trades no harder to negotiate and record, and no more dangerous
to the client, than traditional lending or deposit-taking transactions'.
But given the fears of regulators about the risks involved in derivatives in
the wholesale market, it is hard to imagine them embracing the notion of
placing these complex and potentially dangerous instruments in the hands of
consumers.

FT  15 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Solution found to Bank of Scotland tax
poser
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERYTHING was going swimmingly in the undated sterling Eurobond market
until a couple of weeks ago, when someone decided to kick up a fuss about
tax.
This sector of the international bond market had been growing steadily over
the past two years because it provided UK financial institutions with a
cost-effective way to improve their capital ratios.
At the same time, pension funds and insurance companies were keen to buy
these high-yielding and long-dated assets because they could write their
business against them. They were also popular with retail investors seeking
to preserve their income as interest rates fell.
Last year, a new structure was devised to cut the cost of issuing these
securities further, but at the same time safeguarding their eligibility to
classify as tier-two capital.
Under the new structure, a call option, usually 10 or 20 years after issue,
and a simultaneous increase or 'step-up' in the coupon have been
incorporated into the bonds.
For example, if the issue came at a spread of 150 basis point over the yield
on the 20-year UK government bond (gilt) and the issuer does not call the
bonds, the coupon is re-set for a further five years at the higher of either
the existing coupon or the yield on the then five-year gilt plus 250 basis
points.
Investors have been willing to pay a little more for these so-called
'stepped-coupon' bonds because, although the bonds are undated, they are
perceived to have a finite maturity. This is because the nature of the call
option makes it highly likely that the issuer will exercise the option, with
the prior consent of the Bank of England.
Since these bonds offered benefits to the issuers and the investors, they
performed well in the secondary market and their yield spreads over gilts
tightened considerably.
From June last year to August this year, just over Pounds 1.3bn worth of the
bonds were issued by a range of UK financial institutions, mainly
high-street banks and building societies. However, even Bupa, the private
medical insurer, hopped on the bandwagon with a Pounds 100m issue in April
this year.
Despite all the benefits which the new structure offered, it also created a
fiscal problem for taxable investors because the potential rise in the
coupon on the bonds meant that the bonds were caught by a UK tax law
designed to prevent 'coupon-washing'.
This is a form of tax avoidance whereby taxable investors sell their bonds
just before the coupon is paid to a non-taxable investor and buy them back
afterwards.
Coupon-washing was outlawed in the UK in 1988, when the Income and
Corporation Taxes Act was passed. Section 717 (2) of the Act states which
bonds are taxed neutrally under the Accrued Income Scheme (AIS) and which
are not.
Those which are permitted neutral tax treatment under the AIS are bonds
either with a fixed rate of coupon, or with a coupon fixed over a published
base rate or a published price index. All other bonds are 'variable-rate'
instruments.
Under the AIS, both the buyer and the seller of bonds which are eligible for
neutral tax treatment are taxed on the interest that has accrued during
their respective period of ownership of the bonds.
By contrast, if variable-rate bonds are traded between interest payment
dates, both the buyer and the seller pay tax on the interest accrued on the
date of sale. As a result, accrued interest on these bonds is taxed twice.
Since the interest rate paid on 'stepped-coupon' bonds can change during the
life of the bonds, they are classified as 'variable-rate' bonds and are
therefore subject to penal tax treatment.
The tax position, which was included in the prospectuses of the issues
launched since June 1992, did not put off investors from buying the bonds
because they assumed that the Inland Revenue would tax them on a 'just and
reasonable' basis.
Therefore, Hoare Govett and Salomon Brothers had a nasty shock during the
launch last month of a Pounds 200m offering for the Bank of Scotland when a
handful of banks and institutions expressed their fears about the tax
implications.
The sudden anxiety attack prompted a sharp fall in prices of similar bonds
in the secondary market and threatened to derail the new issue for the Bank
of Scotland.
However, with the help of the best tax lawyers in the country, within 24
hours the lead managers came up with a solution which was acceptable to the
issuer and to investors.
The Bank of Scotland's issue is made up of a series of fixed-rate notes for
tax purposes while maintaining the perpetual nature of the security for
regulatory purposes. If the issuer does not call the first note, it will be
exchanged for another note with a new fixed-rate coupon.
Although the incident now seems like a storm in a teacup, the Bank of
Scotland's issue has helped the market regain its composure because it
provides a blueprint for future bond issues.
It also offers a way out for the outstanding bonds which have been caught by
the legislation. However, since changing the terms of the bonds would be
time-consuming and expensive, the issuers would rather the Inland Revenue
took the bonds out of the variable-rate category.
The Inland Revenue is understandably reluctant to tinker with such a
clearly-worded piece of anti-tax avoidance legislation. 'It would be
difficult to draw and hold the line between securities which should be taken
out of the provision and those which should be in the provision,' says an
official at the Inland Revenue.

FT  15 NOV 93 / International Company News: Apple to license Mac software
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
APPLE Computer has decided to license to other computer makers the software
that makes its Macintosh personal computers unique, Mr Michael Spindler,
Apple's new chief executive, told analysts.
The move comes after years of debate within Apple about allowing competitors
to access its software 'crown jewels'. It reflects Mr Spindler's new
strategy to broaden Apple's markets by abandoning the strict proprietary
software approach that the company has adhered to for more than a decade.
Apple has yet to say to whom it will license the Macintosh software, but
potential licensees are expected to include companies designing products
around the new PowerPC microprocessor, co-developed by IBM and Motorola,
upon which Apple will base its next generation of computers.
Another sign of Apple's strategy shift is expected today when it is due to
announce a product, code-named Houdini, that enables the Macintosh to run
applications programs designed for the Microsoft Windows operating system.

FT  15 NOV 93 / International Company News: CS Holding pays SFr416m to raise
stake in Bank Leu
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CS HOLDING, the parent company of the financial services group built around
Credit Suisse, has bought an additional 15 per cent stake in Bank Leu,
Switzerland's fourth largest bank, for SFr416m (Dollars 278m) in shares and
cash.
The move, which raises CS's holding in Leu to 70 per cent, is aimed at
strengthening its capital base and consolidating its position as
Switzerland's largest financial services group. CS said it also plans to
make a five-for-one share split
The Leu shares were bought from BK Vision, a specialised investment company
controlled by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking group, at the rate of one CS
share and SFr720 in cash for every six Leu shares.
At a stroke, this makes BK Vision, which is known for trying to influence
the management of companies in which it takes positions, one of the largest
shareholders in CS Holding with roughly 2 per cent.
It is already the largest shareholder in Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS),
with approximately 5 per cent of the equity worth some SFr1.5bn.
CS will make an offer this morning to the remaining Leu minority
shareholders on the same terms, which represent a 15 per cent premium over
Friday's closing price of SFr592 per Leu share.
CS acquired its current 54 per cent stake in Bank Leu through a hostile
takeover bid in 1990, ironically, beating out a competitive bid from the BZ
group.
Since then, the process of integrating the bank, which has both a large
international private clientele and a local commercial business in the
Zurich area, into the CS group has proceeded slowly.

FT  15 NOV 93 / International Company News: Asarco to swap Medimsa holding

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASARCO, the US mining and metals group, seems to have solved the problem of
what to do with its shareholding in Medimsa, a Mexican copper company, that
it has been trying to sell for some time.
Instead, the group is to swap its 28.3 per cent stake in Medimsa for a 23.6
per cent holding in Grupo Mexico, Medimsa's publicly-traded parent and the
largest non-ferrous metals mining group in Mexico.
There will then be an international offering of Grupo Mexico shares in which
Asarco will sell some of its holding. It will also grant some of Grupo
Mexico's existing shareholders an option to buy about 9 per cent of the
Mexican company at the peso equivalent of Dollars 1.40 a share. If
exercised, the option would bring Asarco Dollars 87m.
Mr Richard Osborne, Asarco's chairman, said the immediate financial impact
on his company is likely to be immaterial.

years - Automotive

MAZDA says it expects to make a pre-tax loss of Y32bn (Dollars 301m) this
year - its first for 18 years - after posting a pre-tax loss of Y15.5bn for
the first six months to September.
The Japanese carmaker blamedweak demand at home and in Europe, as well as
the sharp appreciation of the yen, as sales slipped by 22 per cent to
Y876.08bn from Y1,129.56bn in the same period last year.
The company, which said it would pass its dividend, made a pre-tax profit of
Y3.06bn at the same stage last year.
Mazda, which is 25 per cent owned by Ford Motor of the US, suffered a
setback in most of its markets. Exports fell 25 per cent while in Japan, the
company saw a 17 per cent decrease in factory unit sales.
While demand in Asia, Africa, central and South America was firm, shipments
to North America, Europe and the Middle East were sluggish, mainly due to
weak demand in Europe and the strong yen.
The restructuring plan Mazda drew up in June is having to be reviewed in the
worsening trading environment. Under the original plan, costs were to be
reduced by 30 per cent and personnel by 1,500 over the next three years.
However, the company is bringing forward plans to restructure operations and
the number of staff to be reduced through natural wastage over the next
three years has been increased to 3,000.
Fuji Heavy Industries, which makes Subaru cars, also reported a sharp
deterioration in its business performance.
The company suffered a pre-tax interim loss of Y19bn on sales down 11 per
cent to Y356.60bn from Y399.86bn. It is passing its interim dividend. The
loss came despite sales of fixed assets.
Fuji was hit hard by the fall in domestic sales of mini cars and exports of
passenger cars, which fell by about 20 per cent. Its financial position also
worsened due to the need to redeem equity warrant bonds.
Meanwhile, Suzuki, the largest maker of mini cars in Japan and the world's
third largest maker of motorcycles, managed to report interim pre-tax
profits of Y9.18bn on sales that were 0.2 per cent down to Y517.72bn.
Suzuki's performance was helped by strong demand for its motorcycles
overseas and for its recreational vehicles in Japan.
The company is forecasting pre-tax profits for the full year to next March
of Y18bn on sales of Y1,020bn. The forecast compares with profits of Y20.5bn
on sales of Y1,053bn for fiscal 1992. This would be the first annual sales
drop for Suzuki and the third decline in profits.

AUSTRIA has unveiled an ambitious privatisation programme under which a
number of industrial companies will be floated on the Vienna bourse and
other stock markets around the world.
The proposals allow for the break-up of the Austrian Industries state
holding company, from which Voest-Alpine Technologie and Voest-Alpine Stahl
will be formed.
Along with the rest of Austrian Industries' constituents, these two are to
be merged with OIAG, AI's parent, by the end of this year.
The share sales get under way this month with the offer of 25 per cent in VA
Eisenbahnsysteme, the railway controlling systems manufacturer. Some 49 per
cent of this company was privatised last year.
The next move - in the second half of 1994 - will be the flotation of 51 per
cent in Voest-Alpine Technologie. The government hopes to raise Sch5bn
(Dollars 420m) from the sale.
The shares will be sold in Vienna and internationally. SG Warburg will be
the lead manager.
The 30 per cent private sector shareholding in OMV, the oil and chemicals
group, will be raised to above 50 per cent next year, with full
privatisation planned for 1995.
The state's 74 per cent stake in SGP Verkehrstechnik, the railways rolling
stock manufacturer, will be offered to Siemens of Germany, which already
owns 26 per cent.
Stakes of up to 100 per cent will be offered in Austria Mikrosysteme, the
custom microchips maker, Vamed (hospital construction and maintainance), VA
Bergtechnik (tunnelling and mining machinery), VA Steinel (transport
machinery), Schoeller-Bleckmann (stainless steel tubes and drilling
equipment), and Austria Technologie &amp; Systemtechnik (printed circuits).
The government has made it clear that Boehler-Udderholm (high quality steel)
will need a Sch2.5bn capital injection before it can be privatised.
The schedule here suggests a 1996 flotation. Austria Metall, the heavily
loss-making aluminium manufacturer, will be restructured in 1995 prior to a
privatisation issue.
In order to prepare the ground for the privatisation issues, OIAG will
receive Sch5bn (Dollars 418m) in interim financing as a loan from the
government. The financing will eventually be paid back from privatisation
revenues.

group, which currently has a 52.6 per cent voting interest in Lawson, equal
to 32.7 per cent of the equity, has agreed to tender its shares.
The CDollars 14-per-share price offered by Alusuisse is well above the
CDollars 9.88 at which Lawson was trading on the Toronto stock exchange
prior to the announcement.
Although Lawson has a relatively highly-geared balance sheet, with debts of
CDollars 350m, Alusuisse is understood to be attracted by its strong market
share in folding cartons, flexible packaging and labels.
Alusuisse said the proposed acquisition was in line with its focus on growth
in packaging and chemicals.

<TEXT>
KONICA, the photographic materials and business machine maker, reported a
32.6 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y3.38bn (Dollars 318m) for the half
year to September and said that its workforce would be cut by almost 10 per
cent over the next two years.
Sales for the period slipped by 8.6 per cent to Y168.2bn, as the yen's
appreciation hurt export earnings. There was an operating loss of Y652m, its
first in 24 years, but success in foreign exchange dealings helped the
company to report a pre-tax profit.
Konica intends to cut its workforce from 5,500 to 5,000 by March 1996, but
said this would be achieved through hiring fewer graduates, and not by
making workers take early retirement, which is still controversial in Japan.
For the full year, Konica expects a pre-tax profit of Y5bn, compared to
Y7.6bn last year, on sales of Y340bn, down just over 1 per cent.

<TEXT>
MITSUI Fudosan, a leading Japanese real estate developer, saw sharp falls in
profits for the half year to September due to sluggish earnings by its
office leasing division, writes Emiko Terazono.
Unconsolidated pre-tax profits fell by 45.3 per cent to Y9.5bn (Dollars
89.5m) on a 13.4 per cent decline in revenues to Y343.4bn. After-tax profits
fell 18.6 per cent to Y7.4bn.
The office leasing unit saw lower revenues, due to thinner profit margins
and a loss of Y5bn caused by a rise in cancellations of contracts, and the
occupancy rate for its offices totalled 93.4 per cent at end-September, down
from 95.7 per cent at end-March.

The product is based on the SFE's 10-year and three-year Treasury bond

hedging overnight risk.
The overnight options will only be valid for the duration of a single SYCOM
session - from 4.40pm on one day, to 4am on the next - thus distinguishing
them from other existing option contracts.

<TEXT>
THE Dollars 10bn takeover battle for Paramount Communications will shift to
the courtroom tomorrow when QVC Network, having increased its hostile offer
to Dollars 90 a share on Friday night, will ask a Delaware court to create a
'level playing field' between it and counter-bidder Viacom.
QVC is asking the court to remove 'lock-up' provisions of Viacom's friendly
merger agreement with Paramount.
The provisions would give Viacom a Dollars 100m consolidation prize if a
rival bidder wins the battle, as well as the right to buy 20 per cent of
Paramount's stock on very favourable terms.
QVC made its increased offer on Friday night conditional on the Delaware
Chancery Court removing these barriers to its bid.
The company is now offering Dollars 90 a share in cash for 51 per cent of
Paramount and stock worth around the same amount for the other 49 per cent.
Viacom is offering Dollars 85 a share in cash for 51 per cent and stock for
the remaining 49 per cent.

FT  15 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Studies suggest SmithKline drug most
cost-effective
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE studies presented yesterday suggest a SmithKline Beecham product is
more cost-effective than one of Glaxo's most important new drugs.
The studies, two independent and one sponsored by SmithKline Beecham, the
Anglo-American group, compare Glaxo's anti-nausea compound Zofran, with
Kytril.
The three trials, presented at the European conference on clinical oncology
and cancer nursing in Jerusalem yesterday, are the first ever comparing the
two drugs, used mainly to limit the side-effects of cancer treatments.
Zofran has been Glaxo's most significant launch over the past four years,
generating sales of Pounds 365m last financial year, and forecast by
analysts to reach Pounds 465m next year.
A Finnish trial of 161 women with breast cancer demonstrated that a 3mg dose
of Kytril was statistically more effective than a single 8mg dose of Zofran.
Complete control of vomiting was achieved in 84 per cent of patients on the
SmithKline Beecham drug, compared with 60.7 per cent on Zofran.
The trial also compared Kytril with a Sandoz product, tropisetron, which
prevented vomiting among 74.5 per cent of patients.
The study also showed only 2 per cent of patients taking Kytril vomited more
than twice, compared with 12.7 per cent on tropisetron and 18 per cent on
Zofran. About 41 per cent of patients expressed a preference for Kytril,
compared with 16.9 per cent for Zofran, and 15.4 per cent for tropisetron.
About 26 per cent expressed no preference.
Another trial in France, comparing the effect of a single 3mg intravenous
dose of Kytril with 10 8mg intravenous and oral doses of Zofran over three
days, suggested the two regimens had similar efficacy. SmithKline Beecham
says the Kytril dose costs Pounds 36 in the UK, compared with Pounds 99 for
Zofran over the three days.
The third trial, involving 359 patients, showed no difference in efficacy
between the two drugs, comparing a single dose of Kytril and three 8mg doses
of Zofran over five days.
'This data will give our marketing people something to get their teeth
into,' said Dr Paul Jenner, SmithKline Beecham pharmaceuticals director of
central nervous system medical affairs. 'In an increasingly cost-conscious
healthcare environment, this sort of data is extremely important.'
SmithKline Beecham has been disadvantaged in its commercial battle with
Glaxo because of its poor development record. Glaxo has launched Zofran in
nearly every world market, while Kytril has not even been licensed in the
US, the world's largest market.

FT  15 NOV 93 / International Company News: Ashanti set for February
flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASHANTI GOLDFIELDS of Ghana will be ready to be floated on the London Stock
Exchange by late February, according to Mr Sam Jonah, managing director. He
says that only a collapse in the gold price below Dollars 350 a troy ounce
could jeopardise the company's return to international stock markets after
an absence of 24 years.
He does not expect the gold price to fall that far but, if it did, markets
might not be receptive to a 'pure gold' company float.
Ashanti itself is reasonably insulated against gold price falls because it
has hedged about 30 per cent of its production two years ahead at an average
of Dollars 400 an ounce while retaining most of the potential benefit from a
price rise, says Mr Jonah.
Ashanti, which owns one of the world's richest gold deposits, had cash
production costs of Dollars 170 an ounce in its last financial year, among
the lowest in the industry. 'With a gold price of Dollars 350, Ashanti
shareholders are very comfortable,' Mr Jonah suggests.
The company announced in September that the Ghanaian government would
provide about 25 per cent from its present 55 per cent holding in Ashanti
for the float which analysts suggest might value the gold company at up to
Dollars 1bn.
Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, and James Capel, the stockbroker, have
been appointed advisers and Mr Jonah now says that Ashanti is considering
taking advantage of the float to raise new money.
Lonrho, the UK-based conglomerate undergoing a management upheaval and which
owns 45 per cent, continues to insist that mining is one of its core
businesses and that it does not intend to sell even one share in Ashanti.
About 5 per cent of Ashanti will be made available to the fledgling Ghana
stock exchange to give it a boost.

<TEXT>
CAZENOVE, the stockbroker, has linked up with another Lloyd's investment
trust, following the failure of efforts earlier this week to raise capital
for the Nelson Lloyd's Trust.
Cazenove will make a market in shares of the Kiln Cotesworth Corporate
Capital Fund, a Pounds 10m fund launched by an offer for subscription by
Baring Brothers last month.
Kiln is listing the trust on the Stock Exchange where shares will trade on a
matched bargain basis. Kiln will provide capacity of between Pounds 18m and
Pounds 18.5m to 22 syndicates, eight of which are managed by the Kiln and
Cotesworth managing agencies. Other syndicates are managed by Murray
Lawrence, Wren and Wellington. Kiln and Cotesworth members agency will merge
to form Kiln Cotesworth next January.
Cazenove linked up with Lazard Brothers and the Octavian Group, one of the
Lloyd's market's largest agencies, to raise Pounds 60m for the Nelson
Lloyd's Trust.
A pathfinder prospectus was issued but the fund's directors said last
Tuesday that they had been unable to obtain sufficient backing from
institutional investors and withdrew the scheme.

FT  15 NOV 93 / UK Company News: A return from the wilderness - How Philip
Swinstead has begun to build up Comac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PHILIP Swinstead at 50 has clear objectives for his next half decade in
the computing services business. 'In five years', he says, 'I intend to hand
over to another chief executive. I shall become a non-executive director,
and one of the managers I've recruited will take my place.'
He was speaking late last month as Comac, the small employment agency for
computer specialists of which he is chairman, announced the Pounds 18.5m
acquisition of Computer Search and Selection (CSS), the privately held
largest independent contract agency for freelance computer consultants. The
enlarged group will be the UK market leader with some 1,200 contractors in
place.
Mr Swinstead says: 'My aim is to make money in terms of building a business
showing capital growth and a rising share price. I have not taken a penny in
salary from Comac so far and my salary in this new, quite big, company will
be only Pounds 75,000 a year.'
Mr Swinstead became chairman of Comac earlier in the year after spending
Pounds 750,000 to take a 20 per cent stake in the company. The move
attracted attention in the City as it signalled Mr Swinstead's return to the
information technology business after two years in the wilderness (or, more
accurately, fishing on his estate in Perthshire, Scotland).
Founder of Systems Designers, he was chief executive of SD-Scicon, one of
the UK's largest systems companies, until its acquisition in 1991 by EDS of
the US after a lengthy takeover battle.
The UK company was in difficulties after provisions on a series of contracts
forced it into a Pounds 20m loss. Mr Swinstead insists the damage had been
repaired by the time of the acquisition, but ruefully admits: 'We learned
that we could not walk on water.'
The contrast between SD-Scicon, which had peak revenues of Pounds 256m and
prestigious defence and financial sector contracts, and the enlarged Comac
group with combined revenues of about Pounds 65m from 'body-shopping', as
the agency business is sometimes slightingly described, could not be more
marked.
Agencies like Comac have thousands of freelance, self-employed computer
consultants on their books. They earn between Pounds 45,000 and Pounds
55,000 a year. Comac's sales team tries to match the contractors' skills to
its customers' requirements.
'It is very basic, very low-tech', Mr Swinstead says. 'It was a real shock
to my system after selling software to the Ministry of Defence.'
However, he has long recovered from the bitterness he felt over EDS'
victory. Furthermore, he believes he has purchased a foothold in the future
of computing services. 'The agency market is growing. It is fragmented just
like the software business in the 1970s when there were thousands of small
software houses'.
His intention is to build a services company with three legs: a strategic
information technology consultancy, a systems integration company and an
agency. He sees the agency as the key. As conventional software and services
companies grew they acquired acres of office space to house thousands of
programmers. When the recession struck, even the best managed found
themselves shedding staff and taking charges against often unlettable office
space.
Mr Swinstead's idea is to build a company along the lines of an engineering
contractor. 'The key commercial and technical staff are employed by the
company but when you win a bid you pull in freelance consultants from
outside. These are skilled people but we can pull them in and that gives us
a price advantage. We will not be paying for their downtime and it will give
us considerable flexibility.'
'The prime contractor on a construction project employs the key commercial,
technical and project management people but its does not employ the
riveters.'
The acquisition of CSS gives Comac economies of scale. With turnover last
year of Pounds 53m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 2m, it is a well-run
company but it has built up Pounds 2.5m of debt through rapid expansion.
The existing management, including Mr John Sharpe, the co-founder and chief
executive, will stay on to run the agency business. Mr Swinstead believes it
will benefit from the broader experience of the computing services he and Mr
Ian Scoggins, also an SD-Scicon director, can bring to the business. Mr Paul
Davies, formerly with SD-Scicon and more recently managing director at GEC
Easams, has been appointed to the board and will run the non-agency side.
'In five years' time I would like to think Comac will be a systems company
with a very good strategic information technology arm - that will provide us
with public visibility and the high level contacts we need to sell our
services. The agency side will be less publicly visible.'
Even Cap Gemini Sogeti of France, Europe's largest computing services
company, started as a 'body shop'. So there are sound precedents for Mr
Swinstead's belief in his strategy. Last month he backed his judgment,
putting a further Pounds 750,000 of his own money into the merger.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kleinwort Emerging Markets Trust, which came to the market in July, reported
a net asset value per share of 103.9p fully diluted at September 30.
For the period from incorporation on June 21 to September 30 net revenue
amounted to Pounds 19,000 for earnings of 0.07p.
The directors reiterated that the objective of achieving long-term capital
growth meant it was unlikely dividends would be significant but that any
dividend would be in the form of a single payment in August each year.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Ferranti investors told to accept GEC bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECEIVERSHIP is the only alternative to GEC's bid of 1p per ordinary share
in Ferranti International, shareholders have been told in the offer document
released yesterday.
The bid continues to meet strong opposition from some shareholders. Mr John
Katz, chairman and one of the founders of the shareholders' association,
described the offer document as tantamount to mugging the shareholders.
GEC is offering about Pounds 10.1m for the ordinary shares and Pounds 1.29m
for the preference shares. It will also be required to assume Ferranti's
bank debts of around Pounds 110m and further debts of Pounds 30m. The bid
will proceed only if GEC can win acceptance from 90 per cent of the
shareholders.
Mr Eugene Anderson, Ferranti chairman, said at the weekend that it was vital
for shareholders to accept 'because we believe that it is unlikely that they
would receive any return in receivership and that suppliers, customers,
creditors and employees would also suffer'.
Ferranti's 10 largest shareholders own 38 per cent of the equity and the top
100 own 59 per cent. But in order to clear the 90 per cent hurdle, virtually
all its 8,000 largest shareholders will have to accept the deal.
The final 10 per cent of the stock is in the hands of 40,000 individual
shareholders. More than 500 shareholders claiming to represent about 25m
shares have contacted Mr Katz, who is leading the shareholder revolt.
Yesterday he said that if Ferranti did go to the wall and jobs were lost 'it
will be noted that it was not the shareholders who pulled the plug on the
company, but the banks, who are the most massive beneficiaries of the
proposed restructuring'.
Mr Anderson's letter in the offer document paints a bleak picture of the
defence electronics group's financial weakness and the effect on its ability
to do business.
He warns that the position is continuing to deteriorate. The interim pre-tax
loss, to be announced on Thursday, 'is estimated to be in excess of the
Pounds 10.9m loss' for the half year ending September 30 last year.
GEC's offer is also conditional on the conversion of the group's preference
shares to ordinary shares. This requires a 75 per cent vote in favour at the
extraordinary general meeting on December 8.
Mr Anderson conceded in the document that 'shareholders will not be happy
about the value ascribed to their shares'. But in order to continue trading,
Ferranti would need to use working capital facilities which depend on the
offers being made, and would become repayable if the offers lapsed.
'Your board believes that the only alternative to the offers would be to
invite the appointment of receivers. Receivership is unlikely to return any
value to any class of shareholder in Ferranti.'
It rules out the possibility of further disposals, a rights issue, or
finding a strategic partner.

FT  15 NOV 93 / European telecoms lay down lines of defence: Project
Atlantic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS, JOHN RIDDING and ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The international telecommunications industry is buzzing over Project
Atlantic, the putative alliance between France Telecom, Deutsche Telekom and
American Telephone and Telegraph, the world's three largest operators.
If it comes to fruition, a draft agreement to merge all but the domestic
voice businesses of the French and German state carriers and bring them into
AT&amp;T's international 'Worldsource' venture would constitute potentially the
biggest telecoms deal in history. This summer's Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.5bn)
partnership between British Telecommunications and MCI, the second largest
US carrier, is Lilliputian by comparison.
The deal would have a long haul through the European Commission. BT's will
not be the only voice crying foul on competition grounds - though some in
the Commission's telecommunications directorate, as petrified as France
Telecom and Deutsche Telekom at the long-term threat posed by AT&amp;T, might
see a defensive case for the arrangement.
However, Project Atlantic is simply the most graphic illustration yet of
three trends sweeping Europe's public telecommunications operators (PTOs):
the discarding of utility traditions; the search for alliances; and the
passion to crown them with an American partnership.
The UK is the most advanced on all three fronts. Privatised in 1984, BT has
been shedding staff, acting abroad in an aggressively entrepreneurial
fashion, and engaging in foreign acquisitions. Its alliance with MCI is the
latest and biggest such venture.
Europe's smaller PTOs are following suit. A number - led by the Danish and
Netherlands PTOs - are on the privatisation trail. Telecom Netherlands last
week announced a strategic partnership with Telkom Indonesia, extending the
Dutch operator's base in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region.
Meanwhile, the Swiss, Swedish and Dutch PTOs have formed their own
outsourcing company - 'Unisource' - which has an alliance with Sprint, the
third-largest US long-distance carrier. Telefonica, the Spanish
semi-state-owned operator, is in talks about joining.
Although they follow the same trends, the activities of the French and
German PTOs are not motivated by identical pressures. While Deutsche Telekom
is set for privatisation in 1996, France Telecom is not on the Balladur
government's sell-off list of 21 publicly owned groups.
The French PTO is flush with cash, operating arguably Europe's most advanced
network. Its German counterpart is weighed down by the investment demands of
eastern Germany, and is anxious for private capital.
Nonetheless, both are acting more entrepreneurially and are concerned at the
threat of foreign competition. Both are making aggressive moves abroad -
ironically they are heading rival consortia bidding for stakes in Matav, the
Hungarian state operator to be privatised this autumn. For offensive and
defensive reasons, both are keen to strengthen their existing outsourcing
venture Eunetcom.
Deutsche Telekom has been in the limelight this year because of its
privatisation plans and a succession of ventures in the former Soviet bloc.
It has signed a memorandum of understanding with Intertelekom, the Russian
state-owned long-distance operator, to modernise crumbling telecoms
infrastructure. In the Ukraine, DT has formed a joint venture called Utel
with AT&amp;T, PTT Netherlands and the national operator to build a basic
telecoms network, and it has teamed up with PTT Netherlands and the Danish
PTO to develop a mobile phone network.
France Telecom has been less visible abroad, but it would be wrong to
consign it to the back seat of any tripartite venture. With annual sales in
excess of FFr120bn (Pounds 14bn) and a monopoly in most markets, it has a
stronger domestic base than BT.
More than 80 per cent of France Telecom's network is now digitalised, and
neither the UK nor Germany has anything to match its Minitel screen-based
information service.
France Telecom, too, has been stepping abroad. In the past month it has
signed a series of agreements including an accord with Rostelecom, the
Russian telecommunications operator, to develop a range of telephone
services.
The French operator and its political masters have made no secret of their
desire for an alliance with Deutsche Telekom. Mr Gerard Longuet, the French
industry, post and telecommunications minister, describes DT as 'a natural
partner'.
To give the operator a sharper competitive edge, Mr Longuet is preparing to
change its status from an 'autonomous operator under public law' into a
joint stock company able to form cross-shareholdings with other telecoms
groups.
If Project Atlantic has its entrepreneurial side, it is at least as much a
defensive ploy. Both the French and the German operators fear an assault on
their lucrative international businesses. Far better, say senior executives,
to work in partnership with AT&amp;T before the 1998 Brussels deadline for
competition in voice services, particularly if the BT/MCI alliance makes
inroads.
Furthermore, both groups are sensitive to their weaknesses in facing head-on
competition. DT has the more obvious problems, given its staffing levels and
the protected civil service status of most of its employees. France Telecom
has an uneasy relationship with its unions. A strike last month demonstrated
the depth of concerns and the scale of the obstacles to reform.
AT&amp;T's motivation in Project Atlantic is obvious. It needs a credible
European partner for its Worldsource venture, and it cannot gain direct
access to the European market until 1998.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Reshuffle at Fiat due to Agnelli unease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Umberto Agnelli, deputy chairman of Italy's Fiat group who will formally
resign at a special shareholders' meeting in Turin today, is believed to
have threatened to break up the family holding company and move abroad after
recent setbacks within the business empire.
The threat of a split in one of Europe's richest families and consequent
risk to Fiat and the Agnellis' other interests explain the complex
redistribution of roles within the family announced on Friday night.
The changes include the appointment to Fiat's board of Mr Agnelli's son,
Giovanni, and an explicit family 'vote of confidence' in Mr Agnelli by
giving him executive powers at Ifi, the quoted holding company at the heart
of the Agnellis' widespread business interests.
Mr Gabriele Galateri di Genola, managing director of the Ifil investment
group, is taking a similar post at Ifi, which controls Ifil. Mr Galateri has
helped turn Ifil, chaired by Mr Agnelli, into one of the country's most
successful companies.
The reshuffle at Fiat and Ifi is believed to be a response to growing
dissatisfaction felt by Mr Agnelli, who was expected to assume the Fiat
chairmanship on the retirement of his elder bother Gianni next year.
That changed in September when Mr Gianni Agnelli announced he would stay on
for an extra two years.
In spite of Mr Umberto Agnelli's own business talents and diligence, he has
tended to remain in the shadow of his elder brother Gianni.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Economics Notebook: Picking holes in independent Bank
proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Independence for the Bank of England is a subject that refuses to lie down.
The question has been the focus of an extensive inquiry by the cross-party
House of Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee over the past six
months. On Thursday of this week, the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a
think-tank, will publish a report with proposals to change the mandate of
the Bank and its relationship with the Treasury and with parliament.
It is a foregone conclusion that the CEPR panel of experts, chaired by Lord
Roll of Ipsden, the president of SG Warburg, will put forward plans to make
the Bank independent and accountable. The commons committee is likely to go
the same way when its report on the Bank appears, probably before Christmas.
Over the past few weeks, a succession of establishment figures, including
Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, and Sir Peter Middleton, a former
permanent secretary at the Treasury, have appeared in the Palace of
Westminster's dusty committee rooms to disown the present arrangements,
which leave the Bank subservient in matters of monetary policy to the
Treasury.
Indeed, the cause of central bank independence has achieved such momentum in
Britain that even those sympathetic to such an idea must worry that it is
achieving the status of a panacea and that too many hopes are being invested
in it.
So it is a happy coincidence that the judges of this year's essay
competition organised by the Amex Bank Review have chosen to give one of the
top prizes to a paper that disputes some of the claims made for central bank
independence, and in particular the idea of a causal link between low
inflation and the freeing of a nation's central bank from short-term
political control.
Mr Adam Posen, the Amex silver award winner, asserts that close examination
of the post-war economic record of the advanced industrialised democracies
reveals no automatic link between an independent central bank and low
inflation. An extra ingredient must be found. Mr Posen, an economist who is
doctoral candidate at Harvard University, has concluded that a central bank
will take strong action against inflation only when there is a coalition of
interests in society capable of giving the bank political protection.
Other economists have expressed similar ideas, including Mr Andrew Crockett,
the Bank of England executive director appointed last week to take over as
general manager of the Bank for International Settlements. He asked recently
whether the independence of the Bundesbank was responsible for Germany's
generally good low inflation performance, or whether the desire of the
German people for low inflation was the reason the Bundesbank can operate as
it does.
An important part of Mr Posen's 'interests not institutions' approach to
central bank effectiveness is his belief that the financial sector plays the
key role in resisting inflation in industrialised democracies. In his view,
variations in the inflationary tendencies of societies can be ascribed
partly to structural differences in their financial systems.
These ideas lead him to suggest that:
financial sectors with universal banking systems have a stronger
anti-inflation bias than those without. This, he contends, is because
universal banks are more involved in lending than in securities operations
and so are more aware of the costs of inflation.
the system of bank regulation has an impact on the counter-inflationary zeal
of a country's financial sector. Mr Posen says that where central banks are
not involved in bank supervision, financial sector representatives will be
less inclined to lobby central banks for easier monetary policies to reduce
the regulatory burden on banks and financial companies.
political conditions also influence financial sector opposition to
inflation. Mr Posen claims that the financial sector is more likely to press
counter-inflationary ideals on a central bank in a federal system because
its representatives, who are normally well organised and share common
interests, can put forward a united front across regions.
It is perhaps no surprise to learn that Mr Posen was a guest economist at
the Bundesbank in late 1992 and at Germany's Deutsche Bank this spring. The
financial and political conditions he advances for a successful independent
central bank (universal banking, no central bank involvement in supervision
and a federal state) exist most obviously in Germany.
Conditions in the US - with its independent Federal Reserve system - lend
some support to his argument that the degree of political support for
counter-inflation policies, and in particular financial opposition to
inflation, is the key to a successful anti-inflationary central bank.
'It is not a coincidence,' Mr Posen writes, 'that the threats to Federal
Reserve independence mounted by Senator Paul Sabarnes and Representative
Henry Gonzales, among others, have noticeably increased in the last few
years along with the relative political weakness of the American financial
sector - irrespective of the contemporaneous extremely loose monetary
policy.'
At another point, he asserts that 'an independent Bank of England cannot
bring about noticeably lower inflation so long as the British financial
system is securities based, specialised, and central bank regulated and thus
not strongly anti-inflationary.'
His claim that independent central banks which supervise banking systems are
less effective in controlling inflation is sure to meet hefty opposition at
the Bank of England. The Bank has gone out of its way to reject suggestions
that its responsibility for bank supervision could lead to a conflict of
interest with the needs of monetary policy if it gains independence.
But UK policy makers, weighing independence for the Bank of England, would
be well advised to take note of his central idea: that there is no
institutional 'fix' which ensures that an independent central bank can
deliver low inflation.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Union bid for United Airlines fails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FIVE-MONTH attempt by unions at United Airlines to buy a majority stake in
the large US carrier has fallen apart, and the failure threatens to spark
off strife between labour and management.
United, one of the big three US carriers, wants to improve its profitability
by a restructuring plan, lay-offs and a sale of assets which its unions
oppose.
The unions, which made an abortive attempt to buy out the airline four years
ago, have warned of 'Armageddon' if the company pursues its restructuring.
However, United said the takeover proposal from its pilots and machinists
unions was 'seriously deficient', and reiterated that it would continue its
cost-cutting.
This will focus on its short-haul domestic routes, where it faces mounting
competition from 'no frills' low-fare airlines. 'United continues to be
non-competitive in the short-haul market and everyone knows something has to
be done about it,' the company said.
Its plans also include the sale of 15 of its 17 flight kitchens to Dobbs
International for Dollars 119.4m (Pounds 79m), which will mean the lay-off
of 5,000 staff. The pilots and machinists' unions expressed 'bitter
disappointment that management has placed short-term profits from the sale
of the flight kitchens ahead of the interests of all employees and
shareholders'.
The takeover talks apparently broke down on Friday because of disagreement
over the value of the unions' offer.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Chinese back wide reforms to speed economic transition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S ruling Communist party yesterday launched the country's most
far-reaching economic reforms, aimed at speeding its transition to a
socialist market economy.
In the second phase of a modernisation drive begun by Deng Xiaoping, China's
senior leader, 15 years ago, the party's central committee agreed a
50-article manifesto, covering banking, taxation, trade and the reform of
state-owned enterprises.
The plan was approved by the 182-member committee after four days of secret
talks. A communique emphasised that public ownership should continue to be
the 'mainstay' of the economy, but called for the establishment of a 'modern
enterprise system which suits the requirements of a market economy'.
It demanded the separation of 'government administration from enterprise
management' as part of an accelerated process of transforming state
industries.
Reforms of banking and taxation will include strengthening the powers of the
People's Bank, China's Central Bank, and also the introduction of a new
federal-style tax system to improve revenue-sharing between the centre and
the provinces.
The committee said the accelerated market reforms were needed to build on
the 'positive results' of an austerity programme launched in mid year, which
was designed to re-establish control over a runaway economy. Economic growth
this year is expected to reach 13 per cent.
The emphasis given to enterprise reform suggests that China's rulers are
anxious to speed the 'corporatisation' of the state sector, including a
pilot process of privatisation.
Chinese economists have been debating the merits of turning state
enterprises into limited- liability companies, and in some cases joint stock
companies.
The process would be aimed at making enterprises more accountable for their
profits and losses, and reducing the responsibility of the state for
faltering industries which are proving a huge financial burden.
Chinese policymakers have been obliged to advance carefully in that area
because of concerns of a backlash from the state enterprise lobby, and from
party conservatives who would claim that the 'socialist system' was under
threat. As a result, efforts to reform the debt-ridden state sector have
been disappointing.
The communique made frequent reference to Mr Deng's guiding hand, leaving no
doubt that China's dominant political figure was continuing to exert a
powerful influence.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Nuclear Electric seeks 1995-96 privatisation: State-owned
operator sees improved results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NUCLEAR Electric, the state-owned operator of nuclear power stations in
England and Wales, has told the government it wants to be privatised as soon
as possible.
Although it has left the precise timetable open, it has indicated that
privatisation in 1995-96 would be appropriate because the company expects to
be fully commercial by then. That would also enable the sale to take place
in the life of the present government, which could extend to 1997.
The Gloucester-based company made its proposals as the government prepares
to launch a review of the nuclear power industry, which was promised after
the recently announced coal mine closures.
Some details of NE's plans were disclosed at the weekend at a seminar
organised by the nuclear industry on the prospects for nuclear power in
Britain. The company is expected to report sharply improved operating
results for the first half of the current financial year. They will show
profits of more than Pounds 450m compared with Pounds 661m for the whole of
last year. However, those figures include the Pounds 1.3bn 'nuclear levy'
which NE receives from electricity consumers to help it build up provisions
against its costs in decommissioning reactors.
When NE was incorporated in the late 1980s, it was given responsibility for
the nuclear industry's liabilities such as decommissioning retired power
stations, but no money to pay for them. The government decided to fund the
liabilities by imposing a 10-year levy on household electricity bills.
According to senior executives, NE is basing its case for privatisation on
two main points:
That the company has made big efficiency improvements and is now close to
making a profit without the levy;
That the government's reluctance to finance new nuclear stations means the
industry will have to raise private capital if Britain is to have a
long-term nuclear power industry.
Mr Mark Baker, NE's executive director for corporate planning, said: 'We
believe that the best way of achieving our commercial objectives is to have
the freedom to make our own decisions.'
NE is preparing detailed financial projections for ministers with the help
of Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm it has hired to advise it on
privatisation. The projections are said to show that NE could produce a
dividend stream that would be attractive to private investors.
Analysts at the seminar said the company might be worth up to Pounds 2bn,
but much would depend on how the sale was structured and the extent to which
the government was prepared to underwrite NE's huge liabilities.
The privatisation of NE does not need specific legislation. But if the
government decided to go ahead with what would be a highly controversial
sale, it would probably present a bill to parliament so that the issue could
be fully debated.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is more to the recent slide in Tokyo equities than meets the eye.
While the Nikkei 225 average has fallen by 11 per cent over the last month,
the more widely-based Topix index has fallen by only 6 per cent. Plans to do
away with the Nikkei partly explain this underperformance, since investors
have been selling small illiquid stocks unlikely to feature in the index
which will replace it. Since the Nikkei average is not weighted by market
capitalisation, such switching has acted as a heavy drag. Arbitrage traders
selling the Nikkei 225 futures contract and buying the Topix, the closest
proxy for the new weighted index, have added to the pressure.
The underlying slide in share prices is less easily evaluated. The flotation
last month of JR East, the railway company, drained liquidity from the
market and left a sour taste. The post-flotation premium of the share price
has been quickly eroded. The authorities also appear less keen than in the
past to provide a prop for a falling market by encouraging public sector
funds to buy equities.
Whether this reflects a new laisser-faire policy in government, or simply a
pragmatic response to the improved capital position of Japan's banks,
remains unclear. But retail investors are showing scant enthusiasm for the
stock market, unlike their counterparts in the US and UK. A poor interim
results season and continuing economic gloom provide little incentive.

FT  15 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: UK accounting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having knocked the profit and loss account into shape, the Accounting
Standards Board now plans to tackle the vexed question of goodwill -
ironically during the Christmas season. The debate is unlikely to generate
much cheer. The question is how companies which pay more than net assets for
acquisitions should treat that premium in their accounts. On a wholly
pragmatic view, the interests of UK companies would be served by an
accounting treatment which is transparent and in step with international
practice. That argues for amortisation of goodwill through the profit and
loss over a fixed period. Both the US and international standards setters
have adopted this approach.
Yet many finance directors are loath to accept a treatment which results in
lower profits. They also use the uncertain argument that goodwill does not
depreciate in the manner of a physical asset. The ASB enjoys powers of
coercion, but wholesale prosecution of British industry does not seem an
attractive option. It is exploring subtle methods by which goodwill might be
valued so that it can be held on the balance sheet and, if necessary,
depreciated. Whether the board can find a sufficiently water-tight method to
prevent manipulation of accounts remains an open question.
Even a more or less reliable method is unlikely to satisfy those who fear
that revaluation of goodwill would leave UK accounting on a slippery slope.
After all, it seems inconsistent to value acquired goodwill without treating
internally generated intangible assets such as brands in the same way. There
is a danger accountants will end up encroaching on the stock exchange's role
in valuing companies.

FT  15 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Corporate disclosure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock exchange's draft guidelines on corporate disclosure have drawn a
first public response from Hoare Govett, which admits to worry about the
low-key nature of the call on companies to give more information. This homes
in on the central nature of the problem. There is a need to ensure
information is disseminated fairly, but there is also a need to formulate
the guidelines in such a way that companies do not simply clam up. In
practice that means that an obligation to inform may have to accompany a ban
on selective leaking of information.
This points inexorably towards the introduction of a quarterly reporting
requirement together with some prescription for the minimum amount of detail
such statements might be expected to include. Companies may not like the
extra work involved: in the end, though, it could cause them less time and
trouble than continuous worry about what does or does not constitute market
sensitive information. Indeed any attempt to make the guidelines define the
term market sensitive is bound to come adrift.
Quarterly statements would not, of course, absolve companies from issuing
timely announcements when the unexpected happens. Nor should such
information be dribbled into the market. After all, cheapening technology
will give even small investors access to a Topic screen or its equivalent
sooner or later.

FT  15 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: A marginal existence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's high street banks must view the possibility of an interest rate
cut at budget time with some ambivalence. The days are long gone when lower
rates were needed to stop their customers going under. Another half point or
so off base rate would do little to bring provisions down faster. It would
reduce the cost of funding non-performing loans, but this saving would be
largely offset by lower returns on so-called free balances, accumulated
capital and current account deposits on which banks do not pay interest.
Lower interest rates could thus put margins under downward pressure, despite
the lucrative opportunities in mortgage lending which were amply
demonstrated in Bank of Scotland's recent results. The building societies'
dependence on retail savings has forced them to keep mortgage rates high so
that they can afford to pay adequate interest to their depositors. This has
created an opportunity for banks which have unrestricted access to cheap
wholesale money.
The banks, however, have now reduced rates on their own retail savings
products to the bone. If base rates fall further, they could increasingly
come under the kind of margin squeeze facing the building societies. To
compensate, even conservative banks like Lloyds, which faces particular
pressure on its operating income, might try lending more. The temptation
might become more general as bank capital is swollen by the post-recession
recovery in earnings.
But competition for a limited pool of credit business could simply depress
margins further. Hence the need for savings in areas like cheque processing.
Lower base rates would also hasten the day banks are forced to start
charging for current accounts and other money transmission services.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Hands across the water: Links between the Pacific nations
are likely to be strengthened, say Alexander Nicoll and George Graham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The unprecedented meeting this week of leaders of Pacific nations may be
short on concrete moves towards future co-operation, but it will be full of
powerful symbolism.
The 15 members of Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation, a four-year-old
grouping that will hold its first leaders' meeting in Seattle on Friday and
Saturday, include the world's two biggest economies - the US and Japan - and
by some measures the third largest, China. They represent a large proportion
of the world's wealth, and sport the fastest rates of growth in output,
trade and investment.
For Asian countries the gathering will underline this prosperity, as well as
the increasing closeness of trade and diplomatic relations within the
region. Apec's other members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea,
Taiwan and Thailand.
They will be discussing the acceleration of already fast-growing trade and
investment between their dynamic economies, while governments of
slow-growing industrialised countries struggle to overcome domestic
protectionist pressures and push through free trade measures. US President
Bill Clinton will arrive in Seattle having won or lost the battle in
Congress for the North American Free Trade Agreement in the House of
Representatives vote on Wednesday. And a December deadline for a conclusion
of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is fast
approaching.
For Mr Clinton, who has called for the creation of a 'new Pacific
community', the meeting will be an opportunity to persuade Americans that
their destiny is tied more to Asia than to Europe. Mr Winston Lord, US
assistant secretary of state for Asia, says: 'Europe is still very important
but, in relative terms, we believe Asia has become more important for
America - and not just for economic reasons.'
The economic justification, however, is clear. US trade with Asia last year,
at Dollars 344bn, was 51 per cent higher than trade across the Atlantic. By
1991, Asia accounted for Dollars 66bn or 15 per cent of US direct investment
abroad.
Just as important, moves towards multilateralism, such as Apec's
development, are a step forward for a region in which a strong US troop
presence has, since the second world war, kept the security balance. Asia
has a history of hostility and wars between neighbours. It still has a
number of outstanding security issues, such as the nuclear aspirations of
North Korea's dictatorship and the disputed Spratly Islands in the South
China Sea.
Regional co-operation should help the US to achieve its goal of a reduction
in post-cold war military expenditure while remaining an Asian power - a
role that Pacific countries want Washington to maintain. 'It (Apec) is an
important device for keeping the US engaged in the region,' says Mr Don
Russell, Australian ambassador to the US.
South-east Asian countries and their main industrialised trading partners
agreed earlier this year to expand annual talks into a regional security
forum. Though there is no suggestion that Apec should also take on a role in
discussing security issues, officials from both sides of the Pacific see it
as having a long-term role in promoting peace.
This sort of role is welcomed by China, for example. Mr Wu Jianmin, China's
foreign ministry spokesman, says that while China opposes a formalised trade
bloc, 'we believe it is useful to have a leadership conference to enhance
mutual understanding'. China's president, Mr Jiang Zemin, will be in Seattle
and his first meeting with Mr Clinton will potentially mark an important
step forward in the difficult Sino-American relationship.
Actual moves towards economic co-operation among Asian countries, however,
have been insubstantial and are unlikely to be much advanced this week. Apec
is a consultative body dealing with issues such as harmonisation of customs
data and exchange of information on marine pollution. The Seattle meeting
will take it a step further by establishing a trade and investment
committee.
The committee will aim to simplify customs procedures and improve investment
flows within the region. But Ms Charlene Barshefsky, deputy US trade
representative, says it could expand into other areas, as Apec members
become more comfortable with and committed to greater co-operation.
The reason for this cautious approach is that there are deep divisions among
members about the nature and degree of future co-operation. Asian countries
resent any move that could be interpreted as intended at regional
domination, and are particularly suspicious of US emphasis on human rights
and the promotion of democracy.
These worries have been illustrated by reactions to an ambitious report from
an Eminent Persons Group, to be considered by Apec ministers when they meet
in Seattle on Wednesday and Thursday. The group, chaired by Mr Fred Bergsten
of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, calls for the
creation of an Asia Pacific Economic Community, and specific steps towards
the establishment of an Asian free trade area, which would push regional
trade liberalisation further than measures agreed under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
US officials acknowledge these are distant prospects. But the
recommendations have caused concern among the six-member Association of
South-east Asian Nations, which is keen to maintain its own position as a
regional grouping.
'Malaysia has made it clear it would like Apec to proceed slowly, just as
Australia has made it clear it would like to proceed quickly,' says Mr Lord.
Malaysia's prime minister, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, declined Mr Clinton's
invitation to the Seattle meeting.
Japan, wishing to expand its global role but anxious not to upset the US or
its regional neighbours, is trying to tread a line between them. Mr Takeshi
Isayama, a senior official in the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, says: 'We have to think what kind of management will be most
beneficial to the world economy after the end of the cold war. Apec can be
an extremely effective place to think about that.' But he also says the Gatt
Uruguay Round is essential to Apec: 'Making Apec an alternative to Gatt
means to make it a forum for negotiation. That's impossible.'
Even Australia, which sparked Apec's original creation and remains its
keenest promoter, made clear last week that a suggestion by Prime Minister
Paul Keating to change the 'Co-operation' in Apec's name to 'Community' did
not imply it wanted to establish a free trade area.
Domestic political considerations would in any case rule out an Asian free
trade agreement for the foreseeable future. Mr Clinton, after his troubles
over Nafta, could hardly launch an even more ambitious trade initiative.
Leadership struggles in Japan and China will also limit their freedom of
action.
Divisions may emerge this week on admission of new members. Mexico, Chile
and Papua New Guinea are the most immediate candidates, but India, Pakistan,
Macao, Sri Lanka, Russia, Ecuador and Peru have also made overtures, and the
European Union has asked for observer status. Ms Barshefsky says: 'The
desire to include new members is currently juxtaposed against an increasing
concern among many members that Apec must first consolidate and produce
concrete results.'
This week's strongest rhetoric is therefore likely to be reserved for issues
of global rather than regional importance. Apec members will forcefully
demand a successful resolution of the Gatt talks by the December deadline.
'We are interested first and above all in the Uruguay Round. That really is
the overall setting,' says Ms Joan Spero, US undersecretary of state for
economic affairs.
Before true Asian co-operation can make any further significant progress,
there will need to be many more confidence-building sessions such as the
Seattle meeting. Ms Spero says: 'It (Apec) is not going to be a snail. On
the other hand, it is not going to be a jack-rabbit, either.'

One thing that Britain's parliamentarians really look forward to is an
official all-expenses-paid trip abroad. Imagine the horror then when members
of the Trade and Industry Select Committee were recently threatened with
having to fly economy class to south-east Asia because British Airways had
overbooked its flight.
However, all it took was the threat to call Sir Colin Marshall, BA's
chairman, and the MPs were reinstated in Business class although the
committee's two clerks were not so lucky. Hard to imagine a self-publicist
like Virgin Atlantic's Richard Branson making such a gaffe.

Unemployment in Europe must have reached serious proportions when Germany's
physicians start phoning the Bundesbank for work. The German central bank's
switchboard has been jammed in recent weeks by job-hunters, including at
least one doctor, hoping to get one of the 200 jobs at the European Monetary
Institute, Buba's new neighbour.
Observer does not want to dash hopes but prospects don't sound too
promising. Initially, the core of the EMI staff will be drawn from the
Basle-based secretariat of EC central bank governors. It already operates a
number of working groups - on a future European bank note and on EC payment
systems, for instance - staffed by delegates from European central banks,
and these are likely to transfer to Frankfurt. But when the EMI needs more
full-timers it knows where to look.
Not all should despair, though, because the secretariat is currently paid
top whack salaries by the Bank for International Settlements. So some
candidates may opt to stay behind in Basle rather than take a cut in their
standard of living by moving to Frankfurt. In any event, aspiring EMI
bankers are ill-advised to call Buba, thereby reminding it of its eventual
demise. CVs to EMI president Alexandre Lamfalussy at the BIS in Basle,
please.

<TEXT>
Still on the subject of possible boardroom rifts at the top of big FT-SE 100
companies, some old Unilever-watchers are wondering why it is taking so long
for the Anglo-Dutch multinational to make up its mind about its next
boardroom reshuffle.
Unilever is headed by a triumvirate consisting of two chairmen - one English
and one Dutch - and a third director, currently Morris Tabaksblat, 56. The
latter is expected to replace Floris Maljers as chairman of Unilever NV when
he retires next year. This will leave a slot on the committee which by
tradition is filled by the next British chairman in waiting. Michael Perry,
the current chairman, is only three years off retirement so whoever gets the
seat on the special committee should not have long to wait until assuming
the chairmanship.
The front-runners for the job are Niall FitzGerald, 48, and Charles Miller
Smith, 54. The latter may have blotted his copybook by his reported interest
in the chief executive's job at Barclays. On the other hand if FitzGerald
were to get the job he would might be in charge of Unilever for an awfully
long time. The smart money is on FitzGerald but don't rule out the chance of
another caretaker being appointed to the committee.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Observer: Does Jan not love Bob?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What does Jan Leschly, the incoming chief executive of SmithKline Beecham,
think of the current incumbent, Bob Bauman, who steps down next April? Not a
lot, if a private note from brokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew is to be believed.
The note, which has been leaked to the press and is based on an interview
two UBS analysts had with Leschly last month, argues that now that the 1989
merger of SmithKline Beckman and Beecham has been completed Bauman is not
the best person to generate the organic growth that the new group needs.
No great surprise there. But then it goes on to summarise Leschly's alleged
views on Bauman which range from an assertion that he has no understanding
of how the drug industry works to his lack of strategic skills. Even worse,
Bauman is said to be not good at motivating staff and too anxious about City
views. Vicious stuff.
An embarrassed Andrew Porter, the UBS analyst who penned the contribution to
UBS's UK Healthcare Daily Comment, now says that his views were just
'jottings' and did not represent what was said at the meeting. Perhaps, but
why commit them to paper and include a prominent warning to 'keep the
controversial points to yourself and not let SKB know the comments came from
us.'?
Even assuming that Jan Leschly's views about Bauman have been completely
misrepresented, the case raises the question of whether stock broking
analysts should be briefing their firm's salesmen with ideas that they are
not prepared to justify in public.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Personal View: Stumbling block to monetary union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIK HOFFMEYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month's judgment by the German constitutional court clearing the way
for Germany to ratify the Maastricht treaty has been given a general
welcome. However, the court's ruling, coupled with the suspension of the
narrow margin exchange rate mechanism (ERM) on August 2, may well render the
project at the centre of the treaty - economic and monetary union (Emu) -
more difficult to achieve.
Let me deal first with the Brussels meeting of EU finance ministers and
central bank governors at the beginning of August. The meeting was requested
by the German monetary authorities after heavy currency market pressure at
the end of July.
During the night of August 1-2 the French and German authorities agreed to
suspend the narrow margin system. Other members were not in favour of this
decision.
If there had been the political will to continue with the system, it could
have been maintained, and the end-July crisis would have been overcome. This
would have involved, of course, a decision to continue intervention and to
adjust interest rates in the countries whose currencies were under pressure.
The system was created as a result of a strong German desire during the past
two decades for more stable European exchange rates. This resulted in the
establishment, first, in 1972, of the European 'snake', and then, in 1979,
of the ERM.
The decision to suspend the system means that the cornerstone of European
monetary co-operation over the last 21 years has been discredited. It is
difficult to see how it can be rebuilt.
The system became the most important symbol of policy collaboration in
Europe and an essential instrument in creating convergence among member
countries. This can, of course, be achieved in other ways, but, I am afraid,
only with difficulty.
At present, leading EU countries do not display active political interest in
re-establishing the exchange rate mechanism.
With respect to the Constitutional Court's judgment on October 12, there is
a need for careful analysis. In particular, two aspects appear of great
importance.
First, the court's ruling states definitively that the realisation of the
Maastricht convergence conditions prevails over the date - January 1999 -
when, according to Article 109j of the treaty, Emu has to be established at
the latest.
The ruling confirms the tendency to put increasingly massive weight on the
exact fulfilment of the conditions. This will make it more difficult to
realise Emu - particularly in the light of present circumstances. The
economic slowdown is increasing the budget deficit and public debt ratios of
member countries to beyond the reference levels set down in the Maastricht
treaty.
Additionally, the widening of ERM bands may make it difficult to fulfil the
Emu eligibility rule that requires countries' participation in a narrow ERM
band, without being devalued at their own initiative, for two years before
the final fixing of exchange rates.
Just think of the disturbances created by the German unification that
brought Germany away from fulfilling the Maastricht stability conditions.
Although German unification was a unique external shock, disturbances of a
similarly difficult political nature might occur in other countries in the
future.
The second question concerns the court's ruling that, once Emu has been set
up, Germany may leave monetary union if the stability conditions are not
continuously fulfilled.
It is sometimes argued that this is only a theoretical possibility, but it
may still have an impact on markets. The initial phase of Emu is expected to
be characterised by irrevocably fixed exchange rates. Will that be a
credible system if an important member reserves the right to leave if
conditions change?
These are all important questions. I cannot resist the temptation to say
that these reservations are more far-reaching that Denmark's own requirement
to win an exemption from Emu, which gave rise to so much trouble.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Leading Article: High noon in world trade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEXT 30 days will mark a watershed. In that time the still economically
dominant western powers will decide the fate of the liberal trading system
that underpinned their postwar success. Construction of a new international
order may well be beyond their ability. Preserving and extending this most
essential of legacies should not be.
A series of hurdles - the vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement in
the US House of Representatives, the meeting on Asian Pacific Economic
Co-operation in Seattle, but above all the deadline of the Uruguay Round of
multilateral trade negotiations on December 15 - lie before us. These
hurdles must be jumped. There is no sensible alternative.
The postwar trading system was animated by a single-minded determination to
avoid repetition of the protection that wreaked such havoc in the 1920s and
1930s. It succeeded beyond the wildest dreams of its designers. Between 1950
and 1991 the volume of world exports rose 12 times, while that of exports of
manufactures rose 23 times, an expansion that dragged global output, itself
up six times, behind it.
Policy choices made such success possible. Policy choices will also
determine whether it lasts. Industrial output per head in east Germany did
not fall to a third of that in the west because the people were inferior.
South Korea did not outstrip the North because of luck. These successful
countries shared active participation in the global market economy with all
the other dynamic economies of the postwar era.
The point has not been lost upon others. Sixty-three countries, 51 of them
either developing or former centrally planned economies, have notified the
Gatt trade liberalisation measures taken during the seven-year history of
the Uruguay round.
One reason these countries wish to increase their commitment to the liberal
world trade system is economic. Credence may not be placed in estimates of
the benefits of a successful Uruguay round, such as the Dollars 270bn
advanced last week by the OECD. But few can doubt that world economic
welfare would be far higher with comprehensive trade liberalisation than
without it.
No less important are the potential losses from failure. Nobody knows what
those might amount to, but that does not mean they would be small. They are
more likely to be unknowably large. As Peter Sutherland, the Gatt's new
director-general, has stressed: 'failure to reach agreement by the end of
this year would undermine the multilateral trading system with unpredictable
economic, political and, even, security consequences'.
Cost of failure
Those wider consequences of failure must never be forgotten. Does anyone
suppose, for example, that co-operation between the US and Europe would
survive a breakdown that could be plausibly blamed either on French
intransigence or on stubborn US nit-picking over the trading rules?
The challenge is to make arrangements that flourished in the shadow of the
cold war survive in its absence. Success is more difficult now, because
there is no longer a shared threat. But it is also still more important,
because trade friction has become a central part of international political
relations.
It is on the shoulders of the western powers, the US and the European Union,
that the outcome ultimately rests. But this is not just a burden upon them;
it is also an opportunity. The notion of a system of international trade law
governing a liberal global economy is both their achievement and their
legacy, but it is ceasing to be their possession. Their economies still
account for half of world output, but this share is in ineluctable decline.
What the western powers can do, though perhaps now for the last time, is
determine whether a working system is bequeathed to the more politically and
culturally diverse world now emerging.
The system is, in fact, a peculiarly American creation. At the end of half a
century of active engagement in global affairs, the US has every right to
feel satisfied with the outcome. Alas, it does not. So great is US
self-doubt that even the free trade agreement with Mexico stands on the
verge of rejection.
NAFTA must pass, not because it is that intrinsically important, which it is
not, even to its participants. Nor is it because it is unambiguously
desirable. In important respects, notably its restrictive rules of origin
and its two side agreements on labour and the environment, it is even quite
worrying. The latter, for example, though modest enough in themselves,
indicate US acceptance of the fallacious idea that trade between countries
with different standards is mutually impoverishing. They also introduce the
equivalent of the EU's acquis communautaire: the idea that regulations may
never be relaxed, however costly they turn out to be.
For all that, NAFTA must not fail, because it would do so for the wrong,
protectionist reasons. US credibility in international negotiations is at
stake. The administration realised this very late in the day. It is to be
hoped that it did not realise it too late.
The EU too is palsied by protectionism, notably in its attitudes towards
trade with eastern Europe and within agriculture. France, the EU's second
most important member state, is even prepared to undermine the EU's capacity
to act in order to preserve its right to dump subsidised agricultural
surpluses on world markets. Worse, the EU has not been prepared to confront
French intransigence, with the result that its principal negotiator, Sir
Leon Brittan, is forced to look over his shoulder in almost everything he
does.
Game of chicken
As Mr Sutherland has pointed out, the US and EU are playing a game of
chicken in the last stages of these negotiations, both hoping the other will
swerve first. Progress has been made in Geneva. A significant market access
package is being shaped, while there is almost complete agreement on a text
in services. But the negotiations have fallen well behind the schedule
agreed last summer. The market access negotiations, in particular, were
supposed to have been finished by November 15. It appears that the EU and US
hope everything will be wrapped up in a grand closing sale, failing which
each will blame the other for the breakdown.
The time of decision has arrived. The long-term economic and political
future of Europe is at stake, with the EU risking a grim future as an
increasingly marginal part of the world economy. The new Union must show
itself capable of sticking to agreements it has reached. Even the
Franco-German alliance may founder if it falls short of constructive
engagement with the rest of the world.
The challenge for the US is little less. Should Nafta be defeated, a
successful outcome to the Uruguay round may be still more difficult, but it
would also then be even more important. Should both fail, the legacy of half
a century of successful US-led effort would lie in ruins. No contemporary US
politician has the right thus to throw away the achievements of more
constructive times and wiser men.
The alternative to the Uruguay round would not be a harmonious world of
trading blocs. Anyone who believes that a US unable to implement Nafta could
negotiate free trade with Latin America or east Asia is dreaming. Anyone who
believes that an inward-looking EU would prove stable may be similarly
deluded.
The probable alternative to success would, instead, be a chaos of
simple-minded unilateralism and bilateralism. It would be a world of
unsuccessfully managed trade. It would, in short, be everything that
policymakers decided, half a century ago, they never wished to see again.
There is no good reason why their hopes should be betrayed. The world knows
better than that. Leaders of great economic powers should show they do too.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Arts Council open-minded on dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms PRUDENCE SKENE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article on modern dance ('Modern dance in dire straits',
November 10), Alastair Macaulay claims to be basing his conclusions on 'the
facts'. He suggests that the Arts Council has agreed to the formation of a
revised Rambert and told London Contemporary Dance Theatre to reduce its
size or close.
The fact is that in the case of London Contemporary Dance Theatre, it is the
board of governors of Contemporary Dance Trust, and not the Arts Council,
that has taken decisions on the future of the company. London Contemporary
Dance Theatre has been without a permanent artistic director for almost five
years, and for more than a year we have been waiting for the board to make
an appointment and, following that, to produce strong artistic plans.
The Arts Council has kept an open mind and does not have preconceived
notions of what London Contemporary Dance Theatre should be or do. We shall
of course give careful consideration to any proposals put forward to us by
Contemporary Dance Trust.
The Arts Council recently announced its commitment to supporting the
development of a broad range of contemporary dance. As the recipient of the
largest Arts Council grant to any contemporary dance organisation, London
Contemporary Dance Theatre's future direction must be considered in detail
by the dance panel. The dance panel has encouraged Contemporary Dance Trust
to submit plans, which can be considered alongside proposals from other
dance companies, including Rambert. The Arts Council has yet to respond to
the plans already put forward by Rambert's board and will be making no
decisions about dance funding until the grants for 1994-95 are finalised
next month.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Japan's policy for plutonium
re-cycling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From YASUTAKA MORIGUCHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am responsible for establishing and implementing Japan's plutonium
recycling policy. I refer to the letter titled 'Japanese nuclear policy
increases UK's risk' (November 11), in which Mr W Walker insisted that the
trouble for Japan is a plutonium surplus of more than 20 tonnes by 2000, and
40 tonnes by 2010. I would like to explain Japan's plutonium supply and
demand situation.
According to the August 1991 report of the advisory committee of the Atomic
Energy Commission, Japan will get a cumulative 85 tonnes or so of plutonium
up to 2010. Of course, this does not mean that Japan will have a stock-pile
of such an amount at that time, because we have a concrete plan to use it
up. By 2010 Japan will consume 80-90 tonnes of plutonium in total: 10-20
tonnes for fast breeder reactors R&amp;D, about 10 tonnes for added thermal
reactors R&amp;D; and 50 tonnes for fuel of light water reactors.
Compared with two years ago, the programme of plutonium supply and demand
has slightly changed because the schedule for operation of the Rokkasho
reprocessing plant, as well as start-up of the prototype FBR 'Monju', was
postponed for a few years. Estimates of both supply and demand have
decreased by a few tonnes. However, the prospect that Japan will have no
surplus of plutonium, including that from Thorp, is strictly maintained.
As long as we use nuclear power in electricity supply, plutonium is being
daily produced in the fuel of the existing reactors. At this juncture, we
have two options. First, that we use plutonium recovered from reprocessing
as a technology-oriented energy resource. Second, that we dispose of spent
fuels in which plutonium and uranium are contained. The environmental impact
of high-level radioactive waste separated from plutonium and uranium by
reprocessing will be smaller than that of direct disposal of spent fuel. In
Japan, our policy is to use plutonium as fuel for nuclear reactors, in light
of the above.
We believe that Japan, as a big consumer of energy resources, should develop
plutonium recycling-technology for future generations.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: UK lead on air transport essential
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NORMAN NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, If vested interests in the European air transport industry are to be
challenged you say that passengers must make their voices heard ('Closed
skies' November 4). Unfortunately, with little opportunity to shop around,
this is too often impossible. Most European governments are reluctant to
allow the concept of the national 'flag carrier' to die. This was clear in
the evidence presented to the 'committee of wise men' set up to look at the
industry's problems - a committee that did not include a single
representative for passengers.
UK passengers have enjoyed the benefits of liberalisation. Not only do we
have a choice of airline on the most popular routes from Heathrow but
increasingly also a choice of airport. It is surprising that the travelling
public elsewhere in the European Union is not more vociferous in demanding
similar deals. The UK must continue to lead by example.
This means taking all possible steps to ensure competition can flourish,
including a much freer arrangement with the US. The capability to drive
change has yet to shift from the regulator to the passenger.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Rising tide of despair: James Buxton looks at the crisis
hitting salmon farms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Salmon farmers along the sea lochs of the west coast of Scotland are near to
despair. In the past six weeks the price they have been getting for their
fish has fallen by 45 per cent, dropping well below their break-even point.
The price has collapsed because of a big increase in the quantity of
Norwegian salmon on the European market, already dampened by recession. The
concern of the Scottish farmers is intensifying because the UK government
has not responded to their demands to ask the European Union to impose
emergency protection measures on the salmon market.
'It's absolutely appalling,' says Mr David Windmill, managing director of
McConnell Salmon, which operates in the Western Isles. 'We've been through
hell over the past three years. Now we're being hit once again by a much
bigger salmon producer which can't control its own industry.'
The crisis in the salmon farming industry is more than just an issue for
Scotland, where the industry employs 6,000 people. As well as affecting
Ireland, another salmon producer, it is an important issue to be resolved
before Norway can join the EU because of its past record of over-production.
There have already been some signs that British consumers are benefiting
from lower prices for salmon. In recent weeks Safeway and Sainsbury, the
retail superstores, have cut salmon prices, and prices in the highly
competitive smoked salmon market are likely to be pared down for the peak
Christmas season.
The introduction of salmon farming in Norway and later in Scotland in the
1980s made the king of fish more widely available and much cheaper because
of vastly increased output. Last year Norway produced 141,000 tonnes
compared with Scotland's 38,000 tonnes and Ireland's 9,000 tonnes. But
Norway's dominant position has been a constant source of problems for other
producers, and itself.
The issue came to head in November 1991, after a glut of Norwegian salmon
pushed down prices just as it is doing now. The EU temporarily imposed a
minimum import price on salmon from Norway to protect its own growers, and
insisted the country put its house in order.
The Norwegian government responded by advancing money to the banks to fund a
scheme to buy in and freeze excess fish then sell it outside the Union. The
Norwegian Fish Sales Organisation, which sold all Norwegian salmon and
exercised some control over the industry, went bankrupt because it had
become overextended trying to support a guaranteed minimum price. It took
many farmers with it, put further strain on the already stretched banks and
forced the government to refinance them.
These moves, plus other measures to hold back Norwegian production, sent
prices up again in 1992. In Scotland, surviving farms made themselves more
efficient and returned to profit. At the annual Scottish fish farm
conference last February the Norwegians warned that if European salmon
producers did not combine to rationalise production there would be a crisis
by 1996.
So it came as a shock when in late September the Norwegians indicated that
instead of the 120,000 tonnes of fish they had predicted for 1993 they were
on course to produce 180,000 tonnes, rising to 220,000 tonnes in 1994.
This year, like competitors elsewhere, Norwegian salmon producers have
benefited from breakthroughs in dealing with the threats of infestation by
sea lice and the disease furunculosis. The rate of losses among fish in
cages on some Scottish salmon farms has fallen from about 20 per cent to 5
per cent.
But fish farmers in Scotland believe some Norwegians have put more smolts
(young fish) into cages for growing into salmon than they had admitted.
'Since the bankruptcy of the Fish Sales Organisation in 1991 the Norwegian
industry has been a free-for-all,' says Mr Frank Odie of Framgord, a salmon
wholesaler in Shetland.
Prices started falling as more Norwegian fish came onto the European market
from September onwards. The average price dropped from Pounds 1.74 a pound
that month to Pounds 1.44 in October. It is now about Pounds 1 a pound. This
spells disaster for Scottish salmon farmers whose break-even point is about
Pounds 1.30 a pound.
Scottish salmon farmers responded by asking the UK government to seek
emergency EU action against Norway. This would entail either setting a limit
on the tonnage of fish that can be imported from Norway, or reimposing a
minimum import price.
The Scottish Salmon Growers' Association justifies this request on the
grounds that Norwegian producers are selling salmon at below cost prices on
the EU market. The association also says that the Norwegian government
unfairly subsidised its salmon industry through the 1991 bank bail-out.
'The Norwegian salmon industry lost Pounds 300m in 1990-92,' says Mr William
Crowe, the SSGA's chief executive. 'Of that about Pounds 150m was absorbed
by the government.'
In spite of promises of imminent action from some ministers, the UK
government has not moved, apparently because Treasury ministers oppose the
kind of trade protection the farmers want. The UK failed to support an
application last week by Ireland for emergency EU action.
Norway has reacted to the threat of EU action and also fears another glut.
Most farmers have cut down on fish feeding to reduce weight gain.
The Norwegian fish farmers' federation has asked the government to limit the
number of fish that can be harvested, though many observers think this
solution is impractical as it would be difficult to police.
Meanwhile Norway still hopes to join the EU within the decade. Mr Donald
MacRae of TSB Bank Scotland believes the EU should make it a membership
condition that Norway regulates its salmon industry and stops subsidising
it.
'If Norway were a member of the EU it would become subject to EU competition
laws. If I were Norway I would be building up my salmon production as fast
as possible before entry,' he said. The Scottish salmon farmers believe that
is exactly what it happening.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Runners under starter's orders: Raymond Snoddy examines the
corporate battle to operate the UK's first national lottery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dublin taxi driver had no doubt about the best things that had happened
in Ireland in the past 10 years. 'The visit of the Pope and the national
lottery,' he declared with great conviction.
The Irish lottery launched in 1987 has, by any standards, been a
considerable success. Nearly 60 per cent of Irish adults play once a week,
spending an average of just over IRPounds 3 and producing revenues last year
of more than IRPounds 252m from a population of 3.5m.
'It has entered the rhythm of Irish life,' said Mr Ray Bates, the lottery
director. At 8pm on Wednesday and Saturday evenings, when the big draws are
broadcast live, three-quarters of Irish homes tune in.
The corporate runners and riders now beginning to line up for the great
National Lottery stakes in the UK hope that this success can be replicated,
though on a grander scale. 'The televised draw will get a bigger audience
than Coronation Street (one of the most popular shows on British
television),' said Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive of Granada, the
television company.
He is also executive chairman of The Great British Lottery Company, one of
the first of the bidders in pursuit of the single operator's licence to be
awarded in March or April next year. There will only be one operator's
licence although other companies can provide individual games.
If anything like the Irish experience were repeated in the much larger UK
economy, then the new National Lottery licence would be a prize worth
winning. On the basis of the Irish experience turnover could approach Pounds
10bn a year.
This is extremely unlikely, mainly because of competition from the Pounds
800m-a-year football pool markets, quite apart from other 'harder' forms of
gambling such as casinos and horse racing. Yet there is a growing belief
that Pounds 1.5bn-a-year estimates of potential revenues from Mr Peter
Brooke, the national heritage secretary, are conservative and that more than
Pounds 3bn looks possible when the lottery gets into its stride. The first
winning numbers could be chosen by next autumn.
In a recent study, including a model of future lottery finances,
stockbrokers Hoare Govett argued that the National Lottery was likely to
become the single largest 'consumer product' in the UK. 'Our forecast
turnover of Pounds 3.5bn in year five will produce revenues to the exchequer
of Pounds 420m and a sum for the beneficiaries of Pounds 1.8bn,' it said.
The beneficiaries will be - in equal proportions - the arts, sport,
charities, national heritage and a fund to pay for projects to celebrate the
millennium.
The other bidder already trotting off down the course is Camelot, a
consortium bringing together Cadbury Schweppes, De La Rue, GTECH, Racal
Electronics and ICL. Like The Great British Lottery Company, also a
broad-ranging consortium grouping Hambros, Associated Newspapers, Carlton
Communications and Vodaphone as well as Granada, Camelot has already hired
about 100 people and will probably spend about Pounds 2m by the time the bid
document is submitted; the expenditure will cover the cost of the bid in
addition to carrying out planning for the earliest possible national launch
of the lottery.
At least five other riders, some more committed than others, are approaching
the starting gate and most of them are likely to submit their bids in
February.
The definite starters include the Rank Organisation, N M Rothschild in a
joint venture with Tattersalls, the Australian lottery company, and the
Tote, the body responsible for managing on-course pooled betting at horse
races. The Tote has linked up with GEC, Thorn EMI and an unnamed lottery
equipment supplier which is an equity investor.
Ladbrokes, the betting and leisure group which owns Vernons football pools,
has not formally declared yet but is likely to submit a bid with partners.
A rather flightly outsider not to be ignored is Mr Richard Branson, who has
a team, advised by advertising agency J Walter Thompson, working on a
non-profit-making bid. 'We are spending a lot of time on this,' said Mr
Branson, who envisages a wholly commercial operating company which would
give all its profits to a charitable trust.
Most of the would-be lottery operators have gone down the consortium route,
pulling in expertise ranging from computer power to retailing and television
experience in the form of equity investors.
Mr Michael Gifford, chief executive of the Rank Organisation, has been
working on a possible bid for five years and will contract his outside
expertise. It is believed he has secured exclusive deals for all the
suppliers he needs, including Arthur Andersen, the consultancy which has a
specialist lottery team, and Dittler, the US lottery ticket company.
'We say we are an operator. We will buy at best value what is needed to make
it work,' said Mr Gifford. An indication of his seriousness comes today when
Mr Ian Neilson-Jones takes up his new job of leading Rank's lottery bid. Mr
Neilson-Jones previously ran the lottery in Ontario, Canada - the fifth
largest in the world.
Also later today Mr Anthony Fry of Rothschilds/Tattersalls will decide
whether to send out tender documents following the release of draft lottery
regulations last week or wait until the final versions are available next
month.
Work is now under way following the publication last week of draft licences
and application documents and a series of tough rules from the Department of
National Heritage. These include limits on rolling over the top prize for
more than three weeks, which would block Dollars 100m US-style payouts and
preventing tickets being sold in places such as betting shops or bingo
halls.
By next year the lottery will offer considerable opportunities to a wide
range of businesses - from suppliers of on-line terminals for the eventual
20,000-30,000 retail outlets, to printers of lottery tickets. An estimated
500 jobs could be created directly, double that if associated jobs are
included.
According to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research a total
of 85,000 jobs could be generated from the 'multiplier' effect, including
jobs in the construction industry from the money spent on good causes such
as building new sports facilities.
The winner of the lottery licence will have to fight for its profits. After
assuring Mr Peter Davis, director-general of the Office of the National
Lottery, the body responsible for setting up and regulating the lottery, of
its probity and reliability the contest will then turn on numbers - some of
them very small. The smallest percentages of administration costs will
impress Mr Davis as will small profit margins, although the main aim is to
maximise revenues.
Hoare Govett estimates that by the fifth year the operator could be earning
annual profits of Pounds 70m, though by then it would only have 18 months
left of its licence, which expires on March 31 2001.
Unlike experience almost everywhere else the UK lottery will probably start
with a 'big bang' - a national launch of on-line terminals where customers
can chose their own numbers and have them entered directly into the computer
system and receive a ticket in seconds. In other countries lotteries have
launched first with 'instant' games such as scratch cards and then moved on
to more sophisticated computerised versions.
The UK lottery is also unusual in that it will be the first 'privatised'
lottery in the European Union. Its supporters hope that it will share one
aspect of lotteries which is almost universal - if lotteries are properly
administered and there is an interesting diversity of games, they make more
money than originally forecast.
In the first week of the Irish lottery IRPounds 6m was taken in revenues on
scratch cards alone. And when the first big Lotto prize was won there was
even a religious echo - the winner used the letters in the name of her
favourite saint to help chose the winning permutation. For the seven likely
bidders plus any dark horses the permutations are endless.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Dilemma at the centre of 'A' level
intake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr G P GALLIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your survey of October 31 in which a selection of schools is ranked by
the students' 'A' level results presents a dilemma which I should like to
share with you. While the articles associated with the statistics indicate
the caution with which they have to be interpreted, they do not present
clearly what appears to me to be a central issue.
Like many comprehensive schools, we are now accepting a rising proportion of
our students on to 'A' level courses which were intended originally for the
most able 25 per cent of the population. We receive about 200 children of
all abilities each year from the neighbourhood, and have for several years
accepted some 35 per cent of these to study for 'A' levels.
In recent years this proportion has increased to 55 per cent, and the
'additional' students have largely gained reasonable 'A' level grades. They
have been accepted into higher education courses and we are confident that
they have benefited from their time in the sixth form.
We could, very simply, raise our score and find a high place on your
listings by restricting our entry into 'A' level to the figures of three
years ago. We shall not do so, in the interests of students, parents and of
employers. However, by encouraging more students to aim higher we shall
appear to be achieving less than many of the schools in your list. Are those
lists really serving a valuable educational purpose?
Incidentally, we believe that we offer 'good value for money'. The annual
cost of educating each student at this school, now borne almost entirely
through funds delegated to the school, is Pounds 1,820. Our 'A' level
results compare favourably with many schools working on double that figure.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Arts: Relative Values - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Noel Coward's Relative Values was first performed in Newcastle upon Tyne in
October 1951, then moved to the Savoy Theatre in London where it had a run
of 477 performances. Gladys Cooper and Angela Baddeley were among the stars.
The play suggested that Coward could still shine in the postwar world,
though in retrospect it was his last great piece.
The date seems slightly odd, for the programme note for the revival, also at
the Savoy, states that the action takes place at Marshwood House in Kent in
July 1952. Never mind the apparent discrepancy. The Savoy has changed as
well. Having being severely damaged by fire in 1990, it has been
reconstructed in the hope of restoring old splendours.
The theatre remains confusingly subterranean, and at first sight seems cold
and metallic, at least when the houselights are up. When the houselights are
down, however, such reservations diminish. The Savoy has a wonderfully
capacious stage and now has the most comfortable seats in London.
It takes a good 20 minutes to realise what a good Coward play Relative
Values is. It has a slow start in any case and Susan Hampshire in the star
role of Felicity, Countess of Marshwood seems to need time to warm up. By
half way through she looks a natural for one of the best female parts that
Coward ever wrote. She is imperious, she is charming, she knows her place
(and everyone else's) in society.
The piece is a joyous, sentimental fling at socialism. It's a social
experiment, says the man-servant Crestwell, to show that not only is
everyone equal in the eyes of God, we are all equally equal in the eyes of
our fellow creatures. Coward the playwright comes in, too: 'Comedies of
manners,' somebody says, 'soon became obsolete when there were no longer any
manners.'
Here is the old classless society where the lady of the manor gets on very
well with the servants, and they with each other, provided there aren't too
many intruders. There is an excellent plot which shows what can happen when
people get above their station, and some lovely contrasting of the style of
Hollywood movies and London's West End. But there is no bitterness: the
admiration for Hollywood at its best is unconcealed, from the Countess of
Marshwood down to the humblest servant.
There is also some interesting social comment. 'How did you vote in the last
general election?' someone asks. It must have been the one that returned the
Tories to power without, in Evelyn Waugh's phrase, putting the clock back by
even five minutes. The old British Railways seems to have been at least as
erratic in its timetabling as its successor today. And even in the early
1950s trouble was brewing in the Church of England.
Ms Hampshire is not the only star. Almost no West End production of Coward
nowadays is complete without young Sara Crowe. She appears here as the
Hollywood star concealing her modest birth in Sidcup by claiming that she
was brought up in even direr circumstances in Brixton. Ever since she
emerged alongside Joan Collins in Private Lives, she has had to compete with
older women. It is good to see the old guard still giving as good as it
gets. Ms Crowe's performance is at least matched by Alison Fiske as her
elder sister who has stayed at home in Kent. And there is a splendid
bit-part played by Margaret Courtenay as the plumpish, elderly Lady Hayling.
Direction is by Tim Luscombe, with an attractive set designed by Rob Howell:
note its depth, and the colours.
Meanwhile. for late night theatre addicts, there are two more performances
of Franz Kafka's A Report to an Academy at the Royal Court at 10.30 pm next
Friday and Saturday. The stage version is adapted and played by Henry
Goodman as the ape who gives the report. None of the lucid, bitter quality
of the writing is lost, and you will be amazed by how ape-like as well as
professorial Goodman is.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Arts: A Sondheim straitjacket
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Watching The Ten Commandments, a musical written by a committee and which
has just been performed at the Place, is as grim an experience as I have
undergone in a long age. But pity the poor folk involved] They had to write
and rehearse it. The fact that it is a bad show is not in itself important,
since trashy musicals are common phonomena. What is sad, indeed alarming,
about The Ten Commandments is that it is the product of an entire school of
aspiring songwriters who mean to advance the musical.
The name of this collective is the Mercury Workshop, which was formed in
April 1992 as a spin-off from Stephen Sondheim's masterclasses in Oxford. I
saw the workshop's first show, The Challenge, in July 1992; and, though that
show had some glimmerings of talent, I am now wholly persuaded that Oxford's
idea of getting Sondheim to teach those masterclasses was the worst thing
that could have happened to British musical theatre. These young-ish writers
now seem to have wholly subordinated themselves to Sondheim style; they have
learnt everything from Sondheim except his talent.
They have, in fact, learnt the Ten Commandments of Sondheim musical theatre.
Namely: 1. Thou shalt have no other gods before Saint Stephen. 2. Thou shalt
be clever. 3. Thou shalt be cynical. 4. Thou shalt not be original. 5. Thou
shalt give each line of verse as few syllables as possible. 6. Thou shalt
rhyme, rhyme, rhyme. 7. Thou shalt give equal stress to most syllables, then
undue stress to the last syllable of each line. 8. Thou shalt make music
less vital than words. 9. Thou shalt eschew jazz, swing, and rock from thy
music. 10. Thou shalt cultivate a truly wearisome mixture of patter,
vaudeville, and ballroom musical ingredients.
A possible Eleventh Commandment (though it is one that Saint Sondheim has
broken on occasion) is: Thou shalt choose as unlikely a subject for musical
as the brain of man might conceive. In The Challenge the Mercury Workshop
set itself the task of telling the tale of Daedalus, the Minotaur and
Icarus. For The Ten Commandments, each of the Biblical commandments is
assigned to a separate decade of the 20th century; and each commandment is
viewed as cynically as possible. Thus, 'Thou shalt not kill' is illustrated
in Africa in 1907, when a ritual self-sacrifice is stopped by Christian
teaching with unhappy effect; 'Thou Shalt not Commit Adultery' is seen in
the 1960s, with contraception and adultery adding up to lovelessness.
All is cynical, gloomy, clever; and the evening made me wish to heaven that
rhyme had never been invented. The 1960s number (lyrics by Stephen Clark)
finds so many lines to rhyme with 'bed', and seems so pleased with them,
that I was amazed when finally it moved on to use another rhyming word. In
the Ninth Commandment, Warren Wills's music showed some signs of
originality, and Adele Anderson's lyrics some refreshing independence from
rhymestering - though not for long.
What is most depressing is that these composers and lyricists seem to have
learnt nothing from the larger world of Gershwin, Rodgers and Hart, Berlin,
Porter - the true masters of the idiom in this century. None of the
composers seem to have thought about setting expansively lyrical music to
words that are cynical - as, for example, Rodgers does to Hart's 'Falling in
love with love' (or Sullivan to Gilbert's 'Hearts do not break'). These
people write songs as if the last thing they wanted was for an audience to
come out humming them; and their lyricists write words as if the last thing
an audience might need was a good time.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Arts: Stunning work despite recession - FT Architecture
Award
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The FT Architecture Award has had a particularly splendid year. There was a
record number of entries - 154 - and the quality was extremely high. The
Award will be presented at a luncheon in London when Sir Simon Hornby, the
official lay member of the Financial Times Architectural Award jury, and
himself a considerable patron of new buildings as chairman of WH Smith, will
be the main speaker. As the new chairman of the Royal Horticultural Society
and a former chairman of the Design Council, he is well qualified to
consider the whole question of architecture and business.
What emerged clearly from the travels of the jury - and it is an important
feature of the FT award that the jury visits all the short listed buildings
 -is that the very best British architects have produced some stunning
recent work, the recession notwithstanding. One of the following has won
this year's coveted FT Architecture Award, but in the true spirit of
competition the winning building and architect will not be named until the
luncheon.
The shortlist begins with an excellent small building by Sir Norman Foster.
His new library for the Cranfield management school is an elegant,
classically proportioned small temple of learning, the more impressive since
it was achieved on the relatively low budget allocated.
Norman Foster and Partners' much grander and deceptively simple new airport
at Stansted is also on the short list. Many think it the most beautiful new
airport in the world and certainly the level clarity of the design is quite
brilliant. I have always been particularly impressed by the way it sits in
the landscape, but perhaps the most beautiful feature is the ingenious
system of natural lighting. Structurally it has a rare purity.
The Queen's Stand at Epsom by Richard Horden is a very unusual type of
building which has brought out the best from this practice. An extremely
enjoyable place to visit, it proves that contemporary places of pleasure do
not have to be sterile or concrete. It has the elegance of a modern yacht.
Michael Hopkins has a triumvirate of buildings in this year's short list.
Just outside Cambridge he has added to the Schlumberger research centre (an
earlier FT winner). These simple wings on each side of a modest atrium are
very controlled and restrained. What is particularly exciting here is
Hopkins's adventure in 'gothic' with his geometric concrete laboratory
ceilings.
Anyone associated with the FT has a soft spot for its old home, Bracken
House by St Paul's cathedral, which was sold to a Japanese company and
turned into a bank. The original building was put up in the 1950s to designs
by Sir Albert Richardson. The fine quality of the design, workmanship and
materials led to its being listed. Hopkins had a difficult task convert a
former newspaper offices and printing works into a bank. Retaining the north
and south blocks as bookends, he has inserted a brilliantly designed new
central block with all the muscle and strength of the original without a
hint of imitation.
Out near Heathrow Airport are the business parks. Stockley Park is the most
outstanding but a more recent one, Bedfont Lakes, is fascinating, if a
little schizophrenic. Two architects designed the two main ranges of office
buildings and the results are like chalk and cheese. Ted Cullinan built
large, vernacularesque blocks while Michael Hopkins followed a more
orthodox, almost Miesian line, in his buildings for IBM. These are solemn
and austere, with all the attention to detail that one has come to expect
both from the Hopkins and IBM, which is probably the most serious business
patron of design and architecture in the world.
The two remaining entries on the short list are quite unlike each other and
quite unlike the rest of the list. The local authority offices in Winchester
by Colin Stansfield Smith are a serious attempt to be modern in an old
context. In roof line and at street level the shapes and materials are
contextual, but in between it is a braver new world with large areas of
glass.
In Chichester is the final building on this year's short list - a remarkable
multi-storey car park by architects Birds Portchmouth and Russum. This is a
controversial addition to a historic town which tackles the problems of car
parking head on and with considerable style.
The decision on the winner will be a hard one to make.
The result will be announced at the luncheon on Monday 29 November, at the
BAFTA Centre, 195, Piccadilly, London, W1 and this year it would be a
pleasure to see some of our FT readers. Ten places will be available and
readers should apply for their invitation to Mrs Vicki Harvey-Piper, The
Financial Times, Number One Southwark Bridge, London, SE1 9HL. Places will
be given to the first ten applicants received in the post.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Arts: City of London Sinfonia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saturday's Queen Elizabeth Hall concert by the City of London Sinfonia made
up a retrospective of music by three popular contemporary composers, Arvo
Part, John Tavener and Alfred Schnittke. It was a long evening by any
standards, doubly so because of the static nature of most of the music.
Part and Tavener have been dubbed, uncharitably but not inaccurately, 'holy
minimalists', which reflects the musical and spiritual inspiration each
derives from Orthodox Christianity. Their minimalism is not of the Steve
Reich 'tape-loop' brand, rather it is based on rich, slowly-shifting
sonorities that suggest religious fervour.
Part's short, serene Cantus in memoriam Benjamin Britten, which opened the
programme, explores a single idea and succeeds on its own mystic terms,
though these are limited. His 30-minute Tabula Rasa (composed, like the
Cantus, in 1977) is another matter: a clean slate only in its emptiness, it
essays some titillating effects at length - modern music for people who
think they don't like modern music.
Tavener's music is equally unchallenging. While it is hard to doubt the
sincerity of the composer's inspiration, the appearance of more cello music
so soon after the great commercial success of his Protecting Veil raises a
question.
Ironically, it was in the work of the maverick Schnittke that music of
substance was reached, his Concerto Grosso No. 1 seeming like an oasis of
dissonance. The concert ended with Schnittke's jokey Moz-Art a la Haydn.
Like all the pieces in the programme, it requires a steady, metronomic
conductor, and found one in Richard Hickox.

<TEXT>
When parents try to persuade a child to enter into the spirit of some
forthcoming 'treat' such as a visit to Auntie they say 'You know you'll like
it once you're there'. But the more insistent they become, the further out
the child's bottom lip protrudes. I feel much the same about series such as
Wild Palms (BBC2, 9.00) which, according to the promoters' endless hype, is
even more weird and addictive than 'Twin Peaks'. The more they go on about
it the more I want to say 'No, won't watch'. It is, of course, American, it
seeks to develop a cult, James Belushi and Angie Dickinson star, and Oliver
Stone is co-producer. You get 90 minutes tonight, 45 tomorrow, and then it
continues on Tuesdays.
C4 also starts another new American series: Homicide: Life On The Street
(10.00) which follows the fortunes of a police murder squad. Hasn't that
been done before? In Panorama (BBC1, 9.30), environment correspondent Ian
Breach reports on the building of Thorp, a 'nuclear laundry' which the
government is expected to approve this week, though there seem to be doubts
about whether it is needed.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Construction Contracts: Mowlem clinches Pounds 50m station
deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN MOWLEM has won a Pounds 50m build contract from London Underground as
part of the Jubilee Line extension.
The company will construct the surface section of the line from Canning Town
to Stratford, new stations at Canning Town and West Ham and part of a new
interchange station at Stratford.
Work also requires the demolition of a number of existing buildings on the
site, culverting of a section of the Channelsea River, preparation of cable
routes for signalling and power supply equipment, construction of track
drainage, new retaining walls and acoustic barriers.
The Canning Town station will handle British Rail's North London Line,
Docklands Light Railway and the Jubilee Line extension. The structure has to
be built on a constricted site between the DLR and BR's North London Line,
with 132 kva electricity cables for the national grid running overhead.
The DLR platforms will be above those for the Jubilee Line and there will be
an underground ticket hall giving access to all platforms. Mowlem is to
build a new bus station with subway links to the station and a riverside
walkway.
Consultants for the project are Kenchington Ford and Mason Pittendrigh. Work
starts November for completion in summer 1997.

FT  15 NOV 93 / People: Shell's md of UK exploration
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Heinz Rothermund (right) is to take over as managing director of Shell UK
Exploration and Production on January 1. He replaces Chris Fay, who has
moved up to chairman and chief executive.
Rothermund, a Swiss citizen and an engineering graduate of the Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology, first came to the UK in 1976, serving a stint as
offshore installation manager on the Brent 'B' platform. He later assumed a
senior offshore design post and became project manager for the Tern field,
before moving on in 1982 to Shell's operations in Nigeria.
Those were the 'glory days' of the North Sea, he said yesterday from his
office in Hanover, where he is chief executive of BEB Erdgas und Erdoel, an
oil and gas joint venture between Shell and Esso.
Recent developments in the German gas market 'are not comparable' to events
taking place in the UK, he concedes, but the future of the British gas
industry will figure heavily in his new job overseeing the UK largest
offshore operator, accounting for about a third of national oil and gas
production. 'I will be extremely curious to see how the UK gas market
develops.'
Rothermund does not expect to face radically different challenges in
exploration and development. But he admits that the task of finding and
developing oil in the deep water to the west of Shetland will press offshore
technology to its limits.
Rothermund hopes he will find some changes in social circumstances. When he
last lived in the country 'I was always finding myself defending Britain at
parties' against a wave of disparaging remarks from the British themselves.
'In those days I was very surprised to see them run down their country so
much. It has so much to offer.'

FT  15 NOV 93 / People: Morrison and Davies get 'divorced'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Morrison, Goldman Sachs' London-based international currency expert,
has taken a leaf out of the book of Michael Jordan, the US basketball star
who has just announced that he is quitting at the peak of his career. Still
only 41, Morrison is giving up one of the best-paid economic jobs in the
City by resigning as a general partner of Goldman Sachs.
Gavyn Davies, 42, Morrison's long-standing partner, describes Morrison's
decision to retire as 'like a divorce'. The two of them have worked together
for more than a decade; they started as economists at stockbrokers Phillips
and Drew in the late 1970s, moved to Simon &amp; Coates in 1981 and then to
Goldman Sachs in 1986. Two years later they were both made general partners
of the US investment bank, confirming their position as two of the most
respected economists in the City of London.
Morrison, who will be a limited partner of Goldman and will retain an office
there, had begun to tire of the pressures involved in working for a
high-powered US investment bank - the constant travelling and the need to
make speeches all the time.
'Maybe there are fresh challenges out there,' says Morrison, who has not
ruled out re-emerging in the financial markets at some stage. But for the
moment he intends to spend more time with a family which is growing up
rapidly, indulge his passion for motor sport and devote more effort to
helping handicapped children.
Morrison's departure at the end of this month means that Gavyn Davies will
become head of European investment research and chief international
economist. Jeremy Hale will take responsibility for the firm's foreign
exchange forecasts.

He will stay on at Babcock Thorn, which runs the warship builder Rosyth

FT  15 NOV 93 / People: BZW hires Bruce from JP Morgan
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BZW is overhauling its internal risk control mechanisms by bringing in an
extra layer of management with the hiring of Andrew Bruce, 44, currently the
member of JP Morgan's European management group responsible for credit risk
throughout Europe. He will join Barclay's investment banking operation from
the beginning of next year.
David Band, BZW chief executive, says that the two institutions he most
respects for their credit risk management skills are his own former stable,
JP Morgan, and GE Capital. Band has just brought Patrick O'Sullivan from the
latter into the new post of head of bank finance, following a transfer of
control of large corporate lending from the bank to BZW.
Band was chairman of JP Morgan Securities in 1987 and 1988 when Bruce was
head of credit and counterparty risk there. He says that when he was at
Morgan, its officials in turn looked up to GE Capital in the risk analysis
department.
Financial institutions have become increasingly aware of the elements of
credit, as opposed to market, risk in growing areas such as swaps and
derivatives. Previously, BZW's credit risk exposure had been the
responsibility of Peter Bingham, chief credit officer, who reported to chief
financial officer Oliver Stocken. When Stocken moved up to become group
finance director, Bingham reported to Lord Camoys as an interim measure, but
Camoys retires next April. Now Bingham will work for Bruce, who in turn will
report directly to Band.

FT  15 NOV 93 / The Week Ahead: Recovery poser for Clarke near Budget -
Economics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS week's string of UK economic releases provides Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, with his last chance to gauge the strength of the recovery ahead
of the Budget.
The big imponderable is whether or not he will cut interest rates on or
around budget day. Wednesday's retail prices index may give a clue. The
headline inflation rate has risen for four consecutive months, albeit from
the lowest level for a generation.
The underlying rate, which excludes mortgage interest payments, has also
crept upwards prompting some commentators to suggest that another round of
monetary easing now would be precipitate.
Official retail sales figures are also out in the UK this week. In September
they rose 0.5 per cent on the month to stand 3.5 per cent up on a year ago,
lending weight to evidence that consumer spending is the driving force
behind the recovery. The consensus forecast is for a slightly smaller
monthly increase in October of 0.3 per cent.
In the US, the big event of the week is the crucial Nafta vote in the House
of Representatives. Rejection of the treaty would severely disrupt progress
on Gatt and US-Japan bilateral trade agreements.
The Federal Open Markets Committee meets in Washington tomorrow. In spite of
a 0.4 per cent rise in the October consumer prices index, it is assumed that
the Fed will maintain a neutral stance on monetary policy.
The rest of the week's economic releases follow. The figures in brackets are
the median of analysts' forecasts from MMS International, the financial
information company.

utilisation (82 per cent), September business inventories (unchanged),

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN British Steel have more than doubled this year, reflecting relief
that the group has been able to make price increases stick in the slowly
recovering UK market. Analysts expect pre-tax profits today of about Pounds
10m in the six months to October, compared with a loss of Pounds 51m last
time, and resumption of an interim dividend of 0.5p.
Most interest will focus on the progress of restructuring the European steel
industry, with the company anxious to maintain maximum pressure on the UK
government to seek the closure through the European Commission of less
efficient capacity.
The City will be looking for confirmation from British Airways today that
the airline is riding out the recession better than its main competitors.
Pre-tax profits for the second quarter should be close to Pounds 170m,
compared with Pounds 136m last year.
Almost as important will be the figures that show how much money each
passenger is paying for a seat and the airline's costs per kilometre
travelled by that passenger.
They will point to the effectiveness in beating off competition brought by
the company's expensive refit of its business and first class cabins.
Interim results tomorrow from BAA, which operates the UK's biggest airports,
should see pre-tax profits rise beyond Pounds 240m, compared with Pounds
220m last time, with the dividend rising to almost 7p from 6.25p.
Analysts will be keen to see how the company's retailing interests are
faring. That part of its business is taking on an increasingly important
role as parking and landing fees aid by airlines are tightly controlled by
regulatory rules.
Commercial Union and General Accident are both expected to report
substantial increases in profits when they post their results for the first
nine months of 1993 this week.
Analysts expect GA to record pre-tax profits tomorrow of between Pounds 195m
and Pounds 230m compared to a loss of Pounds 37m at the same stage last
year.
CU on Wednesday is expected to register an increase to between Pounds 128m
and Pounds 151m, compared to Pounds 6m last year. Increases in premium
rates, especially in the UK and improved claims experience are the main
reasons.
Cable &amp; Wireless interim pre-tax profits forecasts are in the range Pounds
490m to Pounds 520m. At Pounds 500m, C&amp;W would be 32 per cent ahead of last
year (Pounds 378m), with earnings per share up to 10.9p from 9p (adjusted).
But most of the increased profit is attributable to currency gains on its
business in Hong Kong and the Caribbean.
Land Securities, the UK's biggest property company, is expected to report
flat interim figures tomorrow. Analysts are looking for pre-tax profits of
around Pounds 117m - half the Pounds 234m for the year ended March. A small
rise in the dividend for the full-year is expected, but there might not be
an increase in the interim, which was 6.3p last time.
De La Rue, the security printer and cash-handling machine group, is expected
to report tomorrow that half-year profits have increased from Pounds 46m to
between Pounds 48m - Pounds 55m. The City will be interested in any
acquisition plans or whether - like Reuters - the group might consider
handing back some cash to shareholders.
Storehouse, the clothing retail group comprising BHS, Mothercare and Blazer,
is expected to report a more than a four-fold increase in interim profits on
Thursday to about Pounds 14m. That compares with Pounds 3.1m last year,
before exceptional costs of about Pounds 30m relating to the sale of
businesses. The interim dividend is expected to be raised from 2.5p to
2.75p.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Management: A week to stand out - Tim Dickson and John
Authers look at two new training initiatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A recent survey showed that roughly 90 per cent of UK organisations think
management training is 'a good thing'. But whereas those who promote
motherhood and apple pie generally put their money where their mouths are,
the same study suggested that only 50 per cent of UK companies run formal
management training programmes to underpin their beliefs.
It is this gap which the Management Charter Initiative, an independent body
backed by 1,600 companies and the UK government, has tried to fill for the
last five years.
By its own admission there is still a long way to go. MCI's chief executive
Andrew Summers estimates that about 11 per cent of UK organisations are
applying the benchmarks of best practice it has developed for middle and
first-line managers and supervisors; perhaps half of these are encouraging
their staff to acquire a National Vocational Qualification in management.
MCI's underlying thesis that the ability of managers can be improved by
adhering to a set of standard competences has also run into some scepticism.
Undeterred, MCI is aiming to raise its profile and spread the message with
its week-long Be a Better Manager campaign, which starts today and has the
backing of the Confederation of British Industry and the Department of
Employment. Around 7,500 managers in the UK will be working to a selection
of MCI's management standards for the first time, assessing at the end of
the exercise what they have got out of it.
The campaign is being fronted by the Woolwich Building Society, National
Westminster Bank, Auto Windscreens (part of the building products group
Heywood Williams) and the Magistrates Court Service. Others taking part
include the National Trust, BBC Wales, Texas Homecare and the Benefits
Agency.
Participants will work to one of four, one-page checklists - managing the
workplace, cost control, leading meetings and setting objectives - each of
which is an abridged version of an MCI standard. At the end, individuals
compare what they expected with the benefits achieved.
Parts of the MCI check lists may seem obvious, but no more so than the
advice some management consultants sell for a fancy fee.
Setting objectives and explaining them, keeping spending within budget,
preparing adequately for meetings and ensuring equipment is maintained, are
ideas which bear constant repetition. All the more so given the extra
responsibilities thrust on to middle managers due to 'delayering' (the
removal through sacking and early retirement of entire management tiers).
Judging by their comments at Friday's press conference, the four front
organisations are enthusiastic about the campaign, expecting it to raise the
profile of management development within their companies or services and to
encourage wider employee participation. Its success will depend on how far
the MCI convinces others that adhering to the standards has demonstrably
improved these organisations' management performance.
Summers says the chief barrier to more widespread management training in UK
companies is not cost. 'When we ask people that usually come eighth or ninth
on the list. The sort of thing they tend to say is that they are too small,
that they only employ trained staff, or that they have no time.'

FT  15 NOV 93 / Management: Cinderellas en route to the ball - Tim Dickson
and John Authers look at two new training initiatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies looking to cut training bills could do worse than look at the UK's
further education colleges.
FE colleges, which provide post-16 vocational training, adult education and
increasingly offer an alternative to schools for teaching A-levels, have a
reputation as the 'Cinderellas' of British education, mainly thanks to the
country's traditional preoccupation with academic qualifications. But they
have the resources to produce work tailored directly to the technical
training needs of individual companies.
Large employers already make extensive use of FE colleges, but take-up by
smaller companies remains disappointing. At a CBI conference tomorrow, John
Patten, the education secretary, is expected to announce a package of
measures to help businesses fund or build links with FE colleges.
The experience of Rover and Land Rover in Birmingham highlights the
possibilities for larger companies. Land Rover used to have its own training
school. Trainees and apprentices would then be sent to East Birmingham
College to brush up on theoretical details. However, it closed its school 10
years ago because it seemed more cost-effective and now uses the college's
larger facilities for all its first-year training. Land Rover's trainers
attend all classes, and trainees, who work together in one group, are
sponsored by the company.
Fees are fixed in line with what the college can afford. Since April,
colleges have been 'incorporated', meaning their funding is devolved, but
comes ultimately from central government rather than local education
authorities. This makes costing more transparent, allowing employers to
negotiate more easily over price.
Rover's Longbridge factory has similar links with Bourneville college
outside Birmingham, along with its own education service. John Towers,
Rover's managing director, believes investment in education schemes and
local colleges is 'nothing to do with altruism, it's about competitive
dynamics'.
Working with colleges allows the company to take on young people at 16 and
put them through a common learning programme closely related to their
eventual work, but at the same time allowing flexibility. Rover's programme
allows employees ultimately to earn a university degree, via an arrangement
with the University of Warwick.
Any new government action should allow more companies to benefit in the same
way.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Management: An art that deserves a high priority - Martin
Broughton, chief executive of BAT Industries, on how to handle
communications with the City / Tips from the top
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN BROUGHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is a dangerously presumptuous subject for an article as it presupposes
there is a 'right' way of handling communications with the City and that we
are arrogant enough to think we have found it. That would be far from the
truth. But I think what we have got right is recognising the need to give a
high priority to communications with the City.
What is investor relations? Is it an art or a science? The dictionary
defines the former as 'skill as the result of knowledge and practice', while
the latter is 'often opposite to art' or, more usefully, 'a branch of study
concerned with a demonstrated body of connected truths'. Given that no less
an expert than Lex in the FT once wrote that Wellcome's shares 'might either
double or halve', the field seems to be a little short on science.
Our objective is not directly to promote BAT as an investment, but rather to
explain the company. The syndicated tracking research which we do every year
through Mori is a useful starting point because it helps us to understand
what sources of information are important to our audience.
In terms of sources of information, for instance, it is remarkable that a
recent Mori survey reveals that more than 90 per cent of all investors
described brokers as 'most useful' to them in their jobs. This paints a very
different picture to the commonly held notion that institutions are paying
less and less attention to brokers' analysts. This is just as well, because
I know how much time BAT spends with the brokers' analysts, even though more
and more institutional representatives are now coming to our results
briefings.
BAT started reporting quarterly in 1987. It gives the company twice the
number of formal occasions on which to talk to the City, as well as making
the flow of information more frequent. The typical six-month gap between
preliminary and interim results can allow uncertainties to develop or can
lead to a company that is 'out of sight' also being 'out of mind'. Apart
from results days, when we hold a press conference and a video-conference
with US analysts, as well as the UK analysts' briefing, the other
face-to-face elements in our programme include facility visits to our
operations and small group meetings with investors.
A recent visit to Farmers, our US insurance subsidiary, shows how difficult
it is to manage these events. We intended to improve the parties' long-term
understanding of a key business and general feedback suggests that was
successfully achieved, but one analyst couldn't resist publicly reducing his
forecast before the presentations had even finished, leaving the market with
a different perception of the visit. Although BAT does not organise a
facility trip every year, we are committed to visiting our leading
shareholders in person annually.
What are shareholders looking for? Again, the Mori research tells us that
the two most important factors are the quality and strength of management
and the company's financial status. Given the first of these, it is not
surprising that leading investors should want to meet the management face to
face.
Contrary to what might be expected, I believe that companies try very hard
not to reveal any 'inside' information under these privileged conditions.
Indeed, in BAT's case, this part of our programme is always timed for the
period immediately following a reporting occasion.
I have tended to concentrate, in this article, on the core of our investor
relations activity but it does not exist in isolation, being supported by a
range of corporate information and even some corporate hospitality. The
annual and quarterly reports are another essential part, while advertising
our results on the financial pages of national newspapers enables us to
explain the company's performance, in a controlled way. We try hard, but we
know what we're up against in communications with the City. After all, to
invest can be an irregular verb. I have heard it conjugated: 'I invest. .
.you finance. . .they speculate.'
Next Monday: Mick Newmarch of Prudential Corporation on how to move the
corporate headquarters.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Survey of Harrogate (6): Local labour may give city its edge
 -Despite a lack of incentives, the district has shown it can attract inward
investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARROGATE has not previously tried to sell itself to inward investors. With
full employment until spring of 1990, it did not need to. Inquiries were not
turned away but were not deliberately solicited either. Policy was to be
reactive, not proactive.
The district's circumstances have changed but adjustment may take some time.
An attack of nimbyism, for example, has fed opposition to a small business
workshops programme in Nidderdale, where a change of use was required for an
old mill building.
Harrogate's leaders also admit privately that the town has some
disadvantages to overcome. The most obvious is a lack of grants for
potential incomers, who are being wooed by other areas with sometimes
substantial incentives, but there is also a problem with transport links.
It is not that Harrogate is not well placed nationally - as a glance at the
map shows. The A1, which is being upgraded to motorway standard, provides a
good north-south link, but east-west roads are usually frustrating to drive
along and traffic is always heavy throughout the network of local roads
between Harrogate, Bradford and Leeds.
Leeds-Bradford Airport, about 12 miles from Harrogate, is underdeveloped,
and has to operate under night-flying restrictions which spark widespread
local controversy - and more nimbyism when attempts are made to change them.
Harrogate council supports extending the flying hours, along with business
throughout the region. The argument is that a better array of scheduled
services to the rest of Europe is needed to ensure Yorkshire and
Humberside's long term economic development in partnership with other EC
regions rather than just regional development in British national markets.
Getting to Manchester airport, which has all the necessary services to allow
easy day trips to most European cities for those within reasonable distance,
is awkward because of local roads. There is also a worry about rail links
after privatisation of the railways.
Harrogate, therefore, presents an interesting contrast to many of its
competitors for inward investment. They can usually offer grants and other
incentives, as well as better transport infrastructure and communications,
plus easier accessibility to important regional assets, such as Manchester
airport.
So where is Harrogate's edge? The way in which the local economy is
developing suggests it could well be the type and availability of local
labour. Much of the national struggle for inward investment is about
attracting jobs for large numbers of, at best, semi-skilled men in areas of
high unemployment.
This year Harrogate reached two important inward investment shortlists. It
was knocked out by Chester in bidding for the MBNA America Bank, but
National Westminster Bank awarded Harrogate the other prize - its expanding
Switch card operations.
MBNA was the big one - a Pounds 43m project to establish a new affinity
credit card lending operation employing 800 people. Cheshire was able to
offer regional selective assistance from the government worth Pounds 7m, but
Harrogate had no incentives to compete with. However, the Switch operation
will bring 400 jobs. What Harrogate had to offer was instant availability of
42,500 sq ft of National Power's partly vacated offices at about Pounds 10 a
sq ft.
Local labour supply was also of the right kind - adaptable and used to
office work. Efforts are already being made to put the necessary training
systems in place to deal with any mismatch between existing skills and those
likely to be required by inward investors.
Working jointly with North Yorkshire County Council and the areas training
and enterprise council, Stuart Quin, Harrogate's economic development
officer, reckons the town can move quickly to support any reskilling that
may be necessary.
'The fact we have made two shortlists in financial services suggests we have
a chance with other big projects. We have also been looked at seriously for
two modern manufacturing relocations.
'Inquiries have gone up significantly in recent months,' says Michael Walsh,
Harrogate's chief executive.
Harrogate now has four general target areas for inward investment:
Modern manufacturing, such as electronics, precision engineering, electrical
engineering. The leafy, clean local environment is of the type that appeals
to such companies around the world.
Finance and business services. Local growth during 1981-91 in this sector
matched that of Leeds. (The reasons are examined in a separate article).
Medical and health care. Harrogate already houses the headquarters of the
regional health authority. It also has close ties with St James's Hospital
in Leeds, Europe's largest teaching hospital. Hazleton Laboratories Europe -
part of Corning - employs 600 people in Harrogate, carrying out research and
testing for big drug companies. The company has planning consent for a 60
per cent increase in size.
New small business. The area has already made a mark as a small firms
economy. In the 1980s Harrogate had one of Britain's fastest growth rates in
new company registrations and now has more than 3,000 small businesses, with
an average payroll of four or five people each. Harrogate enterprise agency
is recognised nationally as one of the best.
Recent movements into the area vindicate this strategy. One example is Coda,
a computer software company specialising in mid-range accounting packages,
which has brought in 120 jobs. Founded in 1979, the company moved from Leeds
 -where it was located in the city centre shopping area - to Harrogate in
1991.
Having grown to 300 employees in 20 offices worldwide, it wanted to
establish a new corporate headquarters but needed to stay in the general
area so it could retain its existing staff. Since many of them already lived
north of Leeds, Harrogate looked obvious. Coda was able to buy land and
build it own premises for about Pounds 3m.
Link Interchange Network - the hole-in-the-wall automated teller system for
32 financial institutions, mainly building societies - relocated to
Harrogate from London in 1991, to meet its requirement for room for further
growth.
The management says there has been a shift in the company's culture since
moving to Harrogate, where staff openly acknowledge their rewards and
recognition should be based on the contributions they make. Staff
'ownership' of the company's ambitions were felt essential to cope with
constant change and growth.
The implication that staff were less well-motivated in London is borne out
by very low staff turnover in Harrogate, a welcome change from the high
figures common in metropolitan locations, such as London.
Another important factor is that North Yorkshire is a very attractive place
to live, making key members of management and staff essential to a company's
success and continuity much less reluctant to move.
John Webster, a partner in Cluttons, a firm of Leeds-based chartered
surveyors which introduced NatWest to the National Power offices which
Switch will occupy, is cautiously optimistic. He reckons more than 100,000
sq ft of commercial property has been let or sold in the last 12 months -
despite depressed national markets - with plenty more in the pipeline.
Homeowners Friendly Society has started building a 35,000 sq ft headquarters
for completion next year so it can burst out of the 15,000 sq ft building it
built only in the 1980s. The old building will then be for sale or let.
At Ripon, part of Harrogate district, the Inland Revenue will move into
11,000 sq ft of new offices when they are completed next year. The National
Health Supplies division has also chosen Harrogate for its east Pennines
purchasing and supply unit.
British Fuels, Albion - a clothing company - and Bradford &amp; Bingley Society
have this year all taken space at Gregory Properties' office development in
Harrogate, leaving only two small units of about 2,500 sq ft each available.
A town centre development by St Martins Property Corporation now houses
Lovell Homes, which moved from Middlesbrough, Crinc Wellman, a US waste
management company which has picked it as its UK base, and Saffery
Champness, the chartered accountants. Only two small units remain.
Other relocations include the Westcourt Group, a property company relocated
from Darlington. An unnamed government department also has 6,000 sq ft of
town centre space in legal process at present.
Harrogate will still face a shortfall of about 5,000 jobs by the end of the
century if it cannot replace those it has lost since 1990, but a lot seems
to be happening in a place which has only been trying to market its wares to
inward investors for a couple of years.
The lesson it suggests for others is that while reputation, image and the
quality of life on offer are crucial elements in selling relocation, the
nature of the available labour force may matter more than anything else,
even if you have no incentives to offer.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Survey of Harrogate (7): Wealth surprises outsiders - The
Golden Triangle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A clue to northern England's Golden Triangle, the area bounded by Harrogate,
York and Wetherby, can be spotted in one of Harrogate's town centre car
parks. A cursory glance immediately reveals a Mercedes, a Jaguar, a Porsche,
various BMWs and a clutch of Range Rovers.
In the window display at Ogdens, the jewellers, a Pounds 12,600 ring
glitters alongside dozens of four-figure items, and further along James St,
a mannequin on the stairs of Hewlett's department store shows off the latest
Louis Feraud autumn look: Pounds 1,207 for the suit, coat and hat.
Yorkshire people may have the reputation of being hard to part from their
money. 'They do say a Yorkshireman is a Scotsman stripped of his
generosity,' chuckles stockbroker Stephen Jackson, but in Harrogate the
evidence points to a taste for the best that money can buy, and the money
with which it buy it.
'Until you come here you don't realise how much wealth there is. It's
extraordinarily wealthy,' says Mr Keith Weston, one of two founding partners
of the Harrogate office of accountants Saffery Champness. 'North Yorkshire
is wall-to- wall full of money,' says Mr Jackson, senior partner at Cawood,
Smithie &amp; Co, Harrogate's biggest stockbrokers.
This may surprise outsiders but, say Mr Weston and Mr Jackson, Yorkshire
people tend not to talk about their wealth and they are careful about how
they spend it - even if some mothers taking their children to school do look
as if they had just stepped off a catwalk.
'Sometimes the trouble is trying to get them to spend. You'll get the lady
with a Pounds 500,000 portfolio saying 'I'm going to cancel a particular
subscription, it's gone up,'' says Mr Jackson.
The growth of business for Saffery Champness and Cawood, Smithie's offices
in the town is evidence of the private wealth which underpins the Harrogate
area.
Cawood, Smithie &amp; Co, founded in Harrogate in 1975, now employs 40 people.
Two years ago, six new partners were appointed, bringing the total to 10.
Saffery Champness's office, opened in January 1992, had by April this year
already achieved the highest billings of all the firm's eight regional
offices. In its second year of operation, the office expects to record a 15
per cent to 20 per cent increase in billings over year one. That both firms
have prospered in Harrogate is all the more significant given the town's
proximity to the very large financial sector of Leeds.
Saffery Champness in Harrogate has pitched its activities at private
clients, especially high net worth individuals. Its ideal client would be
worth well in excess of Pounds 1m, and possibly much more.
Several clients are self-made business people. Although Harrogate has the
reputation as a residence for wealthy old ladies, the town and the
surrounding area are also home for well-off people who commute to work in
Leeds, Bradford and even Teesside.
A number of Saffery Champness clients own country estates, sometimes passed
down through their family for centuries. Two of the seminars the firm has
co-hosted in the past two years on the theme of protection of landed wealth
were held at Bramham Park, home of George Lane Fox, whose family's presence
in the West Riding dates back to Stuart times.
The key objective for such clients is wealth protection for the family.
'We're looking at the next generation, and the generation beyond that,' says
Mr Weston.
A similar philosophy underpins the work of Cawood, Smithie &amp; Co. 'We aren't
in the business of taking risks for our clients; our purpose is risk
minimisation rather than profit maximisation', says Mr Jackson.
Both men note their client base's attachment to Yorkshire, and Yorkshire
companies. 'They're very proud of being Yorkshire,' says Mr Weston. This
allegiance, he acknowledges, helps sell the message that it is not necessary
to look to London to find good financial advice.
Down at Harrogate council's offices, where the ornate municipal silverware
is displayed in cases in the main entrance hall, Mr Stuart Quin, economic
development officer, acknowledges that the town and the surrounding
agricultural area have traditionally been very prosperous.
For some, this still holds true, he says. Some businesspeople living in
Nidderdale have applied successfully for planning permission for helicopter
pads. But, says Mr Quin, Harrogate is suffering a slow erosion of jobs,
including many white-collar posts, and this leaves no room for complacency.
Appropriately for a town with so many opportunities to spend money on
high-class goods, some of the companies Harrogate has attracted in the past
few years are finance-related. They include Coda Group, a financial
accounting software company with 20 offices worldwide, a NatWest switchcard
operations base and Link Interchange Network, which provides electronic
switching services to its members, mainly banks and building societies.
'Harrogate has the sort of quality feel we wanted,' says a spokesman for
Coda, which moved its headquarters from Leeds to Harrogate two years ago.
The Golden Triangle, according to estate agents Cluttons, lies between
Skipton, York and Leeds. The Triangle's diamond centre is bounded by
Harrogate, Ilkley, Wetherby and Leeds. The firm is unashamedly upmarket. It
does not generally deal in domestic property worth less than Pounds 250,000.
Cluttons has a clientele of potential buyers looking for classic country
houses in the Golden Triangle, at between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 750,000.
Some property values in the area are higher than in parts of the home
counties, says residential partner Mr Tim Waring. 'If you took a Queen Anne
house in Oxfordshire and put it in the triangle it would sell for more.'
The Triangle concept, first mooted a couple of years ago, has even received
official recognition of a sort. It was mentioned recently in court during a
property-related case.
It would be foolish, says Cluttons partner Mr Tony Pardoe, to say Yorkshire
has been unaffected by the recession. He believes, however, it has proved in
better shape to withstand it than southern areas, because of the testing
time its industries had already gone through in the 1970s and 1980s.
The problems at Lloyds' of London, the insurance market have also meant some
properties coming on to the market, he says. 'But the wily old Yorkshireman
has not been as heavily involved with Lloyds as his counterpart in the
south.'
In 1992, the average price per residential transaction at Cluttons'
Harrogate office was Pounds 288,000, compared with Pounds 335,000 in 1991,
although the transaction level dropped by less than 4 per cent. By the end
of October this year, the 1992 sales total had already been surpassed.
In the last five years, says Mr Pardoe, the proportion of Golden Triangle
buyers has switched from being two-to-one outsiders to insiders, to a
two-to-one majority of Yorkshire people, looking to switch homes but stay in
the area.
In such a close community, personal recommendation is very important for
professional firms. 'Credibility has to be maintained. The only way to
maintain it is by providing a very good professional service,' says Mr
Jackson. He lives in Harrogate and sometimes walks to work. 'One morning
this summer I met three clients and picked up some business on the way.'
Mr Weston, who moved from Fulham to a barn conversion in Nidderdale when he
moved north for the opening of Saffery Champness's Harrogate office, says
the beauty of the town and its surrounding area comes as a shock to
first-time visitors.
This, he says, is England's best-kept secret. 'You find me a southerner who
has ever gone home.'

FT  15 NOV 93 / Survey of Harrogate (3): The spa resort with a sparkle -
Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HARRIET ARNOLD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE centre of Harrogate is exceptionally easy on both the eye and the shoe
leather thanks to its spa resort elegance and the rare proximity of its many
tourist attractions.
The town boasts probably the most sulphurous springs in the country,
bringing the sweet stink of success in the late Victorian and Edwardian eras
when the town enjoyed its heyday as the hydropathic (water treatment)
industry took off. The Harrogate curative concoction was described by Bertie
Wooster, in Carry on, Jeeves, as 'practically equivalent to getting outside
a couple of little old last year's eggs beaten up in sea water.' He was
possibly understating the case.
The Harrogate water can still be sampled at the Royal Pump Room Museum, on
the site where a famous early nineteenth century Harrogate figure, Betty,
dispensed a sulphurous brew. Today's luckier visitor can follow up the
experience with a visit to a completely different Betty's establishment, the
town's most celebrated cafe tea-rooms.
The spa may have gone but the town has continued to develop its status as a
tourist spot and a base from which to make forays into the rest of
Yorkshire. The result is that the tourist information centre now handles
275,000 inquiries a year, says Mr Stuart Mackay, head of marketing and sales
at the Harrogate International Centre (HIC).
Visitors are drawn by the graceful architecture, the antiques and other
shops - the number of fashionably hatted ladies testifies to the well-heeled
atmosphere - the floral displays and the restaurants. That's just the town.
The surrounding area is bristling with stately homes and historical sites as
well as being close to the natural wonders of the Yorkshire Dales.
Tourism contributes about Pounds 80m-Pounds 90m to the local economy
according to Mr Stuart Quin, economic development officer for Harrogate
borough council. In 1987, Peat Marwick McLintock estimated that 3,500 jobs
in the area were directly attributable to the centre's activities. Another
2,500 are estimated to depend on holiday tourism.
'The centre's economic impact has been greater than expected,' says Mr Quin,
whose own figures indicate that employment in the Harrogate travel-to-work
area rose from an index of 100 in 1981 to 178 in 1989.
The centre promotes tourism opportunities as part of the mix which it can
offer its customers and is also responsible for maximising the number of
accompanying visitors and holiday tourists.
Local businesses have also become involved in shaping the area's strategy.
The A Group has started to contribute funds to developments at the centre on
a results basis. Its chairman Mr Frank Flaherty, general manager of the
Majestic hotel, says this 'indicates to the town that we are prepared to
work closely with the centre'.
In return, Mr Flaherty and his colleagues expect a say on what is planned.
For instance, he observes, 'a residential-based policy was critical.' A
Group also participates in the centre's marketing exercises to potential
customers.
The UK and international recession has affected Harrogate and it has come as
something of a shock to the town that even some of its more significant
hotels have been unable to avoid financial problems and in some cases have
gone into receivership.
There is concern that more could be done to target the holiday visitor. 'The
holiday tourist has been somewhat neglected,' says Joy Allan, president of
the Harrogate Chamber of Trade and Commerce, and part owner of the
privately-owned Green Park Hotel near the town centre, 'as the marketing
emphasis has been towards the business tourist.'
The marketing mix could change soon, as the council is currently debating
proposals on the direction holiday tourism should take. Mr Quin says that
two main points have emerged from a consultation process undertaken for the
council: 'There is overwhelming agreement that the district should be
marketed as an integrated product, and there is a great deal of goodwill on
the part of those operating private facilities towards the idea of
co-operating more fully with HIC.' Suggestions have been made for
enhancement of all-weather facilities, and a visitor management strategy has
been mooted, with greater co-ordination of tourism information.
Harrogate's spa industry may also live again, this time as a leisure
attraction. The council is examining the prospective rewards, based on
growing interest across Europe in spas. Much of Harrogate's spa
infrastructure, such as the wells and the Royal Baths Assembly Rooms
building (where a municipal Turkish Bath still operates), is still in place.
Other developments being closely watched by the council include the
recommendation by the Countryside Commission that the Nidderdale area should
officially become an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and North
Yorkshire's bid for European Community Objective 5B status, which allocates
cash to poor rural areas. If the area is designated eligible on January 1
1994, the council plans to use some of the funds to enhance local rural
tourism.
Transport to and around the town is a weakness, and the council is keen to
see a bus station restored to the town, having already campaigned
successfully for improvements to the railway station. It is also supporting
Leeds/Bradford Airport's application for authorisation for round-the-clock
flights.
Plans for marketing the area's attractions are many but, as Mr Quin points
out, the rich heritage alone will not keep Harrogate's well-heeled ladies in
hats or their menfolk in the latest cars.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Survey of Harrogate (4): A symbol of determination -
Conference Trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HARRIET ARNOLD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MODERN conference and exhibition centre set amid the elegance of
Harrogate's spa resort architecture is a symbol of the town's continuing
determination and willingness to change.
Growth and prosperity had come in the nineteenth century from catering to
the Victorian interest and enthusiasm in hydropathy, or water cures. In more
recent years the availability of more scientific treatment and a withdrawal
of National Health Service support for spa cures heralded a period of
decline for the resort's water facilities.
Harrogate turned instead to the conference and exhibitions industry. But a
report prepared for the borough council in the late 1970s delivered an
ultimatum: a substantial investment in new facilities was necessary or it
would lose its share of the UK and international market. This would be bad
news for a town bursting with hotels - 80 per cent of the area's tourist
accommodation is in Harrogate.
In 1982 the Harrogate International Centre opened, ranking in the top five
in the UK, with a 2,000-seat auditorium, six exhibition halls (about to
become seven) and the 1,300-seat Royal Hall, formerly the Kursaal in
Victorian spa days. The adjoining Moat House International Hotel is the
first hotel to be built this century in the town centre.
Since then employment in the area has been buoyed by the centre, which hosts
national and international events. That did not stopped detractors labelling
it a great white elephant, as the original estimated costs of nearly Pounds
8m grew like Topsy to nearly Pounds 34m, and the Centre - built without
support from central government - failed for years to operate at a profit.
In a buyers' market and suffering the effects of recession, the Centre has
fought hard to maintain market share. 'In a difficult three years, we have
done well,' says Mr Paul Lewis, director of the Harrogate International
Centre, whose strategy has been to market the centre while undertaking
substantial improvements.
Harrogate has seen the number of conferences grow from about 1,100 in 1991
to about 1,300 in 1992-93 with the number of conferences linked to
exhibitions increasing from 14 to 18 in the same period. The number of trade
fairs has dropped by three to 25, but the centre is confident that old or
new clients can be brought back into the fold soon. Despite the dip in trade
fairs, the total number of delegates has risen to 275,000 in 1992-3 from
272,000 in 1991.
The centre's corporate sector business has been worst affected by recession,
but its core growth business has been the expanding market of conferences
linked to exhibitions. In addition, a number of clients have committed
themselves to the centre for at least three consecutive years. 'Associations
have to meet,' observes Mr Lewis, who also notes that the recession has
meant that clients are looking for value for money.
Mr Lewis is particularly targeting the growing medical sector. Recent
conferences linked with exhibitions included the European Wound Management
conference, while forthcoming examples include the Royal College of Nursing
and Healthcare Computing, both on long-term contracts. Mr Lewis estimates
that about 10 per cent of the centre's business is from overseas.
The marketing programme includes taking a stand at International Confex, the
exhibition industry's annual show.
The visitor attractions, such as the central large, high-class hotels and
the town atmosphere, are part of the package to customers. 'I sell the
destination as well as the centre itself,' says Mr Stuart Mackay head of
marketing and sales at the Centre. 'Visitors to Harrogate can easily walk to
their conference, exhibitions, shops, restaurants, and other tourist
attractions.' As Mr Lewis says: 'If we can't rival Birmingham for space, we
can offer the quality of facilities, service, and the ambience of the town
and district.'
When delegates to the conference of the Institute of Personnel
Management,which has been held in Harrogate for 47 years, were asked if it
was time for a change of venue, 'respondents said overwhelmingly 'Please do
not move',' says Ms Marie Ricot, organiser of the conference. She, too,
cites the proximity of all the locations that delegates need or want to
visit, and the ambience of the town.
The centre's quality facilities and the village atmosphere attract national
and international rather regional customers. Many are prestige events, such
as the Confederation of British Industry conference this week, which marks
the first time the CBI has returned to the same venue for two consecutive
years.
The latest developments at the Centre again grew out of the findings of
another report, by Peat Marwick McLintock in 1987, which examined its future
role, funding options and management. It found that although many customers
were very loyal to Harrogate, the exhibition facilities were becoming
dilapidated and demand for extra space could not easily be satisfied.
Since then, a development programme in three phases has been initiated.
Phase 1 was a refurbishment programme of the exhibition space to upgrade the
roofs, air conditioning, toilets, floors, lighting and organisers'
accommodation, with the last work scheduled to end by January 1994.
Phase 2 will implement a new catering facility, with bars, restaurants and
entertainment areas, to be completed over three to four years.
Phase 3 aims to build a new exhibition hall on the Royal Hall carpark. It
will be funded by profits from the centre, which traded profitably for the
first time last year, and is scheduled to be in place by the end of the
decade.
But the greatest current project for the Centre is the opening in April 1994
of a new exhibition space, Hall Q, in place of a superstore which has moved
to a new site. 'It will give us a new dimension in marketing for new
business,' says Mr Lewis. 'Now we can accommodate larger events, with 1,740
sq m in net saleable exhibition space in the new hall'.
Not only will Mr Lewis be able to target bigger event holders, but in a
development that he calls pioneering, the Centre will 'sell the whole
product - hall hire, stands, electricity, even carpets, will all be laid on.
The user can just walk in and set up.'

FT  15 NOV 93 / Survey of Harrogate (5): Uncertainty clouds outlook -
Agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN addition to its many conferences, Harrogate is host each year to one of
agriculture's most popular events - the annual Great Yorkshire Show.
During the second week of July around 90,000 people attend the three-day
show, the biggest agricultural event in the North of England.
First held in 1838 in York, the show moved to Harrogate in 1951 to a site on
the edge of the town. Over the last few years, however, its organisers,
faced with the need to upgrade the site's facilities, have been debating
with their 8,000 members and the general public whether the event should
continue on this land.
They have now decided that it will do so; the proceeds of an Pounds 11.5m
deal in which four acres of the site have been sold to Sainsbury will be
used to develop new, modern facilities which, between shows, can be let out
to other organisations to generate more revenue. Significantly at a time
when farmers are increasingly having to think of adding value to their basic
products, the new site will also include a purpose-built food show hall,
promoting the best of Yorkshire food.
The presence of the Great Yorkshire Show in Harrogate is just one reminder
of the strong agricultural backbone of the surrounding area. A total of 4.2
per cent of the Harrogate district's employees in employment in 1989 worked
in agriculture, forestry and fishing, compared with a UK average of 1.4 per
cent.
A report to this month's meeting of Harrogate borough council's economic
development subcommittee reports a decline in agricultural employment in the
Harrogate travel to work area, between 1981 and 1991, of 8.4 per cent, and
in the Ripon TTWA 17.2 per cent. These figures however must be set in the
context of an overall British drop of 21.8 per cent.
But, even though the decline in the Harrogate area is proving less sharp
than nationally, research carried out for the borough council on the
Harrogate economy in the year 2000 has suggested between 300 and 500
agricultural jobs will be lost in the 1990s, highlighting the need for new
activity in the countryside around the town.
The western part of the Harrogate district is included in North Yorkshire
county council's submission for European Community Objective 5b structural
funds. Objective 5b status gives rural areas eligibility to EC grants for
economic development.
North Yorkshire's bid has been passed by the UK government to the EC but it
is competing against many other parts of Britain and Continental rural
areas. A decision will be announced shortly.
The varied geography of the area around Harrogate makes for diversity in
agriculture, from the upland hill farmers of the dales and the dairy farmers
of the West Riding to the arable expanses east and south of the town.
In general, though, the current outlook for the area's farmers and
landowners can be summarised by one word; uncertainty.
At present, Britain's departure from the Exchange Rate Mechanism has brought
farmers a windfall since previously agreed European subsidy levels have been
made more valuable. 'They're doing reasonably well at the moment because of
the devaluation of the pound,' says Mr Gerry Passman, northern counties
spokesman for the Country Landowners Association.
There are some signs of farmers putting the benefits of this back into their
businesses by investing in new machinery. But most see the enhanced value of
subsidies as a temporary phenomenon. 'It's not going to last,' says Robert
Sturdy, a potato and cereals farmer near Wetherby.
In the longer term, says regional National Farmers Union spokesman Robin
Cradock, the prospect is of decline in Common Agricultural Policy
intervention prices as they are brought into line with world prices. There
is also uncertainty at present over the eventual terms of the GATT round and
its impact on agriculture.
In the immediate future, hill farmers are concerned over the likely level of
next year's Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances, due to be announced on
November 30. Britain's departure from the ERM has helped sheep farmers
export much more of their production recently but, they argue, HLCA should
be a compensation for the difficulty of farming in the hills, not a payment
vulnerable to being pruned back. The shortfall of sheep quotas, which
hampers new entrants to the sector, continues to be a bone of contention.
The dairy industry faces its biggest upheaval for 60 years with the
abolition in April of the Milk Marketing Board and its replacement by a
voluntary co-operative, Milk Marque.
Unusually, some West Riding farmers had not been locked into the MMB but
instead have continued to sell their own milk directly to consumers.
However, the entire dairy industry faces an upheaval when the MMB vanishes
and constraints on milk sales are removed. Among the new groups emerging is
Northern Milk Partnership, a Yorkshire-based initiative to supply milk to
Northern Foods. The break-up of the MMB also affects Harrogate itself, as
the town houses the Board's regional headquarters.
Unlike the MMB, the Potato Marketing Board looks set to survive; discussions
on its future are being keenly watched by Yorkshire's potato growers. For a
number of them, incidentally, October was not a good month since it brought
frost which spoils frying quality. Further uncertainty hovers over sugar
beet, an important crop for many local farmers who supply the British Sugar
plant in York. They are anxious to see Britain's sugar beet quota at least
maintained in next year's EC review.
For rural Yorkshire, the British government's controversial new proposals on
farm tenancies, whereby landlord and tenant would negotiate tenancy length
and conditions individually, are also of great importance. The NFU is
strongly opposing the government's present plans for major deregulation of
the agricultural holdings legislation; the union believes the tenancy system
must be backed up by a legal framework and safeguards. The CLA however
supports a freeing up of the tenancy regulations.
Setaside policy is another source of uncertainty; why, ask many farmers and
landowners, can setaside land not be designated for a minimum of 20 years so
it can be put to better use. 'If the land isn't required to produce food,
why isn't it used to grow trees?' asks Mr Passman.
The whole question of just what - and who - the countryside is for is an
underlying concern in North and West Yorkshire, where the beauty of the
rural areas, and their relative proximity to urban settlements, have
attracted many well-heeled commuters and owners of second homes.
The CLA remains convinced that local authorities, despite their involvement
in workspace provision and other rural economic development measures, are
still insufficiently willing to give planning permission for some of the
diversifications necessary to maintain employment and life in the villages.
Yorkshire provides award winning examples of rural business enterprise such
as the high-tec office complex created by Roger Tempest from the Home Farm
at Broughton Hall, near Skipton, owned by his family for almost 400 years.
It also provides a diversification warning story, in the form of dairy
farmer Brian Moore, whose booming ice cream business at his farm at Weeton,
in Harrogate district, fell foul of the planners.
Mr Moore has since moved to Jervaulx, in Richmondshire, where he is again
dairy farming and running a successful ice cream enterprise, employing 14
full and part time staff, as well as his family. His ice cream is sold from
Northumberland to Wales and he had even opened an ice cream parlour at the
farm.
But this is not - yet - a happy ending: he is still paying off the Pounds
150,000 legal bill from his unsuccessful planning battle.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Survey of Harrogate (1): Bright spot's bubble burst - As
Britain recovers from recession, Harrogate's vital indicators are still
going the wrong way. Job losses from electricity privatisation,
rationalisation and defence cuts have shaken an area where there was full
employment only three years ago. Can Harrogate catch up?

<TEXT>
as the leaders of the Confederation of British Industry are doing for their
annual conference this week - and mistakenly believe there is not much wrong
there.
An air of gentility pervades the town. The unemployment rate is only 7.2 per
cent. Fallen autumn leaves have laid a picturesque golden carpet on the many
acres of greensward that set off Harrogate's fine Victorian and Edwardian
buildings. Some of the best tourist sites in Britain are within an hour's
drive.
The town is in a sea of prime agricultural land. Local residents include
rich landowners with old wealth and many of the newly-rich progeny of the
Thatcher era. Shops and restaurants reflect people's almost emphatic ability
to pay top-notch prices for high quality goods and services.
Here is a bright spot of northern Britain. It is part of the county of North
Yorkshire, which - like Cheshire on the west side of the Pennines - is the
nearest thing the north has to the south in terms of look, feel, wealth and
culture.
'We have an upmarket appeal because Harrogate is an unashamedly upmarket
place,' says Mr Stuart Quin, economic development officer for the borough
council, guardedly: he is understandably concerned people might get the
wrong impression and not believe Harrogate is in trouble.
But it is.
In March 1990, Harrogate was a jewel in Thatcher's Britain. It was one of
the places above the north-south divide that had bubbled. Professor Mike
Campbell of Leeds Metropolitan University reckons about 8,000 new jobs were
created in the 1980s, with growth in banking, insurance and finance making
up for any decline in utilities and manufacturing.
'We were in full employment, with a jobless rate of around 2.5 per cent,' Mr
Quin says. 'There were labour shortages. We were one of the top performers
in the north of England and were cited as an example of what could be
achieved.'
The bubble burst. Harrogate's overall unemployment rate may well be only 7.2
per cent now, but the rate has trebled in three years, worsening more than
twice as rapidly as the UK average.
Moreover, the male rate in September was 11.1 per cent, indicating
substantial losses of most households' better-paid jobs.
To make matters worse, as the tide turns for the better elsewhere,
Harrogate's figures are still going the wrong way. Long-term unemployment -
previously hardly known - has risen 34 per cent since last year. A study by
Prof Campbell estimates an impending shortfall of 5,000 jobs as the
workforce grows in the 1990s.
The immediate cause of unemployment has been a series of shocks to the basic
economic structure. 'It's the rate of increase in unemployment that has hurt
us,' Mr Quin says.
'The most pessimistic outlook is that we shall soon be at 11 per cent
overall if we don't do something extensive. There is a sense of holding on
for grim life.'
Harrogate is surviving because a large part of its modern function is as a
middle-class professionals' commuter town, particularly for Leeds - 15 miles
away and in recent years Britain's fastest-growing regional centre for
financial and professional services; it is now the focal point for such
activities east of the Pennines.
'But we need to be able to survive in our own right,' Mr Quin insists.
Harrogate is not just a town, but a wide and diverse district covering 520
square miles from York in the east to the Dales national park in the west.
It has 150,000 people, including a growing workforce of more than 70,000.
Not all are highly qualified professionals able to work anywhere.
To maintain its dignity and avoid dependence on West Yorkshire to the south
or state hand-outs for many of its blue-collar workers, Harrogate has to be
able to generate more added value within its own borders.
The worry is over how much recent change can be reversed. For example, there
has been a run-down in agriculture, both in investment and jobs, which is
now affecting food processing, a staple local industry.
Ripon, part of the Harrogate district, last year lost its biggest employer,
Premier Poultry. The factory closed with the loss of 360 jobs after
Hillsdown, the parent group, bought Unilever's poultry plant at Scunthorpe
and moved production there. Ripon's female unemployment rate is now 6 per
cent and its overall rate 8.8 per cent.
Another blow has been the loss of several blue-chip corporate headquarters
through a combination of national recession, corporate restructuring, and
the end of the cold war.
ICI Fibres had its headquarters in Harrogate and once employed more than
2,000 in the town. Rationalisation meant the chemicals giant could not
sustain it. Mr Michael Walsh, Harrogate's chief executive, says an
unfortunate side-effect will arise because ICI was always first into
'partnership' activities with the public sector, particularly in seconding
staff to projects.
In Harrogate there were 1,000 employees of the Central Electricity
Generating Board who became part of National Power on privatisation. First,
about 750 jobs were lost. About 150 more will go soon, with what was once a
corporate headquarters now reduced to a small rump.
There is a similar story in defence industries. 'We were, in effect, where
the corporate headquarters of the RAF was located,' Mr Walsh says. Now 1,200
civilian jobs and 300 military ones are going to Huntingdon, in the prime
minister's constituency.
Recession also helped cause the loss of Octavius Atkinson, a fabricator of
structural steelwork and part of Taylor Woodrow. In 1990, it moved from the
town centre to a new site at the junction of the A59 and A1, but closed last
April. The 350 lost jobs were skilled manual ones which Harrogate's leaders
saw as part of the area's industrial stock-in-trade.
This is not the first time Harrogate has experienced sudden change. Forty
years ago the National Health Service decided to stop funding visits to
health spas. People 'taking the cure' were the mainstays of Harrogate's
hotel industry and the local economy faced a substantial loss of business.
The town successfully repositioned itself to stage conferences and
exhibitions, which is why the CBI is there this week. However, hotels,
catering, conferences and exhibitions comprise a mature sector offering only
marginal prospects of making up the latest lost ground.
And there will be little outside help. Although Harrogate is hoping for a
limited amount of EC funding - 'Konver' to compensate for defence industry
closures and 5b Status for some of its agricultural areas - there are
practically no incentives on offer.
Harrogate is not badly off enough to be helped, but is at least trying to
turn this into a virtue. Mr Quin says: 'What we have should be attractive to
businsses where skills are at a premium, and it is necessary to pay good
money for the right people. With no grants, companies come because of long
term business prospects.'
With large office users leaving, Harrogate can at least offer competitive
prices - Pounds 10 a sq ft rents for good space, compared with Pounds 12.50
and Pounds 18 in Bradford and Leeds. This appeals to back-office financial
operations, such as NatWest's Switch card, which moved in this year.
Modern manufacturing, finance and business services, the medical and health
care sector, and new small businesses are now the main targets. How
Harrogate fares could well be a lesson in incentiveless marketing for the
1990s. Economic development specialists everywhere will be watching closely.

FT  15 NOV 93 / One last chance to get it right: Philip Stephens on the
balancing act facing Clarke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FATE of Mr John Major's government hangs on whether the Conservative
party at Westminster regains the self-discipline and political will to
sustain it in office.
If the party has put behind it the reflex of rebellion ingrained by its
battles over the Maastricht treaty, there is a fair chance that the prime
minister can rebuild his shattered authority. If it has not, his government
is doomed.
Mr Kenneth Clarke's first Budget on November 30 will provide the test. No
one at Westminster is quite sure how bitter will be the medicine needed to
reduce the government's Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement.
But neither is anyone in doubt that the combination of further tax increases
and a squeeze on public spending, which has been tougher than most have
realised, has the potential to trigger another collective nervous breakdown.
Mr Clarke and Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, have
already framed a detailed programme to sell the package to their own back
benches.
The chancellor, the leader in the cabinet of One-nation Toryism, will
explain to the right of his party that he has been as tough as politically
possible on public spending.
In the same breath he will be reassuring the centre-left that less money for
schools, hospitals and social security benefits does not herald an all-out
assault on the welfare state.
Mr Portillo, the holder of the Thatcherite torch, will take the tougher task
of persuading the disgruntled and dispossessed on the Tory right that a
further round of tax increases is not a fundamental betrayal of the 1980s.
Neither will have an enviable task. The latest FT survey of pre-Budget
opinion on the Conservative back benches shows the party as divided as ever
as to how Mr Clarke should climb out of his Pounds 50bn-a-year public
borrowing hole.
The majority is resigned to a further round of tax increases even before
those announced by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, have started to
bite.
But a sizeable minority believes Mr Clarke should do nothing more to
undermine the Conservatives' already threadbare claim to be the party of tax
reduction.
By contrast, more than two-thirds think there is scope for a further
tightening of the public spending screw. They may not be quite so convinced
once the detailed impact of the cuts already imposed emerge. But, unfair or
otherwise, there is a widespread view on the Tory right that Mr Clarke sees
higher taxes as the easier option.
There are deep concerns too about the impact of the imposition of value
added tax on domestic fuel. The implicit warning to the Treasury is that it
must rethink its resistance to broadening the scope of the compensation
package to those above the income-support levels.
The serious concern that economic recovery has yet to become entrenched is
reflected also in the call by fully four-fifths for the chancellor to ease
the pain of a tighter fiscal policy with cuts in interest rates.
Only 7 per cent think he should regard control of inflation as the top
priority.
On one level the divisions over tax increases may simply reflect the
uncertainty even within the Treasury over how far taxes can be raised to
reduce borrowing without halting a patchy and still-hesitant economic
recovery.
Senior ministers admit there is no unanimity in the cabinet either on the
scope for tax increases in addition to the Pounds 10bn-a-year package put in
place by Mr Lamont. Most ministers believe Mr Clarke must do something more.
But whether that should be a 'symbolic' Pounds 1bn or so or a 'real' Pounds
5bn or so is potentially as divisive an issue in the cabinet as it is on the
backbenches.
There are glimmers of re-assurance for Mr Clarke in the results of the
survey. Although he has not been tested in his five short months at the
Treasury, more than two-thirds are prepared to say he has done a good or
excellent job.
More significantly there are signs that carefully targeted and less readily
understood tax increases - through freezing or reducing income tax
allowances and through further reform of mortgage interest relief - could
win support.
Mr Clarke, we must assume, will produce a clever package with higher taxes
for all cloaked in the guise of the tax reform to which every new chancellor
aspires.
The Conservative party will then have to decide whether it wants to continue
in government.

Results shown in rounded percentages. Totals do not necessarily add up
to 100 because respondents have in some cases chosen more than one
option or have not answered every question. Written questionnaires were
returned by 75 Conservative MPs between October 24 and November 12.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Whitehall reform 'obstructed' by top civil servants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR Whitehall mandarins are obstructing civil service reforms, according
to Sir Peter Kemp, the former civil servant who managed the reforms until he
was sacked last year.
Sir Peter says policies such as market-testing, the Citizen's Charter and
the switch to executive agencies have been stalled by opposition from top
civil servants and the failure of ministers to press them forward.
To maintain the momentum of reform the number of Whitehall posts should be
cut by a quarter, senior positions advertised openly and production teams
established to turn policy into action, he says.
Sir Peter calls for the abolition of the fast-stream entry programme, under
which potential high-fliers are given special training and accelerated
promotion. Describing it as 'elitist', he says more efforts should be made
to identify and develop talent among existing staff.
In a pamphlet published today by the Social Market Foundation, the
independent think-tank, Sir Peter says that some of the opposition to reform
is motivated by the defence of self-interest.
'The levers of power are in the hands of those who broadly oppose reform,
including many senior civil servants and some ministers who are often civil
servants manques. The guards are in charge of the escape committee.'
He adds: 'At the centre, in Whitehall, old attitudes and the old guard
prevail. The only heads that have rolled have been among the revolutionaries
themselves.'
Sir Peter, who masterminded the creation of executive agencies to deliver
public services, was sacked 15 months ago after disagreements with Mr
William Waldegrave, the public service minister.
With civil service numbers increasing again a 'cull of posts' is essential,
Sir Peter says. Up to 25 per cent of Whitehall staff could be cut out
following the creation of agencies to bring numbers under control.
A non-politician reporting directly to the prime minister should be placed
in charge of forcing through change, Sir Peter says.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Axing of safety rules suggested
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REPEAL of many regulations governing safety in industry has been
recommended by a Department of Trade and Industry working party.
The DTI is considering ways of eliminating bureaucracy and red tape. The
measures will be contained in a deregulation bill, to be announced in the
Queen's Speech on Thursday.
The working party is recommending a number of changes to the health and
safety acts and a reassessment of European safety regulations only just
coming into force.
Its recommendations include restricting which business operations need to
abide by health and safety regulations. Temporary workers would also have to
buy their own hard hats and other protective clothing.
Mr Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs, is to hold a series of
meeting with his opposite numbers at the various departments affected by the
government's deregulation drive.
The final details of the deregulation bill are not expected to be thrashed
out until later next month.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Tax 'flaw' may trip chancellor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY may be being lulled into a false sense of complacency about the
impact of a Budget-day tax rise by a flaw in its computerised economic
model, a study being published this week says.
The study, from the Centre for Economics and Business Research, a
consultancy, says the model fails to take into account how a tax increase
would shock people into spending less. It consequently under-estimates the
impact on consumer spending by about half.
Professor Doug McWilliams, the centre's chief executive, has sent his study
to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, with a warning that he might need to
treat the views of his officials with caution because of the problems with
the model.
The Treasury's model is a set of equations contained in computer software
which simulates how the economy works.
Economists use models to supplement their own intuition when trying to
predict the impact of policy changes.
The study comes as Mr Clarke finalises his views about the degree that a
fiscal tightening - which may be needed to curb the Pounds 50bn gap between
public spending and revenues - might harm the fragile recovery. He will
announce his strategy in the Budget statement on November 30.
The study is being published as the Treasury is examining whether it should
contract out to the private sector the job of updating its model to ensure
it works properly.
KPMG Peat Marwick, a consultancy hired by the Treasury, has sent a draft
report to the department on the feasibility of such a move. A decision is
expected about the end of the year. Some economists believe that privatising
the model might improve the quality of Treasury analysis and make the
government's forecasting process more open.
The centre analysed how tax changes have affected the economy in the past 14
years, and the record of economic models such as the Treasury's in
predicting the impact of shifts in taxation.
Prof McWilliams said most economic models, including the Treasury model,
consider the impact of a tax rise or fall by treating it in the same way as
any other adjustment to income - such as a wage change.
Prof McWilliams said, however, that tax changes involved a 'shock' which
affected consumer behaviour more profoundly.
He said: 'While people view a change in income tax or indirect taxation as
permanent, they tend to think adjustments to their wages are temporary. This
means the effect on spending - either positive or negative - is greater for
a tax change than what the models predict.'
According to the centre's research a rise of 1 percentage point in taxation
will lead to a fall of at least 0.25 per cent in consumer spending, which
accounts for about two-thirds of gross domestic product. Conventional models
indicate the likely fall in spending is about half this.
The Treasury said it did not want to comment until it had examined the
study.
Prof Ken Wallis, an expert on computer modelling at Warwick University, said
the problem of deciding the impact of tax changes was one to which the
modelling community needed 'to pay attention'.
Because of such difficulties economists often had to override the output
from models to gain a more realistic view about the likely impact of policy
changes.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Tax increase will not jeopardise economic recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chancellor can rest assured that a significant tax increase in the
forthcoming Budget to close the fiscal deficit will not jeopardise economic
recovery, the latest projections from Oxford Economic Forecasting show.
The Oxford economists argue that Mr Kenneth Clarke can and should raise
taxes by Pounds 4bn to Pounds 5bn on November 30. They expect interest rates
to be cut by half a percentage point and forecast that, even with this
easier monetary policy, the annual rate of underlying inflation will remain
below the government's target ceiling of 4 per cent throughout next year.
The report forecasts that, even with a further fiscal tightening, the
economy will grow by 1.9 per cent this year, revised upwards from their
August forecasts, and by 2.7 per cent in 1994.
The public sector borrowing requirement is expected to reach Pounds 50bn
this financial year before falling to Pounds 37bn in 1994-95.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Slide in business starts dents confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERN THAT the recovery may be weakening has re-emerged as a result of a
slowing in the rate of growth of new companies.
Registrations of new companies last month were only just above the number in
October last year, after a sharp rise in the formation rate in the first
nine months of 1993.
Jordans, the Bristol-based business information company that compiled the
figures, said the slowdown was 'a cause for concern' on the basis that
company starts were normally a good indicator.
On the basis of data provided to Jordans by Companies House, 9,359 companies
were started last month. The figure - which applies to the UK excluding
Northern Ireland - was only fractionally above the 9,339 start-ups
registered in the corresponding month last year.
In both September and August new company formations were up by about 11 per
cent compared with 12 months previously. In the first three-quarters of the
year registrations were up 6.1 per cent on the same period last year.
One interpretation of the figures is that anxiety about possible tax rises
in the Budget, and concern that weak demand in continental Europe is holding
back the recovery, may be leading to a decline in entrepreneurial activity.
According to Jordans, London and the south account for more than half of
business starts, with inner London the registered office base of nearly 30
per cent of new companies.
Outside London and the south the only region to come anywhere close to a
double-figure percentage of all start-ups is the north-west, which accounts
for about 8 per cent of new registrations.
So far this year the south-west, eastern England, the West Midlands and
Scotland have each accounted for about 6 per cent of new starts.
Jordans said: 'New business starts-ups over the last 12 months have been
fairly consistently spread, perhaps suggesting that most regional time lags
and differences have been squeezed out after the prolonged period of
recession.'

FT  15 NOV 93 / Private ambition still open to public question: The case for
nuclear sell-off is still not proved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NUCLEAR Electric's desire to be privatised is one thing. Whether the
government can make it happen is quite another. Only four years ago, the
nuclear industry had to be dropped from the electricity privatisation
programme because the City thought it was too risky. How much has changed
since then?
On the purely commercial front, quite a lot. Under Mr John Collier, its
chairman, and Mr Robert Hawley, its new chief executive who came from
private industry, the company has slashed costs and sharply improved the
performance of its power stations. Nuclear Electric now generates nearly a
quarter of the electricity in England and Wales. Its aim to make a profit
excluding receipts from the annual Pounds 1.3bn 'nuclear levy' by 1995 is
said by analysts to be realistic. However it is not clear whether there have
been enough changes to revive the case for privatisation.
For instance, Nuclear Electric's liabilities for waste disposal and
decommissioning are put at about Pounds 10bn. Mr Collier says these have now
'all been capped and provided for' but merchant bankers and analysts say
that the government would still have to underwrite the risks to achieve a
successful sale.
The main reason for privatising Nuclear Electric would be to enable it to
raise private-sector finance for a new power station, which would be
Sizewell C, a 2,600MW giant costing Pounds 3.3bn.
Mr Hawley says that Britain will need new nuclear power stations early next
century as old ones close and dwindling oil and gas supplies drive up the
cost of other fuels. He also points to the environmental advantages at a
time when the government is trying to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and
other harmful gases from fossil fuels. But others doubt that Britain needs
new plants because of its huge surplus of generating capacity, and the
diversity of its existing fuel mix. Without a new station to build, Nuclear
Electric would become a wasting asset.
Although Nuclear Electric executives say it has good commercial prospects,
they concede that the government would have to play a strong supporting role
in guaranteeing nuclear power an adequate proportion of the market. Mr
Hawley says Britain would have to make a commitment to build several nuclear
power stations so that economies of scale could be achieved.
Mr John Reynolds, who covers the electricity industry for James Capel, the
stockbroker, said five conditions would have to be fulfilled before Nuclear
Electric could be sold. It would have to become fully cost-competitive, and
have total commercial freedom, including the right to enter new businesses.
The government would have to put a cap on decommissioning costs, and be
liable for the cost of any catastrophes. And Nuclear Electric would have to
build a commercial and safety track record with its stations.
A further point for ministers is whether public opinion would tolerate
further expansion of nuclear power. As the debate over the opening of the
Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant has shown, the environmental lobby has
little trouble whipping up opposition to nuclear projects. The industry
itself is also, to some extent, split on privatisation. Mr James Hann,
chairman of Scottish Nuclear which runs two nuclear stations in Scotland,
has now dropped his plan to privatise it - he now wants to make it more
commercial.

FT  15 NOV 93 / MI6 arms evidence to remain secret
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Justice Scott has decided not to publish evidence given by an
intelligence officer which contradicts statements made to the arms-for-Iraq
inquiry by a Foreign Office official.
The evidence given by an MI6 officer, identified only as Mr O, was heard at
a private hearing last week after Mr Simon Sherrington, the Foreign Office
official, had agreed to give his evidence in public.
Mr Sherrington said that in October 1989 he had advised Mr William
Waldegrave, then a Foreign Office minister, that lathes made by the Midlands
company Matrix Churchill were not necessarily defence-related and therefore
not in breach of government guidelines. Mr Sherrington said he had based his
advice on a briefing from his MI6 contact, Mr O.
The intelligence officer was questioned privately last week after it emerged
that Mr Sherrington's evidence contradicted Mr O's written submission. It is
understood that last week's private hearing has not resolved the
differences.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Japan details reprocessing commitment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN WILL receive about 85 tonnes of plutonium from reprocessed nuclear
fuel by the year 2010, the official responsible for the country's plutonium
recycling policy says.
Mr Yasutaka Moriguchi, the director of the nuclear fuel division of Japan's
atomic energy bureau, says, however, that plans have been made to consume
all this quantity, including shipments from Thorp, the UK reprocessing
facility which has long-term contracts to handle Japan's waste nuclear fuel.
In a letter to the FT Mr Moriguchi says today that 10-20 tonnes will be used
for research and development of fast-breeder reactors, and about 10 tonnes
for research and development for advanced thermal reactors. A further 50
tonnes will be used to make fuel for light-water reactors.
Mr Moriguchi says Japan's plans for plutonium have slipped because of delays
in the schedule to build its own reprocessing plant and develop fast-breeder
reactors. This has also reduced both the demand and supply of plutonium.
But, he says, 'the prospect that Japan will have no surplus of plutonium
including that from Thorp is strictly maintained'.
Japan has two options to deal with the plutonium that is produced as part of
the spent fuel from its existing reactors, Mr Moriguchi says. It can either
use it to make more fuel, or dispose of it. Japan believes that the
environmental impact of reprocessing it will be smaller, which is why it has
a policy of using plutonium as a fuel for nuclear reactors.
Mr Moriguchi is one of a number of senior Japanese officials who have
responded to a call by a group of Japanese MPs for a renegotiation of
Japan's reprocessing contracts with British Nuclear Fuels, the owner of
Thorp.
Their interventions come as the UK government is conducting a consultation
on whether to give the go-ahead for the start-up of Thorp, which cost Pounds
2.8bn to build and has a number of long-term contracts with foreign nuclear
utilities. Japan would be the largest foreign customer of Thorp if it came
into operation.
The two biggest domestic customers of Thorp had serious doubts about the
project in the 1980s and argued against reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel
in favour of storage, according to a report by BBC Television's Panorama to
be shown tonight.
The programme also reveals that British Nuclear Fuels has been dismantling
fuel since the late 1980s and suggests this might mean there is no
alternative but to make Thorp operational. BNF so far has dismantled 90 per
cent of the 1,800 tonnes of British spent fuel, removing its outer casing
and storing it in water, Panorama adds. It claims that the Central
Electricity Generating Board, Thorp's biggest customer, and Scottish
Nuclear, its second-biggest, both believed that storage was a better
solution than reprocessing spent fuel but could not withdraw support from
Thorp for 'political reasons'.

A NEW all-electric house generates about four times as much carbon dioxide
as one heated by gas, according to the Association for the Conservation of
Energy.
A study from the group, which acts as the trade association for the energy
efficiency industry, says: 'From the point of view of emissions, the
environmental case against all-electric houses is overwhelming.'
Even in the most efficient cases, burning gas in the home generates heat at
an efficiency of 70 per cent while gas burnt to generate electricity which
is then used to heat the home achieves an overall efficiency of only 40 per
cent.
It says most of the competitiveness of electricity is based on other
factors, such as subsidised connection charges, and the economics of
all-electric houses 'are dubious at best'.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Banks set to process cheques for each other
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH banks are preparing to process cheques for each other, or pay
companies to do so on their behalf, for the first time since the clearing
system was founded in the 1770s.
Fears about growing costs have led to an agreement to change the rules of
the Cheque and Credit Clearing Board (CCCB) - which regulates the processing
and clearing of cheques and credit vouchers - to allow joint ventures and
new entrants.
Several of the big clearing banks are thought to be in the early stages of
talks over joint ventures, or the sub-contracting of paper processing, after
an analysis showed that unit costs could rise by 20 per cent by the year
2000.
The banks now carry out all their own processing. This means each has to
transport large volumes of cheques and other paper around the country before
they are sorted, and payments registered.
The Association for Payment Clearing Services predicts a 25 per cent fall
over the decade from the 4.1bn cheques and credits processed last year. This
and the rise in unit costs would mean the Pounds 1.5bn annual cost being
spread over fewer transactions.
Mr Gordon Younger, chairman of the CCCB, said that banks had no plans yet to
amalgamate processing centres, but growing costs meant there were likely to
be efforts to increase volumes at each centre.
He said: 'As volumes dwindle, some people are going to suffer and they are
going to have to bite the bullet in some way.' He said that detailed rules
for which outside parties might be admitted were still to be drawn up.
The banks participating in the Access credit card company have
sub-contracted processing to First Data Resources, and some bankers have
called for a similar joint approach to the separate networks of automated
teller machines.
The change in CCCB rules coincides with an estimate by SG Warburg Securities
that banks are only recouping about Pounds 2.5bn in revenues from the
clearing system, compared with the total cost of Pounds 4.5bn estimated in
an Apacs study.
Warburg Securities predicted last week that the costs would force banks to
introduce charges on personal current accounts in credit by the end of 1994.
It said that by 2000, cheques would account for only 20 per cent of total
payments.
The only current example of joint processing - which was allowed because of
a loophole - is that Co-operative Bank processes cheques and vouchers on
behalf of Girobank.
Mr Younger said that if outside processing companies were allowed to join
the CCCB, there would have to be safeguards to ensure that the banks for
which they carried out processing maintained the responsibility for cash
settlement.
Pressure for consolidation is likely to be increased by the entry of foreign
banks to the UK clearing system. Both Credit Lyonnais and Deutsche Bank have
been admitted to the Chaps electronic transfer system.

FT  15 NOV 93 / The lights are out in Dudley: The plight of town-centre
shops has been highlighted by the government. Paul Cheeseright visits a
blackspot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO CHRISTMAS lights will twinkle in Dudley this year. The borough council
has run out of money to put them up and local traders seem unable to find
the Pounds 28,000 it would cost to colour the gloom of the Black Country
dusk.
If this signals a lack of festive cheer, it is because the town centre is in
straitened circumstances - although slightly more relaxed than in 1991 or
last year.
Of all the town centres in the West Midlands conurbation, Dudley has been
hardest hit by the growth a couple of miles away of the Merry Hill shopping
centre, a consumer behemoth of 1.39m sq ft, one of the largest retail
concentrations in Europe.
The town's plight is a factor behind the assertion last week by Mr Tony
Baldry, environment minister, that government policy is to encourage retail
investment in town centres, not in out-of-town areas such as Merry Hill.
A government report prepared by consultants Roger Tym &amp; Partners said that
Dudley has been particularly adversely affected and Stourbridge had also
suffered 'a very significant impact'.
Merry Hill inevitably posed a competitive threat to all the traditional
shopping areas of the conurbation once it had reached its present size. It
offered a multitude of new shops to an area where both population and
individual spending were declining. The threat to Dudley was acute because
it is the nearest shopping area of any size.
Shopkeepers are nostalgic for life before Merry Hill. Mrs Linda Nicholls,
who has been trading in Dudley for nine years under the banner Lin's
Perfumery, said: 'Four years ago the town was thriving. It's not true Dudley
was going down. It was a goldmine. I can remember coming to town on the bus
and there was an army of people in the High Street.'
Marks and Spencer did not see the town in quite such rosy light. Even before
it shut its town-centre store to move to Merry Hill it had closed 40 per
cent of its available space. Dudley was the target of government initiatives
to stimulate the local economy from the late 1970s.
By the late 1980s Dudley was losing its comparison shopping - items such as
footwear, which are not bulky. Of the department stores, Debenhams and the
Co-op had closed and Next moved downmarket to Next to Nothing. The quality
of the shops had started to fall.
After Merry Hill was complete Dudley's retail decline quickened. The Tym
report calculates that since 1989 Dudley has lost 70 per cent of its market
share - far higher than Stourbridge at 43 per cent, West Bromwich at 20 per
cent or Birmingham and Wolverhampton at more than 10 per cent. Borough
council figures show that more than 15 per cent of Dudley's shopping
floorspace is vacant.
There is little empty space around the central pedestrianised area with its
cluster of market stalls. But as the high street climbs up to the deserted
FW Cook department store there are six empty premises among 32 postal
addresses on one side of the road.
On the other side of the road downmarket clothing stores abound. 'Faze, the
New Look - stock clearance, every item under Pounds 10' is one, 'Changes,
for all seasons, now open, mid-season sale' is another.
Beatties, Boots and Woolworths remain in the town centre. But there has been
a mass exodus of other multiples. Littlewoods is now Poundworld, all items
less than Pounds 1. C&amp;A's property has been taken by Kwik Save, the
supermarket. There is one indoor market where once was BHS and a second
where J. Sainsbury traded.
The shuffling of shopkeepers led Tym to say that 'the retail composition of
the town centre has deteriorated in quality due to the proliferation of
discount/low-order retail operations. This is a stage in the cycle of
re-adjustment in response to the Merry Hill centre.'
Dudley's difficulty has been that the coming-of-age of Merry Hill coincided
with the start of the recession and it is not clear which has been the most
damaging to the town centre.
The catchment area for Dudley shopping has fallen, and, according to Mr John
Mainwaring, the council's assistant chief planner, is now largely made up of
people in the lower C and D income groups.
To take the town centre back upmarket is difficult. Theoretically more
expensive shops would attract richer shoppers. Mr Mainwaring said: 'The
Catch-22 is that you can't attract back quality because the customers are
not there to spend the money.'
But investment is drifting back, not least in the Pounds 10m purchase and
refurbishment by London &amp; Cambridge Properties of the windswept Churchill
shopping centre.
Mr Stephen Schwartz, the Trueform shoe shop manager and chairman of Dudley
Retail Business Watch, said the town had seen the worst effects of Merry
Hill two years ago. 'We can never compete at the end of the day, but as long
as we can keep filling up shells with better-class shops, that has to be a
plus,' he said.
In any event, trade may be improving. J. Hollins, the old-established
jeweller, reported a 15 per cent increase in turnover this year. Mr John
Griffiths, the manager, scoffed at Dudley shopkeepers wringing their hands
in despair. He said: 'A lot of them have got the death wish. Nothing
succeeds like a will to fail.'

FT  15 NOV 93 / Agents lose jobs ahead of EU laws
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY and STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY British companies are sacking their commercial agents to avoid being
caught by new regulations which will implement European laws in the UK on
January 1.
The regulations will make agents much more difficult to sack in some
countries and guarantee high levels of compensation if they are. The
regulations will also give agents the right to inspect their principal's
books to check their commission and assess their future prospects.
Agents sell on commission for companies which appoint them to do so. They
are different from distributors, who take title to goods they sell and
assume responsibility for any ensuing bad debts.
The government estimates that the changes could cost companies between
Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 80,000 per agency agreement if they try to cancel
agreements after January 1.
Mr Ian Campbell, director-general of the Institute of Export, said:
'Companies are going to have to become urgently aware of the need for proper
agency agreements. They must become more professional in their dealings with
agents.'
The regulations will bring the UK into line with the rest of European Union,
where in most countries the law has been weighted in favour of agents over
the companies which employ them since 1986.
They will replace the informal common-law approach which governs agency
agreements in the UK and is based on cases and precedent.
The new regulations will apply equally to agents in any EU country. As this
includes Britain, many companies are urgently examining the implications for
agents they use in UK domestic markets and mainland Europe.
Mr Michael Thornton, a partner in Laytons, a law firm specialising in
foreign trade, said: 'Many agency agreements have been made by sales
managers with no knowledge of the legal implications. Many agreements have
been oral and concluded by handshake, or simply by exchanging letters.'
BICC, the cables company, has already terminated all its agency agreements
worldwide and drawn up new ones that take account of the changes.
Evidence that the implications of the new regulations have not sunk in for
many companies has come at a series of seven UK regional conferences on
exporting staged in the past few weeks by the Financial Times, NatWest Bank
and Institute of Export.
Several participants said afterwards they were going to sack their agents
immediately and start again.
Mr Andrew Mackintosh, managing director of Oxford Instruments, the
scientific instrument manufacturer which has a turnover of more than Pounds
5m and exports 90 per cent of this, said: 'I was vaguely aware that changes
were in the pipeline but I had not realised how sweeping they were.'
Mr Philip Dimmock, managing director of Sovereign International Freight,
said his company acted as both principal and agent in export and import
markets. He added: 'We will all have to be much more careful in our
contracts. This directive forces us into long-term relations with agents.
While, ideally, we would all like long-term relationships, if anything goes
wrong it could become expensive.'
Mr Neil Quinn, managing director of Apollo Fire Detectors, said: 'We
realised 18 months ago what this new directive could mean and started to
change our set-up. We have gone over to distributors in Europe. They are not
covered by the new rules.'

FT  15 NOV 93 / Graduate recruitment rise forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS PLAN to increase graduate recruitment next year following a
20-year high in graduate unemployment this year, a report published by
Indus-trial Relations Services says today.
The sharp increase in the number of graduates caused by the recent expansion
in the number of university places means, however, that the rate of graduate
unemployment could still increase.
There is also evidence that employers are raising their entry standards to
cope with the higher number of separate applications which each student is
making.
The 190 employers surveyed by the independent pay and conditions group are
planning to expand their intakes of new graduates by 6.5 per cent next year.
The number of graduates should increase by about 12 per cent.
High levels of demand are expected to peg the average starting salary to
Pounds 13,463, a rise of only 2.4 per cent since last year.
Changes in recruitment methods - either by raising entry standards or by
restricting advertisements for vacancies - are being implemented by 42.3 per
cent of employers to handle increased demand.
Employers are also alarmed by plans mooted by university vice-chancellors to
ask graduates to pay towards the costs of their tuition after their
graduation through a higher tax.
Employers have already noted that fewer students are taking time out before
looking for a job because levels of indebtedness are rising.
They feel that a form of graduate tax will have administrative consequences
for them - and also lead to pressure for higher starting salaries as
graduates would face a cut in their net pay. Eight in 10 oppose the idea.
'New' universities, which were polytechnics or colleges of higher education
until last year, appear already to have gained broad acceptance from
employers.
Almost two-thirds of recruiters believed they offered courses which were
more relevant to industry's needs than those of existing universities, while
only 23.7 per cent felt that they produced 'lower-calibre graduates'.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Watchdog widens disclosure talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECURITIES and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, will today
embark on a further stage of its consultation on making life insurance sales
agents tell consumers more about policies. It will set out ideas to those
involved in the consultation process about how to present the information
which sales agents will have to provide, such as the cash commissions they
receive.
SIB was told by the Treasury in July to produce draft rules on greater
disclosure by the end of the year. To meet that deadline proposals must be
put to the board meeting in the first half of next month.
The life industry has vigorously resisted the disclosure of commissions.
SIB's task was complicated by the Treasury's decision to require all sales
agents, not only independent financial advisers who sell the products of
many companies, to portray accurately their commission on each sale.
The method of calculating commissions must address the difference between an
independent financial adviser who relies solely on commission, and sales
staff in banks or building societies who receive salaries as well as sales
bonuses.
It must also take account of the costs of the overheads independent advisers
meet from their commissions.
Companies will have to tell consumers by how much their charges are likely
to reduce returns, and how early surrender would affect the value of a
policy. They must also allow low-cost sales outlets to charge less for the
same product than high-cost outlets.
The Treasury's decision followed its review of a report from the Office of
Fair Trading which concluded that proposals on disclosure from SIB,
supported by the life insurance industry, gave prospective customers too
little information to choose products wisely.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Labour warns on forest sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREST privatisation would be an act of folly that could cost thousands of
jobs, Labour said yesterday.
Mr Gavin Strang, shadow agriculture minister, served notice that the party
would step up its campaign over the next few months to convince the
government to abandon 'the dogma of privatisation and to retain our state
forests for the nation'.
He said in a statement that multi-national companies with paper and pulp
mills in the UK had warned the government that a sell-off would jeopardise
the security of their supplies.
'Timber-processsing companies plan to invest millions of pounds in this
country over the next few years. The industry has warned the government that
this investment will go overseas if the Forestry Commission is sold off.
Certainly, hundreds and probably thousands of jobs will be lost,' he said.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Manufacturers 'still cutting jobs'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURERS are still making people redundant and fewer than one in 10
have job vacancies, in spite of industry's fragile recovery from recession,
according to a survey by the AEEU engineering and electrical union.
A poll of 350 companies covering 175,000 workers showed that one in five
shed jobs in the three months to September. Order books showed no sign of
improvement, with more than half those questioned describing the position as
'average', 15 per cent believing things were 'poor' and just one in four
saying orders were 'good'.
The survey comes ahead of unemployment figures on Thursday. Recently the
jobless total has fallen and now stands at 2.9m.
Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary, disclosed that his union's engineering
section lost 13 per cent of its members last year.
The survey shows average pay rises in manufacturing in three months to
September were 2.47 per cent, a slight increase on the previous quarter's
2.33 per cent.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Clarke to meet TUC as hostility fades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE, the chancellor, has agreed to twice-yearly informal
meetings with the Trades Union Congress, marking a further shift away from
the outright hostility of recent years between the government and the TUC,
David Goodhart writes.
Mr John Monks has had several meetings with ministers since becoming TUC
general secretary in September and believes that more regular contact will
become routine.
'It is difficult to judge whether this dialogue has any significance,' said
Mr Monks. 'But there seems to be an intellectual interest in the link
between labour market changes and the perceived problems of society.'
He said that although there was still a very strong government interest in
labour market deregulation, 'I think there is a recognition that things are
going in a direction inimical to the traditional values that the prime
minister claims to espouse and that the world of work may be connected with
this development'.
Mr Monks also said that the campaign to retain the automatic check-off of
union members' dues had helped recruit more members.
Before next August all employers with a check-off system have to ask those
on the system whether they wish to continue. At British Rail the RMT
transport union says it is receiving regular payment of union dues from
about 80 per cent of its members after BR withdrew from check-off.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Nursery education for all children ruled out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday ruled out introducing universal nursery education
ahead of a call for its introduction today by the independent National
Commission on Education.
Universal education from the age of three, and a 'graduate tax' which would
make students pay for their university education via higher tax payments,
are both expected to be included in the propo-sals.
The education department stressed yesterday, however, that nursery
education, now provided for 53 per cent of children, had to be left to local
decision makers.
Ministers have also made clear that a graduate tax, mooted recently by
vice-chancellors, is not a government priority, partly because it would be
unpopular with Conservative voters. A decision by university heads not to
call for any specific form of graduate tax was described as 'a victory for
commonsense'.
The commission's plans appear to conflict with Mr Patten's re-stated
commitment last week to maintain A-level exams in their present form.
Other recommendations expected from the commission include greater funding
for primary schools; the abolition of GCSE exams, with A-levels converted
into a 'baccalaureate' system; and a new combined department for education
and training to avoid any overlap of responsibilities between education and
employment departments.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Accounts standards set to be tightened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ACCOUNTING Standards Board, the financial reporting standards-setting
body, is preparing to clamp down on provisions and pensions valuations in
draft statements to be issued next year.
Mr David Tweedie, chairman, said he planned to develop new standards on
general provisions, write-downs on assets and on pension-fund valuations.
The details emerged shortly before the board is to issue revised drafts of
standards on pre-acquisition provisions and the treatment of goodwill in
company accounts, which are likely to spark controversy.
They come after a meeting last week of accounting standards-setting bodies
around the world, at which officials resolved to co-operate more closely and
to develop standards in collaboration with each other.
A new standard on provisions would deal more widely with the circumstances
in which companies can take a charge through the profit-and-loss account in
expectation of future reorganisation and restructuring costs.
Traditionally companies have been able to manipulate profits by writing-back
provisions they have not used, which allows them to boost profits
artificially in future years.
They argue that making provisions complies with the fundamental accounting
concept of prudence. But Mr Tweedie said that, while provisions may be
prudent for the balance sheet, they 'whitewash' the profit-and-loss account.
Separately, the board plans to tackle pension-fund valuations, one of the
financial accounting areas open to most interpretation and manipulation.
SSAP 24, the existing standard on pensions, was only introduced in 1988.
The board will also consider the precise circumstances under which companies
will be able to write down assets in their balance sheets.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Threat of prison lock-out recedes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREATENED industrial action in English and Welsh prisons today over the
government's market testing programme appeared to be receding last night.
The Prison Officers Association had told its members to refuse to admit new
prisoners brought to prisons today by the police or Group 4, the private
court escort company. This would have led to between 500 and 1,000 prisoners
having to be accommodated in police cells.
But Prison Service officials said yesterday that prison governors had
received indications from local union representatives that prisoners would
be admitted as usual. If this proves to be the case there will be early
talks between Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the Prison Service, and
union representatives.
Mr Brian Caton, national vice-chairman of the association, said, however,
that the action would go ahead and be stepped up next week to three days.
A ballot of association members favoured limited industrial action over the
market-testing programme, which will extend the number of prisons managed by
the private sector. The union is also protesting about the transfer of
support tasks to civilian staff and prison violence.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Clarke to boost initiative on private finance: Call to
continue tax allowances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY will try to breathe new life today into its faltering private
finance initiative, launched a year ago by Mr Norman Lamont, then
chancellor.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the present chancellor, is expected to stress the
government's firm commitment to the initiative to involve private capital in
public projects in a speech to the CBI conference.
Mr Clarke will also publish guidelines for joint venture projects, and
announce the membership of a working group to investigate problems
identified by the private sector.
The working group, which will include ministers and representatives from
government departments, will be chaired by a senior businessman.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, will give
further details of the government's evolving approach to private finance in
a speech to an infrastructure conference in London.
Mr Dorrell is expected to say that the government increasingly views itself
as a facilitator of projects rather than a provider of services.
He will signal that the government wants to achieve a substantial expansion
of the private finance initiative by involving the private sector in
virtually all new infrastructure projects.
Only a handful of public-sector projects involving private finance have
started, prompting criticism from business leaders, including Mr Howard
Davies, CBI director-general. The lack of progress will be criticised in a
pamphlet to be published this week by the Tory Reform Group, which is on the
left of the party.
Mr Charles Williams, a financial consultant who wrote the pamphlet says:
'For the initiative to remain credible, early commitment to joint funding of
a high-profile project with a firm timetable is needed.'
Rail projects offer the most promising opportunities for mixed funding, Mr
Williams says, but investors are currently deterred by long-term revenue
risks and the costs of competitive bidding. The Treasury must be prepared to
bear some of the revenue risk where traffic declines.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Ministers step up attack on CBI over Europe: Business
leaders aim to defuse ERM row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS yesterday stepped up their criticism of the Confederation of
British Industry's pro-European policy as the row appeared to be causing
further unhappiness in government circles.
Senior ministers attacked Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, for
'dancing to his paymasters' tune' and making 'errors of judgment' in urging
the government not to close off the option of a single currency.
However, Mr Davies said in Harrogate, on the eve of the CBI's annual
conference, that he had been misrepresented in an interview in The Guardian
last week, when he was quoted as attacking the government's stance.
He said yesterday: 'Our position is certainly that of the Bank of England
and, I suspect, of the government, that we should aim at convergence between
the major currencies before we can talk sensibly about a single currency.'
He added: 'It would cause us no concern if the Maastricht timetable were
formally abandoned.'
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, will remind the CBI in a speech
tomorrow that European unity is not about institutions but about people.
He will tell the conference: 'It is people, not those in the community, or
Whitehall or even in boardrooms, that will decide the future in Europe. It
is the people who will set the pace.'
For that reason he believes Mr Davies's criticism of the government for
appearing anti-European was misguided as it failed to take public opinion
into account.
A government adviser said: 'There is no one more pro-European than Mr Hunt
but the CBI must remember that you have to take the people with you.'
Lord Parkinson, the former cabinet minister and chairman of Eurorail who
addresses the CBI today, was equally disparaging about Mr Davies's
'unthinking pro-European' stance.
He said: 'There is nothing less convincing than businessmen talking about
politics. Of course industrialists want exchange rate stability and
certainty. But at what price? The reality is that we are light years away
from a single currency.'
Sir Edward Heath, the former Conservative prime minister, backed the CBI's
call for a more pro-European approach. On BBC's Breakfast with Frost
programme he said: 'Thank God the CBI have spoken up at last. They are the
industrial basis of this country. They have to deal with finance. They are
the people who have to get our exports for us and put our economy right.
They ought to be listened to.'
He accused the government of trying to dominate Europe. 'That is not a
community. We are not out to dominate everybody else and the more we try the
more we are going to suffer.
'Who are we to set the agenda? The agenda is something to be set by all the
members that are credited. For us to brag that we are doing that - in other
words dominating the Community - is absolutely wrong and it is not a
community.'
The CBI moved to defuse the the row with the government. Sir Michael Angus,
CBI president, said: 'The ERM is fairly low down our members' list of
priorities. I think it is on the government's too.'
He pointed out that the results of a CBI survey of business leaders,
released yesterday, had been 'very much in line with the feelings of
government'.
The survey showed that just over half of business leaders regarded a single
currency as unnecessary, while believing it would help business in the long
term. Eight per cent thought a single currency would be damaging to European
prosperity. Only 7 per cent believed the UK would belong to a single
currency by the end of the decade.
There was also criticism of the European Commission, the president of which,
Mr Jacques Delors, addresses the CBI conference today. More than 60 per cent
of those surveyed thought the effect of the commission on wealth creation
was 'on balance negative'.
This view was borne out by two other surveys yesterday. A poll of MBA
graduates by the Warwick Business School showed 53 per cent thought the UK
should never re-enter the ERM.
The West Midlands Business Survey, conducted by the universities of Warwick
and Wolverhampton and by Price Waterhouse, showed that 60 per cent of
executives thought the government should not aim at full monetary union even
in the long term.
Only 10 per cent thought the ERM's virtual collapse this year would harm
their companies, with more than half saying it would make no difference and
the balance regarding it as helpful.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Accounts standards set to be tightened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ACCOUNTING Standards Board, the financial reporting standards-setting
body, is preparing to clamp down on provisions and pensions valuations in
draft statements to be issued next year.
Mr David Tweedie, chairman, said he planned to develop new standards on
general provisions, write-downs on assets and pension-fund valuations.
The details emerged shortly before the board is to issue revised drafts of
standards on pre-acquisition provisions and the treatment of goodwill in
company accounts. The drafts are likely to spark controversy.
They come after a meeting last week of accounting standards-setting bodies
around the world, at which officials resolved to co-operate more closely and
to develop standards in collaboration.
Traditionally companies have been able to manipulate profits by writing-back
provisions they have not used, which allows them to boost profits
artificially in future years.
They argue that making provisions complies with the fundamental accounting
concept of prudence. But Mr Tweedie said that, while provisions may be
prudent for the balance sheet, they 'whitewash' the profit-and-loss account.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Nursery education for all ruled out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday ruled out introducing universal nursery education
ahead of a call for its introduction today by the independent National
Commission on Education.
Universal education from the age of three, and a 'graduate tax' which would
make students pay for the cost of their university education via higher tax
payments, are both expected to be included in the proposals.
The education department stressed yesterday, however, that nursery
education, now provided for 53 per cent of children, must be left to local
decision makers.
Ministers have also made clear that a graduate tax, mooted recently by
vice-chancellors, is not a government priority, partly because it would be
unpopular with Conservative voters. A decision by university heads not to
call for any specific form of graduate tax was described as 'a victory for
commonsense'.
The commission's plans appear to conflict with Mr Patten's re-stated
commitment last week to maintain A-level exams in their present form.
However, Mr Patten could not comment in detail on the plans, drawn up by an
independent commission headed by Sir Claus Moser, the warden of Wadham
College, Oxford, as they are yet to be published.
Other recommendations expected from the commission include greater funding
for primary schools; the abolition of GCSE exams, with A-levels converted
into a 'baccalaureate' system; and a new combined department for education
and training to avoid any overlap of responsibilities between education and
employment departments.
The commission's members include representatives of industry and finance,
such as Dr David Giachardi, director of research for Courtaulds; Mr
Christopher Johnson, former economic adviser to Lloyds Bank; and Mr Peter
Wickens, director of personnel for Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK).
It has no statutory authority but its aims were broadly endorsed by the
government when it was founded, and its members were appointed by the
British Association for the Advancement of Science, an independent
educational body.

Health and education offer opportunities for bringing in private finance
which have yet to be explored. The government should copy the successful
model developed in housing, where housing associations raise about Pounds
1bn a year on the capital markets.
Although associations receive government grants for building new homes much
of their investment programme, they count as private sector organisations
and raise an increasing proportion of their capital on the markets.
This approach could be copied in health and education by turning
grant-maintained schools and NHS trusts into non-profitmaking organisations
outside the public sector, Mr Williams says.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Pressure for aid to capital projects: Lack of public/private

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE, the chancellor of the exchequer, will today come under
intense pressure from business leaders at the Confederation of British
Industry at least to continue the present system of tax allowances on
capital investment and preferably to extend it.
Sir Michael Angus, the president, said he was 'extremely worried' about the
low level of investment. In the second quarter of this year it was 2 per
cent lower than in the same period of last year.
The CBI is campaigning to bring British industry up to what it calls
'world-class standards' by the end of the decade.
It is encouraged by the steps taken by companies to reduce unit costs, raise
productivity and boost exports, but is dismayed at the failure of companies
to raise investment above the depressed levels of 1989-92.

FT  15 NOV 93 / China's trade deficit may reach Dollars 9bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA appears headed for a Dollars 9bn (Pounds 6.1bn) trade deficit this
year, after imports exceeded exports by more than Dollars 7bn in the 10
months to October. This would be China's first trading account deficit since
1989.
Western economists are predicting that China will register a deficit on its
current account in 1993 of about Dollars 7.5bn. This would compare with a
surplus of Dollars 6.4bn last year.
Customs statistics for October showed imports surged 28.1 per cent to
Dollars 76.4bn and exports reached Dollars 69.3bn - a modest 6.4 per cent
increase over the same period last year.
Mr Fan Baoqing, a trade senior official, blamed the deterioration on
powerful domestic demands and bottlenecks in the transport system that had
hindered exports. Weak growth in leading export markets, and rising domestic
costs also restrained export growth.
The customs statistics showed there had been a slump in the exports of crude
oil, coal, steel, non-ferrous metals, cement and raw silk. China's booming
building sector had taken much of the country's steel and cement output.
A surge in imports of machinery, electronic goods, cars and aircraft had
also contributed to the trade deficit. In the 10 months to October, 227,000
cars were imported and 83 aircraft. This represented increases of nearly 90
and 60 per cent respectively.
Imports of steel and crude oil and derivatives had also risen sharply. Some
23.4m tonnes of rolled steel had been imported, a fourfold increase over the
same 1992 period. Oil imports had risen by 50 per cent.
Foreign exchange reserves at the end of the September quarter stood at
Dollars 18.8bn. foreign debt - most of it longer term - was Dollars 69.3bn
in 1992.
China's slide into the red on its trading and current accounts are not
expected to affect its ability to meet its international obligations.

A LOS ANGELES judge has cleared the way for big changes in the financing of
the US television industry by lifting a long-standing ban on the three large
TV networks - ABC, CBS and NBC - owning a financial interest in most of the
programmes they broadcast.
The ruling by Judge Manuel Real, awaited for over a year, was made known to
Hollywood film industry executives late on Friday.
It will mean tough new competition from the networks for the large Hollywood
film studios, which provide most of the prime-time television programming.
It could also encourage mergers between the TV networks and the film

The court ban, imposed on anti-trust grounds, was one of two obstacles
preventing the networks having a financial involvement in prime time

rule, imposed more than 20 years ago by the Federal Communications
Commission, when the three networks controlled more than 90 per cent of the

With the three networks now accounting for only 60 per cent of the market,
the FCC lifted its ban in April.

FT  15 NOV 93 / De Klerk settles below bottom line on safeguards: S Africa's
constitution has no built-in bulwark against majority domination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM THE day President F W de Klerk set out to transform South Africa, he
promised one thing: to prevent the abuse of state power, at the root of
Africa's decline, by refusing to let majority domination replace minority
rule.
He may yet achieve this: but if he does, it will be the result of luck and
the goodwill of the African National Congress rather than the new
constitution, which was to have been the chief bulwark against domination.
That document, due to be finalised within days, falls well short of Mr de
Klerk's goals. Though some important matters remain to be agreed, the
outline is becoming clear: unless there is a wholesale revision at the last
moment, the ANC (which represents the black majority) will not be forced to
share real power with minority parties.
It may well choose to do so anyway, conscious of the power of the ruling
National party in the civil service and the security forces. But the bottom
line is that the National party, guarantor of minority interests, would find
it difficult to use the constitution to force the ANC to change course.
National party negotiators believe they will not need entrenched
constitutional provisions to play a powerful role in restraining the ANC:
they believe the ANC's assurances that it does not wish to govern alone (and
does not believe it could do so effectively); and they judge their electoral
strength will permit them at least some blocking power (though they may need
as much as 40 or 45 per cent to block decisions in cabinet, and latest polls
show NP support at 13 per cent).
But several government negotiators do not dispute that the National party
has settled below its bottom line on crucial issues; they insist it had
little choice. As a minority government whose power diminishes by the day,
negotiators clearly calculated that a deal done now would be preferable to
that available next month or next year. They recall that the National party
would have had significantly stronger blocking powers under the constitution
nearly agreed last year in the Convention for a Democratic South Africa
(Codesa). Some believe the government blundered by refusing a deal then,
only to accept a lesser package now.
That package fails to deliver several of the checks and balances which the
National party had insisted were essential. The party's 1991 constitutional
proposals called for political power to be divided between three tiers of
government - central, regional and local - with each tier to have 'original
and entrenched authority with which other tiers of government may not
interfere'.
In fact, central government retains wide powers to 'interfere' with regional
governments: though the regions (to be called 'provinces') are to be granted
primary responsibility for areas such as primary and secondary education,
housing, health, and policing, central government reserves the right to
intervene in these areas to impose uniform national norms and standards, to
ensure proper regulation, to protect the national economy or national
security, and where there are implications for national economic policy. In
short, the constitution authorises central government to intervene in terms
so vague as seriously to undermine regional autonomy.
Though government officials insist that provinces will have 'all' powers
over primary and secondary education, it is understood that a national
curriculum, probably including compulsory languages, will be imposed from
the centre and that the central education ministry in the new government
will retain almost all the powers of the current ministry - yet no one would
dispute that South Africa is now a highly centralised state.
In the crucial area of regional policing - perhaps a regional government's
most important power - the party has compromised its demand for regional
police forces. According to a deal yet to be finalised, there is to be only
one national police force; government sources say this is merely a symbolic
concession, because powers will be devolved from the centre to regional
commissioners of police responsible to reg-ional, and not central
government.
But according to joint ANC/NP proposals, the president will have veto powers
over appointment of regional commissioners; and central government will
retain control over public order and internal stability. One ANC negotiator
called this 'a national police force with federal trimmings'.
Much will depend on how the constitution will be interpreted by the
constitutional court, which will adjudicate disputes between the regions and
the centre and do much to shape the future state. But here too, the
constitution leaves room for abuse. According to joint ANC/NP proposals, the
new president (likely to be from the ANC) will, in effect, control the
appointments of all 11 Constitutional Court members. He must consult the
multi-party cabinet before deciding, but no other party is likely to be able
to muster sufficient support to overrule him.
Exactly what percentage vote would overrule the new president in cabinet
remains to be agreed; but the latest proposal calling for 55 per cent
support for most decisions, and 60 per cent for budget and security matters,
falls far short of Mr de Klerk's original demand for a 'collective
presidency' where leaders of the three major parties would take decisions by
consensus.
His promise of 'no domination' has always been based on ensuring real
power-sharing between parties in cabinet, and between the centre and the
regions; only time will tell whether such power-sharing develops
voluntarily. The constitution does not prevent it - but it does far less
than expected to ensure it.

Ms Barbara Brogliatti, a spokeswoman for the Warner Brothers film studio and
a group of producers, writers and directors, said: 'We're disappointed. We
fear for the survival of independent producers.'

MS Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's prime minister, strengthened her political
position yesterday with the victory of Mr Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari in the
weekend's presidential elections, Farhan Bohkari reports from Islamabad.
Mr Leghari, one of Ms Bhutto's most trusted lieutenants who became the
foreign minister after last month's national elections, won by a large
margin over his main contender, Mr Wasim Sajjad, the acting president.
Mr Leghari polled 274 votes against Mr Sajjad's 168 in Saturday's voting.
Legislators from Pakistan's four provinces, the national assembly in
Islamabad and senate, all took part in the vote.
Under Pakistan's constitution, the president has wide constitutional powers
including those of sacking prime ministers and dissolving elected
legislatures.
The results were welcomed by many business leaders. Stock prices on the
Karachi stock exchange, Pakistan's leading stock market, yesterday rose by
43 points - almost 2.5 per cent, as investors and brokers bought heavily,
hoping that Ms Bhutto's government was now in a stronger position with Mr
Leghari's election.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Virginian congressmen feel the Nafta heat: Nancy Dunne sees
protesters trying to influence the vote on Wednesday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN VIRGINIA the North American Free Trade Agreement evokes a passionate
opposition, but football, apparently, still is the reigning obsession.
A 'not this Nafta' rally on Saturday provided little competition for the
college 'game of the century' - Florida State University against Notre Dame.
Only 115 demonstrators turned out amid the autumn foliage in the grounds of
Virginia's capitol in Richmond.
They came promptly at two in the afternoon and by three most were gone. The
organisers said they were sending a message to Virginia's three wavering
congressmen that a 'yes' vote on Nafta in the House on Wednesday would be
'remembered in November'. That is, next November's mid-term elections, when
those assembled - mostly followers of Texas billionaires of Mr Ross Perot
and union members - would unite to throw the rascals out of office.
'We are absolutely for free trade,' says Mr Bill Diggitt, the state director
of Mr Perot's United We Stand. 'But Nafta undermines our constitution. It
puts decision-making in the hands of international panels, which undermines
our judicial system.' He says he is concerned about the loss of Virginia's
tax base as companies move production to Mexico and place continuous
downward pressure on wages.
'The administration is selling everything it can to every congressman it
can. That's wrong,' he says.
Mr Josh Greenwood, owner of a small hydroelectric company, says: 'I might
run against my congressman myself.'
Mexican workers are treated like slaves, he claims. 'In Virginia there was
slavery, but the slaves were expensive and the people who owned them valued
them. They had better housing and better sanitary conditions than the
workers in Mexico today. The babies of the slaves weren't born with brain
damage from concentrated pollution.'
Virginia has 11 congressmen. Three have joined the anti-Nafta forces; five
have declared themselves in favour of the pact. The three undecided have
found themselves in the eye of a lobbying whirlwind.
Mr Greenwood's congressman, Norman Sisisky, spent Friday meeting groups from
both sides. 'He is trying to sort through the misleading information,' says
his press secretary. As a member of the House armed services committee he
expects the foreign policy implications of the Nafta vote to weigh heavily
in his decision.
This argument carried little weight at Saturday's rally. Mr Ralph Dombrower,
a Perot devotee, brought the results of an interactive computer poll showing
a growing isolationism among American voters.
'The public is becoming less inclined to see the US as arbiter of worldwide
human behaviour and wishes to get out of our foreign policy involvements,'
he says.
The Virginia business community began a pro-Nafta lobbying effort last
March. 'The unions had gotten to everyone. We were going against a tide of
misinformation,' says Ms Kathy Otts, co-captain of Virginians For Nafta.
The coalition - 100 of the state's largest businesses and 500 small and
medium-sized companies - counter-attacked with an 'education' campaign.
Company employees were exhorted to write or call their congressman.
The anti-Nafta forces on Saturday published long lists of business
contributors to the pro-Nafta congressmen. 'Constituents only have votes to
give, and it seems these congressmen are having a hard time hearing their
message,' the cover page said.
On Friday, after the fifth pro-Nafta congressman announced his position, a
dispirited Lorrie Beckwith, an opposition organiser, said her campaign had
been hindered early on by a lack of unity. President Bill Clinton seemed to
be buying off the undecided congressmen. One was reported to have been
promised that a manufacturing research centre would be located in his
district. Another was said to have received assurances of funding for a new
aircraft carrier to be built in his district. A visit to Congressman Sisisky
had not been encouraging, says Mr Beckwith.
'He says he had a bad feeling about the agreement in his gut. He was
concerned it may hurt family farms. But if he is offered a decent project,
he says he might find it tough to say no.'
In Portsmouth, Virginia, one of the last undecided congressmen, Owen
Pickett, is in his district office, as he is every weekend. His door bears a
sign, 'This office belongs to the people of the second district of
Virginia'.
The unionised port workers are urging opposition. The military, which
comprises most of the district's voters, are worried about jobs in the face
of Pentagon cutbacks. 'He will listen to everyone's side,' a Pickett aide
says.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Structural maladjustment and the CFA franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kwesi Botchwey, Ghana's finance minister through what now amounts to 11
years of market-based economic reform, has a favoured response to those who
criticise his willingness to swallow the bitter medicine advocated by the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. 'Structural adjustment is
very painful,' he willingly acknowledges, 'but structural maladjustment is
much worse.'
World Bank officials, chastened after Africa's dismal economic performance
over the past 'structural adjustment' decade, are quick to echo Mr
Botchwey's words. Of course, structural adjustment is not the answer to
Africa's ills. The effects of short-sighted developed-country trade policies
and decades of under-investment in education, health and institutional
capacity will take many years to reverse. But structural adjustment, while
far from sufficient, remains necessary: without adjustment measures to free
prices, make real interest rates positive and deliver a competitive exchange
rate, the chances of investment- and export-led growth in sub-Saharan Africa
are negligible.
But there is one, compelling, piece of evidence in support of adjustment
that the World Bank and the IMF are, in public, cautious about highlighting:
the deepening economic crisis in francophone west Africa. Originally a
source of low inflation and economic stability, the combination of the
French government's franc fort policy and falling commodity prices has
delivered deepening deflation among the 14 members of the the Communaute
Financiere Africaine (CFA), who have kept their currencies pegged to the
French franc at the same official rate since 1948.
Structural maladjustment - in this case a 30 per cent appreciation in the
real exchange rate since 1985 - has rendered much of francophone Africa's
exports uncompetitive. Average government and manufacturing wages in
Senegal, relative to average incomes, are three to six times higher than in
Indonesia or Ghana. Not surprisingly, the majority of the budget goes to pay
the salaries of the urban elite which are then used to buy provide cheap
French imports. The losers are the rural masses, whose access to primary
education is low even by African standards.
The Bank and the Fund, under heavy French pressure not to rock the boat, are
wary of highlighting the CFA franc's overvaluation. But the truth slips out.
In a well-argued paper, published by a US-based pressure group, Mr Ishrait
Husain, chief economist in the World Bank's Africa department but writing in
a personal capacity, has compared the economic performance of the CFA member
countries with 14 countries which have pursued structural adjustment in the
1980s. The adjusters saw growth accelerate to an average 4.5 per cent a year
between 1986 and 1991. Over the same period, output in the CFA fell by an
average 0.2 per cent a year. The CFA countries have the potential to perform
much better, Mr Husain and his co-author argue, 'but their progress will
remain muted until the competitiveness issue is resolved.'*
The French government has publicly denied rumours in the French press that a
devaluation is planned for the new year. But there are signs that change may
be afoot. In August, the CFA member countries banned the repurchase of
CFA-franc notes outside the zone in an attempt to stem capital flight, but
the CFA franc is now trading at a 45 per cent discount on the black markets
of Lagos and Accra.
Meanwhile, the French government has told CFA zone finance ministers that,
in future, they must reach agreements with the IMF before French aid will
become available, suggesting that France may be moving towards endorsing the
private view of the international financial institutions that some form of
devaluation is inevitable. The political and economic difficulties of a
co-ordinated CFA devaluation are huge. But, as Europe learned this summer,
ignoring the need for a realignment will not make the problem go away.

Due to the introduction of the Single Market, EC countries are currently
changing to a new system of compiling trade statistics. All trade
figures are seasonally adjusted, except for the Italian series and the
German current account. Imports can be derived by subtracting the
visible trade balance from exports. Export and import data are
calculated on the FOB (free on board) basis, except for German and
Italian imports which use the CIF method (including carriage, insurance
and freight charges). German data up to and including June 1990, shown

FT  15 NOV 93 / Trade pact vote hanging in the balance: Arm-twisting on
Nafta will go on to the last minute before the US Congress decides
</HEADLINE>

THE debating, cajoling and arm-twisting will continue up to the very last
minute this week as members of Congress prepare for Wednesday's crucial vote
in the House of Representatives on the North American Free Trade Agreement
with Mexico and Canada.
The congressional votes have been counted, recounted and double-counted, and
still no-one can predict the outcome with real confidence.
'The undecided members of Congress still hold the balance,' Vice-President
Al Gore said yesterday.
If Nafta passes the House, it is expected to be approved more easily by the
Senate. It would then come into effect on January 1, lowering tariffs and
dismantling trade barriers between the US, Canada and Mexico.
President Bill Clinton said this weekend that he had won 27 members over to
Nafta in the three days since Mr Gore debated the issue with Mr Ross Perot
on television, and claimed to have the necessary momentum to win on
Wednesday. One more member, Ms Maria Cantwell, was due to announce her
support yesterday, despite Mr Perot's anti-Nafta rally in her Seattle
district.
But Congressman David Bonior, the Democratic whip who is leading the battle
in Congress against Nafta, said he had topped the 218 needed to win in the
434-member House.
'We have about 222 votes going into this weekend and we think we are going
to hold our votes,' Mr Bonior said yesterday, though other anti-Nafta
campaigners said they wanted a cushion of at least eight or nine members to
counter last-minute defections.
The White House's strategy for winning the Nafta vote is built on gaining
around 100 of the House's 258 Democrats and around 120 of the 175
Republicans.
Some pro-Nafta campaigners believe they will have the Democratic votes they
are counting on, but worry that the Republicans are so far assured of only
105 members and will be hard pressed to find their 120-vote contribution.
In the last month, however, the administration has been hard at work on a
wider spread of side-deals to alloy the doubts of wavering members.
'The only deal that hasn't been made is for working families,' Mr Bonior
complained.
Votes have been hard to buy. Deals on citrus and sugar won fewer vote
commitments than the White House had hoped for, and the promise of a North
American Development Bank doubled its yield this week when Congressman Ed
Pastor cited it as a reason he would vote for Nafta.
Asparagus growers and airlines have also received a helping hand, but the
administration denied that it had promised to build sewers or bridges in the
districts of uncommitted members.
What many congressmen are looking for, however, is a political umbrella. Mr
Clinton offered one to hesitant Republicans by promising to help them in
next year's congressional elections if his fellow Democrats bring up their
vote for Nafta against them.
Congressional vote counters say that Nafta is unlikely to pass by more than
one or two votes, if it passes at all. Several members of Congress may have
promised the president that theirs will not be the vote that kills the trade
pact; if the Ayes top 218, there will be a rush of these provisional Nafta
supporters to vote No.

NOVEMBER 17, WASHINGTON: Congress votes on North American Free Trade
                         Agreement, linking the US, Canada and Mexico.
                         Failure would flag serious US difficulties in
                         ratifying a Gatt Uruguay Round deal, even if an
                         agreement is reached in principle in Geneva by
                         December 15.
NOVEMBER 17-21, SEATTLE: The Apec summit cements closer economic and
                         political ties across the Pacific. Leaders are
                         committed to providing fresh Uruguay Round

                         the Uruguay Round expires, imposing an
                         effective deadline for the talks. Brinkmanship
                         can be expected to the last minute, as the US
                         has to deliver an agreement to Congress by
                         midnight - or 6:00am Geneva time

CANADIAN business leaders are urging their government to press ahead with a
bilateral free-trade pact with Mexico if the US Congress rejects the
tripartite North American Free Trade Agreement this week.
The US House of Representatives is due to vote on Nafta on Wednesday. In a
move apparently aimed both at promoting Canada's own interests and at
stepping up pressure on wavering US congressmen, the Business Council on
National Issues, which represents chief executives of Canada's 150 biggest
companies, revealed that its two most senior officers raised the possibility
of a Canada-Mexico pact at a meeting with Mexican President Carlos Salinas
de Gortari in Mexico City this month.
Canada's two-way trade with Mexico, totalling about CDollars 3bn (Pounds
1.4bn) a year, is a fraction of US-Mexico trade. But the prospect of a North
American free trade zone has sparked great interest among Canadian
businesses in raising trade and investment flows.
Proponents of a Canada-Mexico deal say it would give Canadian exporters and
investors a head start on rivals from third countries, and also pave the way
for closer links between Canada and other Latin American countries.
According to local reports, the Canadians have floated the idea of Pemex,
the state-owned Mexican oil company, moving its North American procurement
office from Houston to Calgary. Canadian grain exporters are also eager to
keep US rivals at bay in the fast-growing Mexican market.
The Canadian parliament has already ratified Nafta. All that remains is for
the law to be formally promulgated.
The Liberal government which came to office in last month's general election
has pledged to renegotiate parts of the accord. It wants, among other
things, to include a subsidies and anti-dumping code, and to amend the
energy provisions of the 1989 US-Canada free trade pact.
Mr Jean Chretien, Canada's prime minister, is scheduled to discuss these
concerns with President Bill Clinton this Friday during the summit of
Pacific Rim nations in Seattle.
Diplomats expect that the Americans will agree to set up some form of
working group to examine these issues. This would not alter the present
provisions of Nafta, but would probably be sufficient for Mr Chretien to
implement the agreement as scheduled on January 1 1994.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Chile's request to join Apec set to be rebuffed

MEXICO and Papua New Guinea are expected to be invited to join the Asia
Pacific Economic Co-operation forum when the 15-nation group meets in
Seattle this week, but Chile's membership application is likely to be turned
down.
US officials said, however, that although the issue of allowing Chile in
would be discussed by ministers in Seattle on Wednesday and Thursday, the
Apec organisation operated by consensus.
The absence of consensus over Chile reflects doubts and divisions within
Apec over how this still evolving organisation should develop.
Founded in 1989 as an informal consultative grouping, Apec includes not only
the six Asean countries but also the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand,
South Korea, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
While Apec's Asian members recognise that Mexico's close economic ties to
the US - particularly if the Clinton administration wins the House of
Representatives vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement on Wednesday
 -make it a logical member, several countries are reluctant to shift the
organisation's centre of gravity further east by admitting Chile.
This in turn reflects suspicion, particularly in countries such as Malaysia,
of a hidden US agenda to use Apec as a way of strong-arming Asian countries
into opening their markets wider to US exports.
President Patricio Aylwin of Chile pressed his country's case on a recent
trip to Asia, but does not appear to have overcome this reluctance.

President Patricio Aylwin of Chile pressed his country's case on a recent

The argument over Chilean membership also reflects doubts over whether Apec,
which established a small permanent secretariat only last year, needs time
to consolidate before it adds new countries.
'It's important to bed Apec down before we start expanding it,' says Mr Don
Russell, the Australian ambassador in Washington.
The expansion issue is unlikely to disappear in the years ahead, as many
countries are eager to reinforce their links with a region which boasts the
strongest economic growth rates in the world.
Besides Mexico, Papua New Guinea and Chile, Apec has also received overtures
from India, Pakistan, Macao, Sri Lanka, Russia, Ecuador and Peru, and even
the EC has asked for observer status.

FT  15 NOV 93 / A public humiliation for the outsider of Italy's business
elite: Olivetti's Carlo De Benedetti is interviewed by Haig Simonian
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME 400 miles divide the dank cells of Rome's rambling Regina Coeli prison
on the banks of the Tiber from the warm, cherry-wood panelled offices of Mr
Carlo De Benedetti's business base in Milan.
In the six-hour drive between the two earlier this month, the Olivetti
chairman, sandwiched between two Carabinieri officers in the back of a small
Lancia sedan, found himself transformed from an industrial mogul to a
miscreant.
Rather than take his private jet or 12-cylinder BMW to face the arrest
warrant from Rome magistrates investigating Olivetti's kickbacks to
officials of the post ministry, Mr De Benedetti wanted to avoid the
impression of special privileges, he says. 'I wanted to be treated
normally.'
That self-imposed public humiliation, which included an unseemly episode
when his car was engulfed by newsmen after being blocked by traffic just
outside the jail, illustrates one facet of a character whose contradictions
make him one of Europe's most fascinating, but bewildering, businessman.
He says he holds no grudges against the judges at whose hand he suffered the
indignities of incarceration. 'Accidentally or deliberately, the formalities
of going into prison separate you from your personality. In a way, you
really do become a number. From an emotional standpoint, this is the most
difficult stage,' he says.
Nor does he wish to see the same thing happening to others in Italy's
business establishment also embroiled in the 21-month corruption scandal.
'I'm such an individualist, I'd never think of comparing myself to them.
Wanting it to happen to them is the last thing I'd do.'
Yet it is hard to believe the brush with justice has failed to unnerve even
Mr De Benedetti, whose ability to recover from setbacks and surmount new
challenges is one of the most alluring aspects of a business career that has
taken him from managing director at Fiat in the 1970s to one of the most
daring of the frontier-busting deal makers of the 1980s.
Hearing him retell it now, Mr De Benedetti's sang-froid almost stretches
belief. The 4.30am departure for Rome was timed to avoid his spending the
night in jail. 'I calculated it would take about six hours to drive, another
hour for prison formalities and six or seven more for interrogation. That
meant I hoped I could sleep in my own bed that night.'
As it happened, Mr De Benedetti was released at 11.35pm after two grillings
in which he satisfied investigating magistrates that the 'new' evidence they
had was already in the deposition he had made to their Milan colleagues six
months earlier. Earlier this year Mr De Benedetti admitted that the company
had paid more than L10bn (Pounds 4.1m) to government officials to win
contracts.
Even Mr De Benedetti, however, admits to some harrowing moments. 'At sunset,
when I was waiting for my second interrogation, the prisoners started to
sing. Listening to that chorus, there was a moment in which I seriously
wondered whether I would get out that night.'
Now Mr De Benedetti, like hundreds of others in the scandals, is in a sort
of judicial limbo, presumably to face trial at some later date. After a few
days under house arrest in Rome and then Milan, life returned to 'normal'
late last week. It is hard to think, however, that life could ever be
entirely normal for Mr De Benedetti, who yesterday held a celebratory lunch
with friends and family at his Turin home to toast his 59th birthday and the
removal of restrictions on his liberty.
Always outspoken, sometimes at risk to himself, he is likely to remain a
prisoner of contradictions in his own nature.
He revels in his image in Italy as an outsider, even among the business
elite with whom he has made so much of his fortune. Along with Fiat's
chairman, Mr Giovanni Agnelli, he is one of a brace of businessmen who have
come to represent Italian capitalism abroad.
At home, his image is still one of a slight upstart who is at times
unwilling to accept the confines and unwritten rules of the domestic
business leaders among whom he moves.
Yet while he revels in being different, Mr De Benedetti has not suffered
from being accepted among the Agnellis, Pirellis and their like. His
business success has opened the doors to his membership of the club of core
shareholders in Mediobanca, the merchant bank behind most big business deals
in Italy, and to the controlling ranks of the Confindustria employers'
federation, whose latest Rome meeting he rushed to attend on regaining his
liberty last week.
In politics, he has used his media interests, notably the best selling daily
La Repubblica and the popular L'Espresso news magazine, to scourge much of
the establishment, notably the now discredited Socialist and Christian
Democrat parties.
That so many members of Italy's political old guard, led by the Christian
Democrats who have held uninterrupted power since the post-war return to
democracy, are now under investigation is a visible source of satisfaction
to Mr De Benedetti, in spite of the fact that he claims he is not in any way
vindictive.
'In Italy, we had a sort of Communist regime in which a coterie held power.
Its duration allowed corruption to grow exponentially, rather like in Japan.
It wasn't quite Russia, in that we had freedom of the press. I was not sent
to Siberia. But my Siberia was the Banco Ambrosiano affair.' The reference
is to the big Milanese bank which collapsed in 1982 soon after Mr De
Benedetti resigned after a two-month stint as deputy chairman.
He sees the tortuous 11-year legal case, rather than his latest dealings
with the judiciary over Olivetti, as his true courtroom Calvary. In April
1992, he was sentenced to more than six years in jail for fraudulent
bankruptcy. Although he appealed immediately, his detailed defence can only
begin once the full motivation for the sentence is handed down, which has
yet to happen.
The true events surrounding Banco Ambrosiano and the mysterious death of its
chairman, Mr Roberto Calvi, found hanging under London's Blackfriars Bridge,
may never be known, although some of the mysteries have recently begun to
clear. Among the groups believed to have been involved were the Mafia, the
notorious P2 masonic lodge and the Vatican, through its own financial
institution. Leaked testimony in the latest corruption scandals suggests the
bank may also have been a conduit for illegal political funding.
Mr De Benedetti is convinced the sentence against him was politically
motivated. It exploded as a bombshell, years after the original charges
against him were dropped at an earlier stage in the proceedings.
He says explosive new evidence for the prosecution will be revealed from the
witness box next month in the long-running P2 trial in Rome which he says
will clear his name. Separately, recent Milanese investigations into a
senior judge implicated in alleged bribery has led to what is believed to be
a broader inquiry into the conduct of some top judges, including those
involved in the Banco Ambrosiano case.
It is that affair which lies at the heart of Mr De Benedetti's quarrel with
the judiciary, rather than his recent contretemps in Rome. 'There is nothing
more damaging for an entrepreneur than to be associated with bankruptcy. I
cannot find any other explanation than some form of vendetta,' he says. 'The
other thing is nothing.'

FT  15 NOV 93 / Wise men warn of German zero growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S 'five wise men' have warned the government that the west German
economy is unlikely to grow in the coming year and the recession may not yet
have bottomed out.
The government's independent economic advisers fear that unemployment will
top 4m in 1994, up by another 500,000, and industrial investment continue to
stagnate. Their report, due out today, is notably more pessimistic than the
recent forecasts from the leading German economic institutes.
Their forecast of zero growth in west Germany compares with a prediction of
1 per cent recovery by five of the six economic institutes. The government
itself is still hoping for a 1.5 per cent growth rate.
Private and public consumption in west Germany are expected to decline for a
second year in succession, while investment in plant and equipment is likely
to shrink by a further 2 per cent, after a 15.5 per cent drop in the current
year. The one hopeful sign is a forecast recovery of 2.5 per cent in export
earnings, while inflation should slow further to 3 per cent in west Germany
and 4 per cent in the east.
Yet the five wise men are probably more hesitant than at any time in recent
years in their prognosis for the German economy, arguing that it could
easily pick up sooner, or deteriorate further.
'We must emphasise that we do not consider ourselves on safe ground in
making this forecast,' the authors say. 'The danger that the recession could
deepen has been initially averted, if not yet fully banished.' The advisers
recall that they forecast zero growth for the west German gross domestic
product for 1993 - the most pessimistic prediction published last autumn -
only to see it heading for a 2 per cent decline. They say a revival of
industrial investment is an urgent necessity, combined with rigorous control
of public sector spending.
They accuse all levels of the government of failing to pursue a clear and
predictable course of consolidation in budget spending over the past two
years.
The wise men warn that the impending introduction of an oil tax from January
1 and simultaneous increases in social security and pensions contributions
are likely to mean a further cut in production in the coming months.
As far as encouraging investment is concerned, they call for further steps
to reform the corporate taxation system, with a view to real tax cuts from
1997 onwards. That would be possible only if there was a consistent savings
programme at all levels of public spending.
The call for action on investment was taken up yesterday by Mr Rudolf
Scharping, leader of the opposition SPD, who urged a revival of 'concerted
action' to tackle the jobs crisis.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Chernobyl death toll put at 42
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TOTAL of 42 deaths can be definitely attributed to the 1986 explosion at
the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine, European scientists said this
weekend.
The figure is in apparent contrast to the Ukrainian government's claim that
8,000 people have died so far from the effects of the world's worst nuclear
disaster.
Apart from increased rates of thyroid cancer in children, no clear signs
have yet been detected of an increase in radiation-related illnesses or
deaths, European scientists visiting the region said. They expected a
long-term rise in cancer rates, but said some reports of increased illness
in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, the three former Soviet republics most
heavily contaminated by radioactive fallout, were unverifiable or premature.
Mr Boris Prister, first deputy minister of Ukraine for protection of the
population from the consequences of the Chernobyl accident, said: 'We are
often asked how many people died from Chernobyl, but the truth is, that is
one of the most complicated questions of all.'
Part of the difficulty in judging the effects of the disaster is the lack of
reliable data in some regions from before 1986.
Cancer experts, some of whom have been studying health effects since the
explosion, were accompanying a European Community delegation to Chernobyl
last week, which included members of the European parliament and the
Commission.
In the past two years, the group has conducted a joint research programme,
funded by the European Union and the three republics, which have invested
Ecu14.2m (Pounds 11m) in 16 projects.
Scientists have agreed that the increased rate of normally rare thyroid
cancer in children in the contaminated regions can be blamed on the
explosion.
Scientists in the EC team say that 35 of the 42 known deaths were people who
suffered severe radiation sickness during the past seven years.

FT  15 NOV 93 / EU bank settlement reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Union central bankers have agreed to try to reduce the risks of
banking system failures by ensuring that banks settle large cash payment
claims against each other immediately.
A working group of bankers led by Mr Tomaso Padoa-Schioppa, chairman of the
Basle committee on banking supervision, a committee of the Bank for
International Settlements, has recommended that EU states should establish
real-time settlement systems 'as soon as feasible'.
Banks in most EU countries currently settle net obligations to each other
through central banks at the end of each day. However, this is thought to
carry risks of systemic financial failure.
Most EU states are working on a move towards 'real time gross settlement'.
Britain is planning to convert its interbank payments system from net end of
day settlement to real time by the end of 1995.
