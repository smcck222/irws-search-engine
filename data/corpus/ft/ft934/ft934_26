Ministers in Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's Israeli government yesterday
called on PLO leader Yassir Arafat to do more to control Palestinian
militants who are attacking Israeli targets in the occupied territories,
David Horovitz reports from Jerusalem. Mr Arafat has condemned the killing
last month of a Jewish settler, Haim Mizrahi, allegedly by five activists
from his own Fatah faction of the PLO.
There were also reports last night that Mr Arafat and Mr Rabin are to hold a
second summit in Cairo next month.

FT  15 NOV 93 / ILO standing at low ebb, say workers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE standing of the International Labour Organisation is at a low ebb as
other international bodies usurp its functions and its 167 member-states
become increasingly reluctant to ratify new conventions, according to an
internal critique of the organisation.
The workers' group on the organisation's tripartite governing body, in a
document to be submitted to the current review of the ILO, is unusually
outspoken about what many see as the ineffectiveness of the organisation.
The submission makes a strong defence of the workers' group's focus on
worker protection in the face of growing pressure from the employers' group
to liberalise regulations and switch emphasis to employment creation.
It argues that the ILO must take the offensive in pressing for a 'world
social charter' and a social clause in the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade which would make access to world markets dependent on respect for
basic worker rights.
The document acknowledges that such a social clause could be seen as 'a
disguised protectionist mechanism' but argues that it could actually help
stem the rise of protectionist pressures and should only lead to trade
sanctions as a final resort. It also points out that various commodity trade
agreements - such as those covering rubber, cocoa, sugar and tin - already
have commitments to fair labour standards.
Mr Bill Brett, the main author of the document and leader of the British
civil service union IPMS, says that just as the International Monetary Fund
sees itself as guarantor of a world financial contract so the ILO should be
the guarantor of a world social contract.
Currently, argues Mr Brett, the ILO is just a 'spectator' in structural
adjustment programmes imposed by the IMF or World Bank which often lead to
violation of basic worker protections. And the ILO, a United Nations agency,
has also seen a 'dangerous incursion' by other institutions into what should
be its field of competence, for example the drawing up of labour codes for
African countries by the World Bank.
Mr Brett says that all countries must ratify the ILO's key conventions - on
freedom of association, forced labour and discrimination - by the year 2000.
Some of these conventions have been ratified by only just over 100 of the
167 member states. The paper also points out that the 17 new conventions
adopted between 1980 and 1990 have received an average of 12 ratifications
each.
The employer offensive, led by the American Mr Abe Katz, has stressed the
excessive legalism and inflexibility of existing legislation.

FT  15 NOV 93 / EU bankers urge settlement reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Union central bankers have agreed to try to reduce the risks of
banking system failures by ensuring that banks settle large cash payment
claims against each other immediately.
A working group of bankers led by Mr Tomaso Padoa-Schioppa, the
newly-appointed chairman of the Basle committee on banking supervision, a
committee of the Bank for International Settlements, has recommended that EU
states should establish real-time settlement systems 'as soon as feasible'.
Banks in most EU countries currently settle net obligations to each other
through central banks at the end of each day. However, this is thought to
carry risks of systemic financial failure.
Most EU states are working on a move towards 'real time gross settlement'.
Britain is planning to convert its interbank payments system from net end of
day settlement to real time by the end of 1995.
The report recommends that the net settlement systems which continue should
meet strict standards. These could raise the costs of these systems close to
those of real time systems, and so reduce the incentive to keep them.
The report also says that only central banks and credit institutions should
be allowed to participate directly in the transfer of funds.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Manufacturing jobs 'to fall sharply' in western nations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURING industry in the leading industrial countries could be
employing less than 10 per cent of the workforce in 30 years, according to
two prize-winning economists.
Ms DeAnne Julius, the chief economist of British Airways, and Mr Richard
Brown, a UK economic consultant, say faster falls in employment can be
expected in countries such as Germany, Japan and Italy.
But in an essay that has won this year's Dollars 25,000 first prize in the
annual Amex Bank Review Awards competition, they argue that it would be
'costly and ultimately fruitless' for industrial country members of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to try to stop the
trend through subsidies or protection. The share of manufacturing in total
employment has already fallen sharply in recent years to around 15 per cent
in the US and to 32 per cent in Germany.
Ms Julius and Mr Brown say the current shift away from manufacturing towards
service sector employment within OECD countries and the migration of
manufacturing jobs to low-cost developing countries are 'desirable and
natural'.
The shift of employment away from manufacturing will be analogous to the
fall in agricultural employment in the industrial countries earlier in this
century when, according to their analysis, displaced agricultural workers
tended to find jobs predominantly in the services sector.
'Left to market forces and assuming continued technological progress, there
is little reason to suppose that manufacturing employment should follow a
very different path over the next 50 years than agricultural employment has
over the past 50.'
The economists say industrial country governments should respond to the
changes by upgrading and broadening their education systems to produce
workers with sufficient flexibility and productivity to underpin expanding
service sectors. They should also support free trade in services.

FT  15 NOV 93 / UK to reduce Trident deterrent: Rifkind set to announce
significant change to country's nuclear stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is set to announce plans to restrict the size of its Trident nuclear
deterrent in the most significant change to the country's UK's strategic
nuclear stance since the end of the cold war.
Under the new policy the UK will commit itself to deploying a force with a
total explosive power no greater than that of the current generation of
Polaris ballistic missile submarines.
The shift means it will need far fewer Trident missiles than first planned,
saving possibly hundreds of millions of pounds from the defence budget.
Experts say the 44 missiles already purchased would easily fulfil the new
requirement, although the navy may seek some extra missiles to keep in
reserve.
Trident submarines, due to come into service in about a year, are capable of
much larger firepower than Polaris, as well as greater range and accuracy.
Each Trident missile carries up to eight warheads, each capable of being
directed at a different target, while Polaris missiles carry two or three.
The decision to limit the Trident system's total explosive power, in terms
of tons of TNT, to that of the Polaris fleet is due to be announced tomorrow
by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, at the Centre for Defence Studies
in London.
The move is in part designed to pre-empt criticism that the UK is re-arming
while the US and Russia are engaged in drastic reductions in their nuclear
arsenals.
In line with US policy, Britain has already withdrawn tactical nuclear
weapons from navy surface ships and has roughly halved its stockpile of
nuclear aircraft bombs. Last month it abandoned plans to replace its
aircraft bombs with a new air-launched nuclear missile which would have cost
up to Pounds 3bn.
US short-range nuclear weapons deployed with British troops in Germany have
also been sent back to the US for destruction under Nato arms cuts agreed in
1991.
Mr Rifkind's announcement will be the first confirmation of the UK's
intention to deploy a reduced Trident arsenal, although the government has
hinted in the past that it would not seek the full complement of 512
warheads for the Trident fleet.
The Ministry of Defence does not plan to declare the total number of
warheads in the fleet, a figure it has always kept secret. Explosive yields
are also classified.
Mr Daniel Plesch, director of the British American Security Information
Council, an independent research group which lobbies against nuclear
weapons, said it was unclear what figure the ministry would use as the
'baseline' for Polaris firepower which would then be used as a yardstick for
Trident. He described the expected announcement as 'a very positive move'.
The decision means that the UK will cut short deliveries of Trident missiles
from the US, which supplies them to Britain and undertakes to take them back
and replace them when they need servicing. The Trident D5 missiles are made
by Lockheed of the US, while the warheads are manufactured by Britain's
Atomic Weapons Establishment.
Reductions in the US Trident programme have threatened to increase
significantly the price the UK pays for its missiles.
Under the new policy, Britain's Trident submarines would have some of their
missile-tubes filled with ballast. Some Trident missiles are expected to be
fitted with single warheads to fulfil a 'sub-strategic' nuclear role, or
even with non-nuclear warheads.
Another possibility is that the submarines could be adapted to carry cruise
missiles as well. Further savings will be sought by relaxing the schedule of
patrols. Although one submarine will always be on patrol, there will be
fewer times when two or more are at sea. This will enable the navy to make
do with fewer than the six crews currently attached to the Polaris fleet.
The UK's first Trident submarine, the Pounds 650m HMS Vanguard, was formally
accepted by the navy in September. The second is due for sea trials next
year. Two more are under construction.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Meatiemen's revolt shakes City to its medieval roots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S oldest meat market is squaring up to one of Britain's oldest
local authorities in a battle for control of the City of London.
The conflict, between the meat traders of Smithfield and the Corporation of
London, has forced the corporation to draw up unprecedented plans to reform
its electoral procedure - which dates back to the Middle Ages.
The move follows a threat by the traders to pack the next election, due next
month, over plans to increase their rents dramatically.
Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the corporation's policy committee,
confirmed that the meat traders' revolt had forced thoughts of reform. He
said: 'We are giving consideration to . . . (extending) the franchise to
limited companies.'
The meat traders have been galvanised into political action by plans to
refurbish their market to meet EU regulations. which could cost each of the
140 of them between Pounds 100,000 and Pounds 170,000. The City Corporation
has already spent more than Pounds 30m on the first phase.
By April 1994, Smithfield's bloodstained sawdust and hanging carcasses must
be replaced with a temperature-controlled zone where meat is electronically
pulleyed through self-lock doors rather than carted around the Victorian
market by aproned men with wooden wheelbarrows.
Mr Dave Bellinger, of the Smithfield Meat Company, said: 'The corporation
are refurbishing the market and trying to increase rents by 400 per cent.
The traders are saying they can't afford it.'
Having already rejected tenancy terms offered by the corporation in April,
the traders are plotting to infiltrate its decision-making body, the
132-strong common council, in elections to be held early next month. They
intend to pack City wards with their own supporters with the aim of creating
a powerful 'meatiemen' group.
At first sight the electoral arithmetic is not favourable. There are 15,929
eligible voters in the City's 25 wards. In the Farringdon Without ward, home
to Smithfield, there are 6,689 voters among the sole traders, partnerships
and residents/tenants, and only 140 meat traders.
But low voter turnout and electorates of fewer than 100 in other wards have
got the corporation worried.
The corporation has been exposed to the challenge because it has the most
restricted local-authority franchise in the UK, with votes for partnerships,
sole traders, livery companies and City residents, but none for the big
companies that account for most of the City's business.
Anomalies mean that partners of large accountancy practices with numerous
offices in the square mile can vote in seven separate wards. BP, the oil
company, which is the square mile's largest employer, does not have a single
vote.
The meat traders are not over-optimistic.
The proprietor of Meat City in Farringdon Road remarked: 'The corporation's
never lost a case in (its) life and it's not going to start now.'

FT  15 NOV 93 / Many Tory MPs want deeper spending cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEEP divisions among Conservative MPs over whether taxes must rise to reduce
the government's Pounds 50bn a year borrowing requirement have highlighted
the dangerous political balancing act faced by Mr Kenneth Clarke in his
Budget on November 30.
A Financial Times survey of opinion on the Tory backbenches at Westminster
reveals that a large majority wants the burden of cutting the government's
indebtedness to fall more heavily on public spending.
Over two-thirds argue that the chancellor should reduce further the
Whitehall spending targets already agreed for the next three years. An even
larger majority (80 per cent) want an early cut in interest rates to
underpin the currently hesitant pace of economic recovery. The survey, based
on written responses from 75 Conservative MPs during the past three weeks,
exposes their deep unease about the planned imposition of value added tax on
domestic fuel.
Some 57 per cent of those polled believe it is too late now to reverse the
plan announced by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, but 48 per cent
say household heating bills should not be subject to the full 17.5 per cent
VAT rate.
That figure points up the serious risk of a backbench rebellion against the
tax unless Mr Clarke unveils a compensation package which includes generous
help for those on low incomes just above the state benefit levels. As Mr
Clarke prepares to put the final touches to his Budget, his cabinet
colleagues are convinced he has decided on a further package of tax
increases.
Senior ministers say the chancellor's commitment to a faster reduction in
public borrowing will be impossible to meet without additional revenue. One
cabinet member said last night that abandoning that commitment would 'tear
up' the Treasury's credibility in financial markets.
The survey shows that 52 per cent of Tory MPs would support higher taxes.
But a large minority - 45 per cent - say he should not add to the tax
increases already put in place by Mr Lamont. Those measures will raise an
additional Pounds 6bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 10bn in 1995-96.
The deep ambivalence on the backbenches over the twin needs to nurture
recovery and reduce borrowing is reflected also in their assessment of Mr
Clarke's first priority. Some 56 per cent of those questioned say it should
be promoting the recovery but 31 per cent say lower borrowing should come
first.
Of the slightly more than half of MPs willing to put a figure on the
acceptable scale of higher taxation an overwhelming majority are convinced
Mr Clarke should err on the side of political caution. Some 32 per cent of
the respondents suggest any increases should be limited to between Pounds
1bn and Pounds 2bn in annual terms while 20 per cent are ready to
contemplate an additional Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn. But only 5 per cent are
ready to consider the possibility the chancellor might seek an extra Pounds
5bn or more.
The MPs are also clear that if taxes are to go up, the increases must be
carefully targeted. More than half believe the best way to raise additional
revenue would be through non-indexation of income tax allowances, while 60
per cent see scope for a further squeeze on mortgage interest relief. Some
53 per cent are also prepared to see VAT levied on newspapers and books.
The concern to strengthen recovery is reflected also in the 73 per cent who
want special measures to help industry and boost exports and investment.

FT  15 NOV 93 / Insurance companies will have to review 5m pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURANCE companies are to be forced to examine up to 5m personal pensions
policies sold since 1988 and compensate any individuals who have taken them
out against their best interests.
According to one regulatory official, the companies could face a bill of
millions of pounds.
The action follows concern among regulators that hard-selling sales agents
encouraged customers to transfer out of attractive occupational pension
schemes into far less advantageous personal pensions. These carry high
administrative charges and have no employer contributions.
Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry, has set up
a working party to devise a system for member firms to examine their
records. It will issue instructions to them early in the new year.
The working party, which will also advise on the compensation scheme,
includes Lautro staff, insurance industry representatives, independent
actuaries and representatives of the National Association of Pension Funds.
The move is a response to an initial review ordered by Lautro for the third
quarter of 1992, which found that 50,000 personal pensions contracts had
been terminated. All of these had been taken out in the previous two years.
Although Lautro has not determined the reasons for this high rate, it has
found that mis-selling has been a significant factor in early cancellations
of long-term savings contracts.
Last year, Lautro issued guidance to sales agents saying that there were
almost no circumstances under which a sales agent could justify selling an
occupational scheme member a personal pension plan. Prior to giving that
guidance, Lautro found that 'in most cases the documentation for each sale
was so poor you could not tell whether the advice given was good'.
Since then, Lautro has found a marked improvement in the quality of
documentation.

<TEXT>
CIDER maker Stephen Gillman sometimes thinks he can still smell the aroma
that wafted from 30 empty oak hogsheads delivered to his Somerset home five
years ago from a whisky distillery in Scotland.
'My first year's cider vintage had a delicious whiskyish background to it,'
he said. 'Some cider makers regularly buy discarded whisky hogsheads to give
some brews a distinct flavour.'
At Pounds 750 including transport, Stephen thought the casks good value  -
particularly as the only other equipment he had to buy to continue his
fledgling business was a Pounds 1,200 hydraulic press.
The vessels were ideal for the first brew, which was 1,500 gallons - the
largest permitted without incurring excise duty. Whether it was due to the
hint of whisky or not, the experiment proved a success.
This was fortunate. Stephen and his wife Jill were more than Pounds 100,000
in debt to the bank and building society, having incurred debts buying out
her brother and sister-in-law's half of the holiday flat letting business
they had run in nearby Minehead. They decided to sell the flats and invest
everything in eight barren acres and a few delapidated barns in the hamlet
of Torre, seven miles away.
The Gillmans were yearning for a pleasant style of life. They wanted to
escape from the cramped urban flat they had occupied with their two small
daughters since Stephen, a master mariner, had opted for dry land. Stephen,
who was brought up on a fruit farm in Worcestershire wanted to do something
more adventurous than running the flats and cultivating pick-your-own
strawberries on an acre of land he rented.
They have achieved a good quality of life - but at a cost. Torre fruit farm
is in an idyllic spot, at the foot of the Brendon Hills beside a lovely
stream a mile from 800-year-old Cleeve Abbey.
Having bought the eight acres, the Gillmans increased their debt by
converting the first of the two dilapidated barns into a family home. They
did this in five months. Then they began the Pounds 80,000 conversion of the
house they now live in, which also has two holiday flats.
'While the building work was going on we lived in a caravan on the spot, but
soon realised that in order to make the whole enterprise work we were going
to have to sell the first barn soon after it was completed, otherwise we
feared the bank would make us sell the whole site to reduce the debt,'
Stephen said.
Then disaster struck. Interest rates rose from 7.5 to 14 per cent. To make
matters worse the Gillmans were paying 3 percentage points above base. It
took two years to sell the cottage, borrowings rose to Pounds 200,000 and
have remained at more than Pounds 100,000.
The Gillmans hand-planted 20,000 strawberry plants. When these all failed
they started again. There followed two good seasons, in which the Gillmans
made money, but by 1989 they realised that they were chasing their tails.
They knew that they had to make more money or sell up. Stephen had made wine
and cider on the kitchen table for several years, and when the Gillmans did
their sums they realised that cider was potentially more profitable than the
pick-your-own business.
'Any number of customers coming for strawberries were asking us where they
could get locally produced real scrumpy. We then realised that in west
Somerset there was no small producer of naturally conditioned farmhouse
cider made entirely from local cider apples,' Stephen said.
'With my background in fruit growing and the realisation that we had access
to a dozen or so old orchards round here with a mix of the right varieties
of apples, we decided to brew cider.'
So it was back to the land, but this time picking, collecting and
transporting 11 tons of apples to make the first brew.
By the summer of 1990 all 1,500 gallons had been sold, 400 bush trees
containing all the main varieties of cider apple planted and the strawberry
fields let to a neighbour to cultivate and run.
For September 1990, the Gillmans increased the brew to 10,000 gallons. 'It
seems an awful lot more, but we realised the road to success lay in
increasing volume. The cost was not that much greater. We had to buy 22
storage vessels at Pounds 35 each but apart from that there was little
further investment needed,' Stephen said.
Further, the holiday flats were beginning to bring in a reasonable sum and
they had found that producing non-alcoholic apple juice was a profitable
sideline. There was no need to employ a large staff - casual labour was
readily available to help with pressing and at other busy times.
There was a 60 per cent profit margin on the first brew. Stephen changed
banks, and consequently, bank managers and managed to reduce his borrowings
a little.
The main task for the 1990 vintage was to sell it all. The Gillmans took on
a sales agent, Sally Simmons, on a commission-only basis. By the summer of
1991, Torre Traditional cider was selling in shops and off-licences all over
Devon and Somerset and some of the bigger competitors were beginning to take
notice.
'When we phoned some of the bigger firms for marketing advice we got very
little help, so we then realised we were making inroads,' Jill said.
The Gillmans have received the endorsement of the Campaign for Real Ale,
which sells 1,000 gallons a year.
Annual production is 20,000 gallons. 'It is still a drop in the ocean
compared to the big boys, but at last the borrowing is coming down slowly
and if we go up to 40,000 gallons annually we should soon be able to pay off
our debts and make a good profit,' Stephen said.
Profits were a gross 56 per cent of turnover in 1989-90, they rose to a
Pounds 25,000 on a turnover of Pounds 62,000 the next year, and Pounds
30,000 on a turnover of Pounds 80,000 in 1992-3.
In spite of the aromatic delights of rising early to start pressing in the
brewhouse at this time of year it is still hard work. The couple reckon they
work 80-hour weeks, 52 weeks of the year. Last autumn they had their first
holiday for five years - a week in a friend's cottage in Normandy.
Stephen is away selling cider at 40 shows this year. The final one is the
London Christmas Festival at Earls Court in early December. 'Sometimes I
think all this is very hard on the children,' he said. 'I wouldn't like to
have to work as hard as this for the rest of my life. But we all love it
here at Torre and I enjoy cider making. So we shall just have to slog on
like this until most of the loan is paid off and we feel the business is
financially secure.'

FT  13 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Cut-price mortgage launched - A look
at a novel scheme by broker John Charcol
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN REECE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A VARIABLE rate mortgage which undercuts the standard building society rate
of 7.99 per cent by a full 1 percentage point has been launched by broker
John Charcol.
The product's competitiveness stems from its link to the London InterBank
Offer Rate, known as Libor. Normal building society mortgage rates are set
with reference to the rates paid to savers.
Libor is the rate at which commercial banks will lend to each other over
various periods and is also an indicator of the wholesale money market's
expectations for future base rate movements. Three month Libor is currently
5.66 per cent compared with base rates of 6 per cent and the standard
building society mortgage rate of 7.99 per cent.
John Charcol's offer of a mortgage set at Libor plus 1 per cent looks
extremely attractive at present rates. But taking out a Libor-linked
mortgage could prove costly, as the chart shows.
Until the middle of 1988, the City was anticipating base rate cuts and Libor
was leading base rates down. But once the wholesale money markets sensed a
turn in the interest rate cycle, Libor shot up and continued to rise at a
premium to base rates and building society rates.
As a result, when base rates reached 15 per cent, borrowers with a
Libor-linked mortgage were paying over 16 per cent, compared with building
society borrowers on 15.4 per cent.
The new John Charcol offer allows borrowers to switch to a standard variable
rate, a fixed rate, or a rate linked to the average of the top 10 building
society rates should Libor begin to rise out of line with other mortgage
rates. Borrowers can opt for these options without any redemption penalties
and with only one month's notice required.
The Libor-linked rate of interest on the loan is recalculated every three
months and adjusted if rates have changed. The initial rate has been set at
6.99 per cent.
The company is also offering a version which caps the Libor-linked loan at
7.99 per cent for 36 months from completion. This means borrowers will
benefit from any further fall in Libor but would be protected from any
increase in the rate above 7.99 per cent. This option is slightly more
expensive - at 1.25 per cent above Libor - and carries redemption penalties
but offers protection against a repeat of the 1990 experience.
The lender charges a Pounds 295 arrangement fee. John Charcol earns its
money either from commission (depending on the method of repayment, eg
endowment or Pep, used), or from a fee, depending on individual
circumstances. This reduces the cost saving compared with a conventional
variable rate. There are no insurance policies tied to the mortgage.
A big advantage for Libor-linked borrowers is that any future cut in
interest rates will be passed on in full whereas it is unlikely that
building societies will be able to cut their mortgage rates by much because
of their need to maintain savings rates.
It is reasonable to expect that, if base rates fell to 5 per cent, the
average building society mortgage rate would fall only 0.5 per cent to 7.49
per cent. John Charcol's Libor-linked loan would enjoy the full benefit of
the cut and would fall to 5.909 per cent.
In 1986, Citibank launched the first Libor-linked mortgage in the UK and
successfully lent Pounds 50m but has since been unable to generate much
interest in spite of a relaunch in March of this year. Stephen Balme,
marketing director of Citibank Mortgage, said that the company may well
consider another relaunch now that wholesale money market rates are so low.
'There is always the problem that the consumer doesn't fully understand
Libor,' said Balme.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Tax returns by telephone - Andrew
Jack investigates a new service that could be the shape of things to come
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MIGHT be on a very modest scale so far, but the service advertised in a
bright yellow leaflet circulating last week heralded what could well be the
shape of things to come for taxpayers.
As the Inland Revenue increasingly shifts the onus on companies and
individuals to assess their own tax, so a new market is likely to open up in
cheap advisory services.
At the start of this month, Direct Line Tax Service began to operate a
telephone tax service, with calls charged at local rates around the country.
Its co-ordinator says that if demand goes as planned, he plans to open a
series of tax shops in high streets, starting with one in London next
spring.
Similar services are offered already by H&amp; R. Block in the United States,
and in Australia.
The initiative has been spurred by the move towards self-assessment of tax.
From 1996, individual taxpayers will be expected to calculate their
liability and either send in a cheque or claim a refund. A similar 'pay and
file' system has just been put in place for companies.
This puts an increasing burden on taxpayers, although it is being
accompanied by considerable efforts to improve communication and clarity in
Revenue forms and information leaflets.
In spite of the ambitious nation-wide aims, Direct Line Tax Service is based
in Fryer &amp; Co., a small accountancy practice at Luton.
It has no connection with Direct Line, the telephone insurance service owned
by the Royal Bank of Scotland.
Ganesh Aiyer, a partner with the firm, says his service has just four staff
answering the 'phones so far but plans to expand up to 20. He believes they
can handle about 200 returns a month each, with an average of 30 minutes for
each call. Each conversation leads to a computer-generated tax return, which
the firm will send to the customer or directly to the Revenue.
His ultimate target would be to deal with the affairs of 200,000 taxpayers.
So far, the service has processed a little over 100 tax returns.
Aiyer stresses: 'We are not selling peanuts, we are selling professional
services.' But others raise questions about the need - although perhaps not
the demand - for his service.
Taxpayers with complex requirements cannot be handled by it and those with
simpler demands ought to be able to do their own returns. Indeed, even if
using the new service, they will still have to ferret out the necessary pay
slips and documents.
Nonetheless, several tax practitioners say they have been expecting
developments of this kind to begin spreading in the UK alongside
self-assessment. As one put it: 'It is amazing how extraordinarily
intelligent people seem to have difficulty with their tax returns.
'This is purely a processing exercise. It is not particularly helpful. I
don't believe it is a threat to the tax profession.'
Aiyer replies: 'We are not offering counselling or consulting. Not everybody
needs professional advice.
'But a lot of people, by sheer inertia, will be inclined to rely on someone
else to do their returns. Some do not feel they want to be doing their own
thing when, for a small price, someone else can.'

FT  13 NOV 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Setting up a trust
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AS A HOBBY, I carry out the book-keeping duties for the limited company and
partnership owned by my son and a colleague.
I would like to set up a trust fund, under my own control, for my young
grandchildren and to place approximately Pounds 100 a month in the fund.
This would be paid from my son's business interests in recognition of my
clerical support.
I might also wish to place funds of my own into the trust from time to time.
I would like the trust source income to be free of income tax liability and,
likewise, any income derived from the trust investments. How can I set up a
trust to cover these requirements?
Once the money is in the trust, it could be possible to ensure that tax is
mitigated by investing in assets which are likely to produce capital gains
rather than income.
The capital gains may be covered by the trust's CGT exemption.
Alternatively, you could pass the money directly to your grandchildren so
that they could place the money in their own names and enjoy the income,
free of tax, to the extent that it is covered by their available personal
allowances.
There is a difficulty in arranging for the income to be received tax-free.
Your son's partnership presumably obtains an income tax deduction for the
clerical fees paid to you and I would expect your receipt of such income to
be subject to income tax.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Paying IHT on gifts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ARTICLE in the FT Guide for the Serious Investor stated: ' . . .if you
have surplus income after tax and normal living expenditure, then this
income can be given to your children without inheritance tax being payable
if properly structured.' Could you please answer these questions?
1. Can such gifts out of income be made to people who are not your children?
2. Do you have to furnish proof that, in such cases, you have not exceeded
your income?
3) Do you need formal documents to make such gifts in cash? And what does
'properly structured' mean?
1. Income gifts can be made to people who are not your children.
2. The Inland Revenue might ask you to justify your claim that the payment
is made out of income and, therefore, you need evidence to show this to be
the case. Your tax return should provide the information to compute your
income and your tax payable, and you should keep a note of annual spending
in the year.
3. The gifts could be accompanied by a covering letter. It should be clear
to the recipient that this is not just a 'one off' capital gift but that you
intend to make the payments for the foreseeable future.
This reply was provided by Barry Stillerman of accountant Stoy Hayward.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: A prosperous punt - A consistent
performer in a risky area / Unit Trusts/Prosperity Emerging Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMERGING markets have become a fashionable area of investment but, for many
private investors, they will appeal only as a punt because of the risk in
investing in what are often illiquid markets. Consistency and volatility do
not usually go hand in hand but Prosperity can point to an impressive record
for the performance of its Emerging Markets fund.
The fund, launched in March 1987, is top of the international equity growth
sector in the five years to November 1 and second over three years and one
year (offer to bid with net income reinvested; source, Micropal). It has
performed well in spite of the stewardship of a series of fund managers and
other management changes.
Prosperity Unit Trusts is still owned by Municipal Mutual, the insurance
company which stopped writing new business last year, but management of the
funds was handed to Commercial Union Investment Management in April.
Roger Bade, the present fund manager, has been a fund manager at CU for the
past 10 years with responsibility for the company's UK funds and
environmental unit trust. He took over management of the Prosperity fund in
July.
With much to live up to, Bade has so far maintained the performance of the
fund, which is second over both six months and one month. Since he took it
over it has grown by almost half - from Pounds 21m to over Pounds 30m today.
This is one reason behind the rapid broadening of the fund; Bade has nearly
doubled holdings from about 40 stocks to 76.
His investment strategy is first to seek out countries with good and
sustainable growth prospects. His decision is influenced by factors such as
whether the country has support from the International Monetary Fund and the
degree to which it is open to foreign investors. He then chooses stocks by
trying to decide whether they will benefit from the growth and expansion of
those economies.
Bade is mindful of the volatility of the markets in which he invests. The
perennial problem for unit trust managers, which is magnified for an
emerging markets fund, is that if performance falters and investors want to
liquidate their holdings, the manager may need to sell holdings quickly to
meet redemptions. He therefore limits himself to large liquid stocks which
are easily traded.
The fund can invest in up to 10 per cent of other people's collective
investments and was near this limit when Bade took over its management. He
has sold holdings in collective instruments in those countries which have a
large market open to overseas investors, preferring to reserve such funds as
a way of entering attractive but illiquid markets, such as Colombia, Peru
and Vietnam.
The majority of the fund - 65 per cent - is invested in the Far East.
Currently, Bade is most interested in China. 'It is the largest and most
important emerging market and is not expensive compared with other markets.'
He believes the Chinese culture of making money and entrepreneurship is more
important than fears of the economy overheating. He thinks Hong Kong blue
chip companies may now be over-priced, but he does not hold shares in them.
Although the fund has invested in some Chinese companies directly, such as
Shanghai Petrochemicals and Shanghai Tyre and Rubber, the market is
difficult to enter. Bade has instead gained access through stocks in nearby
countries which are heavily exposed to developments in China.
Bade also favours India for its size and because its developed middle class
has a strong demand for consumer goods. The fund has 3 per cent of its
portfolio in the country and Bade says he would be happy to take this up to
5 per cent, but has been prevented from doing so because of difficulties of
access. He is not tempted to invest directly in the local market and India
funds are currently expensive.
Latin America accounts for just under 23 per cent of the fund with Mexico,
the largest and most developed market, taking the lion's share.
Nevertheless, Bade is underweight in the country, compared with the IFC
index, the oldest emerging markets index, because of continued uncertainties
over the North American Free Trade Area and falls in growth. His favourite
country in the region is Argentina, for having controlled inflation and the
prospect of 5 per cent growth next year. Inflation of roughly 35 per cent a
month in Brazil has dissuaded him from investing there.
Within Europe, Turkey's high inflation has put Bade off, in spite of that
country being one of the top performing emerging markets. He has sold two
large holdings, leaving the fund with no exposure. Portugal accounts for
most of the European holdings of the fund. Inflation fell from 15 per cent
last year to 10 per cent and interest rates have also been coming down,
which make Bade optimistic.
The top 10 holdings account for one quarter of the fund's investments. The
largest holdings are a 3.7 per cent investment in United Engineers
(Malaysia), a contractor, and a similar amount of the fund is invested in
Mexico's Grupo Sidek. Bade has not had much time to travel, relying instead
on contacts with companies passing through London and through brokers'
research. He is also backed up by a team of two Far East experts and a
Portuguese specialist.
If emerging markets are a fashion, is there not a danger that investors will
eventually sell and go elsewhere? While this is a possibility, Bade believes
that one interpretation of last week's turbulence in the world's leading
stock markets is that investors are anxious about low growth in the
developed markets. If so, the investor who wants growth will keep coming
back to emerging markets.
Similarly, Bade thinks it unlikely 'now that the genie has been let out of
the bottle' that governments will be able to reverse the privatisation
process under way in many emerging markets.
Charges. The initial charge is 6 per cent; annual management charge 1.25 per
cent. The bid offer spread is about 6 per cent. There is a 1 percentage
point discount off the initial charge until December 1. The minimum lump sum
investment is Pounds 500 and there is a monthly savings scheme with a
minimum of Pounds 10 a month. The fund does not qualify for a full Pep
allowance.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Golden future for base metals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JULIAN Baring, manager of one of the best-performing gold funds, is
broadening his horizons to take in copper, aluminium, zinc and other metals
as well as coal, iron ore, diamonds and the like. He has persuaded his
bosses at Mercury Asset Management to set up the Mercury World Mining trust,
which is to raise a minimum of Pounds 50m.
According to Baring, base metals prices are today in a similar position to
the gold price a year ago - that is, down in the depths but ready to bounce
back in a few months. Consequently, he says it is reasonable to assume that
the new trust can make an 80 to 100 per cent return on its money over the
next five years.
Base metal prices may take time to recover and he intends that MWMT
initially should be biased more heavily towards gold shares than those of
companies producing other commodities. 'Gold shares are likely to behave
better earlier and base metals shares should behave better later,' he says.
One-quarter of the fund will be available to private investors when the
public offer, sponsored by SG Warburg Securieties and Cazenove &amp; Co., is
made on November 23. The trust is offering ordinary shares at 100p each and
warrants on a one-for-five basis.
The initial net asset value will be 97p a share, indicating a 3 per cent
'joining fee.' The minimum investment will be Pounds 1,000 and the annual
management charge will be 1.25 per cent.
In spite of the diversity of the mining industry, MWMT's policy will be to
have at least half its investments by value in shares that qualify for
personal equity plans. This means investors will be able to put up to a
quarter (Pounds 1,500 at present) of each tax year's subscription limit in
MWMT shares for inclusion in a general Pep. Warrants will be traded
separately and may not be transferred into a Pep.
Baring's view of the metals business is shared by other analysts including
Euan Worthington, head of the Warburg mining team. In his recent
International Mining Outlook, Worthington suggested that many metal prices
were 'now at not only cyclical lows but at the lowest level ever in real
terms.'
He cautioned, however, about buying the shares of producers just yet because
of their 'stalwart resistance to cutting output, which means we may not have
seen the darkest hour for some metal prices in the current cycle.'

FT  13 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Countdown to Christmas - A look at
the latest investment offers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN and SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY 42 investing days remain before Christmas and fund management groups
are racing to plant their seasonal offerings before potential savers. The
fall in interest rates and the recent strength of world stock markets means
this is an ideal time for the groups to launch new funds. It does not
necessarily mean it is an ideal time for investors to buy them.
At least there is plenty of variety about the funds on offer. Five are
covered below (a sixth, the Kleinwort Second Endowment Policy Trust, is
featured on page III).
Two cover Europe, one focuses on ethical investments, one on global
utilities, and a fifth has an international portfolio including high yield
government bonds and emerging markets equities.
Investors also have a choice between unit and investment trusts. The old
rule used to be that there was little point in buying an investment trust
new issue. For a start, after allowing for expenses, you were buying the
shares at a premium.
Then, either the shares would fall quickly to a discount to asset value (in
which case, it was best to wait and buy them in the after-market) or another
trust, with a similar investment strategy, would already be available at a
discount.
For the moment, that rule does not seem to apply. Either trusts have some
unique selling point which ensures sufficent demand to prevent shares from
falling to a discount; or they have a split capital structure which, because
of the tax advantages, has a similar effect; or they issue warrants, which
compensate investors for the discount effect.
Friends Provident has both a unique selling point (the first ethical trust)
and a split capital structure. Govett has warrants and a high yield which
might create demand from Pep investors. Also, its investment combination is
something not offered by other trusts and (because of the government bond
content) would be difficult for private investors to replicate elsewhere.
For unit trusts, the launch is probably as good a time as any to buy,
especially as the managers will usually offer a discount off the initial
charge during the first few weeks.
The appeal of the European trusts might be questioned by some investors who
realise that many leading European economies are in deep recession and that
continental stock markets have recently been reaching all-time highs.
Nick Train, investment director of GT Management, points out that, while
nominal interest rates have fallen in Europe, real interest rates remain
high. He believes governments will have to cut rates further to stimulate
their economies. Then, as has happened in the UK and the US, falling rates
will lead to substantial flows of funds into equities and bonds as investors
switch out of cash.
Although the price-earnings ratio of European equities is high, Train argues
that European shares look cheap compared with other markets on a
price-to-assets and a price-to-cash flow basis.
GT also believes that most Pep investors are over-exposed to the UK and
should develop a more diversified portfolio. GT's fund will have no UK
investments at all and more than 50 per cent is in equities to comply with
Pep regulations.
Trades Union Fund Managers Ltd is also optimistic about prospects for growth
in Europe; its trust is managed by Hill Samuel. Although TUFML expects most
of the investment to be from unions, it hopes the fund will appeal to all
investors.
Shares in TUFML are owned by the TUUT Charitable Trust, and a proportion of
management profits from the TU British fund are paid into the trust to be
used for charitable purposes.
Those who invest in the European Trust through TUFML can sign an income
mandate so that the yield on their investment is donated to the Labour
party. There are plans under way to arrange a similar mandate for donations
to charity.
The Global Utilities trust is not technically a new fund but the re-launch
of Gartmore's UK and International trust. It is the first in the field and
makes a lot of sense; one problem with UK-only utility funds is their
vulnerability to a change in the regulatory climate.
That risk is diversified by investing internationally; the downside for
investors who seek income is that the yield is far less than on UK utility
funds.
*****
Name. TU European Trust
Aims. To provide capital growth over the medium term through investment in
large and medium sized companies quoted on European stock markets, including
the UK.
Yield. 4 per cent gross.
Minimum investment. Pounds 1,000, or Pounds 50 per month.
Charges. 4 per cent initial and 0.875 per cent annual.
Pepable? Yes, at no extra cost.
Comment. This is only the second trust launched by TU Managers and it comes
some 30 years after the launch of its TU British trust. Charges on the fund
are noticeably lower than the industry average.
The manager for both funds is Hill Samuel. The performance of TU British was
above average in the 10 years to November 1 and in the year to November 1,
according to Micropal but below average over the five and three-year
periods. Hill Samuel envisages some 30 per cent of the fund being invested
in the UK. Investment policy will be influenced by Trades Union Congress and
Labour party views.
*****
Name. Govett High Income Investment Trust.
Aims. To provide a high level of income with the potential for capital and
income growth by investing internationally.
Yield. 7 per cent gross, paid quarterly.
Minimum investment. Pounds 1,000.
Charges. The annual management charge will be 1 per cent. The costs of the
issue will be 4.8 per cent.
Terms. Shares are on offer at 100p, with warrants attached on a one-for-five
basis.
Pepable? Yes, at no extra charge for those who apply through the offer.
There is a Pounds 25 charge on sales of shares.
Comment. An unusual mix of UK equities, high yielding bonds and emerging
markets shares.
The idea is that the bonds provide the yield, the emerging market shares
produce capital growth and the UK equities offer a little bit of both.
This is not a trust for first time investors, but one for income-seeking
savers who are prepared to take a risk.
*****
Name. Friends Provident Ethical Investment Trust.
Aims. To offer an attractive yield, combined with the prospect of capital
growth by investing in UK equities, selected in accordance with Friends
Provident's ethical guidelines.
Terms. A combination of ordinary shares and zeros. Payment is in two
instalments - 60p upfront and a further 40p (on the ordinaries) and 43p (on
the zeros) in February 1994.
Yield. 8 per cent (in the form of income) on the ordinaries and 8 per cent
(in the form of capital growth) on the zeros.
Minimum investment. Pounds 1,000.
Charges. Issue expenses of under 4 per cent, annual charge of less than 1
per cent.
Pepable? Yes, at no extra charge.
Comment. The past has shown that investors do not necessarily sacrifice
profits if they follow their principles and Friends Provident is a
specialist in the field. The zeros represent a low risk option for the
cautious with a conscience.
*****
Name. GT European Equity &amp; Bond Fund.
Aims. To capitalise on the recovery in European equity and bond markets,
whilst providing investors with a high income.
Yield. 4.25 per cent gross, paid twice a year.
Minimum investment. Pounds 1,000.
Charges. Initial 5 per cent, annual 1 per cent.
Special terms. A 1 per cent discount until November 26.
Pepable? Yes. the initial charge on a GT Pep is just 4 per cent (however,
the launch discount does not apply).
Comment. GT already has a European unit trust which has a fairly good
performance record for its sector.
It is 4th (out of 15) funds over the 10 years to November 1 and 18th (out of
128) funds over the one year period. Growth over the two periods was 393.5
per cent and 32.7 per cent respectively.
The balanced nature of the fund provides some comfort to those who feel that
stock markets are too high, but who want more attractive investment returns
than can be provided by cash.
*****
Name. Gartmore Global Utilities Fund.
Aims. To provide a mixture of income and capital growth by investing in
world utility companies, such as electricity and telecom groups.
Yield. 3 per cent gross.
Minimum investment. Pounds 1,000, or Pounds 20 per month.
Charges. 5.25 per cent initial and 1.5 per cent annual.
Special terms. A 2 per cent bonus allocation of units during the promotional
period, until the end of January.
Pepable? Yes, at no extra charge. At least 50 per cent of the portfolio will
be in UK and European utility companies.
Comment. Utilities make up around 12 per cent of the FT-A World Index and
they tend to be fairly stable stocks with good dividend yields. They are
also important in emerging stock markets. With a number of UK utilities
funds already in existence, Gartmore is restructuring its UK and
International fund to fill an obvious market niche. Chances are it will be a
solid fund, featuring neither at the top nor the bottom of performance
tables.

ALPE D'HUEZ
Alpe d'Huez epitomises French skiing at its best: it has modern, spacious,
fast-moving gondolas and a large, sunny, arena of enormously varied skiing
with half a dozen different areas containing everything from dramatic
off-piste, long steep black runs, swooping motorway skiing and gentle
nursery slopes. The focal point is the Pic Blanc from which gloriously long
off-piste itineraries right down to the village can be attempted. There are
also off-piste runs of unusual quality down to villages like Oz en Oisans
and Vaujany.
The Pic Blanc is the starting point for some of the longest black runs in
the Alps, including the Sarenne, which is 10 miles long. La Combe du Loup is
another tough, long black run with an even tougher variant, the Chateau
Noir. Skiers chasing derring-do slopes should hire a guide and try the Col
de la Pyramide. The Signal area - linked with Villard-Reculas - is
magnificent terrain for intermediates who want fast cruising in wide open
spaces.
Heights: Resort 6,068 ft. Skiing 4,428 - 10,889 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Beginner 35 per cent; Intermediate 52 per cent; Advanced
13 per cent.
Transfer: 2+ hours from Lyon or Geneva, 1+ hours from Grenoble. 572 miles
from Calais.
LES DEUX ALPES/LA GRAVE
There can be few more contrasting resorts than these neighbouring ski areas
either side of the mighty Meije (13,065 ft) in France. Les Deux Alpes is
conveyor belt skiing: lifts whirr and hum like a busy factory and the Jandry
express 20-person gondola and the Dome Express funicular carry thousands of
skiers, a substantial number of them British, to the bleak but widely spread
slopes on the Glacier du Mont de Lans. La Grave is a pretty climbing village
perched on the Col de Lautaret, an extraordinarily beautiful steep-sided
mountain pass which links Grenoble with Serre Chevalier and Briancon.
Les Deux Alps is full of good but rather soulless skiing. Some of the easier
slopes are high on the glacier. This makes the resort exiting for novices,
who can ski on the roof of their world until the last run of the day when
they must either face steep and narrower lower slopes above the village or
descend by mechanical means. It's a long way down] The vertical drop of over
7,500 ft is one of the highest in the Alps.
The scenery is rugged but it becomes even more dramatic if you make the 10
minute walk to the inter-connecting lifts with the La Grave slopes on the
other side of the glacier. This vast, ungroomed expanse of glacial
wilderness is served by five linked gondolas which seem, when viewed from
the road, to be journeying to the very heavens. Over the years La Grave has
attracted skiers enthralled by its breathtaking scenery, savage and remote
beauty and huge vertical drop. The terrain is much steeper than the glacier
runs on the Deux Alpes side, and should only be attempted with a guide.
There are several routes down, all spectacular and all gruelling, though not
really extreme. Unmissable for the serious off-piste skier.
Heights: 2 Alpes 5,445 ft. La Grave 4,756 ft. Skiing 11,775 ft
Difficulty of runs: 2 Alpes: Beginner 30 per cent; Intermediate 61 per cent;
Advanced 9 per cent. La Grave: No grooming below 10,500 ft, where terrain is
100 per cent Higher Intermediate/Advanced.
Transfer: 3 hours from Lyon or Geneva, 1+ hours from Grenoble 580 miles from
Calais.
ANDERMATT
Whatever happened to Andermatt? Or rather what happened to the British who
used to ski there? Once the archetypal Swiss resort - pretty village,
delightful tea-rooms, rushing river, terrific mountain (Gemsstock) and good
nursery slopes at Natschen/Stockli and Hospental - it was a popular
destination with the British in the 1960s and '70s. It's still the same -
except British tour operators don't go there any more. Nowadays the only
British skiers you are likely to find there are those who fell in love with
the place years ago and still make their own way there, and the small band
of skiers who will know it as a magnificent ski-touring centre.
Fashions change. But the stay-away British didn't cause the resort much
alarm because it has one major guaranteed customer: the Swiss army. They do
much of their mountain training there, and Andermatt - in a sunny valley
just north of the St Gotthard Pass - has never really needed to up-grade its
skiing facilities to compete with big tourist centres like Verbier or
Zermatt. The Gemsstock (almost 10,000 ft) is a challenging mountain with
some wonderful scenery and long off-piste runs back down to Andermatt (5,000
vertical ft). Take a guide]
Heights: Resort 4,738 ft. Skiing 9,842 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Beginner 29 per cent; Intermediate 30 per cent; Advanced
41 per cent.
Transfer: 3 hours 20 minutes from Zurich. Rail station in resort. 504 miles
from Calais.
ST ANTON
An outstanding resort for skiing and scenery, St Anton in Austria has four
ski areas and is also on the same lift pass as Lech and Zurs, a short bus
ride away. The most challenging area is the Valuga, networked with wonderful
red runs and testing blacks. And for those with nerves of steel there is a
little-known route down to Zurs via the North Face, accessed by a small
yellow cablecar in which you can only travel if accompanied by a
high-mountain guide. The initial descent is quite severe, but afterwards the
run continues in more relaxing style with off-piste terrain of the highest
quality in powder.
Some of the lifts in St Anton, such as the Schindlerspitze, seem to have
been constructed in mind-bogglingly difficult but awe-inspiringly beautiful
terrain. This lift takes you soaring over jagged ridges and steep, seemingly
unskiable couloirs (they are occasionally skied by ski-extreme specialists)
with what seems to be the whole of the Vorarlberg alps spread out in a
breathtaking panorama. Although St Anton is a happy hunting-ground for
strong intermediates and experts there is plenty for the more cautious
skier. The town meanders alongside the main line from Switzerland to Italy
(you can travel home from the slopes on the Venice-Simplon Orient Express)
and although far from charmless, is too towny to be picture-postcard.
Heights: Resort 4,210 ft. Skiing 9,222 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Beginner 30 per cent; Intermediate 52 per cent; Advanced
18 per cent.
Transfer: 3-plus hours from Zurich, station in St Anton. 606 miles from
Calais.
ARGENTIERE/CHAMONIX
Argentiere in France is the ultimate off-piste paradise: many keen skiers
regard the Grands Montets as the best ski mountain in Europe, particularly
in powder. If you ski the top section you are on the glacier and there is a
danger from crevasses. If you plan to ski it properly, a guide will
considerably enhance your chances of skiing safely and pleasurably. If you
are worried about crevasses, but do not want to hire a guide, make sure you
keep to the marked trails - or only ski the lower half of the mountain below
the ice line.
One of the highlights is the possibility of venturing - at your guide's
discretion - into the edge of the Argentiere Glacier. There are places near
the Point de Vue where you can ski a little way through the surreal,
dreamlike ice-scape of seracs - a sort of petrified forest of ice-blocs. The
challenging Pas de Chevre (Goat's Hop) is one of Europe's classics, leading
down to the Mer de Glace, a dramatic glacier that forms a border between the
skiing at Argentiere and the Vallee Blanche, Chamonix's best known run.
This is a spectacular and quite gruelling off-piste descent although the
skiing itself is not difficult. (There are much more testing variants). It
enables intermediates to enjoy one of the longest (13 miles) and most scenic
off-piste adventures without having to worry too much about technique. But a
guide is important because of crevasse danger.
For less intrepid skiers, any one of the many other ski areas dotted around
the spectacular Chamonix Valley - such as Brevent, Flegere and Les Houches -
offer good all-round slopes.
Heights: Argentiere: Resort 4067 ft. Skiing 10,824 ft. Chamonix: Resort 3280
ft. Skiing 12,431 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Argentiere: On piste, Beginner 10 per cent; Intermediate
70 per cent; Advanced 20 per cent. Off Piste 100 per cent Intermediate and
advanced. Chamonix: Beginner: 40 per cent; Intermediate 48 per cent;
Advanced 12 per cent.
Transfer: 1-plus hours from Geneva. Train station in Chamonix. 562 miles
from Calais.
THE ASPENS
The big news about Aspen this year is the acquisition of the resort's
nearest neighbour, Aspen Highlands. Absorbing its rival gives Aspen four ski
mountains and greatly enhances its claim to be America's Number One ski
resort - a far cry from its tatty beginnings when the early miners shivered
in the camp that was once called Ute City.
This year sees the 100th anniversary of the legislation that ruined Aspen
and other silver-mining towns: the US government dropped the silver standard
and Aspen went bust.
Today Aspen is described as Hollywood on Ice. Even its location - in Roaring
Fork Valley - sounds more like a TV soap opera than real life. But the
skiing is great, especially with the addition of Highlands, a run-down
resort with antiquated lifts but superb skiing. Aspen itself has 75
picturesque trails squeezed into a fairly steep forested mountain served by
a fast, modern gondola, the Silver Queen. Many are fast cruising runs like
Copper Bowl, Spar Gulch and the exhilarating Ruthie's: others are short,
steep double-diamond (extra-difficult) mogul chutes, such as Zaugg Dump and
Lost Dollar, some of which were made by miners shovelling debris down the
slopes as they tunnelled into the mountain.
Bell Mountain - almost a mountain within a mountain - is mainly mogulfields
and skiing in the trees. There is good snowcat skiing on the back of Aspen
mountain. Highlands has the highest skiing - some would say the best - and
with its view of the stunning Maroon Bells range, the best scenery.
The chutes, moguls and tree skiing on both sides of the ridge around
Steeplechase and Olympic Bowl are outstanding, and one steep trail,
Deception, is so called because it starts steep and gets even steeper.
Tiehack-Buttermilk is ideal for beginners, but it has secret powder caches
where you might find a few wise skiers who have drifted across from Aspen.
Snowmass, although a lot less fashionable than Aspen, has more ski visitors
than the other three resorts put together. A vast intermediate playground,
Snowmass is famous for its Big Burn area, which comprises several runs which
virtually merge to form one huge trail as much as a mile across in places.
It also has some severe chutes off The Cirque and steep tree skiing in the
Hanging Valley Glades. Unlike Aspen, Snowmass also has some excellent
nursery slopes.
But there is only one Aspen: the atmosphere is fun, the town is pretty and
the natives are actually quite friendly. Aspen has had to own up to a little
'fat cat' arrogance in the past that alienated some of its clients. It
realised, none too soon, that skiers did not owe the town a living, and so
to ensure their continued custom, Aspen has spent more on updating its lift
systems and ski infrastructure.
The main skiing is on Ajax mountain, and the place to be afterwards is
Schlomo's, at the back of the Little Nell hotel. The sundeck at the bottom
of Ajax is a favourite place for skiers relaxing with apres-ski drinks to
the sound of reverberating heavy metal music. The Little Nell's big rival,
the Ritz Carlton, opened last year in a blaze of publicity, leaving the
Jerome to cater for clients who prefer the quaint and the historic to the
last word in luxury.
Heights: Resort: 7,945 ft. Skiing: 11,212 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Beginner 0 per cent; Intermediate 35 per cent; Advanced
65 per cent.
Aspen Highlands: Resort: 8,000 ft. Skiing: 11,800 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Beginner 23 per cent; Intermediate 48 per cent; Advanced
29 per cent.
Snowmass: Resort: 8,220 ft. Skiing: 11,835 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Beginner 9 per cent; Intermediate 51 per cent; Advanced
40 per cent.
Tiehack-Buttermilk: Resort: 7,870 ft. Skiing 9,900 ft.
Difficulty of runs: All beginner/Intermediate.
Transfer: Aspen 204 miles from Denver local airport.
AVORIAZ
Of all the purpose-built French purpose-built resorts, Avoriaz, with its
space-age architecture, is arguably the most exiting. It is a little
reminiscent of the pulsating, futuristic city in the classic film
Metropolis. In sunshine it has a colourful Riviera flavour, but during one
of its rather surreal white-outs, the mist-shrouded tower blocks of
apartments pierce the heavens like some Martian film set, giving it a
sinister and surrealistic quality. This can be chillingly appropriate when
they stage the annual festival of 'Films Fantastiques]'
Avoriaz is the jewel in the crown of the vast Portes Du Soleil region, a
circuit which takes in more than a dozen resorts along the French-Swiss
border. It is also the location for one of the classic decents - the
Chavanette, or Swiss Wall - down into Les Crosets. The wall has a fairly
fearful reputation. It is in fact a very unforgiving long and steep mogul
field, where it is easy to fall, but not normally terribly dangerous except
for the problem of falling skiers crashing into others. It is usually closed
when conditions are seriously unpleasant. In fresh snow, there are
alternative routes to the left which are more enjoyable and less dangerous.
Avoriaz and the rest of the Portes du Soleil provide endless terrain for
average-to-good skiers and the opportunity to enjoy the satisfaction of
skiing from one resort to another. Conversely, off piste enthusiasts who
prefer quality to quantity will have a treat if they can find the secret
powder fields off the Ripaille above Champery's Grand Paradis area. Rather
than perpetually skiing to the next horizon, they will want to stay and ski
the powder out.
Heights: Resort 5,904 ft. Skiing 7,743 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Beginner 18 per cent; Intermediate 66 per cent; Advanced
18 per cent.
Transfer: 2+ hours from Geneva. 555 miles from Calais.
BARILOCHE
Half way down the vast length of the magnificent Andes, close to Lake Nahuel
Huapi, the Argentine city of San Carlos de Bariloche has a decidedly
cosmopolitan feel about it. Bariloche's ski area at Gran Catedral is South
America's biggest and oldest mechanised ski resort. The city of Bariloche is
12 miles from the slopes (there is a regular bus service) but there are
lodging facilities at the resort base.
Since the city's beginnings almost a century ago, when German settlers
started trading here, other travellers from all over Europe have followed,
and European-style chalets are common. Although the season normally runs
from early June until early October, Bariloche's snow record is not
outstanding, either for quantity or quality. With a maximum elevation of
6,725 ft and a fairly warm winter climate, the slopes tend to experience
snow that is heavy and soft. But with 32 lifts and 50 runs, it is a
significant resort. Most of the runs are intermediate, but advanced skiers
will be able to enjoy high-speed cruising on the upper slopes. Bariloche,
with eight FIS approved runs, is Argentina's principal racing centre.
Heights: Resort 3,378 ft. Skiing 6,725 ft.
Transfer: 12 miles from Bariloche. 1048 miles from Buenos Aires.
BIG SKY
Montana is rarely mentioned in skiing circles outside the Rockies, but it
has 13 small but often spectacular resorts including Big Sky. The resort has
some dramatic terrain - steep bowls and chutes - and is often used by ski
extreme enthusiasts for derring-do videos. Its annual snow record - 400 in -
is also well above average. Now that the resort is starting to be
'discovered' by outsiders, it is busily adding lifts at the rate of almost
one a year. One of the latest, a high-speed quad called Ram Charger which
speeds you from bottom to top of Andesite Mountain in under five minutes,
gives you a fairly unequivocal flavour of the kind of ambiance the resort
exudes] And Challenger Lift, on Lone Mountain, is for experts only.
The nearby resort of Bridger Bowl is also building up a reputation as a cult
resort for powder fanatics. But beginners should not despair: in spite of
Big Sky's machismo image, they should be able to manage 20 per cent of the
trails. If they can't, there's not a lot else to do, but they could take a
trip to Yellowstone nearby.
Heights: Resort 6,970 ft. Skiing 10,900 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Beginner 20 per cent; Intermediate 50 per cent; Advanced
30 per cent.
Transfer: 45 miles from Bozeman.
BLUE RIVER
Blue River - half way between Kamloops and Jasper - is a small railway town
in the middle of British Columbia's mountain wilderness where the Canadian
National trains howl all night and heli-skiers whoop all day on runs like
Yukon Jack, Smokey Ridge, Sparkey's, Cobra and even Two Titties. It is the
headquarters of Mike Wiegele Heliskiing, Canadian Mountain Holidays' only
serious rival in the Canadian Rockies. Wiegele operates along a 4,000 square
mile area of the Monashees (rugged, glaciated, treeless) and Cariboos (tree
skiing) on the shores of Lake Eleanor, 370 miles from Vancouver. You can do
the entire journey by train, but there are only two a week.
Like CMH's rival operation in Revelstoke, basing heli-skiing in a town
enables skiers to come and go for the odd couple of days or so rather than
be committed to an entire week in a lodge. The skiing is excellent even when
snow conditions are not perfect: Wiegele's guides (there are usually two
with every group of 10 skiers) have a knack of teasing out good runs, come
what may. A word of warning though. Says Wiegele: 'No refunds are given if
you are unable to keep up or it is too difficult.' In practice this hardly
ever happens.
Heights: Resort ft. Skiing 10,500 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Heliskiing off-piste. All Intermediate/Advanced.
Transfer: 370 miles from Vancouver. (There is a special Wiegele Greyhound
service from Kamloops, 140 miles).
COURMAYEUR
On a superficial level, Courmayeur in Italy is a smallish resort above an
attractive, medium sized town with a big cable car - somewhat lacking in
breadth and vertical drop, though there is quite a testing 12 kilometre run
down to Dolonne. There are one or two reasonably challenging runs at
Checrouit/Cresta d'Arp - and some inspiring scenery. It's the scenery that
gives a clue to one big gun the resort has up its sleeve: Mont Blanc. Thanks
to a staggering feat of engineering, this great hulk of a mountain
overlooking Courmayeur's slopes brings all kinds of interesting
possibilities into play.
The Italian version of the famous 18-kilometre Vallee Blanche off-piste
excursion is achieved by taking three cable cars from Entreves. Elsewhere,
there is some goodish helicopter skiing to be had around Courmayeur and at
nearby Valgrisensche. Epicurians will be fascinated with a different sort of
Entreves challenge - how to consume a 36-course meal at the Maison de
Filippo. The trick is not to hog the early courses and pace yourself - a
difficult achievement if you come off the slopes ravenous after a good day's
skiing. Courmayeur is good-food country, with excellent restaurants both on
and off the slopes. One major snag - you can't ski back to town. Unless you
want to bother to be picked up by car on the village outskirts, there is
only one way down: back in the big cable-car.
Heights: Resort 4,015 ft. Skiing 9,843 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Easy 44 per cent; Intermediate 44 per cent; Advanced 12
per cent.
Transfer: 2 hours from Geneva or Turin. 575 miles from Calais.
CORTINA
Italy's Cortina has stunning scenery (used extensively as pretend-Colorado
in Sylvester Stallone's movie Cliffhanger) and self-indulgent visitors. It
also has so many fur coats that
Aspen, its real Colorado equivalent, seems like a bastion of Greenpeace by
comparison. The possibilities of apres ski at this former Olympic resort
come so early - around noon - that some people go straight to the apres
without bothering with the ski. Many visitors have not the slightest
intention of skiing anyway, and the number of people on the slopes often
seems to bear this out.
By early afternoon, long before the sun dips behind the Dolomites, enhancing
their naturally pink hue, the main pedestrian precinct, the Corso Italia, is
crowded with people wearing the inevitable jewellery and furs. But
surprisingly few visitors seem to find their way to the slopes the following
morning. Having spent the later part of the evening in discos and
nightclubs, they may feel that actually skiing is asking too much.
The slopes are largely intermediate and widely spread out in beautiful
surroundings. Faloria, which links with Cristallo/Staunies, an exhilarating,
quite steep but wide gully, is easily accessible from the town, and
therefore one of the most popular. Tofana, Pocol and Socrepes are also
linked. Some of the more testing skiing is at Cinque Tori and Lagazuoi and
the upper section of Cristallo. Cortina is also part of the vast Dolomiti
Super Ski area which can be skied with one lift pass, which also enables you
to ski in some Austrian resorts.
Heights: Resort 4,078 ft. Skiing 10,543 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Beginner/Early Intermediate 64 per cent; Intermediate 20
per cent; Advanced 16 per cent.
Transfer: 2+ hours from Treviso. 834 miles from Calais.
CRANS MONTANA
Crans Montana is a sun-drenched, wide-open picturesque and rather expensive
Swiss ski resort perched above the Rhone Valley - roughly mid-way between
the Matterhorn and Mont Blanc - where you can ski fast and furiously with
great gusto in a giant, largely treeless arena which contains a hundred
miles of pistes. Like Bormio in 1985, Crans Montana took advantage of the
world championships in 1987 to modernise its lift systems, tripling the
number of skiers the resort can transport to its three main ski areas: Les
Violettes-Plaine Morte, Cry d'Err-Bella Lui and Aminona-Petit Bonvin. But
apart from a handful of black runs, it has rather a lack of seriously
testing slopes.
One of the most spectacular is the Faverge off-piste run from the very top
of the ski area at Plaine Morte (the 9,840 ft glacier from where Arnold Lunn
launched the nine-mile long precursor of the Kandahar race) all the way down
to the neighbouring resort of Aminona - a vertical drop of almost 5,000 ft.
Crans, the posher of the two, with most of the smart boutiques, and Montana,
the older and more rustic, have merged and now form what is claimed to be
the largest ski resort in Switzerland. The resort is reputed to have more

CRESTED BUTTE
For a former ma-and-pa ski hill, this Colorado resort has a lot of bright
ideas as well as some of the best beginner-intermediate trails and most
testing back-country slopes in the Rockies. It has already made a big name
for itself by offering free skiing for the first four weeks of the season
for the last three years. Now the former mining town is offering new skiers
their money back this winter if they haven't learned to ski from the top of
the Keystone lift to the bottom after a special two-day learn-to-ski
package.
Crested Butte is something of a Jekyll and Hyde resort, although the Hyde
section - dramatic terrain called the Extreme Limits - lurks out of harm's
way above the normal ski area. Families and intermediates gliding around on
much less daunting slopes below need never be aware of the thrills and
terrors of the terrain around the North Face and recently opened Headwall.
Like Steamboat, Crested Butte (a butte is a solitary mountain) has an
attractive old wild-west town - scarcely more than a village - a mile from
the ski resort. It is colourful and rustic, with quaint old bars hotels and
shops all snuggling up together and a delightful frontier town atmosphere in
a remote corner of Colorado. Winters used to be hard for miners gouging
anthracite, silver and gold out of the ground. Now they are good for skiers.
Heights: Resort 9,100 ft. Skiing 11,400 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Beginner 29 per cent; Intermediate 53 per cent; Advanced
18 per cent.
Transfer: 230 miles from Denver.
THE CAUCASUS
'As much salmon, caviar, vodka and Russian specialities as you can eat and
drink' - and then there's the helicopter skiing. As much as you can afford?
This is heliskiing in the Caucasus mountains close to the Black Sea as
offered by Yak and Yeti, the specialist high mountain guide company in
Chamonix which has a programme at Krasnaya Poliana near Sotchi. Skiing in
the Caucasus used to be - and in some resorts probably still is - a fairly
primitive affair with ancient lift equipment that frequently broke down and
spilt drops of oil on your ski-suit. It was another Caucasus resort,
Guadauri, which changed all that. The Austrians built a new hotel complex
there and installed state-of-the-art Doppelmayer lifts. The Georgians added
a couple of rather ponderous, unwieldy and ancient ex-military Mia
helicopters and the scene was set for an exciting new ski resort.
Then the problems started. Two helicopters were involved in separate
incidents, killing one young Austrian guide and seriously injuring a flight
technician and two Austrian tourists. Better helicopters have been
introduced, but because of the unsettled regime in Tbilisi the situation is
unpredictable. However, when the dust settles Guadauri should be the
showpiece of the Caucasus.
Heights: Resort 6,600 ft. Skiing 10,913 ft (up to 13,200 ft with
helicopter).
Difficulty of runs: Easy 46 per cent; Intermediate 38 per cent; Advanced 16
per cent. Heli-skiing: 100 per cent Intermediate/Advanced
Transfer: 2+ hours from Tblisi.
DAVOS/KLOSTERS
The British have been coming to Davos since the 19th century - originally to
enjoy the climate: hence the resort's claim to be the 'cradle of skiing'. It
is also the highest ski town in Europe and Switzerland's largest ski resort.
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who brought his wife here to convalesce, made a
historic ski-tour with local guides across the mountains to Arosa. Sprawling
pleasantly along a picturesque valley in eastern Switzerland there is little
of the cowbell-and-yodelling flavour associated with a traditional Swiss
resort.
The five skiing areas are considerably spread out. Only the famous Parsenn
area and Schatzalp-Strelapass are linked, and it is well to have a car,
although there are trains and buses. The Parsenn is a huge network of runs
almost the size of Manhattan including one excursion all the way from the
Weissfluhjoch to Kublis, 14 kilometres away. The Jakobshorn provides good
skiing and there are testing off-piste runs on the back of Rinerhorn.
It is difficult to escape the influence of the Prince of Wales in Klosters,
a pretty but now slightly sprawling Swiss resort. He was almost killed in an
avalanche here, and the cable car to the Gotschnagrat slopes close to where
it happened is named after him. The Gotschnawang is not quite the terror it
is made out to be. What makes it dangerous is not the difficulty but its
proneness to avalanche. The Gotschnagrat is effectively a major flank of the
adjoining Davos skiing area. There are several routes down to Klosters from
the Parsenn area. Skiers of most grades can make the descent using one route
or another but the most challenging is Drostobel. On the other side are the
sunny, wide open slopes of Madrisa.
Heights: Davos 3,706 ft; Klosters 5,116 ft. Skiing: 9,328 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Beginner 29 per cent; Intermediate 41 per cent; Advanced
30 per cent.
Transfer: 3 hours from Zurich. Other airport Basle. Rail station in Davos.
626 miles from Calais.
FLAINE
Traditionally Flaine has always borne the brunt of criticism over
purpose-built French resorts, with claims that it is 'even uglier' than
Tignes, Les Menuires or the worst excesses of La Plagne. But much as La
Plagne started doing some years ago, Flaine is now building any fresh
accommodation in a much gentler, 'sympa' style. Hence the new Le Hameau
development just two kilometres away from the original, rather charmless,
concrete village centre at Flaine Foret. The new timber chalets are
delightful. They have balconies, sloping roofs and look far more like the
kind of buildings one would prefer to find in the mountains.
Ugly or not, Flaine is a great favourite with British skiers, and the resort
is celebrated for its children's facilities. Only 90 minutes or so from
Geneva, the Grand Massif area has a lot of honest-to-goodness skiing with
some unusually good off-piste (guide de rigeur because some of the off-piste
areas are honeycombed with pot-holes and there one or two dangerous cliffs
around too.) Though most of Flaine's skiing is above the tree-line, there
are some delightful runs through the trees down to the more traditional
villages of Samoens and Les Carroz.
Heights: Resort 5,250 ft. Skiing 8,150 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Beginner 7 per cent; Intermediate 77 per cent; Advanced
16 per cent.
Transfer: 2 hours from Geneva. (Other airport: Lyon) 548 miles from Calais.
THE GASTEIN VALLEY
This is one of those major Austrian ski areas like Ischgl that still does
not seem to have entered the consciousness of many British skiers, which is
something of a mystery. There are so many Gasteins in this beautiful
Salzburger land valley - from the pretty village of Dorfgastein at 2,755 ft
to the chillier slopes of Sportgastein with skiing up to 8,800 ft on the
Kreuzkogel - that it is less confusing just to call it the Gastein Valley.
The skiing is spread out across wide-open and sunny slopes with a lot of
quite easy off-piste terrain. The toughest runs are off the Stubnerkogel and
Kreuzkogel at Sportgastein - the highest and most snow-sure of the Gasteins
 -and on the wooded slopes of the Graugogel on the other side of the valley
above Badgastein.
The Schlossalm, a large bowl above the tree line, provides most of Bad
Hofgastein's skiing. Bad Hofgastein is is between Dorf, with its friendly,
tree-clad slopes on the valley floor, and Sportgastein. The most interesting
of all is Badgastein, famous as a spa resort for 600 years, which clings to
a steep hillside, through which the River Ache bubbles and cascades. Over
the years kings, emperors, heads of state and all kinds of celebrities have
come here to ease their aches and pains and try and fend off advancing age
and even impotence - but not to ski. Badgastein's public swimming pool - one
of the largest in Austria - is heated naturally by thermal waters which also
provides hot water for some of the local hotels.
Heights: Bad Hofgastein 2,853 ft; Badgastein 3,608 ft. Skiing: 8,812 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Easy 24 per cent; Intermediate 66 per cent; Advanced 10
per cent.
Transfer: 1 1/2 hours from Salzburg, 2 hours from Linz or Munich. 763 miles
from Calais.
GSTAAD
The good news is that Gstaad is back in the Which? Good Skiing Guide, the
skier's Bible. It was churlishly axed for one edition but the new editors
have done the decent thing and rescued it from the ashes. There is however,
a problem: although it may be true that in Gstaad 'every guest is a king;
but kings are only guests', it does not apply on the the slopes. Skiers here
are not kings. Occasionally they are even paupers. In spite of being one of
the great 'in-places' to ski, Gstaad has an indifferent snow record and
rather unexciting skiing, rescued only by being part of the much bigger
Gstaad Superski region. There are some quite decent runs on the Wasserngrat,
close to the resort's famous Eagle Club - perhaps the most expensive and
exclusive luncheon club in the world - and parts of the Wispile are testing.
Fortunately Gstaad can share the glory of a whole network of satellite
resorts such as Saanenmoser and Videmanette, above Rougemont. Because of its
reputation as a trendy place in which to be seen, this is a very fortunate
arrangement that spares its blushes as a ski resort. At around 3,500 ft,
Gstaad is quite low, but it is fortunate to have the Diablerets Glacier
reasonably close to hand. Here, at 10,000 ft, there is excellent skiing. And
when the snow is limited in Gstaad, the glacier can be a godsend, although
it is prone to be shut in bad weather.
Heights: Resort 3,308 ft. Skiing 6,461 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Easy 42 per cent; Intermediate 45 per cent; Advanced 13
per cent.
Transfer: 2 1/2 hours from Geneva. Station in resort. 533 miles from Calais.
GULMARG
Of the handful of ski resorts in the wild and relatively unknown Himalayas,
seven thousand miles from the UK, such as Shimla, Narkandar and Auli, only
Gulmarg in Kashmir is known to British skiers and even that at present has
severe drawbacks. There is very little for intermediates. Either you pootle
around on the beginner slopes or you go to the other extreme and take a leap
into the unknown and try helicopter skiing. There is nothing much in
between.
The long-awaited and much-discussed cable car up to the nearest mountain,
Aparwat, is now half finished, but sporadic fighting in Srinagar has made
the resort dangerous to get to. But once the cable-car is up and running the
skiing in Gulmarg - an old British Army hill station - should be
transformed. Although this is India, you will find a hot-water bottle in
your bed, a charcoal-burning stove being lit by your 'room-boy' and the note
in your fact sheet saying: 'During the winter the temperature is almost
identical to that of the Alps.' Since the skiing ranges from 8,700 ft to
more than 12,000 ft, this is hardly surprising. The heli-skiing is run by
the Swiss-born ski extreme specialist Sylvain Saudan, who claims there are
perhaps 2,000 runs within reach of Srinagar.
Heights: Resort 8,954 ft. Skiing 12,000 ft.
Difficult of runs: Gulmarg 100 per cent Beginner/Early Intermediate.
Heliskiing 100 per cent Off-piste: Intermediate/Advanced.
Transfer: Unpredictable because of unstable political situation. Normally
one hour by air from Delhi to Srinagar. Gulmarg is 35 miles by road from
Srinagar. Helicopter link normally available.
HAPPO ONE
While Norway puts the finishing touches to preparations for next February's
Winter Olympics at Lillehammer, plans are well under way for the next winter
games in Japan - in spite of last winter's farcical Alpine Championships.
This charming and impressive ski resort in the Japan Alps has been chosen to
host the 1998 Winter Olympics with Shiga Kogen. Happo One - pronounced
'Hap-pony' - is one of the few resorts in Japan capable of staging a decent
Men's Downhill. It is the best of a string of resorts in the spectacular
Hakuba Valley, where the mountains are real mountains, unlike some of the
rounded hilltops that pass for mountains in some parts of Japan. Although
individually they are nothing to shout about, if you are going to the Hakuba
Valley to ski Happo One, it is well worth spending a few hours at the
neighbouring areas of Sunalpina Sanosaka, Goryu Toomi, Hakuba 47, Iwataka
and Hakuba Minekata. The village of Happo One - a maze of attractive narrow
streets with colourful quasi-European shops and bars - is most attractive,
although skiers on foot and two-way traffic causes severe congestion after
the lifts have closed. Every resort in the valley has a fire festival - each
on a different date - when instructors carrying fiery torches give a
breathtaking display of synchronised skiing under floodlights. Some of them
leap through blazing hoops, while at the bottom of the mountain, enthralled
crowds munch on squids-on-a-stick to the accompaniment of hypnotic tribal
drumming.
Heights: Resort 3,053 ft. Skiing 6,005 ft.
Difficulty of run: Easy 30 per cent; Intermediate 50 per cent; Advanced 20
per cent.
Transfer: 4 hours from Tokyo by train.
INNSBRUCK
The beautiful Tyrolean capital of Innsbruck itself is not really a ski
resort as such (although some Americans think it is) but it is surrounded by
dramatic mountains and a lot of good skiing - five satellite resorts with 65
miles of runs altogether, served by 35 lifts. All are linked by bus, but a
car is a better bet. Innsbruck staged the Winter Olympics in 1964 and in
1976, when Franz Klammer stormed to glory in the downhill at Igls. You can
ski the 2.4 mile course from the Patscherkofel and compare notes]
The most testing local skiing is at Hungerburg where the challenging
Hafelkar slopes are the big attraction. From the Hungerburg plateau there is
an exceptional view across the city and a very severe descent back to the
outskirts of Innsbruck which should be attempted only by experts. Five miles
from Innsbruck is Axams, where the Olympic slalom events and the women's
downhill were staged at Axamer-Lizum, which itself has 20 miles of skiing.
There are some quite challenging runs at Igls-Patscherkofel. Tulfes, almost
eight miles from Innsbruck, has some good off-piste terrain: Mutters is more
suitable for intermediates. Neustift, with summer skiing on the Stubai
Glacier, is also within easy striking distance of Innsbruck.
Heights: Resort 1,886 ft. Skiing 7670 ft. Axamer-Lizum 10,499 ft; Stubai
Glacier, Tulfes: 8783 ft.
Difficulty of runs: (Stubai Glacier) Easy 55 per cent; Intermediate 31 per
cent; Advanced 14 per cent.
Transfer: Flights and ski train direct to Innsbruck.
ISCHGL
Relatively few British tour operators send clients here, which is odd:
Ischgl in Austria has been described as coming close to having the perfect
ingredients for a ski resort, combining the best aspects of French, Austrian
and Italian skiing: plenty of long, fast and comparatively undemanding
skiing, the kind of snow reliability you normally hope for in Val
d'Isere/Tignes, the village charm of Alpbach, and the apres-ski vitality of
St Anton, all combined with the drinks prices of Livigno.
And what of the Swiss? They haven't been missed out, because part of this
wonderful, swooping, wide-open ski area (it is sunny but like most exposed,
mainly above-the-tree-line areas, sometimes chilly too) actually crosses the
wooded Swiss border into Samnaun, where duty-free prices really do rival
Livigno's. (Skiing visitors are recommended to bring rucksacks]) Ischgl has
an exhilarating 4,000 ft vertical drop. As for charm, the smaller resort of
neighbouring Galtur - once a haunt of Ernest Hemingway - has more of the
Alpbach flavour, although even Galtur's ski terrain has doubled in size in
recent years, and is probably better than Ischgl for nursery slopes and a
lack of queueing.
Heights: Resort 4,620 ft. Skiing 9,480 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Beginner 19 per cent; Intermediate 72 per cent; Advanced
9 per cent.
Transfer: 100 minutes from Innsbruck. 3+ hours from Munich.
JACKSON HOLE
Jackson is arguably the pick of the crop of American skiing, and it is in
fact my favourite ski resort of all. Under new management it is set to
become even better, with new lifts and trails gradually filling in some of
the gaps. But the beauty of Jackson cannot be told in terms of lifts, which
are merely the icing on a rich cake. It is Jackson's cocktail of rugged,
awe-inspiring scenery, effervescent skiing and haunting desolation that
grabs at your senses.
As you fly in you are spellbound by a scene that has stunned generations of
trappers and then tourists: the vast, wide-open 600-square-mile valley floor
is punctured by the magnificent Teton mountains which rise like a tidal wave
of granite. It is these giant, snow-clad shark's teeth, glinting in the
Wyoming sun, that lure skiers to Teton Village, 12 miles from the Wild West
town of Jackson with its cowboy bars and wooden sidewalks.
Rendezvous, a graceful brute of a mountain full of gullies, chutes and
couloirs, exhilarating cruising runs and steep untracked powder-fields is an
extension of the range, and all but obscures the Teton peaks. Jackson's most
famous couloir is Corbet's, which mesmerises strong skiers as they glimpse
it from the red Tram on their way to the top of Rendezvous. Many ski to the
edge, and stare into the abyss, feeling that mixture of fear and excitement
luring them nearer the point of no return. Many don't know until the last
moment whether they will end up performing or simply spectating. Skiers must
jump at least 15 ft to enter Corbet's. There is no disgrace in turning back:
there is plenty of excitement here without hurling yourself into Corbet's.
And for less ambitious skiers, neighbouring Rendezvous Mountain has a good
mixture of nursery slopes and fairly easy cruising runs.
Heights: Resort 6,311 ft. Skiing 10,450 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Beginner 10 per cent; Intermediate 40 per cent; Advanced
50 per cent.
Transfer: 24 miles from Jackson Hole airport. 250 miles from Salt Lake City.
JUNGFRAU REGION
The combined skiing of Wengen, Grindelwald and Murren is considerably
greater than the sum of its individual parts, and the scenery is out of this
world. The impact of Europe's most famous North Face - the Eiger - is
dramatic because it is so close to Grindelwald and is also flanked by two
more giants - the Jungfrau and Munch (Monk). The skiing on Grindelwald's
local slopes at First is fun but a little limited. Fortunately Grindelwald
shares much of its back yard with neighbouring Wengen, so overall there is
quite a lot of good, robust but not terribly challenging skiing. There are,
however two good off-piste runs  - the exquisite White Hare which starts at
the bottom of the Eiger, and Oh God] The best of the blacks is Black Rock.
To all but the keenest skiers, however, the comparative lack of really
testing terrain seems to be a minor consideration when you offset it with
such breathtaking scenery, the fascinating history of the conquest of the
mountains by both climbers and railway engineers and the quintessential
Swiss-ness. Europe's highest rack railway, the Jungfraubahn, curls up to the
Jungfraujoch, Europe's highest railway station in most dramatic fashion -
through the very heart of the Eiger. En route it halts at two stations where
passengers are allowed to peer out of the windows on to the mind-numbingly
steep North Face. Above and below are huge, jagged rocks topped with wild
cornices.
When the Swiss built the railway soon after the turn of the century there
were no such things as chairlifts, and the train represented a wonderful new
alternative to slogging up the mountain with sealskins on the bottom of your
skis. The triumphant British were able to leap aboard the Jungfraubahn and
ski downhill only. This was the birth of The Down Hill Only Club (DHO).
The club's great rival, the Kandahar, is based just across the valley in
Murren, spiritual home to Sir Arnold Lunn, who set the first modern slalom
course on the local slopes. Perched on a steep high ledge, you realise just
how fragile Murren's grip on the cliff-side seems when you fly over it in a
helicopter. The quaint, car-free resort has one famous and testing mountain,
the Schilthorn, topped by one of the highest revolving restaurants in Europe
at Piz Gloria. The Schilthorn, which featured in the James Bond movie On Her
Majesty's Secret Service, is also the mightily mogulled and un-nerving start
of the famous Inferno, the longest amateur skiing race in the world - over 8
miles - all the way down (when snow conditions permit) to Lauterbrunnen.
Apart from some noteworthy exceptions like Kanonenrohr, Murren's other
slopes tend not to be terribly eventful, but if you know where to look, or
better still hire a guide, it has some excellent off-piste opportunities.
Heights: Grindelwald: Resort 3,393 ft. Skiing 8,157 ft. Wengen: Resort 4,165
ft. Skiing 9,744 ft. Murren: Resort 5,739 ft. Skiing 9,741 ft.
Difficulty of runs in Jungfrau Region: Easy 33 per cent; Intermediate 47 per
cent; Advanced 20 per cent.
Transfer: 3+ hours from Zurich (other airports: Berne, Geneva). 521 miles
from Calais.
KILLINGTON
Killington is a snow factory. The Vermont resort starts making it as soon as
possible - as early as October - and keeps churning it out in such
proportions that each of its six mountains has its own stockpile of snow
that turn some of the trails on which it is stored into gigantic, marauding
glaciers of snow. The most extraordinary example is Outer Limits, which
drops down from the top of Bear Mountain for more than half a mile. The run
would be difficult enough to ski normally, but when piled high with
artificial snow it becomes the toughest mogul run in the East.
However, of Killington's 77 miles of trails, more than half are classified
as easy - although when the weather turns seriously cold, as it does in
Vermont, even the easiest slopes can bear more resemblance to skating rinks
than ski runs. One of Killington's problems is that it has individual
establishments with considerable charm, but the resort itself has no real
heart.
Among the more intriguing restaurants is Charity's, with its exquisite
cherrywood bar and Italian marble pillars, imported from France more than a
century ago. In those days the wooden floor had to be replaced as often as
six times a year because of the hobnailed boots worn by lumberjacks. The
Wobbly Barn is an infamous nightspot worth at least one visit.
Heights: Resort 1,045 ft. Skiing 4,220 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Beginner 45 per cent; Intermediate 20 per cent; Advanced
35 per cent.
Transfer: 150 miles from Boston. 80 Miles from Burlington Airport.
KITZBUHEL
You will never nod off during the apres ski in Kitzbuhel, but the skiing
itself is a touch predictable. Kitzbuhel's boisterous and colourful ambience
makes it permanently Christmassy - but it tends to be very much a case of
Ding-dong Merrily on Low rather than the Silent Night breed. Without the
invasion of foreign skiers the walled, medieval town, with archways, cobbled
streets, gabled houses and colour-washed facades would be immensely
charming. It has some quintessentially Austrian tea-rooms and coffee shops
offering the most deliciously gooey cakes, of which Praxmair's is the most
famous.
Kitzbuhel also tends to be noisy, and its altitude (slightly less than 2,500
ft) means that it sometimes struggles for snow - although most of the time
it does better that you might expect. The resort also has some serious
queueing problems. There are four main skiing areas which means that with
transport (free bus service or own car) one can enter the ski circuit at the
Fleckalm, Jochberg or Pass Thurn lifts, thus sometimes avoiding the worst
queues and getting better snow conditions. Unfortunately a lot of other
people often have the same idea. Gung-ho skiers might want to try the feared
Streif run on the Hahnenkamm, but most of the skiing is
friendly-intermediate. The Kitzbuhelerhorn provides a delightful alternative
to the local skiing.
Heights: Resort 2,624 ft. Skiing 6,471.
Difficulty of runs: Easy 36 per cent. Intermediate 47 per cent. Advanced 17
per cent.
Transfer: 1 1/2 hours from Salzburg, 2 hours from Munich. Rail station in
resort. 706 miles from Calais.
LA PLAGNE
La Plagne in France is a genuine intermediate and lower-intermediate
paradise, with the vast majority of its 100 or so runs either red or good
blues. It is a vast snowy wilderness dotted with 10 or more villages that
between them cover the entire spectrum of traditional and purpose-built
French architecture, from genuine farming settlements like Montchavin to
brave but not beautiful new world, of which the most dramatic and
controversial is Aime-la-Plagne. The highest of all the villages, Aime
resembles a huge ocean-going liner that has gone aground. This is now
generally recognised to be something of a carbuncle, and some of the more
recently added satellites have been designed in much more traditional style.
The skiing is almost as varied as the architecture: apart from the quite
steep piste and off-piste skiing on the Bellecote Glacier, which offers
10-mile-long runs through a vertical drop of 6,500 ft, there is a lot of
good motorway skiing and powder runs in the trees. The sprinkling of
villages means you can enjoy skiing from one to another without the need to
leave the resort.
Heights: Resort 6,232 ft. Skiing 10,660 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Easy 67 per cent; Intermediate 29 per cent; Advanced 4
per cent. Plus off-piste on Bellecote Glacier.
Transfer: 4 hours from Lyon. 4 hours from Geneva. 583 miles from Calais.
LAS LENAS
The Vall de las Lenas in Argentina's Mendoza Province, at the southern end
of the Alto Cordillera close to the Chilean border, was built only a year
after the end of the Falklands conflict between Britain and Argentina. It is
probably the biggest ski area served by lifts in South America. Although Las
Lenas means 'firewood' the wood it refers to are in bush form rather than
trees, and the terrain is wide-open and bleak, with some superb off-piste
bowl skiing.
Many of the runs are tough, and the weather frequently is too. Winds can be
extreme and accompanied by fierce blizzards which bring avalanche danger.
Some areas are often closed, so that it is quite rare to be able to ski the
entire area even if you had the stamina. The feeling of space is enhanced by
the names of the lifts, many of which are named after the planets: among
them are Mars, Neptuno, Venus, Urano and Mercurio. The Mars chair accesses a
huge amount of steep and challenging off-piste, and only the strongest
skiers can begin to explore it all.
Heights: Resort 7,349 ft. Skiing 11,253 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Beginner 25 per cent; Intermediate 40 per cent; Advanced
35 per cent.
Transfer: 1+ hours flight from Buenos Aires.
LES ARCS
Les Arcs, one of the finest resorts in the French Alps, is the acceptable
face of purpose-building. The architecture is not displeasing, the slopes
are under-rated and the scenery is inspiring. It is probably France's most
innovative resort, known mainly for its Kilometre Lancee Olympic course,
which recreational skiers can attempt from the half-way stage, and - at the
other end of the scale - the ski-evolutif short-ski learning programme,
which the resort pioneered. Les Arcs also has a wonderfully diverse
selection of specialist ski schools which between them cover just about
every possibility of la glisse.
Les Arcs has dozens of good long cruising runs and virtually limitless
off-piste opportunities. The long run down to Villaroger is one of the
classic off-piste descents, and its focal mountain, the Aiguille Rouge, has
superb off-piste runs off both shoulders - preferably skied with a guide.
Experts will also find some real challenges behind the Aiguille Grive and
Aiguille Rousse.
Heights: Resort 5904 ft. Skiing 10,580 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Easy 17 per cent; Intermediate 49 per cent; Advanced 34
per cent.
Transfer: 4+ hours from Geneva or Lyon. 585 miles from Calais.
LECH/ZURS
These two Arlberg villages, five kilometres apart, share some interesting -
though largely intermediate - skiing across three mountains, some excellent
off-piste (particularly from the Rufikopf). They attract Austria's
glitterati and quite a few film stars, aristocrats and royals from elsewhere
in Europe, including Britain. The shared (clockwise only) circuit is about
20 kilometres long. The Zurs skiing is all above the tree line. Although
Lech has some higher skiing in its satellite, Oberlech, many of its own
slopes are below the tree line, which in bad weather - when the Zurs skiing
can become distinctly unpleasant - are a godsend. In Lech some of the more
challenging slopes are off the Zuger Hochlicht. In Zurs, more advanced
skiers would enjoy the runs down from the Trittkopf cable car. Zurs is tiny,
remote, bleak and trendy. What there is of it is packed with expensive
hotels. Lech is bigger, considerably older, more real - and also expensive.
Lech and Zurs are as famous as their neighbour St Anton though slightly more
precious, genteel, swanky and expensive, with a wealth of intermediate
skiing and up-market hotels and shops. St Anton is not linked, but is only a
short bus journey away.
Heights: Lech 4,756 ft. Zurs 5,641 ft. Skiing: 8,036 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Easy 40 per cent; Intermediate 42 per cent; Advanced 18
per cent.
Transfer: 3 1/2 hours from Zurich. (Other airport Munich.) 606 miles from
Calais.
LAKE LOUISE/BANFF
With more than 100 trails spread over four mountain faces and some of the
most magnificent scenery in the Canadian Rockies, Lake Louise is the most
important of three separate resorts that make up the Banff/Lake Louise
region in Alberta. Some 30 miles from Banff, Lake Louise also has high
calibre bowl skiing in Boomerang, Whitehorn, Paradise and East Bowls. Purple
Bowl, which traditionally takes skiers an hour to hike up to, is having a
lift installed - a mixed blessing for aficionados who wanted to keep out the
riff-raff]
Unlike some resorts in North America, every lift in Lake Louise has an easy
way down and can be ridden by novices. This is not the case at Mount
Norquay, Banff's local ski 'hill' - also reputedly Canada's oldest resort.
This is known principally for its short steep trails such as The Face, and
Lone Pine, although more temperate slopes have recently been opened up.
There is night skiing three nights a week on some runs.
Fifteen miles away down the Trans-Canadian Highway is one of Canada's
highest and bleakest (in spite of its name) resorts, Sunshine, part of which
actually spills over the border into British Columbia. This is fairly
intermediate open bowl skiing with so much natural snow that they don't need
to make their own. Skiers should not miss a visit to the region's great
railway hotels - the Banff Springs and the Chateau Lake Louise.
Heights: Resort 5,400 ft. Skiing 8,650 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Beginner 20 per cent; Intermediate 45 per cent; Advanced

Louise.
MAMMOTH
There is something strangely primeval about Mammoth Mountain, an extinct
volcano 11,000 ft up in California's High Sierras. The resort is exciting
enough to attract thousands of skiers every weekend from Los Angeles, 300
miles away - even though they have skiing in their own back yard in the San
Barnardino area. (The only other way to reach the slopes from Los Angeles is
a 70-minute trip in a light aircraft). During the week the slopes are
wonderfully uncrowded. Spread across the six miles that separate its
boundaries are 150 trails of all descriptions and difficulties although the
emphasis is on the more testing. There are some good nursery slopes, but
beginners may prefer neighbouring June Mountain, 30 miles away. Good
off-piste skiers in search of a challenge will relish Mammoth's Avalanche
Chutes (the Avies). Those with stamina can attempt a different challenge:
skiing off every major lift in a single day. This is complicated because the
numbers are not consecutive. The lifts were numbered as they were being
built, so consequently lift 1 is next to lift 26, and lift 25 is on a
separate mountain. The scenery is spectacular, with views of the Minarettes
on one side and Utah peaks on the other. Mammoth is one of the few US
resorts that opens during the summer.
Heights: Resort 7,953 ft. Skiing 11,053 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Beginner 30 per cent; Intermediate 40 per cent; Advanced
30 per cent.
Transfer: 4 miles from Mammoth Lakes Airport, 300 miles from Los Angeles.
THE MILKY WAY
High on a mountain pass on the French border with Italy, with a good snow
record, Montgenevre has a large, mainly intermediate ski area of its own,
but it is also the starting point for a very scenic, though easy, tour deep
into Italy - the Milky Way. This makes it possible to visit - out of
curiosity - but perhaps not to stay, in the much maligned 'Benidorm-on-Ice'
resort of Sauze d'Oulx. En route one skis through Claviere (said to be
Italy's oldest ski resort), Cesana, Sinsicario and Sestriere (said to be the
first purpose-built resort, once rather unkindly described as being
hand-built by fascist robots in Mussolini's day). The section between
Montgenevre and Claviere is the most stunning visually, with dramatic
mountain views. But the skiing, for the most part, is bland and reasonable
intermediates will manage to get all the way to Sauze and back in a day. For
a strong beginner, the excitement of skiing to other resorts - especially in
a different country - is considerable, even if they only manage the first
resort or two. Montgenevre attracts visitors from both sides of the border,
particularly Briancon and Turin.
Heights: Montgenevre 6,068 ft. Skiing: 8,528 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Easy 24 per cent; Intermediate 64 per cent; Advanced 12
per cent.
Transfer: 2 1/2 hours from Turin, 3 hours from Grenoble, 4 hours from Lyon.
611 miles from Calais.
REVELSTOKE
This is prime helicopter-skiing country. Most off-piste skiers believe that
helicopter skiing in British Columbia is one of the best ski experiences on
earth. But most of the serious heliskiing is carried out from high mountain
lodges such as those at the celebrated Bugaboos, Cariboos and Monashee
lodges. Revelstoke is one of the few towns - the only one used by the market
leaders, Canadian Mountain Holidays - from which you can heliski without the
need to be incarcerated (however cosily) in a remote mountain lodge. It
serves the mainly wooded terrain in both the Monashee and Selkirk Mountains,
which between them have 200 off-piste trails with names like Fat Freddy's
Cat, Sunrise and Stump Farm. Bad weather in heli-ski lodges can mean a total
shut-down of skiing for a day or even days if the helicopter cannot fly. But
in Revelstoke there is a good local ski resort - Mount McKenzie- which can
be skied happily even if bad weather is halting flights.
Heights: Resort 1,509 ft. Skiing 8,856 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Heliskiing off-piste. All Intermediate/Advanced.
Transfer: 258 miles from Calgary.
SELLA RONDA
The mountainous border became the the scene of bitter fighting after Italy
entered the war against Austria in 1915. This gave the region a split
personality that lingers to this day. Part of the area was once in the
Austrian sud-Tyrol, and many of the place names still have German
equivalents: Selva, for example, is also known as Wolkenstein. The skiing is
typical Dolomite terrain: fairly gentle lower slopes and some steepish runs
through the trees overshadowed by towering, near-vertical cliffs of the
celebrated Dolomite granite, its pinkish hue often enhanced by glorious
sunsets.
With an impressive man-made snow system Selva/Val Gardena is a pre-Christmas
venue on the World Cup circuit and part of the scenic four-valley circuit
round the Gruppo Sella mountain, a huge monolith surrounded by ancient pass
routes linking dozens of old villages. Selva is also part of the Dolomiti
Superski region which covers 38 resorts served by 464 lifts, all of which
can be skied on one lift pass.
Arabba, at the base of the spectacular Sella Massif, is linked with the
Passo Pordoi (with good off-piste opportunities on the Gruppo Sella) and
Alta Badia. The resort's north-facing mountain provides a number of long and
quite breathtaking runs. Many are so steep that you feel like an astronaut
on a space walk. You constantly need to check your speed. There is some
outstanding scenery from the top of the cable car, which includes a
marvellous view of the Marmolada, which at just under 11,000 ft is the
highest peak in the Dolomites. Marmolada has its own superb long cruising
run, but the mountain is not covered by the Dolomiti Superski lift pass.
Heights: Selva 5,084 ft; Arabba 5,254 ft. Skiing 9,676 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Selva: Easy 35 per cent; Intermediate 58 per cent;
Advanced 7 per cent. Arabba: Easy 41 per cent; Intermediate 45 per cent;
Advanced 14 per cent.
Transfer: Approx 4 hours from Verona, 6 hours from Milan, Munich or Treviso.
766 miles from Calais.
SNOWBIRD/ALTA
When the snow - sometimes as dry as talc after crossing the West Coast
deserts - falls deep at Alta and Snowbird they can justifiably claim that
Utah has 'the greatest snow on Earth' - the 'champagne powder' the Americans
are always on about. Last winter so much snow piled up in Little Cottonwood
Canyon that it almost buried the neighbouring resorts. The road to Salt Lake
City was blocked and at one stage it was even illegal to leave your hotel
because of the avalanche danger. Until it was destroyed by fire and
avalanches, old Alta was a bustling, lawless mining town with countless
brawls and shootouts at bars like the Bucket of Blood Saloon. It had one of
the worst murder rates in the West.
Today its reputation is whiter than white. Both resorts are criss-crossed
with chutes and bowls but there is plenty for beginners and intermediates.
Alta has one of the cheapest lift passes in the Rockies and strong skiers
will enjoy the Greeley Bowls and the Chutes at Spiny Ridge. At Snowbird, Gad
Valley and Peruvian Gulch have steep-sided bowls with stunted,
blizzard-lashed pine trees to give you a little perspective. Snowbird's Tram
whisks 125 skiers to the top of Hidden Peak (11,000 ft) in eight minutes. It
also has what is probably the widest green run in the Rockies - Big Emma. At
Alta's Shallow Shaft (a euphemism for a poor day's work by a workshy miner)
you can eat swinging on old mining chairs. In contrast, Snowbird is probably
the closest to a modern purpose-built French resort in the Rockies.
Heights: Alta: 8,500 ft. Snowbird: 7,900 ft. Skiing: 11,000 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Beginner 25 per cent; Intermediate 35 per cent; Advanced
42 per cent.
Transfer: 32 miles to Salt Lake City.
SQUAW VALLEY
With no fewer than six mountains, almost shoulder-to-shoulder in a huge arc,
Squaw Valley - which hosted the 1960 Winter Olympics - is the most
challenging of 15 ski resorts that encircle Lake Tahoe, a beautiful
cobalt-blue stretch of water on the California/Nevada border. Unusually,
there are no marked trails as such. Instead the resort offers 4,000 acres of
open-bowl terrain spread around its rich variety of peaks: Emigrant, Granite
Chief, Squaw Peak, Snow King, Broken Arrow and the most spectacular of all,
KT22, whose front face mogul field is a serious test of most skiers' nerve.
However, even that pales into insignificance compared with The Palisades
chutes off the shoulder of Squaw Peak. But in spite of some tough terrain,
beginners do rather well at Squaw because unlike so many ski resorts, the
nursery slopes are up among the higher slopes on Emigrant Peak, rather than
at the bottom of the mountain.
Heights: Resort 6,200 ft. Skiing 9,050 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Beginner 25 per cent; Intermediate 45 per cent; Advanced
30 per cent.
Transfer: 45 miles from Reno, Nevada.
SKI THE SUMMIT
Summit County, Colorado is one of the few places in the US which promotes
the European concept of skiing in a number of resorts on the same lift pass.
Breckenridge, just purchased by Keystone and Arapahoe Basin, plus Copper
Mountain, now the odd one out, are within a 30 mile radius of each other and
linked by shuttle bus. More British skiers have their first encounter with
the American skiing experience here than anywhere else. There are many more
Britons here than there were native Americans during the post gold-rush days
when the population of Breckenridge was reduced to just seven and it became
a ghost town. Today its charmingly renovated mainstreet has 350 original
buildings dating back to the Victorian mining days. The British have been
buying condominiums here faster than any other non-US nations.
Breckenridge's four mountains (Peak 7 is due to open soon) have well over
100 trails between them. The original, Peak 8, offers a good mix of terrain,
plus the highest resort skiing in America - at a couple of ft below 13,000
ft - in the newly opened Imperial Bowl. (Arapahoe actually steals it at
13,050 ft, but that is 'back-country' skiing.) Peak 9 tends to be easier and
10, with some good tree-skiing in The Burn, more difficult. Strong skiers
can attempt Devil's Crotch and Mineshaft on Peak 9, Goodbye Girl and
Psychopath on Peak 8 and Blackhawk and Mustang on Peak 10.
Copper Mountain - once a copper mining centre - is a less attractive but
friendly purpose-built village of somewhat drab brown brick buildings. But
there's some attractive skiing, neatly 'arranged' strategically so that the
more difficult of Copper's 76 trails, like Formidable, are on the left, easy
slopes like Loverly are on the right and intermediate trails are in the
middle. Reasonable skiers can try trails like Copperopolis or Oh No] in the
middle area.
For many years Keystone had a reputation for being a slightly tame but fun
resort for families and beginners. But it always had a few difficult runs on
North Peak and those who wanted to ski steeper terrain could always head a
little way up the road to Arapahoe, a small but funky satellite with such
high skiing that it doesn't close until May or June. Now the recently opened
Outback area offers still more interesting terrain for strong skiers, and
the resort is seeking permission from the National Forest Service to open up
another big new bowl.
Keystone has the biggest night skiing area in North America and probably the
world, with more than 300 high-pressure sodium lights illuminating 13 trails
like giant glow-worms down an impressive 2,340 ft vertical drop.
Heights: Breckenridge: Resort 9,603 ft. Skiing just under 13,000 ft.

ST MORITZ/PONTRESINA
This is where the British invented winter holidays in the Swiss Alps. Like
Aspen, Switzerland's most famous ski resort is not as snooty as you might
expect. Dammit, they are even opening a 'half-pipe' track for snowboarders
at Corviglia] You can arrive in the most infra dig fashion - by mini-bus
from Livigno - and still feel welcome. Although there are cheaper ski
packages available during the low season, St Moritz tends to be expensive,
but friendly: you don't have to stay at The Palace, but a visit is
recommended even if it's only for a drink or better still, dinner.
St Moritz's ski areas are scattered on both sides of the valley. The local
slopes are at Corviglia which has warm, fairly undemanding runs within easy
reach of the centre of town. Corvatsch is further out of town and has more
interesting terrain, but there are often serious queues at the bottom of the
cable car. A car is useful to get you round to the various areas, although
trains and buses will do the job. The short train journey to Pontresina is
gorgeous. If anything Pontresina's architecture, with turreted facades and
colourful murals creeping into view as the train negotiates a great sweeping
curve, is even more attractive than downtown St Moritz. The skiing in
Pontresina is amongst the best in the whole region, particularly on the
visually stunning Diavolezza Glacier and Lagalb, where you will find a long,
tough but hugely enjoyable black run and some quality off-piste.
Heights: Resort 5,904 ft. Skiing 10,824 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Easy 22 per cent; Intermediate 57 per cent; Advanced 21
per cent.
Transfer: 4 hours from Zurich. (Or local airport). Rail station in resort.
654 miles from Calais.
SUN VALLEY
Sun Valley was invented just before the last war when Averell Harriman,
chairman of the United Pacific Railroad, asked an Austrian count to search
the Rockies for a site for a ski resort which would attract rail passengers
during the lean winter months. After a prolonged quest, Idaho's remote
Sawtooth Mountains were chosen for the creation of Hollywood's concept of
what a Tyrolean resort transferred to the American west should look like -
reindeer and all]
It was great success. Celebrities arrived in their hordes and the film Sun
Valley Serenade helped make the resort famous. The framed photographs which
line the walls of the Sun Valley Lodge give it the appearance of a mausoleum
built to commemorate post-war Hollywood. Although the train, usurped by the
aircraft, no longer calls, Sun Valley - currently involved in a big
redevelopment programme - still has some of the best skiing in the Rockies,
mainly on Baldy Mountain, where seven or eight bowls allow skiers to drop
off into some excellent terrain with constant pitch all the way to the
bottom. There is a second mountain, Dollar, where the skiing is easier.
Heights: Resort 5,750 ft. Skiing 9,140 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Beginner 38 per cent; Intermediate 45 per cent; Advanced
17 per cent.
Transfer: 81 miles from Twin Falls, 150 miles from Boise or Idaho Falls, 300
miles from Salt Lake City.
TAOS
New Mexico's most prestigious ski area was built by a German-born Swiss,
Ernie Blake, and he made it a cult resort, with some magnificent steep runs
such as Sir Arnold Lunn, Inferno, Powderhorn and Walkyries Chute. Al's run,
named after Dr Al Rosen, who used to ski with an oxygen tank after suffering
a heart attack, is legendary but not as steep as it looks when you first
glimpse it - with some trepidation - on your arrival. The resort is about 20
miles from the adobe town of Taos, the haunt of DH Lawrence in the 20s. It
also has a fascinating Pueblo Indian reservation. Some of Taos's best runs -
a series of chutes off the Highline Ridge like Thunderbird Trees - can only
be reached on foot. Some are named after German generals who plotted
Hitler's death (Blake, nee Bloch, worked for Allied intelligence in the last
war.).
The most exiting and gruelling is the long trek to Kachina Peak, which is
rarely open but a glorious red-letter day when it is. Blake always refused
to turn Kachina into a common-or-garden extension to the ski area and
refused to build a lift there. The rewards of skiing it are therefore that
much greater. There are now rumours that following his death his wishes may
be ignored, and a lift may be built. Walk up while you have the chance and
it is still extra special.
Heights: Resort 9,207 ft. Skiing 11,819 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Beginner 24 per cent; Intermediate 13 per cent; Advanced
63 per cent.
Transfer: 147 miles from Albuquerque. 288 miles from Denver. 20 miles from
local airport in Taos.
TELLURIDE
Telluride in Colorado is still much as it was a century ago when its remote
position coupled with its boom-or-bust philosophy made it a town of
contrasting fortunes. Life was cheap in the silver and gold mines and gaming
saloons, and on the mountains where miners were frequently killed in
avalanches - if the mines didn't get them first.
Described by the locals as 'the most beautiful place you'll ever ski' it is
indeed stirringly atmospheric. The ski area - steep though it turns out to
be in places - is actually to the right of the main range. The skiing has
many exhilarating blue runs like See Forever and testing bump runs through
the forest such as Staircase and The Plunge. However, the resort has a
civilised policy of grooming one side of many of its mogulfields, giving the
average intermediate a chance to enjoy the same runs as the more expert.
Built at the end of a spectacular box-canyon once held sacred by the
Indians, Telluride today is an interesting mixture of devil-may-care
earthiness, gung-ho boisterousness and unexpected conservatism. The old town
has many traditional Victorian buildings that have not been spoilt by too
much prettying up, unlike some old mining towns in the Rockies. Development
of the new ski village up on the mountain is still a sore point among local
residents.
Heights: Resort 8,725 ft. Skiing 11,890 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Beginner 28 per cent; Intermediate 54 per cent; Advanced
18 per cent.
Transfer: 65 miles from Montrose plus local airport.
LES TROIS VALLEES
Courchevel, Meribel, Les Menuires, Val Thorens
Almost too big to be true, this is the largest concentration of pistes in
the world (the Portes du Soleil on the Swiss border is more strung out but
more thinly spread). The Three Valleys are a paradise for any grade of
skier, although there is no point in beginners buying a Three Valleys lift
pass when they will never get round to all the skiing in any one of the main
components. Intermediates can ski for ever and there is everything from
testing to extreme terrain for advanced skiers. The Petit and Grand Couloirs
above Saulire are not that difficult in good snow: likewise the Col du
Fruit. A guide is recommended for off-piste skiers, both for safety and to
help seek out some of the classic itineraries. Many of these - such as the
beautiful descent of the remote Les Avals valley via the Roc Merlet at
almost 9,000 ft and the stunning descent of the Gebroulax Glacier - involve
hiking up for anything up to an hour from the highest lifts, carrying your
skis or skinning up on touring skis.
Although the ski area is huge it does not mean that there are no picturesque
or rustic nooks and crannies tucked away in its vast terrain. Admittedly Val
Thorens and Les Menuires are no oil paintings, although a French friend
insists that even Les Menuires doesn't seem ugly when you get used to it.
There are some delightful spots in Courchevel, particularly lower down at
1650 and 1350. St Martin de Belleville is a truly charming old town and
Meribel Mottaret, although modern, has been put together with considerable
charm.
As for the skiing, there is every possible permutation from the manicured
motorways of Courchevel to the manic mogulfields of Menuires. Courchevel,
with its network of colourful but ageing bubble cars, has 86 runs alone, and
the region as a whole has more than 300 miles of groomed pisteds served by
almost 200 lifts. You can head for the sophistication and variety of
Courchevel or in the other direction for the rather more stark lunar
landscape of Val Thorens, Europe's highest ski resort, where a giant cable
car takes you up to the Cime de Caron at almost 10,500 ft. The skiing here
is bleak and fairly unforgiving but exciting if you have the legs for it.
Nearby Les Menuires has some powerful and quite testing skiing on La Masse.
Meribel's skiing is also a good mix. Those interested in clocking up
ski-miles can sample all three valleys in one day.
Heights: Courchevel 1850: 6,013 ft - 8,825 ft. Meribel: 4,756 ft - 8,856 ft.
Les Menuires: 6,068 ft - 9,512 ft. Val Thorens: 7,544 ft - 10,496 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Beginner 15 per cent; Intermediate 65 per cent; Advanced
20 per cent.
Transfer: 2 1/2 hours from Geneva or Lyon. 500 miles from Calais.
VAIL/BEAVER CREEK
Vail maintains that it is America's largest single-mountain resort and has
around 100 beautifully groomed trails (none of which is seriously
difficult.) What sets it apart from all other US resorts are its fabulous
back-bowls. It has seven: Game Creek, Sun Up, Sun Down, Tea Cup and the more
recently developed China, Siberia and Mongolia Bowls. These bowls are left
ungroomed in all weathers. When they are bad they're tough but when they are
good they are superb. Vail and Beaver Creek both devote part of their
mountain to special ski runs and features for children.
Even newer and more up-market than its sister resort, Beaver Creek is like a
scaled-down version of its neighbour - nine miles away - without the bowls.
It is a fairly straightforward, slightly sanitised resort, with
uncomplicated fast skiing on superbly-groomed slopes. The toughest runs are
the so-called Birds Of Prey, with trail names like Golden Eagle, Peregrine
and Goshawk. Recently the resort added 100 acres of intermediate/advanced
skiing on Grouse Mountain, served by a new high-speed quad chair. Further
expansion is in the pipeline.
Other highlights include Beano's Cabin, a restaurant which is reached after
dark by snowcat-driven sleighs, and Trapper's - a small, luxurious and
expensive cabin where you can dine on such delicacies as buffalo and
rattlesnake meat, soak yourself in a hot whirlpool under the stars and spend
the night in splendid isolation without any 20th century distractions.
Heights: Resorts 8,150 ft. Skiing 11,450 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Vail: Beginner 32 per cent; Intermediate 36 per cent;
Advanced 32 per cent. Beaver Creek: Beginner 23 per cent; Intermediate 43

Transfer: Beaver Creek: 110 miles from Denver. Avon Stolport 1 mile. Vail:
103 miles from Denver. Eagle airport 30 miles.
VAL D'ISERE/TIGNES
Val d'Isere, a bustling and lively ski town with plenty of good restaurants
and a pulsating night life, is one of the most British-influenced ski
resorts in the French Alps. Its mayor recently wrote a controversial letter
to British tour operators - signed by several colleagues in other resorts -
asking them to weed out the 'hooligan element' among their clients. Together
with Tignes the region, dubbed 'L'Espace Killy', forms what is arguably the
greatest ski resort in the world. Unfortunately, Tignes is also one of the
ugliest. But at least its lift queues will not be so grim this winter. The
'caterpiller' funicular - supposed to be open in time for last year's Winter
Olympics but bedevilled by geological problems - is up and running and will
hopefully cut queues to the Grand Motte to a minimum.
The joint ski terrain named after Jean-Claude Killy, France's greatest
skier, is a vast network of long and inspiring pistes where many of the red
runs would be black elsewhere and many of the blacks are at the extreme end
of the anxiety spectrum. Val, as it is so often abbreviated to, is
traditionally the location for the Criterium De La Premiere Neige, the first
major world cup race of the season. The resort has two world-class downhill
courses: the dramatic Face on Bellevarde, which was redesigned for the
Olympic games, and the old OK run where you can take part in a race-training
programme with Top Ski, one of the Espace Killy specialist ski schools.
The resorts also have a selection of couloirs that are as tough as you will
find anywhere, plus an enormous number of off-piste opportunities and tours
which would take most skiers an entire winter of non-stop exploring to ski
in its entirety.
Heights: Val d'Isere 6,068 ft. Tignes: 6,560 ft. Skiing 11,280 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Easier 21 per cent; Intermediate 69 per cent;
Advanced/Expert 10 per cent.
Transfer: 4 1/2 hours from Geneva. (Other airport Lyon). 600 miles from
Calais.
VERBIER
With 200 miles of skiing spread around 10 local Swiss villages, and almost
90 lifts (including the 'jumbo' cable-car which whisks 150 skiers up to the
Mont-Fort glacier at almost 11,000 ft) Verbier's skiing is quite exceptional
in terms of size alone. But this sprawling collection of modern chalets
(there are few hotels) built on a sunny shelf beneath some of the most
dramatic slopes in Europe is celebrated chiefly for two things: fabulous
off-piste and a somewhat antiquated lift-system.
Mont-Fort and Mont Gele are the two big mountains that give Verbier its
cachet with serious skiers. The back side of Mont-Fort is one of the finest
off-piste descents in Switzerland but should only be attempted with a guide.
Mont Gele too has an extreme side and an easier face which is excellent in
fresh powder, but even that should be skied with care. Tortin is another
magnet for adventurous skiers, and Stairway to Heaven - which involves a
steep climb over a saddle, skis on shoulder - is well worth the effort
providing the snow is good.
Many people find neighbouring Haute Nendaz a quieter alternative to the
veritable cat's cradle of lifts around Attelas, Ruinettes and Lac des Vaux
where intermediates tend to buzz around like stray Exocets, and places such
as La Tzoumaz provide some delightful and quite gentle runs through the
trees when snowstorms are battering the major local peaks.
Heights: Resort 4,920 ft. Skiing 10,915 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Easier 39 per cent; Intermediate 42 per cent; Advanced
19 per cent.
Transfer: 2+ hours from Geneva. 623 miles from Calais.
WANAKA AND QUEENSTOWN
Between the beautiful alpine lakes of Wanaka and Wakatipu on South Island is
some of New Zealand's most spectacular helicopter skiing terrain, dominated
by the Central Harris Mountains, which can be skied from both bases. From
the attractive and cosy mountain town of Queenstown, on the shores of
Wakatipu, skiers have access to the South Harris Mountains, with a mixture
of easy, open bowls for intermediates and 'radical' chutes for experts. From
Wanaka, skiers can descend the North Harris Mountains - bigger peaks with
more dramatic terrain, and longer runs.
The Tyndall Glaciers, with an awe-inspiring network of crevasses and
wonderful views of Mountain Aspiring, offer vertical drops of as much as
4,000 vertical ft. Because of the proximity to the Tasman Sea, skiers often
find themselves accompanied by seagulls who follow them down the mountain as
they might a cross-channel ferry. Altogether Harris Mountains Heliski visits
more than 100 peaks with as many as 200 named runs. Be it August powder or
September corn, this is some of the finest helicopter skiing you will find
in either hemisphere.
Heights: Resort 5,116 ft. Skiing 9,328 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Helicopter skiing. 100 per cent strong
intermediate/advanced.
WHISTLER/BLACKCOMB
These two mountains standing shoulder to shoulder near the western seaboard
of British Columbia provide the finest resort skiing in Canada, with superb
bowl skiing in one and first-class glacier skiing in the other. Whistler and
Blackcomb also have the highest vertical drop in North America - more than
5,000 ft. Both have a richly varied selection of runs but on the higher
slopes each mountain specialises in different terrain.
Whistler has six bowls which rival those of Vail, Colorado. Blackcomb's big
feature is its glaciers. Both the Horstman and the Blackcomb Glacier provide
top-class powder skiing when conditions are good. There is also a selection
of excellent couloirs such as Cougar, Soudan and Pakalako. The only snag
about these resorts is that because of their maritime nature the snow can
sometimes be quite wet and heavy. Whistler Village is low - even lower than
Kitzbuhel - and if often rains. You need faith and determination to set out
for a day's skiing in the rain, confident that by the time you get to the
main skiing area the rain will be falling as snow. Last winter I donned a
plastic mac in a cloudburst and ended up having one of the best day's skiing
of the winter.
Because of their northern location it gets dark quite early so some of the
the runs close at 3.30pm. This means that long lunches are a luxury. Often
you find that if you have that final drink the lift network is closing
around you.
Even though the two resorts are run by the same company they are marketed
separately and competitively. The resorts are locked in combat: thus as fast
as one resort makes a big improvement, the other tries to outgun it with
something even more spectacular. This conflict can only be to the skier's
gain.
Heights: Resort: 2,200 ft. Skiing: 7,494 ft (Blackcomb), 7,140 ft
(Whistler).
Difficulty of runs: Beginner 25 per cent; Intermediate 55 per cent; Advanced
20 per cent.
Transfer: 70 miles from Vancouver. Journey can be made by helicopter.
ZERMATT
In the beginning was the Matterhorn. Tourists flocked here just to gaze upon
its rugged beauty. Climbers, inspired by the tragic first ascent by Edward
Whymper, in which four people were killed on the way down, could not keep
away either. The bewitching mountain is Zermatt's crowning glory. Almost
everywhere you go the Matterhorn is there watching over you.
Zermatt has three main ski areas. Schwarzsee and the Theodul Glacier bring
you closest to this thrilling slab of granite. The other areas are
Sunnegga/Rothorn/Gornergrat. Gornergrat provides some of the most stunning
views in the Alps - across the chain of mountains to the left of the
Matterhorn, the Klein Matterhorn Lyskamm, Breithorn, Castor, Pollux, and the
mighty Monte Rosa. This winter the train service to Gornergrat has been
speeded up and observation cars have been introduced.
The cable car to the Klein Matterhorn - the highest in Europe - gives access
to Cervinia, on the Italian side, which can also be reached via the
Theodulpass. Sunnegga, Rothorn and Gornergrat provide the best of Zermatt's
friendlier, sunnier slopes plus some of its best black runs like National
and the superb Triftji run. The Theodul Glacier - which doubles as Zermatt's
summer skiing area - offers rather dull motorway skiing, and the Schwarzsee
at the very foot of the Matterhorn offers a good selection of runs for all
grades.
There are two excellent blacks - Tiefbach and Aroleid, plus an exciting and
scenic descent, the Weisse Perle, which takes you swooping past the pretty
villages of Stafelalp and Zmutt, where you will be tempted to call in at
cosy piste-side bars and restaurants. You might as well surrender: by common
consensus Zermatt has the best selection of mountain restaurants in Europe.
Heights: Resort 5,346 ft. Skiing: 12,610 ft.
Difficulty of runs: Easy 27 per cent; Intermediate 42 per cent; Advanced 31
per cent.
Transfer: 4+ hours from Geneva. Station in resort. 672 miles from Calais.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Pink Snow - FT Guide To The World's Best Ski Resorts (1):
Twin peaks for Val d'Isere - Arnie Wilson analyses this year's Pink Snow
resort and tour operator ratings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE AGAIN the big French resorts, with Val d'Isere taking first place as
last year, have dominated the Pink Snow FT readers' questionnaire - with one
exception: Zermatt, the great British favourite in Switzerland, has
leap-frogged Courchevel and Meribel and is snapping at Val's heels. Verbier
has slipped from fourth to fifth place.
Val d'Isere's neighbour Tignes, however, which was fifth last year, has
inexplicably dropped out of sight - to 44th equal. Seven French resorts
figure in our Top 15, and if the votes for Courchevel, Meribel and Val
Thorens are pooled, the Trois Vallees resorts score a total of 111, which
leaves the rest trailing.
It is therefore perhaps no accident that a luxury ski tour operator
specialising in France - The Ski Company, with seven chalets in the French
Alps - has topped the poll for the best tour operator with a remarkable 97
per cent of the possible maximum score. Even more impressive, this high
score was achieved from pooling the satisfaction ratings of a total of 28
readers who mentioned the operator in their returned Pink Snow
questionnaires.
As well as general questions about skiing ability, our Pink Snow
questionnaire asked FT readers to nominate their favourite resort and also
to give a 'satisfaction rating' to tour operators they had skied with in the
past five years. These responses were collated, converted into percentages
and used to draw up the tables opposite, grading operators with more than 20
mentions ('The Big League') and those smaller, mainly specialist operators,
with fewer than 20 mentions ('The General League'). Fuller details of how
operators were graded can be found in the footnote to the Big League table.
Of those operators mentioned fewer than 20 times, two other French
specialists, Collineige and Ski Weekend, both achieved an excellent 95 per
cent - although bear in mind that both companies achieved their high ratings
from a total of only five readers' submitted satisfaction ratings.
Other companies that are strong in France were not far behind: YSE, (83 per
cent) which operates solely in Val d'Isere, Club Med (81 per cent) and Ski
Esprit (71 per cent) all finished strongly.
The French resort of Chamonix, featured by Collineige, climbed from 16th
position last year to eighth. In a letter to Pink Snow outlining his likes
and dislikes about skiing, FT reader David Maule raved about its most famous
off-piste run: 'I was in Heaven skiing the Vallee Blanche,' he wrote,
although he admitted that early on in this 17-kilometre marathon he was
'crying in pain during some of the worst moments of my life' during the
long, cold walk along the steep ridge to reach it. Meanwhile, the hordes of
skiers further down in the resort reminded him of Jean-Paul Sartre's famous
quote: 'Hell is other people.'
In keeping with the good showing by Zermatt and Verbier, the Swiss Travel
Service (91 per cent rating from an impressive 37 Pink Snow respondents)
keeps up its excellent record by finishing second in our 'Big League' table
of tour operators and fifth overall. Ski Weekend (95 per cent), Ski Scott
Dunn (90 per cent) and Kuoni (86 per cent) also scored high marks.
Silver Ski, 31st last year has shot up to eighth this time with an
impressive 84 per cent. Ski West improved on last year, rising 13 places to
22nd and its owners Bladon Lines has climbed six places to 21st.
America is exerting an ever more noticable influence on FT readers' choice
of top resorts, with two Colorado hotspots, Vail and Breckenridge, in the
top 15 of favourite resorts.
Vail rises from ninth to seventh. Virgin Holidays, which specialises in
Californian skiing, also achieved a high-scoring 92 per cent. The growing
appeal of skiing in the US is explained in an article on page 18 of Pink
Snow.
Not all readers, however found America ideal. Mr G Martin of Winchester
wrote: 'I skied in freezing drizzle on the East Coast. The only lift had
metal seats which were covered with ice, which I thawed with my bottom on
the way up. I recovered on the run down, only to be frozen rigid again up.'
However, he pointed out that if conditions are good, the skiing can be
outstanding.
Conversely, Italy - which, although thanks to a weak lira is set to enjoy a
skiing renaissance this winter - hardly gets a look-in on the basis of FT
readers' reported skiing experiences in the last five years. The highest
placed Italian resort is Cervinia at No. 27.
That will change this year. Tina Crowther, of the Skiers Travel Bureau in
Leeds, reports: 'Ski holidays to Italy are on a roll this season, and many
operators who used to have much larger Italian programmes must be kicking
themselves for reducing them in recent years.'
Italy's gains this year seem to be mainly at the expense of Austria whose
front-runner, St Anton, is in sixth place this year (up from eighth). Two
more Austrian resorts, Kitzbuhel (down two places) and Obergurgl, plus
Wengen (17th last year) in Switzerland - all traditional British favourites
 -fill 11th, 12th and 13th spot in this year's poll. Behind them are two
more French resorts, Alpe d'Huez (18th last year) and La Plagne (12th last
year). which are now equal 15th.
However, Austria is still favoured by many British skiers. Carole Emmett, of
Basildon, Essex, wrote to say that she particularly enjoyed the apres ski at
the Eidelweissam in Obertauern - 'the wildest place I have ever been to . .
. very few Brits; singing and dancing on tables in your thermals.' She also
likes the Cafe Christina at Ischgl - 'full of dancing, riotous, thumping
Germans drinking large beers.'
This year's most highly-praised tour-operator, The Ski Company, was started
by David Kemp on 'the first day of the recession' in 1987, and for a while
his office 'was a very lonely place.' Kemp, born in Zambia, did not even see
his first snow-flake until he came to Britain in 1969.
The Ski Company says it attempts to provide 'good food, fine wines and the
informality and privacy of a private house with the service of a private
hotel.' Says Kemp: 'Luxury does not mean going over the top. It is
understated good value. Hand-picked, well-trained staff, everything done
really well. Obviously our holidays are expensive because you cannot have
three people looking after eight guests in a chalet without it costing
something. But we've never had anyone who hasn't said our holidays are good
value.'
In contrast, a number of tour operators have experienced disappointing
results, particularly Touralp (satisfaction rating 39 per cent this year, as
against a top score last year, although that score was from only four
readers' mentions), and Crystal (46 per cent) which in spite of beating Ski
Thomson into second place in the recent Travel Trade Gazette Travel Awards
is still down among the tail-enders. Ski Thomson itself - the market leader
in terms of numbers of holidays sold - still languishes in the wrong half of
the table, albeit with a fairly reasonable rating of 66 per cent.
Andy Perrin, Crystal's marketing director, said he was 'gutted' by his
company's poor showing in the questionnaire.
'We have pulled out all the stops on customer satisfaction, and we were
delighted to beat Thomson at the TTG awards. I just can't understand these
figures. I can only assume that because skiers were asked to comment on
holidays taken in the last five years it's down to past problems still
catching up with us. We're definitely not the same company as we were four
or five years ago, but how do you get that message across to people?'
Touralp's apparent plunge in fortunes was 'not due to a drastic drop in
standards, as the results might imply,' claimed Pierre Espinasse, the
company's new general manager. It was not the skiing but delays in airport
transfers, - frequently a cause for disgruntlement among clients - that were
the chief bones of contention, it seems.
'In order to address this problem, Touralp has now completely done away with
group bus transfers and introduced a fly-drive programme giving our clients
the benefit of a hired car for a week,' says Espinasse. 'This cuts the wait
at the airport and people are free to drive to their resort in their own
time and visit neighbouring ski areas.'
Lotus Supertravel, which last year claimed to have been chosen by FT readers
as the 'Top British Tour Operator' fell from 15th last year to 19th, in
spite of a gallant attempt by Susan Burgin of south east London to give them
top rating. But then Ms Burgin is the company's marketing director, so a C
rating was unlikely.
Powder Byrne, too, was disappointed about slipping from second to 12th spot,
although the company scored a very creditable 77 per cent satisfaction
rating. 'We are not going to cut our throats over this,' said managing
director Rory Byrne. 'But we are going to do our damnest to get back to the
top. This kind of response keeps us on our toes.'
There will doubtless be arguments about our scoring system, which gives
considerable weight to dissatisfied customers. We think this gives a fair
reflection of the performance of larger operators, but operators with only a
few mentions might be unduly penalised by the rating of one or two
malcontents.
Nevertheless, with a total of more than 900 respondents to the
questionnaire, and with a very high proportion of those respondents giving
their views as paying customers of those tour operators mentioned, the
scores will give many companies food for thought. The customer is still
king, and any operator which rests on its laurels risks the wrath of those
who will send their verdicts to next year's Pink Snow . . .

Key: In the Pink Snow questionnaire FT readers were asked to rate ski
tour operators they had travelled with from A (excellent) to D (poor).
These ratings were converted to a score as follows: A=8; B=6; C=2; D=-2,
and this score was then expressed as a percentage. The survey reflects
the experiences of FT readers over the past five years. The management
of some companies has changed over that period. Operators no longer in
business have been excluded from the survey. A total of 938
questionnaires were returned. Not all readers expressed a view about
travel operators or favourite resort.

FT  13 NOV 93 / International Company News: QVC steps up bid for Paramount
to Dollars 10.8bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
QVC Network, the cable television company headed by Mr Barry Diller,
yesterday increased the value of its hostile takeover bid for entertainment
group Paramount Communications from around Dollars 9.5bn to Dollars 10.8bn.
The new bid, totalling Dollars 90 a share, tops the Dollars 85-a-share offer
on the table from Viacom, the cable group which has agreed to a friendly
takeover of Paramount.
Viacom will have to decide whether to increase its bid for Paramount a third
time, weighing up the rarity value of one of Hollywood's few remaining
independent film studios against bid prices which many Wall Street analysts
suggest are now in the realm of the uneconomic.
QVC, which was in the middle of a cash tender offer for 51 per cent of
Paramount's shares, increased the price it will pay for these shares from
Dollars 80 to Dollars 90, which will involve a cash outlay of Dollars 5.5bn
for 61m shares. The tender runs to November 26.
If its tender offer is successful it will then offer shareholders 1.43 QVC
common shares and 0.32 shares of new convertible preferred stock for every
Paramount share.
The next important date in QVC's bid will be on Tuesday, when the company
appears before a court in Delaware seeking to overturn special 'lock up'
provisions of the Viacom-Paramount merger agreement. It said the revised
offer was conditional on success in court.
The lock-ups allow Viacom to buy 20 per cent of Paramount's stock at a price
of just Dollars 69.14 a share in certain circumstances. QVC is demanding
that the court create a level playing field between the two bids.
The new bid comes just 24 hours after BellSouth, the US regional
telecommmunications company, joined QVC Network's war party by agreeing to
invest Dollars 1.5bn in QVC if it acquires Paramount.

FT  13 NOV 93 / GCHQ faces shift pay fury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHIFT WORKERS at GCHQ, the government eavesdropping centre based at
Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, are to have pay cuts and revised staffing rotas
imposed on them in a new employment package, Richard Donkin writes.
The new rotas are to be introduced at the start of next month in spite of a
90 per cent vote to reject them by shift workers of the staff federation
that was created when unions were banned in 1984.
Mr Clive Lloyd, one of the former GCHQ staff who was sacked when he refused
to resign from his union said: 'In the words of a friend who still works at
the centre, they are in uproar and furious.' The unrest is likely to
embarrass the government, which has agreed to talks about the possible
restoration of union membership at the centre.
GCHQ last night accepted that the new system was unpopular. It said the
arrangements were being phased in. There had been a 'change in needs' for
the existing shift working arrangements.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Tory and CBI clash over Europe grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT was on the defensive yesterday over its European policy after
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry,
warned it not to close off the option of a single currency.
Mr John Major insisted that Britain was not 'remotely ready' for a single
currency. The prime minister added that he believed businesspeople were
'very much behind the government's approach'.
Speaking on a visit to Ealing, west London, the prime minister claimed that
Mr Davies's views on Europe had been misrepresented in an inter-view
published in The Guardian newspaper on Thursday.
Mr Major, pressed for his view on a single currency, said it 'certainly
isn't going to happen in this decade'.
In an interview with BBC radio yesterday, Mr Davies appeared to broaden his
attack. He said: 'What we are slightly concerned about is a feeling that the
government is prepared to dismiss the prospect of a single currency in the
longer run, or exchange-rate stability, which we think are, in the
long-term, of interest to the business community. The arguments which
brought us into the ERM in the first place still have some force.
'What I think concerns us is that the government's rhetoric on EMU has
become very negative indeed. We would like to stop that getting too far.'
The CBI fears the government is closing off its long-term options in Europe.
A survey of business leaders, commissioned by the CBI and to be published
tomorrow, shows many in business in favour of a single currency.
Last night a CBI official stressed that there was 'no question' of Mr Davies
having criticised the government's policy on Europe.
'What he criticised was the attitude of some politicians who were opposed to
Britain's greater involvement,' he said. 'The business community cannot
afford to be excluded from a Europe which is moving to a single currency
while Britain is left outside.'
Commenting on the CBI's poll of businesspeople, he said: 'The bulk of
replies favour the return of Britain to a single currency in the longer
term.'
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, appeared to distance
himself from some anti-European remarks by some colleagues at last month's
Tory party conference.
He said: 'We have taken historic decisions to move to a single market. That
process is bound to create difficulties and short-term controversies.'
While Mr Davies knew 'perfectly well that today's circumstances' had upset
the assumptions on which yesterday's discussions had taken place, Mr
Heseltine said it did not mean that circumstances would not change.
Later in the evening Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, urged the party to
stop debating Europe in terms of Euro-sceptic versus Euro-enthusiast.
At a meeting of the Conservative Group for Europe Mr Clarke said: 'We must
fight the real battle which is between the right and the left in Europe,
between British Conservatives and John Smith's Euro-socialist Labour party.'

<TEXT>
THE European Union and South Korea yesterday concluded talks on intellectual
property rights covering EU pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals.
The agreement was announced after the annual EU-Korean ministerial meeting
held between Sir Leon Brittan, Europe's chief trade negotiator, and Mr Han
Sung-joo, the South Korean foreign minister, in Seoul.
The EU and Korea have been negotiating during the last two years on
retroactive product protection of EU pharmaceutical and agricultural
chemicals based on a 1991 framework agreement.
Sir Leon also asked South Korea to open its rice market as part of the
Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - something
Seoul has persistently refused to do demanding an exception to the
all-tariffication rule.
Korea can not be granted an exception because it would threaten 'to unravel'
other agreements already reached during the Gatt talks, Sir Leon said.
He also complained about discriminatory tariffs on imported European cars
and official harassment of buyers.
'The purchase of a foreign car should not be regarded as an unpatriotic act
and one that will draw the attention of the tax authorities,' he said.

Israel yesterday received some of its first concrete political and economic

establishing full diplomatic relations with the Jewish state and Tunisia
ended the ban on Israeli tourists, writes Julian Ozanne in Jerusalem.
Both moves, part of a gradual easing of Israel's isolation by Arab and third
world countries, will help win popular support in Israel for the peace
process.
Under the Israeli-Tunisian tourism agreement Neot Hakikar, an Israeli
tourism company, will take its first two groups of Israeli tourists to
Tunisia next month after special approval was given by the Tunisian
president.
Israel's army said five members of Mr Yassir Arafat's Fatah faction of the
Palestine Liberation Organisation had been involved in the recent killing of
a Jewish settler.

Mr Hou also said that no progress had been made recently to bridge
differences between the two sides: Taiwan wants to concentrate on a future

BAe said it expected no decision would be made until after Taiwanese

FT  13 NOV 93 / I'm back - has anything happened?: Dominic Lawson puts his
new book aside and returns to the 'real' world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO ALL those who have written to me while I have been away, begging me to
return, I would like to say: thank you, both of you. My advice to all other
readers is to turn over to the next page.
That, at least, is what I have been doing over the past two months: reading
nothing. No newspapers, no magazines; nothing. Disraeli said that if he
wanted to read a good book, he would write one. In my own more modest way, I
have followed the same approach. I have read nothing except for the words of
my own book, as they have emerged on the computer screen. My television has
remained in its cupboard, not even to be wheeled out at the news witching
hours.
I have become, in a word, ignorant. Ignorant, at least, about all the things
which are supposed to be important. What is the latest word on Kenneth
Clarke's Budget plans? Is John Major getting more or (even) less popular?
Are house prices turning up? I don't know, and frankly, my dears, I don't
give a damn.
To the extent that the viscous fluid of political life percolated through to
my study at all, the most eminently indigestible was the domestic scene. It
suddenly did seem all immensely boring and unimportant. But even matters of
international significance left me unengaged. Did I care desperately about
the resolution of the Palestinian issue? No. Did I mind whether Boris
Yeltsin succeeded in storming the White House? No. Was I kept awake at night
worrying about nuclear proliferation in North Korea? No, I was not.
You might think this perfectly normal behaviour. You too might consider
these matters to be crashingly boring, although I suspect that, as an FT
reader, you are unlikely to be so parochial. But the thing is, I am an
editor. I am supposed to be greatly fascinated by the domestic and
international political scene. I am supposed to care about who is up, and
who is down, what is in, and what is out. Not only that: I am supposed to
have views on such matters.
While I was writing my book, I turned down every invitation I received to
cocktail and dinner parties. Ostensibly the reason was that I was far too
busy scribbling to find the time or the energy to socialise, let alone eat
and converse simultaneously. And there was some truth in that. But it occurs
to me that there was another reason for my apparent ascetism. I was simply
embarrassed that I would be asked my opinion on the latest topics of
political importance and thereby my vast range of ignorance would be exposed
to the sort of people it is my job to impress. Sing for my supper? I
couldn't even have croaked.
My book is about the psychology of sporting and intellectual conflict, as
seen through the medium of world championship chess. This, it seems to me,
is a topic of fascinating interest. But there are limits to the extent to
which a cocktail or dinner party conversation can revolve around such
matters. Small talk, it is not.
When I finally returned to my office, having delivered my baby to the
publishers, I received a number of friendly letters and telephone calls.
Virtually all of them said something along the lines of 'Welcome back to the
real world.'
What these kind people meant was that the world of current affairs
journalism was real, and the world of Grandmaster chess was not. In a way, I
understood this. Chess is, for most people, just a game. But for those who
play it for a living, it is real enough. They are engaging in pure,
creative, mental conflict, and pushing real chess pieces around a chess
board. There is no hypocrisy at the chess board. Something either works, or
it does not. In this sense, chess has similar properties to the worlds of
engineers or physicists.
But what do political journalists do? And what, for that matter, is it that
politicians do? They talk a lot. They have lunch a lot. Usually with each
other. From time to time they make things up. On some occasions they do
something useful. Because some of the things they do are useful, they
consider them 'real', and, therefore, important.
But now I miss the pure, useless, value-free world of the chess
Grandmasters. And I am sorry, in a way, to return to the 'real' world where
people try so desperately hard to govern and influence the behaviour of
their fellow men.
Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Tax to save us from smut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Normally I have no truck with Britain's tabloid newspapers. Life is too
short. But in the wake of the argy-bargy caused by Mirror Group Newspapers'
spy-in-the-ceiling photographs of Princess Diana working out in a private
gym, I called at my newsagent this week and bought the Smutty Four of daily
journalism: Mirror, Sun, Star and Sport.
The newsagent looked askance. In his eyes, my only flirtation with
insalubrity is an occasional purchase of the Racing Post - a tabloid,
admittedly, but one that is much superior to its broadsheet rival, the
dim-witted Sporting Life.
I told the newsagent: 'Don't look askance. If it wasn't for you newsagents,
the profession of journalism would not be under siege. If newsagents refused
to sell the Smutty Four, the rest of the press - honourable enterprises
attempting to do their jobs with dignity and integrity - would not be
splattered by the muck thrown up by the tabloids.'
I explained to the newsagent that because of the smutties, the rest of the
press was in danger of being tarred and feathered by two unwelcome
developments: further encroachment on press freedom via the introduction of
restrictive privacy laws; and the slapping of VAT on newspapers and books
when the chancellor of the exchequer, Kenneth Clarke Ha Ha Ha, introduces
his first Budget later this month.
I doubt whether Kenneth Clarke Ha Ha Ha is seriously considering levying VAT
on the printed word; but he might be. Nor do I think that the hooligans at
Mirror Group have necessarily guaranteed the introduction of legislation
that, to quote The Times, 'will do little to protect privacy and much to
hamper the press'; but they might have.
Yet I have a further objection to the Smutty Four: with their pandering and
sleaze and bigotry and hypocrisy they help entrap millions of readers in a
tar-pit of ignorance.
Every time I see a person reading one of the smutties, I say to them: 'Why
must you do that? They are taking you for a fool. All they give you is a few
cheap thrills. Pictures of naked ladies. A drip-feed of sensationalism.
Pandering to your prejudices. Confirming you in your ignorance. Pushing you
down and down. You really must snap out of it. Buy a decent newspaper. Even
The Independent. Of course it's wretchedly po-faced. Entirely the fault of
the editor. But at least it's got a brain. Do yourself a favour. Try and get
out of the gutter.'
I have never been properly thanked for tendering this advice. The person I
am trying to help emits a low Neanderthal growl and generally tries to club
me.
Initially, Lord McGregor, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, urged
advertisers to boycott the Daily and Sunday Mirror, and two of them, the
Royal Automobile Club and Autoglass, were quick to pull out once the mud was
flying. Yet the morning after Princess Diana obtained a High Court
injunction preventing further publication of the eye-spy pictures, the
smutties were still full of adverts.
Prominent advertisers in the Mirror included Lloyds Bank Insurance Services,
Toyota, Sainsbury, Maxwell House, Tesco, General Accident, Coalite, Kitchens
Direct, Gateway - even the Newspaper Publishers Association, which had a
full-page ad. The Sport had only porno ads, but the Star, which is not much
better, was thick with General Accident, Daihatsu, BT, the RAC, Citroen,
Royal Insurance, Coalite, Reader's Digest, National Westminster Bank,
Gateway, Franklin Mint - and the Newspaper Publishers Association.
But advertisers should not be blamed for the activities of the media, and
the hapless McGregor later cancelled his call for a boycott. Advertisers
chase demographics: if BT and General Accident want business from perverts,
that is probably their affair.
Rather than hassling advertisers, I plan to harass Kenneth Clarke Ha Ha Ha.
I shall tell him that instead of imposing VAT on books and newspapers he
must introduce RAT - a Rather Awesome Tax on all smutty tabloids, Sundays
included. Proceeds from RAT will not go to the Treasury but will be donated
to the broadsheets to help them keep afloat.
RAT could be extended to books. Why should a hack like Jeffrey Archer salt
away millions while a true artist like Barry Unsworth, author of many
excellent novels, has to scrimp and scrape and live in Finland?
RAT has immense potential for cultural and social good. I believe it will be
the saving of us.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Private View: When work is a perk: Guy Standing thinks every
citizen should get welfare benefit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE unemployed slumdweller in Jamaica said when quizzed by a visiting
economist: 'Man, I don't want a job. I want to work.' But in an era when
jobs are increasingly - perhaps permanently - scarce, the distinction
between a 'job' and 'work' is no longer a matter of semantics only.
According to Dr Guy Standing, the economist of the anecdote, it becomes the
starting point for a humane response to a struggling labour market and
shrinking welfare state. If we are to help the unemployed, we must change
our definition of employment.
Standing, an officer of the UN International Labour Organisation, has
studied the labour markets of western Europe, eastern Europe and Russia. For
the past five years, he has been privately promoting the idea of a
'citizenship income guarantee.' The idea is seductively simple: give every
citizen, regardless of age, work or marital status, a guaranteed minimum
income. Children might receive a portion, the poorest a supplement.
For non-earners, it could be an automatic payment or a lifetime credit
acquired at birth and drawn down when needed. For earners, it would take the
form of a tax credit. The aim, says Standing, is to combine the virtues of
labour flexibility (giving people more choice about when and how they work)
with the justice of income security. And the way to do it is to sever the
link between welfare and work.
His project is not new: in its various guises, it has been called a negative
income tax, social dividend, social credit or basic income. And, as Standing
confesses, it has in the past attracted its fair share of cranks as well as
the academically respectable. But with unemployment in the European Union
heading towards 18m, and in Russia towards 20m, he says the citizens' wage
is winning converts.
Standing's underlying assumption is that while there will be work, there
will not be so many jobs. Does that mean, I asked him, that people will have
to be paid not to join the labour market - at least, not full-time?
'Yes. It's a regrettable fact that the era of full employment in the old
sense is past; and while the notion of full work opportunities for all is
something we should cherish and promote, the idea of everybody being in
full-time, regular, protected employment is now not likely to return.'
You have said that full employment is not all that wonderful. What do you
mean?
'Full employment would not be wonderful if it meant putting large numbers of
people into low-wage jobs with poor working conditions and a lack of basic
rights.
'If you remove all protective regulations and institutional support -
including trade unions - the labour market you create at the bottom is very
unedifying. After all the social and economic progress that Europe has
achieved, to return to that model would be a monumental historical defeat.'
He sees the citizenship wage as an answer to the failure of full employment
strategies (communist as well as capitalist) and as a counter to the growing
popularity of workfare - the principle that the unemployed should be
compelled to work for their welfare cheque. Workfare, he said, was both
immoral and uneconomic. 'You create a low-wage stratum of people who would
bump out others who were doing the work before. It can be an obstacle to
skill development.'
It also corrected the failure of the benefit system. (Only 30 per cent of
unemployed Britons actually receive unemployment benefit. The fraction in
Russia is even smaller). In any system, people fall through the net.
Meanwhile, payments are being reduced and qualifying criteria stiffened.
Means testing is on the increase.
Standing is chairman of a little-known body called Bien, a punning acronym
for Basic Income European Network. His 15 minutes of fame came aged 23,
when, fresh from a PhD in labour economics at Cambridge, he combed the UK
census figures and announced that the unemployment rate was really 1m, not
the 700,000 the government had announced.
Offered a job at the UK Department of Employment, he chose the ILO instead.
Why? 'Because I believed, and I still believe, that to have civilised labour
markets requires an institutional approach.' These days, he works in
Budapest directing a team of ILO field-workers throughout central and
eastern Europe. Significantly, the ILO has not adopted the basic income idea
itself.
I asked Standing how he would sell his ideas to governments.
'The politicians have gone for efficiency and improving the flexibility of
labour markets. These are worthy objectives. With income support, more
people will be able to take part-time jobs, to take risks, to experiment
with training, to move in and out of the market.' The poor would be helped
out of the unemployment trap (when loss of benefit is a disincentive to
working) and the poverty trap (when the loss is a disincentive to working
harder).
What about the black economy and welfare-scrounger argument?
'Politicians are ambivalent. Sometimes they talk of scrounging, sometimes
about personal initiative and entrepreneurial talent. Most people doing well
in the informal economy are the ones who tend to have regular jobs -
savings, contacts, etc - whereas most unemployed do not have those things.
'You either go for more policing, which leads in rather worrying directions,
or you have to find ways of legitimising many forms of activity that are
only illegitimate in dysfunctional systems.'
Would the basic income be enough to live on?
'We're hoping that, gradually, you move in the direction of providing an
income where people could, if necessary, survive without earnings for a
period. But we're not so naive as to think that is a realistic possibility
in the near future.'
How would you sell it to workers for whom unemployment is the great stigma?
'Look, unemployment is a reality in Europe now. Most people are afraid of
it, particularly those in manual jobs. You offer them different types of
work, waged jobs for a certain period, or training, or self-employment. I am
convinced of the attractions, particularly to those who feel frustrated in a
narrow, static job.
'And despite what some trade union leaders say, this prevents sweated
labour. You wouldn't be forced to take the terrible jobs any more.'
What you describe sounds like communism, I said. It's the iron rice bowl
again.
'No, it's moving away from old labels altogether. Under the Leninist model,
there was a guarantee of some sort of income, but it was for workers. If you
were not a wage labourer - and usually a manual labourer - then you didn't
have any entitlements to society's surplus and you were regarded as a social
parasite. And there was a compulsion to do waged labour.'
But wouldn't it be fabulously expensive?
'No, because there is a lot of churning in the existing system: benefits to
middle-income groups, waste, duplication, administration. The Dutch have
costed it and found they could provide a reasonable level of basic income
with only a small rise in the average tax rate.
'Then, if you turn benefit receivers into tax-paying workers, you are
increasing the tax base. One of the problems of recent years has been the
erosion of the tax base, with people at both ends of the income scale
bypassing it.'
So, some of the middle-class tax perks would be removed?
'I think that's essential.'
The 1990s, he said, was an era for experimentation: with new kinds of
working, social protection and wealth distribution. A citizenship wage was
only one of many techniques to be employed on the road to economic and
social democracy without which political democracy could not survive.
'In the end, it's a question of what sort of democracy you want to create.'
People detached from the labour market had to be re-attached. 'Should it be
by paternalistic direction and regulation, or by maintaining a liberal
attitude and letting them make their own choices - giving them education,
training, the opportunity for different occupations . . ?'
Including the the opportunity not to work?
'Exactly. But if they take that opportunity, the consequences are a pretty
low income. I have never met anyone content to live on a bare survival
income. It takes a very strange view of human nature to think that large
numbers of people would want to be idle. Human beings are not like that.'

FT  13 NOV 93 / Arts: Exposes from the gents - Alastair Macaulay reviews
Lloyd Newson's work on 'cottaging'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEVER before has so much significance been attached to going to the gents
after the performance. DV8's latest work, MSM (which opened at the Royal
Court this week), is about cottaging - ie gay male sex in public lavatories.
As theatre, it is just so-so. As documentary, however, it is interesting.
This is not the first time that cottaging has been brought into the open. It
has been covered on television and there is a famous scene of group
cottaging in Joe Orton's diaries. But a theatre work is a uniquely public
event. You can claim not to have read Orton, or not to have watched certain
programmes; but, if you watch MSM, you do so in a theatre full of other
folk. Hundreds of you together, indeed, are watching a theatre piece about
secretive sex between men who usually never even ask each other's names.
DV8's choreographer-director is Lloyd Newson. His talent has three separate
strands: gay sociology; wit; plaintive expressionism. Compare him with a
famous gay artist like Orton, and he hardly seems an artist at all. Newson
is more like a radical journalist; he means to expose issues.
MSM features spoken passages culled from 50 interviews about cottaging.
These are selected and shaped in a thoroughly Newson style: a mix of expose,
confessional and commentary. I was often astonished by their frankness and
the seriousness of their self-analysis. Newson's wit is evident in the way
he has selected and presented them. He combines this with visual jokes such
as the episode in which five men join, with infinite absorption, in a bout
of pass-the-orange-under-the-chin.
A peculiar feature of Newson's works is that they convey no happy-to-be-out
gay pride. They are about the psychopathology of gayness. His best work,
Dead Dreams of Monochrome Men (1988; televised, 1990), was about a subject
which not many years ago would have been considered far beyond the pale for
a theatre performance: gay necrophylia. Many features of MSM recall it.
MSM's cast of seven, ranging from portly middle-age to pretty-boy
lissomeness, is excellent. Language is explicit; clothes are worn in most
scenes; the most basic acts of cottaging are indicated rather than shown
explicitly.
Like Dead Dreams, MSM is a view of gayness as a prison from which there is
no escape. The hero of Dead Dreams commits foul murders and unnatural acts.
In his home, which becomes a grotesque charnel house, the audience sees the
hell of his own mind. MSM suggests that the basic emotions and attitudes
involved in cottaging are despair, loneliness, and escapism. (Many cottagers
are married and/or bisexual.) 'I have sex with complete strangers,' one man
says, 'because it's a way of numbing my mind.'
The walls, cubicles, doors of gents' lavatories become metaphors. Early on,
while men before a wall start to loiter with intent, parts of naked torsos,
beyond the wall, rise and turn, showing the practice, the steamy fantasy and
in between, a psycholgical barrier; Through a hole in the wall, a naked leg
protrudes. A man caresses it. The nature of cottaging could not be indicated
with more loaded irony.
Newson's 'physical theatre' has become popular in recent years because it is
all about 'the body' - that big buzzword in hip intellectual circles. Not
the transformed body of academically virtuoso dance, but ordinary mortal
flesh. And a disappointment in MSM is that it focusses on 'the body' only
intermittently. MSM is 90 minutes of graphic sociology, and closer to being
a lecture-demonstration than a sustained sequence of theatrical images.
Like David Mamet's Oleanna, MSM is a less-than-great work of theatre that
nonetheless I think is worth going to see. It raises questions about what
causes men to seek homosexual sex in illicit, dangerous, and awkward
circumstances, without providing unambiguous anaswers. But like everything
Newson has made, MSM gives me a headache. Behind his wit, humanity, and
documentary force, one senses a hectoring temperament and a terrible
hysteria. Newson now knows 50 different ways of banging his head against a
wall; but it is the same head. And the same wall.
At the Royal Court, SW1, 071-730-1745/2554, until November 20.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Arts: The shape of stars to come - Pyrotechnic wizardry is
taking over cinema screens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALADDIN, Dick Tracy, Batman, Death Becomes Her, Terminator 2 . . . Have you
noticed something odd happening in cinema? It is getting harder and harder
to keep track of well-known faces and appearances. Stars vanish under mounds
of make-up. Actors mutate into cyborgs. Actresses's bodies turn into
avant-garde sculptures. And leading cartoon characters spend whole movies
making lightning transformations, like chameleons on benzedrine. We are in
the age - on screen if not off - of prosthetics, 'morphing',
computer-generated effects and other pyrotechnic wizardry.
Today's transformational impulses are less about regaining glamour, more
about reaching for the fantastical or flabbergasting. In Death Becomes Her,
Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn turned into living Henry Moore sculptures: one
with a hole in her stomach, the other with a torso twisted back-to-front by
a stairway fall. In Batman and Dick Tracy a constellation of stars, from
Nicholson to Pacino, played 'Find me' under layers of Pelion-on-Ossa
character make-up. And in every new sci-fi Schwarzenegger vehicle the hero
and/or pursuing villain are called upon to dazzle us with quick-change
routines.
Terminator 2, the most indelible of these Arnie antics, popularised
'morphing'. This is the computer-created process whereby a hero-chasing
cyborg can seamlessly transform himself from metallic robot to human and
back again: sprouting, whenever he chooses, new limbs and bio-mechanical
weaponry.
Now in Disney's Aladdin, opening in Britain next week, this fascination with
fast-track metamorphosis has entered, or re-entered, what many might think
its natural home: the cartoon. Since opening in America last Christmas
Aladdin has become, according to some Tinseltown auditors, the most
profitable film ever made. Though earning less than its only 1993
out-grosser at the US box office Jurassic Park - Dollars 210m against
Dollars 330m - its production costs were tiny and its revenue outstripped
even Disney's 1992 animation phenomenon Beauty And The Beast.
Aladdin has a mimicry-prone genie (voiced by Robin Williams) who switches
voices and faces so fast, so gymnastically, that it is a rollercoaster ride
merely to keep up. Here is Robert De Niro, here Peter Lorre; now it's Ethel
Merman or Woody Allen or an air-line stewardess. And while the voices
change, so do the features and physique. They swirl in and out of new
likenesses with such speed and virtosity that the Disney technicians had to
use new computer techniques - just like their live-action rivals - since
even the plasticity of traditional animation could not do the job.
As this trend towards show-off Proteanism in the movies grows, the message
for cultural observers is becoming louder. Cinema is feeling time and
fashion's chariot hurrying near. It is not just that an
art-and-entertainment form soon to celebrate its 100th birthday (1995) is
reaching for the revitalisation pills and knocking them back to the point of
overdose. It is that cinema is becoming aware of the threat from video,
video games and computer software: forms that have attracted more and more -
and younger and younger - spectator-participants by demolishing all
frontiers between the Possible and Impossible in visual terms.
Jurassic Park itself, plundering trick-image techniques from these upstart
technologies, proved that the way to collar large audiences today is to meld
cinema's wall-to-wall realism - what is left of it in the age of shrinking
screens - with the perceptual gamesmanship of the new audio-visual systems.
Spielberg's creature feature did this deftly enough to become the
highest-grossing film of all time and to show that in today's ludic
zeitgeist a bunch of agile, capricious dinosaurs can act a bunch of stiffly
traditional human characters off the screen. (The real prehistoric monsters
in this film are Sam Neill, Laura Dern and company.)
Jurassic Park spotlights the most dramatic development of all in these New
Age movies: they make a mockery of what we used to think of as cinema's
charisma essentials. In the past stars and their roles were expected to be
bigger than life. (Video-game heroes and villains are smaller than life and
must make up for it in speed, agility and elastic identity.) And stars,
whatever their roles, were expected to be - at core - changeless. Indeed
what defined them as stars was their ability to stand there being luminously
iconic, giant points of light on a giant screen. Dietrich or John Wayne,
Bogart or Gary Cooper, they 'acted' by sending out small, flickering signals
from a largely monolithic face and voice.
Back in those days transformational showmanship was sidelined into
lunatic-fringe genres like horror, sci-fi or fantasy (The Wizard Of Oz).
Today, though, every genre must be able to flirt with the miraculous, the
metamorphic. (A romantic weepie can have a crackpot cryogenics plot -
Forever Young; a crime-and-gangster film can have a trunkful of masks and
funny faces - Dick Tracy). Likewise every star must join in in the game of
musical identities. Tom Cruise? Bring on the balding wig and wheelchair for
Born On The Fourth Of July. Warren Beatty? Off to the Richard Nixon
Lookalike Laboratory for Bugsy. As for Streep, Nicholson, Pacino, Hoffman
and De Niro: these are character actors who have seized the throne of
stardom today thanks to an age that likes its leading players versatile,
volatile and Olympically unpredictable.
Even the recent history of the Best Actor Oscar bears out the trend. Who
have been getting the statuettes? Day-Lewis, Irons, Hopkins, Pacino: each
for playing a broad-stroke character part ostentatiously removed from the
actor's known personality and traditional run of roles.
Today there are still a few white-bread, no-change male stars like Redford,
Gere, Costner and - since Born On The Fourth as if in contrition - Cruise.
And there are female stars like Cher who go in for the full surgical
overhaul in an oldfashioned bid to become ageless icons. But exceptions
prove rules - or at least draw attention to a new trend by hanging
'endangered' signs around on a stardom style that used to be the norm but
now seems an ever rarer beacon in a crashing, changing sea.
If the waves are starting to beat against these immutables, it is because
the waves are beating against the kind of cinema - and cinemas  - that
nourished them. Movie palaces yield to multiplexes; multiplexes yield to
VCRs. And as even VCRs lose their novelty value, kids are forsaking them for
the new moving pictureland of computer games. Screens shrink; so feature
films make larger gestures and louder noises to get noticed.
In recent years the leading cultural buzz-phrase has been Short Attention
Span. But what cinema is experiencing and reacting to today is more the
Shrinking Attention Zone. Reduced frames of action; larger portions of those
frames annexed by computerwork and other brave-new-worldery; diminishing
room inside for humans who just want to be expansively human.
From now on, shrinking 'delivery systems' may dictate an increasingly manic,
attention-grabbing style of delivery. Films like Demolition Man, Last Action
Hero and Jurassic Park pile on the plot twists, animate the once-inanimate
and push their human players through ever more demanding and eccentric
hoops. Audiences - and critics - had better learn to love the new game-plan
or the game itself may leave them behind. Meanwhile beleaguered old-style
film stars, whose effortless charisma depended on those giant screens with
their giant constancy of image, may have to mimic Gloria Swanson's famous
words in Sunset Boulevard. 'I am big] It's the pictures that have gotten
smaller.'

THE QUESTION-mark is vital in Radio 4's New Society? that begins this week.
Four writers give their views of life as they see it. Dave Hill, a
sociologist new to me, reckons to see sexual deviance everywhere. David and
Andrew live together and give elegant dinners. Their neighbours accept their
hospitality without questioning their sexual affairs. Rude word games are
common, and Ann Summers parties. In today's society there is much dispute
about what is wrong and what is not.
Victorian values, it seems, never bit too deep. Erotic books were traded.
There was 'quite extensive' fraud; what are now categorised as 'dangerous
drugs' were obtainable at the chemist's by the housemaid for the home. Lord
Deedes, for many years editor of the respectable Daily Telegraph, kept his
potentially offensive news firmly on page 3; he reckoned morals were much
the same in all classes. If we follow John Major's advice about Victorian
values, they must be properly discussed.
For a long time I have reckoned that the BBC's best radio drama is Radio 3's
on Sunday night and Radio 4's on Monday. Times change: two weeks running,
Radio 3 has given us duds. Joy Hendry's The Wa' at the World's End on
October 31, about the bedridden Scots poet William Soutar was simply dull.
Authentic, yes - it was derived from Soutar's own Diary of a Dying Man.
Nothing in it persuaded me that he was an interesting chap, even if one
enjoys his verse.
Then last Sunday, we had Karim Akrawi's The Genie and the Playwright, a wild
account of a writer's struggles with the censor in Egypt. The Genie gave
more comment than help, though he finally took over the writer's girl. The
writer, after disputes on political, social, religious and linguistic
grounds, was advised by the censor to 'consume himself', and this he
actually did. The humour was childlike, the literary politics familiar.
Radio 4's Monday Play spread a modest plot over at least half an hour too
long. Robert Paterson's The 50 Friends of Simon Goberschmitt told simply of
the curiosity of a nice bunch of Scottish girl students about the
correspondence of this eponymous fellow-resident. Having booked in, he left
for a long time but got letters from everywhere, left unopened. In time, he
returned, with an all-too-simple explanation of their origins - and of his.
His affairs were less everyday than the students', but his story was over in
a moment, and certainly not worth waiting 90 minutes for.
A special word, though, for Radio 4's Classic Serial, John Fowles's The
French Lieutenant's Woman, ably adapted by Frederick Bradnum, which ended
this week. The characters, as vivid as on the page, were well contrasted,
and Fowles's personal interpolations into the narrative given a proper
suggestion of radio presentation. Amanda Redman as Sarah, David Threlfall as
Charles and Teresa Gallacher as Ernestina hit their several marks precisely
under Janet Whitaker's direction.
Stacey Aumonier, a familiar magazine-writer of the 1920s, has been accorded
a season (two stories, two dramatic adaptations) on Radio 4. They are highly
imaginative, full of bad jokes, but just as acceptable as they must have
been in the Windsor or the Strand or wherever. I think he really belongs on
Radio 2, where yesterday's stars are celebrated.
Really funny people are adept at spotting the mechanics of other people's
fun. Miles Kington, who is funny, began It's a Funny Old World on Radio 4 on
Wednesday. An examination of the humour of different lands, he had an easy
start with the Irish. How will he fare with the French, next week, or the
Jamaicans after them?

FT  13 NOV 93 / Arts: An open race for also-rans - The Turner Prize is
moving even further away from its original rubric
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT IS to be done with the Turner Prize? Here it comes again, marking the
silly season between Bonfire Night and Christmas with easy copy for the
Tate-Baiters. Clearly it is a hopeless case, and here we all are, standing
round the expiring patient, knowing just what the doctors should do if only
they would listen.
There always was a good case for generous prizes for the visual arts, and
Pounds 20,000 to the winner is certainly generous, though by no means
exceptional these days. The trouble with the Turner is that from the start,
and in the name of one of the greatest of painters, it laid claim to honour
and distinction above all the rest. Its rubric has been watered down over
the years from the 'best' or 'most significant', but still it reads: 'for an
outstanding exhibition or other presentation of work in the 12 months
preceding June 30 1993.' That shift from definite to indefinite article may
betray a certain loss of confidence in these correct and sensitive times, an
unwillingness to accept, perhaps, that there should ever be such things as
winners and losers. Even so, with its banquet and its speeches and
presentations on prime television, the Turner Prize is hardly yet a
shrinking violet.
For my part I could never see anything wrong in the idea that the art world
should have some fun and self-congratulation at the end of the year, with a
bit of a punt on the side. Any such race should be open, fair, and run under
consistent rules. It is the inconsistency of the Turner Prize that has so
fatally undermined its credibility, when all we want is to see the best set
against the best in a fair test.
Why is it that the Prize should latterly have been reserved for artists
under 50? Why should the nominations from which the jury picks the
short-list not be published? How is it that the sponsor, Channel 4, has been
allowed to limit the size of that short-list for its own broadcasting
convenience? Why has the Prize allowed itself, through its short-lists, to
become so narrowly identified with the experimental and conceptual, in
sculpture especially, at the expense of broader qualities and interests? To
ask for rational answers is to whistle in the wind.
This year the Prize is as loaded towards the conceptual as usual, and to
installation in particular, with two sculptors and a photographer set
against one abstract painter in a field of four. Hannah Collins (37) takes
photographs of decaying city streets, symbolic figure subjects and
still-life, which she blows up portentously large. 'Discussing a landscape
work . . . (She) said, 'I look in the back of the camera and work out the
relation between the viewer and, say, the height of the mountain in the
desert' . . . This approach . . . tends to produce . . . a dramatically
enhanced realism.' She is currently concerning herself with the movements of
refugees and economic migrants into Europe.
Vong Phaophanit (32) is a Laotian now living in England. He makes
installations, works tailored to the particular place and circumstance in
which they are to be shown. His 'Neon Rice Field', a set of low ridges of
heaped rice, with pink neon strips glowing along the troughs between, was
first shown at the Serpentine in the summer and is here reworked. It is
extremely seductive in a quietly theatrical way, redolent of the raked Zen
gardens of the Buddhist tradition.
Sean Scully (48) is the painter, his large, block-like panels, with their
bold rectilinear motifs and thick, lush paint, has the physical presence of
high relief. In terms both of colour and image, he imposes one set of strong
and simple values upon another, leaving them to fight it out. The resulting
accommodation is neither arbitrary nor strident, but oddly spiritual, grand
and monumental.
Rachel Whiteread (30) is preoccupied with the interior volumes of things.
From making casts of the insides of baths and basins, she moved on to
casting whole rooms, spaces as it were turned inside out. Lately she has
given a whole house the treatment in the East End. Her work stimulates, at
least in the first instance, a compulsive conceptual engagement. Whether it
bears endless repetition is another question.
The Turner Prize of 1993 seems to be a fairly open race for once, with
Scully to win from Whiteread, Phaophanit a decent each-way bet and Collins
the outsider.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Arts: Free Spirits electrified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUITARIST John McLaughlin is electrified again. After a long relationship
with the acoustic instrument and natural accompaniment, the super guitarist
has teamed up with heavyweight drummer Dennis Chambers and Hammond organist
Joey DeFrancesco to form an electric and electrifying new trio.
The British fusion pioneer is always good value. He seems to carry good
karma with him whatever the material, from improv to flamenco by way of
Mahavishnu. Free Spirits, as the three month old group is to be known, is
different again and does not disappoint. McLaughlin, coiffed platinum hair
and tanned complexion, in overpressed casual clothes, looks just like the
well-to-do Yorkshireman who now lives in Monte Carlo that he is.
DeFrancesco, winding up the Hammond into action, has the appearance of a man
who does not get out from behind the keyboard much. Chambers, a terrifying
spectacle in cap and headphones, if firmly rooted behind a large drum kit
which trembles in front of him, like a dragster with the handbrake on.
Between them they provide strangely contrasting textures in this mix of new
and old McLaughlin composition. The classical, sometimes Spanish tones of
McLaughlin are intermingled with RSI defying, squiggling solos; the
right-handed, shrill treble of the DeFrancesco's urging in the foreground.
Chambers, who is known as a powerhouse drummer, rumbles behind, controlling
the dynamic in a sometimes overwhelming manner.
In a concert of two halves at the Festival Hall on Tuesday, the first set
worked beautifully as an extension of what has gone before with McLaughlin.
Sensitive balladeering mixed with chattering solo parts from each corner of
the trio gave way to convivial and folky swing. In a peaceful moment without
Chambers, DeFrancesco emerged from behind the organ keyboard to duet with
the by now peripatetic leader, on wistful and often Milesian muted trumpet.
After the interval, the mood changed, however, with the trio slamming into a
soul jazz session, which slid greasily into a long and gratifying blues jam.
Possibly not planned as such a lengthy work-out, tremendous reaction from
the packed house prolonged McLaughlin's heroics and egged Chambers on to
greater, more deeply bruising snare action, cleverly lifting and lowering
the tempo on the cymbals.
As a precursor to the recording promised for the New Year, the omens are
good - though Strong Spirits might be a more appropriate name for this tough
trio.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Arts: In praise of youth - This adolescent Hamlet explains a
lot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the best Hamlets you are likely to see has arrived at the Donmar
Warehouse, the smallest of London's mainstream theatres. There are many
virtues in Stephen Unwin's production for the English Touring Theatre
(formerly the Century Theatre), but the greatest of all is youth.
Alan Cumming's Hamlet is a very young man, perhaps still an adolescent. This
is not the way the Prince of Denmark is usually portrayed: even the text
suggests that he must be at least 26. Yet to play him younger explains an
awful lot.
This Hamlet is an only child with all the arrogance of an advantaged
background. True, he has most of the qualities that are attributed to him.
He can fence: he can remember huge chunks of Dido and Aeneas from a single
hearing, and he has good manners when he wants to, mainly to outsiders like
the Players.
He can also be petulant, rude and immature. He cannot understand that his
mother can still have sexual desires at her age - she must be at least 45.
Nevertheless, he still longs to be mothered and there are early moments when
he seems intimidated by his step-father. He is a clever boy, but dreadfully
spoiled.
Cumming's Hamlet is not the glass of fashion. He dresses in a black T-shirt
and short black leggings. He has wildish hair which he keeps pushing back.
Everyone else is smarter. But again this is the only child, born to be king,
doing what he likes.
Cumming's one very distinctive trait is to speak with a Scottish accent
while the rest of the cast is English. He also has a marvellous talent of
appealing directly to the audience. He delivers his soliloquies as if he
were thinking of the words for the first time - the idea of staging a play
to catch the conscience of the king seems to come to him suddenly out of the
blue.
It is not all Cumming, however. There is a style to Unwin's direction which
runs throughout. When Pip Donaghy's Claudius comes to his own soliloquy, he
has the same technique of eyeing the spectators. The Donmar Warehouse is a
wonderful place to do this.
Some of the other characters come out in new light. Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern are not the customary stooges and sycophants. Sometimes they
behave like the older boys in the school who might just give Hamlet a
roughing up him to teach him a lesson.
There is a moving Ophelia played by Hilary Lyon who, like Hamlet, seems to
weep real tears. Gertrude is played by Eleanor Bron not as a particularly
sensuous-looking woman, but one who goes along in a practical way with
remarriage when her husband dies. Apart from Laertes, whose character is not
defined, this is one of the hardest parts in Hamlet. Ms Bron carries it off
by not over-acting.
There are some cuts. The production is not as magisterial as the recent
Royal Shakespeare Company's. But the narrative flows - the piece still lasts
3 1/4 hours, the bare stage at the Donmar is just right and it is good that
the Hamlets should be getting younger.
Donmar Warehouse until November 27. (071) 867 1150

FT  13 NOV 93 / Arts: Massenet plays the tune - At last this composer is
being taken seriously
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR BRITISH lovers of French opera in general and Massenet in particular,
the prospect looks exceptionally fair at the moment and over the next few
months. Three rarities from the last period of his astonishingly fruitful
40-plus years of operatic production are being revived: the 'lyric tale'
Griselidis (1901) on the medieval legend of patient Griselda and her trials,
just opened in an absolutely smashing student production at the London
Guildhall School; the 'fairy-tale' Cendrillon (1899), one of the best of all
the many operas on the Cinderella story, by Welsh National Opera from next
weekend; and the 'sung play' Cherubin (1905), a fizzing Figaro sequel, at
Covent Garden next February. To add to the tally, an important new recording
of the 'heroic play' Don Quichotte (1910) has just come out, with the
leading Francophone singer of the day, Jose van Dam, in the title role.
To Massenites this is all bounty, though entirely their due and, indeed, not
before time (for budgetary reasons Covent Garden's 1990 staging of Don
Quichotte was cancelled). But to others? I sense that the larger Massenet
battle is not yet finally won: that there remains a body of otherwise
open-minded British opera-devotees suspicious and/or patronising of the
composer and his works - even of Manon and Werther, the two Massenet operas
that, in the long years after his death (in 1912) when his reputation sank
low, managed to keep a toe-hold on the repertory.
The image of a purveyor of Palm Court fodder, bonbons succulent but
nutritionally valueless, lasted long. The smart phrases of Debussy and
D'Indy (who defined Massenet's principal working device as the regular
supply of 'discreet and quasi-religious eroticism') were regularly rolled
out. The ultimate put-down came in the Fifth (1954) Edition of Grove's
Dictionary, whose Massenet entry concluded by indicting him for
'(ingratiating) himself with that large section of the public which . . .
regards music as an agreeable after-dinner entertainment'.
Critical evaluation has changed. (In this regard, Rodney Milnes's Massenet
entry in the 1993 New Grove Dictionary of Opera, a brilliant piece of
missionary polemic, is required reading.) But in case the prejudice still
lingers against this example of a successful artist who did not set out to
be a mould breaker - who was not, in other words, the Mozart, Wagner, Verdi
or Schoenberg of his age - these four particular later-Massenet works might
have been specially chosen to mount the most telling argument for the
defence.
On the simplest level, they show how wide was his range: far from repeating
a handful of well-routined tricks, he developed after Werther a broad
spectrum of dramatic styles, comic, fantastic, legendary-romantic. He was
never a 'modern' in the sense that Debussy, creator of Pelleas et Melisande,
undoubtedly was; but examined from a vantage point in the late 20th century
where the whole modernist adventure has already been seen to have been
stringently reassessed, Massenet's retention of a 'popular' operatic manner
in which to clothe his own continual experiments with operatic form and
content does not seem so negligible an achievement after all.
And what he has to say about the human condition, in particular about the
weaknesses and strengths of the human heart, reveals through those
experiments a remarkably broad compassion. After Werther (and a couple of
minor adventures with the vogue of operatic verismo) comedy enters
Massenet's artistic range - a use of comedy poised to balance well-tried
elements of romance, sentimentality, and in certain cases supernatural
fantasy and religious effusion.
This may well be because in this later period Massenet forged his
partnership with Lucien Fugere, great comic baritone of the Paris
Opera-Comique, a stage-artist of wonderful verve, urbanity and polish. He
was the first Pandolphe (the weak father-figure) of Cendrillon, the first
Philosophe in Cherubin, the first Devil in Griselidis, the first Paris
Sancho Panza (and dedicatee) of Don Quichotte.
Whatever the reason, these later Massenet operas are all extraordinary
samples of high craftsmanship finding new, bold ways of re-inventing itself.
Application of orchestral colour becomes ever more exact. Comedy seems to be
particularly expressed through rhythmic vitality - the Devil's scenes in
Griselidis and the Windmill scene in Quichotte make wonderfully supple use
of sharp-pointed rhythmic underpinnings. This composer, one of the masters
of French word-setting, found myriad ways of extending that mastery; and in
key utterances - Cendrillon's plaintive 'Reste au foyer', say, or Don
Quixote's serenade 'Quand apparaissent les etoiles' - the economy and
aptness of the vocal-verbal union are a key part of their ineffably quiet
eloquence.
The Massenet London season begins superbly with the Guildhall Griselidis
(first British staging): any reader able to attend one of the three
remaining performances is urged to do so. In Caroline Gawn's witty, stylish,
beautifully fresh production, and in David Lloyd-Jones's excellently fluid
direction of an excellent student orchestra, the peculiar charm of the work,
part pastoral, part boulevard comedy, part romantic legend, comes across at
full strength.
In the title role the first of the school's two alternating casts introduced
to us a young soprano of star potential, Catrin Wyn Davies, with the clean,
limpid, deeply affecting manner and tone of a young Ileana Cotrubas. She and
the two leading baritones - Matthew Hargreaves light and skilful in the
Fugere part, Gwyn Hughes Jones sturdy and handsome-voiced as the crusader
knight who leaves Griselidis's virtue to be tested by the Devil - exemplify
the unusually degree of preparatory effort (particularly over sung French)
that is a feature of the show.
A brief word on the new Don Quichotte recording, only the third in the
work's history. Van Dam's subtle declamation and the close-knit partnership
he forges with the equally understated Sancho of Fondary give continuous
pleasure. Berganza as Dulcinea (in this post-Cervantes treatment not a
village whore but a sparkling, sophisticated courtesan) retains much of her
unique vocal velour, if at times too little verbal punch.
Under Plasson the flow of the marvellously picaresque score is effortlessly
judged. And yet, on returning to Decca's 1978 Quichotte, with Ghiaurov,
Bacquier and Crespin, I found a more telling recorded ambience and a more
various, vigorous, account of the whole work. As, in addition, this new
recording is full-price and the older one a medium-price reissue in Decca's
'Grand Opera' series, the advice to the consumer seems pretty clear.

MARIE-ANTOINETTE
by Ian Dunlop
Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 20, 411 pages
WHILE waiting for death in his prison cell, a victim of the Revolution he
had taken part in creating, Camille Desmoulins wrote to his wife, 'I had
dreamed of a republic all would adore. I could not believe how ferocious and
unjust men could be.' The Terror unleashed by France's revolution horrified
all witnesses by its extremity. Deep festers of gangrene had been ruptured
by the overthrow of the Ancien Regime, and the poison flowed. Tumbrils
rolled to the guillotine, and crowds intoxicated by events roared every time
the blade fell, murdering alike the overthrown and those who had overthrown
them.
It is the way of mankind, when circumstances conspire, to fasten on some one
thing as a focus for hatred or blame. In a bankrupt France where hungry
peasants and angry artisans groaned under crippling taxes, but where the
extravagant life of aristocrats and clergy continued, public resentment came
to concentrate on one person especially, as emblematic of France's ills: its
Queen, the 'Austrian whore', Marie-Antoinette. Public memory is the memory
of victors; Marie-Antoinette is she whom legend says advised the hungry that
if they had no bread they should eat cake. Perceived as rapacious,
expensive, frivolous, an Austrian spy, sexually promiscuous under the nose
of her impotent husband Louis XVI, she became the subject of pornographic
ballads and bitter hatred. Among many accusations at her trial were
allegations of incest with her small son. The sans culottes believed her
capable of anything.
Ian Dunlop's new biography of Marie-Antoinette sets out to rescue her from
this slough of calumny. Skilfully evocative of the times, the palaces, the
intricacies of court life and the history of Louis XVI's family and circle,
Dunlop's account is frankly partisan. He is an admirer of the sweet-faced
princess who, married by proxy to the Dauphin of France at 14, had to assume
the role of consort in the world's most glittering monarchy. His portrayal
of her is seductive; he makes excellent use of the many contemporary letters
and journals which convey the affection and respect nourished for her by
those who knew her well. Even her gaolers came to love her, and wept when
the tumbril carried her away.
Against the legend of the royal family's callous frivolity and indifference
to France's suffering, Dunlop gives us a picture of an anxious but largely
ineffectual Louis XVI trying to practice economies in the running of his
many huge and decaying palaces, and a Marie-Antoinette writing to her
mother, Marie-Therese of Austria, to tell her of the touching affection of
the peasantry for their King, despite their hunger and taxes.
Dunlop brings Versailles and Fontainebleu vividly to life, along with the
ceremonial and intrigues of court. The history of 18th-century France flows
turbulently behind, giving one a sense of the inevitability of disaster.
Around the figure of Marie-Antoinette accumulate the incidents,
miscalculations and unlucky accidents as in the case of the Diamond Necklace
scandal, in which she was the victim of a criminal conspiracy that in the
public mind metamorphosed a fairytale Queen of France into 'that Austrian
bitch'.
France's story in Louis XVI's reign is one of hubris, vainglory and
stupidity. Neither the royal pair nor their ministers were unaware of
France's ruinous finances and the people's suffering. But the clergy and
aristocracy vetoed all demands to pay taxes. Those who were to die under the
guillotine paved their own path thither with their cupidity and
short-sightedness. The system's inflexibilities meant that France's
government behaved as if Louis XIV still reigned. But time, credit and the
people's patience had run out.
Seen from the broader view, France's King and Queen forged their own fate.
But theirs is an intensely moving story nevertheless, so skilfully told by
Dunlop that one has to force oneself periodically to remember that this
piercing tragedy is itself merely the peak of a mountain of injustice. a And
that is why a charming but after all self-indulgent young woman came to be
murdered to satisfy the rage of an entire people. Where the degree of
tragedy is measured by the height from which its sufferer falls,
Marie-Antoinette's life is a tragedy on the grandest and most instructive of
scales.

his monumental works
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS

<TEXT>
RODIN: THE SHAPE OF GENIUS
by Ruth Butler
Yale, Pounds 19.95, 591 pages
TOWARDS THE end of his career Rodin acquired a following among famous and
fashionable people in Edwardian England. One of the earliest to perceive his
genius was the poet WE Henley, coiner of the phrase 'bloody, but unbowed' -
a highly Rodinesque sentiment. Rodin carved portraits of prominent Tory
politicians like George Wyndham and Charlotte Shaw commissioned Rodin to
make a bust of her playwright husband. The Shaws went to Rodin's studio at
Meudon and despite the language barrier the two geniuses got along
splendidly.
Rodin's young secretary, who happened to be the German poet Rilke, marvelled
at Shaw's energetic way of posing, '. . . his whole personality seems to
become concentrated essence'. Rilke invited the American photographer Alvin
Langdon Coburn along. Not content with just having his portrait sculpted,
Shaw insisted on posing in the nude in the manner of Rodin's 'The Thinker'.
Coburn's photograph of this piece of Shavian effrontery is reproduced in
Ruth Butler's thoughtful new biography, Rodin: The Shape of Genius.
The photograph may be seen as an icon of the whole Rodin story. Shaw
believed zealously in the Superman, and it was Rodin who gave the idea of
the Superman palpable form in his public monuments, blending realism and
grandeur. Some of these were of heroic figures from contemporary life,
Victor Hugo and Balzac. Others from episodes in French history, the
'Burghers of Calais' surrendering to Edward III, or from classical legend
and literature. 'The Thinker', the most famous statue of the 19th century,
has its origin in Dante's Divine Comedy.
Rodin was commissioned to carve the bronze doors to the entrance to a
projected Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris. He conceived a grandiose
scheme whereby the panels would represent scenes from the Inferno, and
towering above them, he placed the brooding figure of Dante. As this figure
developed it ceased to be merely that of the poet and became a super-genius,
Rodin himself, pondering all the ills of the world.
In the end the Museum was never built but Rodin worked on at his panels,
known now as 'The Gates of Hell'. Other figures from the Gates that acquired
a separate existence are those of 'The Kiss', originally Dante's Paolo and
Francesca, banished to Hell for their illicit love.
The heroic and the erotic - these were the drives that motivated Rodin in
his re-creation of the human form from his time as an apprentice to his
death in 1917. He was fortunate to live during the Third Republic when
France became obsessed by the need to put up public monuments to honour its
outstanding men of genius but the commissions always involved tiresome
monitoring by committees responsible to those who had contributed the
funding.
Rodin's relations with these committees and with the arts ministers who
headed them were often conducted at breaking-point. He was incorrigibly bad
at meeting deadlines. This was because he tended to take on too many
commissions at once; and because he liked to ponder a major work for years
making preliminary sketches and maquettes.
Above all, the candour of his conceptions frequently affronted the
sensibilities of his employers. His 'Monument to Victor Hugo' depicting the
poet's body in the nude was luckily acclaimed when it was shown at the
Salon, but his version of Balzac - a phallic-shaped white hulk, shrouded in
his coat, gazing heavenwards through dark glasses - was too much for the
Society of Men of Letters who had commissioned it. Bernard Berenson said it
looked like a polar bear standing on its hind legs. Rejected, it ended up in
Rodin's garden.
Butler goes at great length into the long wranglings that surrounded the
creation of these masterpieces and her accounts make melancholy reading. We
could have done with more about the works' ultimate importance in the
history of art. Rodin's relations with women (dealt with very fully in the
earlier biography by Frederic Grunfeld in 1987) are just as depressing.
Butler regards the early death of Rodin's supportive and purposeful elder
sister, Maria, a nun, as the crucial trauma. Rodin found a substitute in his
first pupil, Camille Claudel, sister to Paul Claudel, a fine sculptor and
early feminist. Their affair ended suddenly in a brutal separation.
There were many other mistresses. Some were rich patrons like the
American-born Princesse de Choiseul; others were artists who sat at his feet
like the English painter Gwen John. But with none of them did Rodin manage
to sustain a satisfactory lasting relation. There is something sadly
touching in Rodin's refusal completely to discard his earliest mistress, a
low-class model, Rose Beuret.
Rose became his servant, putting up with his absence for months on end. But
he did continue to provide for her and the dim-witted son he had by her and,
somewhat surprisingly, at the age of 77 he married Rose while on his
deathbed. The nature of his private fantasies about women may be seen in the
large collection of erotic drawings discovered after his death. His work as
a whole is permanently on view in the Musee Rodin in Paris (formerly the
Hotel Biron occupied by Rodin at end of his life and bequeathed by him with
its contents to the city).
No admirer of Rodin can afford to neglect this biography which gives a
fuller account of his life than any previous one. But the writing is not
always elegant and the reader will need to look elsewhere for an appraisal
of the works. In addition to the notes and bibliography, a full chronology
of the life should have been included.

LENIN'S TOMB: THE LAST DAYS OF THE SOVIET EMPIRE
by David Remnick
Viking Pounds 19.99, 576 pages
THERE IS a certain irony in the fact that David Remnick's book Lenin's Tomb:
The Last Days of the Soviet Empire has come out now. It is only a few weeks
since communists and fascists had gathered together under red flags with the
intention of restoring the Soviet regime. The building of the White House
which two years ago symbolised the victory of democracy over communism had
now become the communist's last shelter.
Only a few weeks ago the 1991 coup, brilliantly described by Remnick, seemed
like the final agony of the old regime. After the events of October 1993 it
now seems like the prelude to a bloody tragedy. The fourth part of Remnick's
book, 'First as Tragedy, Then as Farce', perfectly describes the mixture of
heroism and absurdity in Moscow during the August 1991. However, after the
Bolshevik's putsch in October 1993, this famous aphorism could more
appropriately be reversed: 'First as Farce, Then as Tragedy'
When Remnick's book was first published in the US earlier this year it must
have read like a documentary novel, with almost no gap between the events
described in the book and the present day. Today it reads not only as a book
which deals with the past, but which belongs to the past. This is not
Remnick's fault, it just proves that Russian history is changing with
'unhistorical' speed.
In the end though, Lenin's Tomb is not a historical survey, but an excellent
journalist's novel. A reporter for The Washington Post for 10 years and now
a staff writer for The New Yorker, Remnick spent four years in Moscow from
1988 till 1992. Most American journalists sent to Moscow manage to come up
with a book about their personal experiences in an exotic country. However,
Remnick is one of the few to have written one combining an excellent
knowledge of Russia's most recent history with high literary qualities.
Although the book contains mostly well-known facts, its main value is in its
sense of personal involvement with Russian life. Yet Lenin's Tomb is not an
adventure novel describing the life of an American journalist and his family
in Russia; it is rather a careful and respectful observation of the country
and its people. It is more than likely that in 30 years time historians will
consider Lenin's Tomb historically incorrect. But this does not matter,
because the book gives a better sense of life in Russia then any history
textbook.
Remnick's book reads like a thriller. It is not hard to imagine how Lenin's
Tomb could be turned into a film script. However, the semi-fictional
character of the book at times works to its disadvantage and makes you
forget that people in the book are not characters, but real people. Russian
history is treated sometimes like a detective story where the 'bad guys',
the communists, are caught and punished at the end.
'The Trial of the Old Regime', the last part of Lenin's Tomb, about the
trial of the communist party, makes it seem that the whole history of
Bolshevism ends with the last sentence of Remnick's book. 'The era that had
begun in 1917 with the Bolshevik coup had now ended - in a court of law.'
Writing an effective finale, like this one, is dangerous, especially when
you deal with Russian history.
Lenin's Tomb does not require any special knowledge of Russia or Russian
history. It illustrates the Platonic idea that we recognise rather then
learn. The names and phrases mentioned in the book are all familiar
'Russian' topics: Solzhenitsyn, dissidents, Stalin, anti-semitism, KGB. The
word KGB in particular can be found almost on every page. Sometimes it gives
the impression that Russian social, political and cultural life consisted
only of two parts - Russian dissidents and the KGB, as if there were nothing
in between these two states, as if it was impossible to live an honest life
in Russia without being a dissident. However, in reading Lenin's Tomb the
KGB is an abbreviation not only for the organisation itself but for all the
evil in the former Soviet Union.
The book starts with a shocking scene. Russian and Polish soldiers searching
for evidence of Stalin's crimes are digging out the mass graves of 15,000
polish officers and soldiers slaughtered by Stalin, when the news of the
August coup arrives. By digging out mass graves, Russia was trying to dig
out mass memory. This powerful image sets the pattern for the whole book;
almost every story from the present day evokes a flashback to the past. From
Remnick's point of view 'The Return of History', as the Russians discover
the true nature of their past, is one of the most important conditions of
Perestroika and the new political system.
After several years of digging up the past there is now a new tendency in
society: to let the past rest. As I am writing this review the Moscow
government is discussing how to remove Lenin from the mausoleum and bury
him. Most Russians are hoping that nobody will have to dig him out again.

THE CONQUEST OF MEXICO
by Hugh Thomas
Hutchinson Pounds 25, 811 pages
THIS VAST book, the result of long years of reading and note-taking in
seemingly endless archives scattered across cope and America, is densely
detailed. Indeed Lord Thomas is ruthless in the pursuit of detail. Our
knowledge of the Aztecs civilisation or the Mexica, as he prefers to call
them, has grown, especially since the second world war, at an unbelievable
rate. Their language is now read; the structure of their empire understood;
their complex barter systems and the sophistication of their neolithic
society fully understood. Although there are many new discoveries,
fundamentally the story which Thomas tells is that of Prescott, who wrote
his great work on the conquest of Mexico 150 years ago.
Ultimately for the detailed account of the conquest, all historians are
forced back, time and time again, to the letters that Cortes wrote to his
monarch Charles V, King of Spain and to Bernal Diaz's reminiscences in old
age. Naturally Cortes's letters were written to impress, to justify, to
inflate the triumph which Cortes had achieved for Spain. As a lawyer as well
as a conquistador, he was determined above all to give a legal justification
to his conquest, in order to avoid charges of piracy or theft.
So Cortes lined up bunches of Aztecs, spectacular in their feathered
headgear and painted faces, totally mystified as he made them swear an oath
of fealty to Charles V. Of course, it impressed the Indians: they were used
to rituals, indeed their lives were ruled by them. So this ritual, bordering
on the farcical, had indeed significance. It gave Cortes the authority which
he used at once. (It was not much different to buying Manhattan for a few
pence from its native Indians).
The Aztecs had great doubts about who the Spaniards were. They could be
gods, or demons, or just super humans with strange weapons. The horses, not
many, about 17, were fearful; the cannon, very few, terrifying; the razor
sharp steel and impenetrable armour were easier to understand. Great as
these Spanish advantages were, they were as nothing compared with the
supreme authority which Cortes assumed at once.
That stunned and bewildered Montezuma. God or no God, Cortes was
incomprehensible. He paralysed his enemies. Gradually, of course, the shock,
the terror, diminished. And Cortes had fabulous luck, which is always
necessary for heroic enterprises. All of these matters Thomas describes with
measured wisdom, combined on occasion with a sly humour that jolts the
complacency of the reader. His story of the conquest, how it happened and
why it happened, carries total conviction. He makes what seems like a
miracle comprehensible.
Certainly he does what he can for the Aztecs. He quotes some haunting poems
to prove their sophistication, poems that stress the agonising brevity of
life, of love, of success but such poems are common to neolithic or early
bronze age societies - they abound, from the Han to Sumeria.
Against the Aztec practice of human sacrifice and cannibalism, they weigh as
light as a feather. Cortes destroyed the most vile society ever devised by
man. The Aztec's failure in battle was due partly to the priority they gave
to capturing alive Spaniards and their Indian allies, rather than killing
them. They ate all they caught, everything bar the head and torso. Calling
the pulsating heart streaming with blood 'Precious Eagle Cactus Fruit' is
revolting and describing death by being hacked to pieces by a flint knife as
'dying like a flower' is grotesque.
Walking in the great museums in Mexico City nothing - nothing in the world -
is so horrible, so revolting as the constant theme of sacrificial death and
festive cannibalism.
Certainly the Aztecs embroidered beautifully, their feather work
incomparable, their craftsmanship in gold exquisite, but it was an empire
best destroyed and obliterated. The relief of their Indian subjects was
almost as great as that of Cortes when he finally captured Tenochtitlan.
No society has wallowed so deeply in sacrificial blood or devoured with such
gusto the flesh of its victims.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Books: In search of Utopia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JDF JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARADISE DREAMED
by Pamela Neville-Sington and David Sington
Bloomsbury Pounds 18.99, 322 pages
I HAVE for years been fascinated by the Freelanders. Almost certainly you
have never heard of them, and they do not rate any reference in this
wide-ranging book about utopias. The 'International Freeland Association'
flourished briefly in the early 1890s, inspired by a moderately-nutty
Austrian economist called Theodor Herzka who preached the abolition of
interest rates and property rights. He sent a pioneer party of his European
followers to East Africa in 1894 to found 'Freeland' on the slopes of Mount
Kenya. The utter failure of this expedition is interesting partly because it
helped persuade the Zionists to turn down the British government's offer of
a territory for 'Israel' in Uganda. It also offers a comment on the fatal
attraction for utopianists of the reality of their dreams.
The Freelanders were just one excellent example (there must have been
hundreds of other such groups over the years), of humanity's chronic search
for utopia, and their story would have usefully illustrated the themes of
Paradise Dreamed. That is to say, they were inspired by the vision of a
single man; they followed a blueprint which had been laid down in extreme
and imaginative detail, however optimistic; they paid particular attention
to their proposed constitution; and they were the extremest of radicals in
that they were emigrants setting sail not to seek their fortune in a
transplanted Europe in the Americas or the Antipodes (as so many did at that
period) but precisely to get away from the system which they had learned to
reject.
More than that - more than the Singtons seem to admit - they were true
utopians in that they were motivated by a despair for their natal society.
This despair is surely a central element to utopianism, from Thomas More to
Aldous Huxley's critique in Brave New World. William Morris, for example,
only wrote News from Nowhere after he had lost faith in his Socialist
movement. I like to think of the Freelanders as some of the first drop-outs
of our modern age.
Pamela and David Sington have produced a helpful survey of utopian thinking,
starting from Hesiod's Golden Age but concentrating on the years since the
Renaissance. This does not pretend to be a work of original thought, and it
often reads too much like a BBC series (as it originally was, for the World
Service), fashioned into a neatly-assembled round-dozen of chapters and
including too many trim one-para summaries of this or that. But the book
serves a purpose: I don't know of a more accessible introduction to the
subject.
Inevitably, we have to be taken through the sources: Plato, Aristotle, More
('one of the founding documents of the modern world'), Campanella, Ledoux,
Bacon, Fourier, Saint-Simon, Diderot and Sade, Edward Bellamy (very keen on
Bellamy - he predicted credit cards), Morris and BF Skinner, and so on and
so forth. And Hawthorne, with this wonderful description of his own Utopia:
he 'has ventured to make free with his old and affectionately remembered
home at Brook Farm as being certainly the most romantic episode of his own
life - essentially a daydream, and yet a fact - and thus offering an
available foothold between fiction and reality'. There you have the creative
tensions in utopianism: daydream/fact, fiction/reality.
The chapters never quite focus on a sustained theme - perhaps that is left
to us. 'Utopias have succeeded in changing the world'. Well, yes, up to a
point. Both the US and the Soviet Union have been inspired by different
versions of utopia, we are told: that is a leading meaning of the 'pursuit
of happiness', and Andre Gide once described the USSR as 'a land where I
imagined Utopia was in process of becoming reality'. But there were deep
distinctions between the European and the American utopian traditions:
crudely put, the European line led from More to Rousseau to Marx and
emphasised the equal distribution of economic resources; the American came
to emphasise 'equality of condition' and therefore 'equality of opportunity'
in which individualism would easily lead on to entrepreneurial capitalism.
Marx may once have observed, of utopias, that 'the man who dreams up a
programme for the future is a reactionary', but that hardly denies him his
place in the utopian galaxy, although his visions were untypically vague and
short on detail.
We are assured by the authors that utopias are frequently realised, if only
in part, and that utopias have been among our principal philosophical and
political guidelines for 500 years. That seems too bold. Some utopias made
sense, others did not; like acorns dropping in profusion, only a tiny
fraction have ever taken root. Coleridge's 'Pantisocracy' came to nothing;
the Freelanders survived only three months in the real Africa of 1894.
Perhaps it would be good to read a more impassioned study. Whose side are we
on, Miranda or Prospero? ''O brave new world/ That has such people in it' -
'Tis new to thee.'' Discuss.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Motoring: The new Seat Ibiza
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS IS the new Seat Ibiza, smaller than an Escort or Astra but larger than
a Corsa or Peugeot 106 and exceptionally keen value with three or five
doors. Prices range from Pounds 6,895 for a 1.3-litre three-door to Pounds
11,250 for a two-litre GTi which, remarkably, has an insurance group rating
of only 10.
For several years, Seat has been part of Volkswagen. The Ibiza is the first
entirely new VW Group car to be conceived and built outside Germany. It has
the solid construction typical of VW products and seats four adults
comfortably with plenty of luggage space. The long wheelbase ensures that it
rides well.
The two I have just sampled were the cheapest 1.3-litre CL and a 1.9-litre
diesel (Pounds 7,595), also a three-door.
I found the driving position excellent, the five-speed gear-shift delicately
precise, and both handling and road-holding well up to class average.
Overall gearing was fairly low, making for lively acceleration, good
hill-climbing and flexibility in town.
I thought the CL would appeal to young buyers who would have liked, but
could not afford, a VW Golf as their first new car. The quiet and vigorous
diesel, with power steering as standard, kept up with the motorway pack and
seemed prepared to go almost anywhere in top gear.
Long-distance commuters who do not have company cars, and anyone who has to
count motoring costs carefully, would find the Ibiza diesel worth looking
at.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Sport: Jersey that built a team - Derek Wyatt visits an
ambitious club with luxurious facilities / Rugby Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEREK WYATT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST NIGHT, the club's four top XVs trained until late. Each team had been
designated one of the four floodlit training pitches. There was a coach and
a team manager watching each side go through its paces for Sunday's games.
Other facilities on the club's 45-acre site include a sports shop, a
restaurant and bar, full-time medical support, accommodation, beach
volleyball, tennis, a golf range, and a basketball and volleyball arena.
After training, the first XV held an impromptu karaoke evening with wine,
cheese and salami provided by club stalwarts.
This morning, the forwards will go through some line-outs at the main
ground. When the side assembles for brunch tomorrow at an exclusive tennis
club, the players will mentally rehearse their play and discuss the
opposition. They will then make their way to their ninth league game of the
season knowing that a loss will deprive them of the leadership of the first
division.
The club is A S Benetton Rugby TV. The TV stands for Treviso, a small,
elegant town near Venice. Benetton, as it is more familiarly known, would
sit easily in the first division of the Courage League in England.
Its facilities are the best in the world. When I watched Benetton earlier in
the season against Milan, the team played a fluid and intelligent game
although it struggled in the line-outs. At the start of the season, Benetton
beat Gloucester at home; last year, the club lost by three points to Bath.
Being so closely identified with Benetton poses problems. Benetton is
Treviso. It has grown from a small clothing venture into a global brand and,
along the way, the family has grown and accommodated similar business
cultures including Nordica (ski clothing and ski boots), Prince (squash and
tennis), Siseley (leisure clothing), Nitro (golf balls), andLangert and
Grafalloy (golf clubs).
The assumption is that Benetton Rugby is flush with money, that all its
players are lire millionaires, and that there is a benefactor who will pay
until success arrives. This is not the case.
Fabrisio Gaetaniello, capped 39 times by Italy and its captain from
1974-1983, is the sports director for rugby at the club: 'Our contract with
Benetton is renewed annually with Luciano, one of the three Benetton
brothers. They are not our only sponsors but they do give us somewhere in
the region of L700m (Pounds 290,000) each year, about a half of what we need
to run our club.
'But we have nine or 10 sides each week. We have a fully fledged schools
programme in the region and supply coaches and coaching to eight of them;
we're dealing with 300 juniors from the age of seven and upwards.
'Plus, we have a newish stadium to support. We have built two stands to hold
12,000 spectators and we have plans to develop further.'
Success is what Benetton TV craves and it has been prepared to go to the
market place and attract the best coaches and players. Until 1992, its coach
was Pierre Villepreux; under him, the club won the championship.
The new coach is Wayne Smith, a former All Black fly-half. He has immersed
himself in the local culture and can speak and correspond in Italian. (The
Italian Rugby Federation has just appointed a French coach to the national
side who cannot speak a word of Italian). In Smith's first season, Benetton
lost the championship final to Milan, its arch-rival, for which David
Campese used to play - he has now been replaced by Jason Little.
'In New Zealand, so much of rugby is automatically inherent. Here in Italy,
there isn't that tradition,' said Smith. 'Rugby is not 100 per cent in their
culture even though, in Treviso, it is the main sport.
'My job is to create a winning side and, at the same time, plan the supply
of future generations of local players. The locals love the game here and it
is the main topic of conversation at the bars. At the same time, although
they talk fondly about it, they might struggle to know where the hooker
plays.
'As a consequence, although we are allowed only two overseas players per
team, they always occupy the decision-making positions. We have Michael
Lynagh returning to us this week and I brought in Rob Penney, the Auckland
No 8, to bring some dynamics to the forwards.'
Talk of Lynagh invariably raises the question about how much players from
the southern hemisphere are paid to play in the north.
'Michael is not paid by Benetton Rugby club,' said Smith. 'And, when John
Kirwan played for us, he also was not paid, either. I have read that these
players are on contracts with us at so much a game. This is absolute
nonsense. JR did not play in the first Test against the Lions because he
wanted to play for us in the final against Milan.'
Kirwan, who is married to an Italian - Lynagh is about to follow suit - has
a business in Treviso; Lynagh works for the main company, Benetton, in
public relations. Is this any different from all those English and Welsh
first division players who hold nebulous positions in 'public relations'? I
am not sure how 'jobs for the boys' translates in Italian, but this is how
all the leading clubs in the world now work.
Smith's wish is that the Italian clubs become involved in the planning of a
European league.
'We need more sides from the UK and France to play us,' he said. 'After all,
it is quicker to travel to London, Cardiff or Edinburgh than it is to play
Catania in Sicily.'
This, and the need for an overhaul of the Italian league structure so that
it is more competitive, is what keeps Smith involved. When he returns home,
you can be sure the club will continue to think big. My guess is that Bob
Dwyer, Australia's coach, will top their list.
Llanelli has provoked the Welsh and English rugby unions to open discussions
for an Anglo-Welsh league. This would be the saviour of club rugby in Wales.
It would not offer the big English clubs sufficient incentives, nor enough
fixtures of merit. England must look to the continent of Europe as well. It
is a European Cup, including French and Italian clubs with the English and
Welsh, that is required.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Sport: The new boys prepare for the rough stuff - As the
Whitbread fleet sets sail for the roaring forties, Keith Wheatley looks at
the skippers / Sailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCIENTISTS who run tank-testing programmes to evaluate hull models for ships
and yachts have an expression for real life. They call it 'full-scale'. Nine
lightweight W60-class yachts in the Whitbread race today go 'full scale'
amid the ice and gales of the Southern Ocean on the 7,500 second leg from
Uruguay to Western Australia.
These water-ballasted sloops blast downwind at around 25 knots. As yet there
is no collective experience of how the boats will perform surfing down waves
the size of apartment blocks ahead of a 40mph wind for nearly a month. Chris
Dickson is one of the few people with a clear idea.
Dickson skippers Tokio, first leg winner from the W60 class. Earlier this
year the crew took Tokio deep south from their Auckland base into the world
of bergs and albatross. 'We had several days of 55 knots of breeze across
the deck. One of the guys had done three Whitbreads and said he had never
seen conditions like it,' said Dickson, at 32, arguably the world's top
sailor but taking part in his first round the world race.
'I surprised myself that I didn't mind the wet, cold and discomfort,' said
the Kiwi helmsman who is seen by some as the archetype of the 'attache-case
skipper'. This mythic figure moves airport-regatta-airport, in an aura of
detachment.
If anyone is seen as part of this breed it would be Britain's top sailor
Lawrie Smith. He was gazetted as the replacement skipper for the
pan-European W60 entry Intrum Justitia just a few days ago.
Like her original skipper, Intrum had a disappointing leg. Roger Nilson is
now in Stockholm recovering from a knee injury which obliged him to withdraw
from the race. Intrum finished in Punta del Este lying fifth in her class,
poor in relation to her known potential.
Nilson is a doctor by profession, rather than a full-time sailor. Nilson is
a Whitbread veteran, one of the old guard. He has completed four Whitbreads.
Smith, 36, is simply a flat-out racer he won five dinghy world championships
and skippered an America's Cup yacht by the age of 22. This is his second
Whitbread.
Smith's arrival to turn Intrum around is a measure of how this race has
changed. The 'hand, reef and steer' of the seamanship manuals has become
32,000 miles raced through appalling conditions virtually in sight of one's
opponents.
'It used to be 'safety first' and we'll worry about the opposition later,'
said Smith. 'Now it's 'Get the spinnaker up and to hell with the
consequences'.' He started this Whitbread in the radical maxi-ketch Fortuna,
but she withdrew after the giant mizzen gennaker ripped the aft mast out of
the yacht in a gale off Ushant - just two days out from Southampton.
Spinnakers and the size thereof has rather a heated subject on the dockside
at Punta. Three years ago race officials, anxious to protect the prestigious
80ft maxi class from the potential humiliation of a defeat by their new
little W60 sisters, took a policy decision: they would 'speed limit',
through technical regulation, the smaller yachts.
Angry W60 sailors refer to it as 'towing a bucket'. On this leg, for
instance, the W60s will be restricted to spinnakers half the size of the
masthead kites they used on Leg One. Safety is the ostensible reason but in
every previous race the decision over how much sail to carry safely has
rested with each skipper.
'We've thought about arguing it through but we're not so stupid as to fight
a losing battle,' said Dickson. 'If a W60 wins coming into Perth I expect
they'll invent new restrictions before we set off on the third leg. I am
quite bitter about it.'
Official plans to have a maxi as overall winner only just avoided Dickson
subversion on leg one. He finished just three hours behind Kiwi rival Grant
Dalton at the helm of the 84ft ketch New Zealand Endeavour. So keen is
Dalton to reduce weight aboard that the yacht's interior remains unpainted
in order to save 30kg or so. The black carbon fibre finish resembles a
minimalist Manhattan apartment - with about as much comfort.
Dickson's weight-saving campaign is aimed more at the crew. 'It's
democratic. Every one was given a choice whether they brought seaboots or
shoes,' explained the skipper. 'It was hard on Jacques Vincent who lost a
shoe over the side on Day Three but we lent him footwear when appropriate.'
Asked whether it was true that in a regime worthy of a U-boat commander,
Dickson had banned books aboard Tokio, the skipper replied: 'There are
several volumes. We're all now familiar with the water-maker manual and the
emergency signals at sea,' added the man who found Japanese humour much to
his taste during two years heading the Nippon America's Cup challenge.
Wild-eyed and elated after winning the Heineken trophy for the W60 class in
the first leg, Dickson stepped ashore and declared that on the evidence so
far, 'The Whitbread is three times more exciting than the America's Cup.'
'He only thinks that because he's never won the America's Cup,' growled his
old opponent Dennis Conner, skippering Winston which finished fourth into
Punta. 'Let's talk again in 32,000 miles time and see who looks bright?'

FT  13 NOV 93 / Motoring: Wiping the cheats off the road - Readers suggest
ways to deal with the unlicenced and disqualified
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESPONSIBLE British motorists who tax and insure their cars are enraged by
the way a minority puts up two fingers to the law and gets away with it.
Four weeks ago, this column noted that driving while uninsured or
disqualified no longer seemed to be regarded as serious offences. So much so
that the Association of British Insurers estimates 5 per cent of all drivers
 -more than 1m people - do not have cover. They feel the risk of getting
caught is slight, and the money they save by not buying insurance makes the
chance worth taking.
When they are involved in accidents, innocent parties suffer financially.
Generally, punishment for uninsured driving and for using a car while
disqualified rarely fits the crime. I thought it high time these anti-social
offences were taken more seriously and suggested that changing the law to
allow offenders' cars to be seized and sold might be a good idea.
None of the readers who have written to this column has disagreed. A retired
solicitor, James Inglis of Edinburgh, spoke for many when he wrote: 'If a
law is to be respected, it must be enforced without fear or favour.
Penalties should be severe enough to act as an effective deterrent, and I
can think of none more appropriate than the seizure of an offender's
vehicle.'
Most correspondents felt that catching the uninsured (and often unlicenced
and even disqualified) driver was a question of will, and that not enough
was being done. Proposals put forward included:
Local authorities should be encouraged to take powers to impose penalties on
owners who leave cars without tax discs in their car parks.
Untaxed cars left on public roads should be clamped or towed away and
released only if driver's licence, vehicle registration document, tax disc,
insurance and MoT certificate are produced within 14 days. Failing this, the
car to be seized and sold.
'If this service were privatised, with a bounty for every car legitimately
impounded . . . we would witness a revolution in resolving this aspect of
open criminal activity overnight,' wrote Les Bennett, of Bingley, West
Yorkshire.
Police should concentrate on catching uninsured and unlicenced motorists
'instead of routinely harassing otherwise law-abiding ones breaking speed
limits where no real danger is involved.'
Robert Street of Woking, West Sussex, complained that his local police had
ignored his request to check all parked cars on a local estate where at
least one in 10 had no tax disc. 'I hope you will continue to campaign
against the egregious complacency of both police and authority in general,'
he wrote.
Many writers expressed a common grievance. They are convinced there is some
kind of hidden agenda in which officialdom (the Home Office?) has told
police to go easy on tax-dodging, uninsured motorists - the New Age
travellers, for example. They resent having to pay ever-higher insurance
premiums and feel that if a minority genuinely cannot afford the cost of
motoring legitimately, it should not be driving cars, anyway.
If all readers who feel aggrieved write to their MPs, it might get the ball
rolling.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Snug in Courmayeur: Arnie Wilson on an enjoyable return to
Italy - Skiing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS IS the winter of Italy's great content. At least it will be if the snow
is as fulsome as the bookings. With the lira as weak as the pound, Italy has
rarely seemed such an attractive option. It was due for a renaissance.
When I am asked by those who have never skied there to recommend a resort
for an all-round winter holiday with reasonable skiing and atmosphere, I
usually take the easy option and plump for Courmayeur, the little resort
with a big heart and an even bigger cable-car.
'You are pleased you have chosen Courmayeur, aren't you, smarty?' asks the
smug tourist office literature. Although it failed by several whiskers to
get into my Thomas Cook International guide to Top 50 Ski Resorts four years
ago, I have such a soft spot for Courmayeur that I might think differently
now.
Charming, old back streets remind one of a set for an Italian opera: you
half expect Don Giovanni to appear from an upstairs window. It is one of
those rare Italian resorts that seems to have some of the best qualities of
alpine villages; superb scenery, rustic streets and buildings, gemutlichkeit
and terrific food.
When I first skied Courmayeur 18 years ago it seemed perfect for a
32-year-old near-beginner with much more strength than technique. Although I
took my first thrilling but faltering turns in powder there, I later began
to find the runs a little limited. It was, I decided, a pleasant, bijou
resort without sufficient skiing to entertain the more advanced skier, which
I was convinced I had become.
For a while Courmayeur drifted into a remote backwater of my brain,
remembered with affection but not much inspiration. Then I discovered two
assets that had gone un-noticed in my formative skiing years: food and Mont
Blanc (in that order.)
At 32, I had been so drunk on the joys of skiing that I used to skip lunch
regularly in the interests of plunging down the Internazionale or
Competizione and getting a good suntan (encouraged rather than frowned on in
those days.) Lunch, I knew, could drive a massive hole in your day's skiing,
starting, as it often did, at 12.30 and lingering until 2.30 or 3 pm.
As I got older, less gung-ho and slightly wiser, it dawned on me that lunch
on the mountains in Courmayeur could be a many-splendoured thing: the
mountain restaurants are delightful and the food simple but splendid. Then I
finally twigged that the Mont Blanc massif, far from being just an
awe-inspiring but untouchable part of Courmayeur's scenery, was actually
accessible. The Mont Blanc experience could be 'bolted-on' to the local
skiing. Suddenly Courmayeur seemed to have moved from a powder-puff second
division resort to serious premiership material.
There is an Italian version of Chamonix's famous Vallee Blanche, for
example, reached from nearby Entreves. Three consecutive cable cars bring
you to the spectacular Punta Helbronner (11,254 feet). From here the descent
to the start of the Vallee Blanche is steeper than the French side but at
least there is no unnerving ridge to negotiate. From the same starting
point, you can ski the Toula Glacier, a much more testing descent.
This was one of the reasons why Carol Thatcher, journalist daughter of the
former premier and a gutsy skiing companion, came down to breakfast in
Courmayeur last spring and joked that she was sending a note 'home to ma' to
tell her where her savings were in case she fell down a crevasse.
She asked if someone would ski with her rucksack for the day because it was
heavy with the entire group's salami sandwiches, adding: 'Do be careful
because it's got all my notes in it.' To which one wag retorted: 'Carol,
you'd better send another note home to ma saying: 'if whoever skies with
your rucksack falls down a crevasse, please rescue notes]''
The approach to Tula is only marginally less nerve-racking than the ridge on
the Chamonix side. After skiing down a short but very steep cliff above a
small bowl (there is a rope option that you may prefer) you must negotiate a
long flight of wooden steps. Once down, there are a number of alternative
routes. Your guide will endeavour to choose the descent with the best snow
conditions. Tula provides just the right amount of challenging skiing and
wild, desolate scenery to interest a reasonable off-piste skier, complete
with narrowish gullys and gloriously wide-open terrain. In addition,
heliskiing is available.
We enjoyed some particularly exhilarating heli-skiing on the glacier de la
Lex Blanche, which is not often skied and only made available to us because
the normal heliskiing areas at Tete de Bernard, Col Malatra and Col d'Arp
were not experiencing such good snow conditions as usual.
Our guides - who had not skied the area themselves for some time - tempered
bravado with sufficient caution to keep our nerves taut as we gingerly
negotiated our way down.
Although we could not see them, crevasses were strewn out beneath us,
concealed by the snow. Our guides were certainly earning every lira of their
wage packet that day: it would never have done to lose Lady Thatcher's
daughter or even Paul Chase-Gardner, managing director of Bladon Lines, in
an icy tomb. As it was, both he and Carol's rucksack, complete with
sandwiches, survived the day, as did Thatcher and her notes.
Arnie Wilson's visit to Courmayeur was organised by Bladon Lines, 56/58
Putney High Street, London SW15 1SF. Tel: 081-785-2200.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Gardening: London's last flower show - Robin Lane Fox enjoys
a final riot of colour and finds inspiration for the winter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE just heard the last bell of the season; from now until the early
crocuses, London's flower shows will be hibernating. Their year ended with a
memorable burst of colour. But it emphasised, once again, that keen
gardeners miss most of the possibilities if they go only to the Chelsea show
and miss its lesser relations.
When the signal sounded, the exhibitors scrambled to pull their stands to
bits. Ladies with small shopping bags made off with the last of the cut
flowers and nurserypersons dragged their exhibits out of the peat and
hustled them off to the Transit van. It all reminded me of end of term at a
boarding school. During the term, nonetheless, the British lead the world in
staging a flower show. And over the past fortnight, we have all enjoyed the
most spectacular autumn colour for a decade. The evening greyness was
gathering round Westminster but, inside the Royal Horticultural Society
hall, you could only wonder why our gardens have started to look dreary.
There was more to the occasion than Korean chrysanthemums and cotoneasters
with red berries. There were blue Chinese gentians, hardy winter cyclamen
from Cos, pink Kaffir lilies, and the brilliant red leaves on azalea Nancy
Waterer. Shows raise our notions of the possible; the weather and whitefly
do otheir best to dash them. My winter ambitions have been rising as the sap
has been falling: this final fling at a flower show has given them a new
impetus.
In November, many front gardens have seen the light already, but the shining
example for the rest of us is the family of winter-flowering viburnums. We
all know the tall, white pink forms but I am always on the look-out for the
small Viburnum farreri namum because it is only 3 ft high. It would be
excellent in a front garden or a confined space in the town if only it was
predictable.
Sometimes, this lovely Chinese shrub is covered in scented white flowers; at
others, it is nothing but leaves. I have now found the answer: apparently,
there are two forms of this small shrub in the trade and one of them is
shy-flowering. You discover the facts behind the news if you ask questions
at shows: I asked Starborough Nurseries, Marsh Green, Edenbridge, Kent,
which has seen both forms but lists only the performing one at Pounds 6.80
each.
Starborough also tantalised me with its liquidambars. These trees are much
on keen gardeners' minds because they have just finished colouring
beautifully. They have fingered leaves, like maples, and the best of the
well-known forms grow to a manageable width and turn to an unusually deep
shade of brown-red. I would always want one in a small area of rough grass
or natural shrubbery, but there are problems. Sometimes, the plants do not
colour properly, and many people say that they will grow only on acid soil.
Once again, I have better information. The colour is much more reliable if
you buy a correctly named form. Starborough sells the true deep red-brown
Worplesdon, whereas other nurseries may sometimes be supplying seedlings of
unproven merit instead. On a lime soil, there is still hope for some of us.
We should dig out a square hole about 3 ft wide and deep and fill it with
lime-free compost. Liquidambars will establish themselves in this lair and
will then tolerate a lower layer of lime or chalk.
I wait to see if this treatment will suit some of the newly-found and
unfamiliar species which Starborough is about to distribute. Two varieties,
acalycina and formosa, are trees with a promising future and planners of
collections and arboretums should check them out as soon as possible.
Acers turned up in their usual quantity from Mallet Court Nurseries, and one
of the main displays of semi-hardy chrysanthemums came from Home Meadows
Nursery. Among their bright leaves and colours, though, my eye kept lighting
instead on evergreeen skimmias. These plants will certainly grow on lime,
although not so luxuriantly as on lime-free soil. They are winners in
semi-shade, along drives or in spaces which link a house to its garden. They
also thrive in towns.
Not that skimmias had everything their own way. Wild gladioli soon drew the
attention away from their muted white; Carol Klein had plants of the
newly-found Corydalis flexuosa in full china-blue flower. We all made a
bee-line for her hardy pink chrysanthemums when the bell rang, and I added
in a rusty-brown one with small button flowers called Dr Tom Parr. Seeing is
believing with these unusually-named varieties of familiar families: a show
is the moment to decide, especially while most of the public are queuing to
dismantle the more over-sized Korean varieties which will not survive a cold
or wet winter outdoors.
The British may know how to run the best show - but they also know how to
dismantle it in 20 minutes flat. I left into the grey, high-rise concrete of
London's Victoria wondering if it had really been true - a haze of
late-berrying sorbus and pink-flowered lilies in the dark twilight of the
year. At the bus stop, somebody bumped into my newly-bought schizostylis and
bent its last flower buds. The evidence was there in my hand, although
looking rather more battered than it had only half an hour before.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Drift netting - the shame of England: Fishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE a friend, rich and powerful beyond the dreams of avarice and
ambition. There was, however, something missing from his world. He had the
ears of ministers, the respect of the makers and shakers of our society.
Opinion-formers bowed respectfully at the mention of his name. But he could
not catch a salmon. He travelled to celebrated waters, watched the fish jump
over his fly - and returned empty-handed. He learnt, to his displeasure,
that salmon paid no heed to wealth and reputation.
This autumn, my friend was invited by a friend - a man equally powerful in
his field - to a famously prolific Scottish river. I told him that if he
failed again, he should think about giving up the rigours of salmon fishing
and stick to something less demanding - such as feeding his koi carp. He
agreed; it was make or break.
The prospects, though, were grim. North-east Scotland was in the grip of a
mini-drought. The water was dead low and the famous river was showing its
bones. The sun beamed down and the fish were stale and scarce.
I should explain that, while my friend was on the Naver, I was in Ireland,
catching nothing on the Blackwater. I shall, therefore, skim over the
details of his exploits (although, should you bump into him, he will be glad
to fill you in). Suffice to say that he caught two fish, one after another,
and no one else caught anything. So now he is rich, powerful etc etc - and a
successful salmon fisherman. It is intolerable.
He would tell you that his success was due to persistence, self-belief, and
skill, My version - possibly tinged by envy - is that it was a pure,
outrageous, undeserved fluke. The truth probably lies somewhere in between.
The truism is that he caught fish, in hopeless conditions, because the fish
were there.
For the Naver, like many other Scottish rivers, has had a fine season;
reminiscent, almost, of the great days of the 1950s and 1960s before disease
and gross commercial exploitation brought Scottish salmon fishing to its
knees. The weather largely was favourable and the fish were back in numbers.
Tremendous strides have been taken to protect the dwindling stocks of
Atlantic salmon - and just in the nick of time. The chief hero is an
Icelander called Orri Vigfusson, a man of demonic energy and magical
persuasiveness, who has made the salvation of the salmon his moral crusade.
He heads the North Atlantic Salmon Fund, and his most recent coup has been
to negotiate the suspension of the Greenland drift-net fishery.
Drift-net fishing involves stretching a huge net - up to 50 miles long  -
across the salmon's known migratory routes. It can easily annihilate a whole
migration, depriving distant rivers of most of their annual intake of fish.
It is atrociously destructive and - in the age of salmon farming - wholly
unnecessary. Greenland now has joined the United States, Canada, Norway,
Iceland and Scotland in banning drift-net fishing.
And what, you might be wondering, is the British government's position on
the infamous matter of the English fishery, which operates off the
north-east coast and accounts each year for up to 80,000 salmon heading for
Scottish rivers?
If inertia and indifference constitute a position, that is the British
government's. John Gummer, as minister of agriculture, presided over a deal
to phase out the north-east fishery. It was hailed - by me, among others,
I'm sorry to say - as an important step in the right direction. It turned
out to be nothing of the sort, for it allowed the existing licence-holders
to continue their depredations for years to come.
I have no particular urge to join the queue of those wishing to put the boot
into Gummer, who has moved on to higher things. But the fact is that the
only remaining legalised drift-net fisheries for Atlantic salmon in the
civilised world are those off the north-east coast of England, and the west
coast of Ireland.
Within the past couple of months has come the news that the Irish government
is considering banning its fishery. Dublin finally is coming to realise that
vastly greater economic benefits spring from exploiting salmon as a sport
resource than from putting them in tins.
This month, a petition calling for an immediate end to the north-east
England fishery is being handed in at 10 Downing Street. Thanks to men like
Orri Vigfusson and a host of other campaigners, the prospects for the
Atlantic salmon are brighter now than for many years. Is it too much to hope
that Gummer's successor, Gillian Shephard, should rouse herself and erase a
shameful blot from her government's conservation record?

FT  13 NOV 93 / Pink Snow - FT Guide To The World's Best Ski Resorts (16):
The best brochures come clean - Arnie Wilson takes a tongue-in-cheek look at
travel operators' seasonal offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE NEWSPAPERS, big tour operators often come out with more than one
edition of their brochures - as well as an 'early booking' version - as a
way of reacting to the opposition and changing currency values.
Powder Byrne (071-223 0601) even printed two brochures at the same time: one
for regular clients ('As you have skied with us before, you already know
what to expect' etc) and one for prospective clients ('We know that you have
not been skiing with us before and we would like to change that,' and so
on.)
Most brochures suggest that every resort they feature is virtually perfect.
But Made To Measure (0243-533333) bravely lists both pros and cons. While it
says lots of nice things about the French resorts (best in Europe for the
keen skier, lift systems without equal, food 'always a pleasure,' excellent
kindergarten facilities) its 'warts-and-all' guide aims to 'represent each
resort and hotel objectively.'
The brochure adds: 'After all, you're going to discover the truth
eventually. The French can be arrogant, unhelpful and apparently unfriendly.
Two minutes later they can be humorous, and charming. Try to bear in mind
that they treat Parisians in just the same way. Don't expect the French to
volunteer to speak English even if they speak it.'
An honesty award also for Ski Esprit (0252-616789) which, among the
accolades on the back of its brochure (best skiing holiday since 1969, best
chalet food I have eaten, etc) include comments that damn it slightly with
faint praise: 'We would have personally preferred less food but better
wine,' for example. Or: 'I was not happy with the creche being in the main
sitting area. I did not ski every day but was unable to sit in the lounge
area because it was being used by children.'
Airtours' bright brochure debut (0706-260000) has an intriguing outbreak of
'nestling'. Almost all its Austrian villages nestle. Kolsaas Weer is
'nestled in the Inn Valley.' Hochgurgl is 'nestled even higher' than
Obergurgl. The Hotel Hochsolden is 'nestled in the hamlet of Hochsolden.'
Nestling is also the undoing of Inghams (081-785 7777) - but not until Page
160 of an otherwise slick and professional brochure. Then it contrives to
have Jackson Hole 'nestling astride the magnificent Grand Tetons.' Other
inappropriate expressions include a suggestion that Snow King, a resort at
'Jackson Hole Town' (the town is called Jackson - Jackson Hole is the ski
resort) is 'for beginners.' It may be small, but Snow King is far too steep
for that description.
The Swiss Travel Service (0920-463971) brochure writer's favourite word is
'superb.' Apart from 'superb child reductions' on every page (I cannot
recall meeting a superb child on a skiing trip) Murren has a 'superb run'
from the Schilthorn and the Grand Hotel Victoria-Jungfrau at Interlaken and
the Hotel Carlton in St Moritz have 'superb views.' The Grandhotel Tschuggen
at Arosa has 'superb gala dinners,' Lenzerheide has 'superb open slopes' and
Saas Fee has a 'superb indoor complex.'
Ski Enterprise (061-745 7000) also appears to cater for gifted children  -
and adults. It has 'Amazing Child' and 'Brilliant Group' discounts.
Ski Thomson's brochure (081-200 8733) contains 'An Important Note About
Children.' It boils down to the fact that normally children under 16 are
banned from chalets. Thomson adds, however that: 'If you book the whole
chalet, your party can consist of as many children as you wish (subject to
the total number of people that your chalet will sleep)'.
Under 'useful information' about its Snow Train, Thomson announces: 'Six
people share each couchette.' Difficult - even if you tried it with six
children. Thomson also points out that since train compartments are mixed,
'loose clothing rather than nightwear is advised.' Is this to encourage or
discourage nocturnal liaisons?
And what of Touralp's (071-602 1952) 'Snooze 'n Schuss' offer? Is this a
reference to dreaming about skiing? Or sleeping on the chairlift? It turns
out to be a ski-pass/bed package which is usually cheaper than buying them
separately.
Was Sally Line (0732-780499) snoozing when it was producing its brochure?
Does it matter that the Matterhorn, partly in Switzerland and partly in
Italy, suddenly turns up in France at Val Thorens? Or that the Vallee
Blanche is the Valley Blanche and Alpe d'Huez suddenly doubles up to become
Alpes d'Huez? Probably not.
Interski (0623-551024), a minnow based in Sutton-in-Ashfield,
Nottinghamshire which offers Courmayeur and La Thuile - produces an
excellent 41-page Holiday Guide to its skiing activities. Illustrated with
cartoons, the booklet deals with every aspect of a skiing holiday.
Ski The American Dream (081-552 1201) wants you to imagine 'the largest
country in the world covered with deep light powder snow.' This might be
something of a shock for Texas, Louisiana and Florida, but it would
certainly give The American Dream some interesting new resorts to sell.
Ski brochures are a great way to get yourself in the picture. Ian Prevett,
who designed this year's brochure for the Courchevel 1650 chalet specialists
Le Ski (0484-548996) made sure he starred in his own production by putting
himself on the front cover. And Colin Mathews, managing director of Meriski
(081-682 3883), based in nearby Meribel, has put himself on pages two and
three - and a back view on page 16 - of his brochure.
Andrew Dunn, whose Ski Scott Dunn brochure (081-767 0202) is again perhaps
the best of the crop this year, has been more subtle: he has splashed his
bride-to-be Jane over the front of his brochure. But it is an anonymous rear
view of her golden locks.
FlexiSki (071-352 0044) prides itself on offering ski holidays spanning
virtually any number of days from two to 22 or more in Courchevel and
Verbier. James Armitage of Simply Ski (081-742 2541) modestly claims that
its new luxury Chalet L'Ancolies in Courchevel 1850 'leaves all our rivals
standing.'
One of those rivals, the Ski Company (071-730 9600) prides itself on all the
extras (including drinks) it throws in free. Indeed, Steve Cox, a
restaurateur in Richmond, south west London, takes a party of up to 10 to
one of its luxury French chalets every year because he thinks the company's
prices - though by no means cheap - are good value: 'Our drinks bill at a
hotel would be enormous,' he says.
'Only one family ever exploited our drinks-on-the-house policy,' says the
Ski Company's David Kemp. 'A group from Finland could hardly believe that
alcohol - so expensive back home - was available for nothing. They were
pouring out tumblers of vodka. But they were such good clients we didn't
mind.'
On the other hand La France des Villages (0449-737664) promises 'very
sensible prices' for its first venture into the ski market at
Champagny-en-Vanoise. 'By not adding extras you may not require,' says
Nicholas Brimblecombe, 'we believe you will find our prices give unequalled
value for money.'
Oliver Ensor operates a home-from-home at the Chalet Savoy (010 33 50
545706) where, he writes in his brochure 'it's as though Mont Blanc were in
the garden]' Obviously this did the trick for one client - 'The skiing
terrain was exactly what I was looking for,' is the testimonial from 'Brian,
Alaska.'
Chamonix provides a plethora of British tour operators using high-mountain
guides for off-piste adventures: Roland Stieger, the fearless and funny
Frenchman, features in Ski Weekend's brochure (0367-252213). The fact that
Colleen Gerrand of Collineige (0276-24262) is married to Jean-Marie Olianti,
the guide Collineige uses in its 'First Tracks' off-piste skiing programme
in Chamonix, does not give her exclusive use of his skills. He is much in
demand both in the Alps and other parts.
First Tracks should not be confused with Fresh Tracks (081-875 9818) which
also specialises in off-piste skiing in Chamonix, Flaine, Verbier and the
now legendary La Grave. YSE (081-871 5117) which specialises in chalets in
Val d'Isere, has a particularly mouth-watering brochure and one of the most
original front covers: an old photograph of a pipe-smoking, presumably
French skier in plus-fours and a tie executing a Monsieur Hulot-style
snowplough.
Snowtime (071-433 3336) another operator based in a single resort (Meribel)
where it has prospered for 16 years, reassuringly states that: 'We tend to
preclude beginners from ski guiding.' I think I know what Snowtime is
actually getting at. The brochure adds: 'If you're able to handle a red run
without too many spills this is a rough guide to whether you should join a
ski guide.' Well, sooner a rough guide than a beginner]
The travel industry throws away about 40 per cent of the 120m holiday
brochures printed each year, many of them dumped unopened. AITO, the
Association of Independent Tour Operators, with 37 skiing members, is
funding an investigation by Green Flag International, an environmental
organisation, into ways of reducing this wastage. Good idea. With fewer
brochures to wade through, I might have more time to ski.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Pink Snow - FT Guide To The World's Best Ski Resorts (14):
Virtually the real thing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOLDSMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCIENTISTS IN Japan have developed an electronic simulator that will give
skiers the sensation of skiing while, in actuality, they remain at a fixed
spot, writes David Goldsmith. The simulator is based on virtual reality, the
brain-deceiving computer science.
The idea that your grey cells can be taken over by a computer linked to a
skiing machine and video monitor might strike you as scary. Even more
sinister is the fact that it works.
NEC, the electronics and communications corporation, claims it is the first
company to think of applying virtual reality to skiing. Because of the
complex feelings fed back by skis - slipping, sliding, acceleration and
deceleration - it faces a formidable challenge. The NEC project is based at
a research building on the west of Tokyo. A chalet-free zone, the place
seemed an unlikely location for a ski run. Project manager Asao Kaneko
explained the principles of NEC's technology. 'We started in 1988. It is
based on the concept of a virtual slope to enable you to ski and practise
with no snow.'
I was taken to the lab, stacked with computers. A group of technicians
hovered around me. Playing for sympathy as the human guinea pig, I received
puzzled glances. In reality (virtual or otherwise) I felt like Frankenstein
Goes Skiing.
On one side of the room was the raised skiing platform. Mounting it in a
pair of standard ski boots I was instructed to step on to a pair of short
skis supported by hydraulic pistons. Mr Kaneko handed me an electronic
sensor to slip over my finger. 'That will measure your blood flow and
determine your stress level,' he said.
Gripping the handles of two ski poles permanently planted in the deck, I
felt the skis float upwards on their hydraulics. Hovering above the
platform, waiting for the skis to start tipping and rolling, was unnerving.
The 'ant's head' virtual reality helmet, usually associated with this type
of technology, had been replaced with a giant projection screen in front of
me that proved more capable of providing the feeling of open vision on a
mountainside.
Five bleeps signalled the start of the run and the huge computer-generated
image burst into life: a strange rolling snowscape of mountain peaks and
crudely exaggerated features at close range: trees and giant slalom gates
that popped alarmingly out of the piste, just a few yards ahead.
My skis were represented by two yellow ski tips at the bottom of the screen.
The objective was to ski around the obstacles by applying turning pressure
to the skis. By switching weight between the two skis I found myself
narrowly avoiding the hazards, but it was hard work. My stress level was
evidently too low because the run then became even trickier. As obstacles
flashed and zoomed in front of me I fought to control the skis.
Skiing over each bump and undulation in the run, there was an uncanny sense
of unweighting and forward motion. The hydraulic skis tipped me forward and
backward to simulate acceleration and deceleration. Particularly impressive
were the feelings of traversing the slope and the camber of the bumps.
In all, the equipment delivered a far closer sense of the real than I had
expected. As a former ski instructor I could see its potential for teaching
in safety, not to mention a lot of fun. NEC plans to launch virtual reality
skiing in Europe in the next two years.

When the balloon goes up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

RECENT visitors to the Alpine ski slopes may have noticed an increasing
number of skiers belonging to the ABS club. That, at least, is what it looks
like, as more and more skiers don bright red or purple rucksacks with ABS
printed in huge letters on them.
In fact, the letters stand for Avalanche Balloon Securesystem, and the
rucksack contains a clever device to help the adventurous skier survive an
avalanche.
The device consists of a large folded fabric balloon and a small aluminium
cylinder of nitrogen under 300 bar of pressure. In the event of an
avalanche, the user pulls a ring at the end of a cord on his chest - rather
like that for a parachute. This causes a pin to puncture the seal of the
nitrogen capsule and the nitrogen inflates the balloon.
The idea is that the resulting increase in volume per unit of weight will
make the body lighter than the snow, and so the skier will rise like a cork
to the surface of the avalanche flow.
As roughly 80 per cent of skiers killed in avalanches die from asphyxiation
after being buried, the device should save a lot of lives. Last winter,
Florian Schamaun, a guide at Davos, was caught in an avalanche while leading
a group in the Wolfgang area. 'Luckily I was the only one caught, because I
was the only one wearing the rucksack,' he says. 'It carried me 500 meters
and I ended stuck in the snow with my head sticking out. Without the
rucksack, I would not be here today.'
Ueli Gantenbein, head of the Davos Ski School, says that from now on all its
guides and customers who ski off piste will be required to wear an ABS
rucksack.
Many private guides have already adopted ABS. Bruno Sprecher, who guides
Prince Charles among others, was an early convert, and his small shop in
Klosters is filled with ABS rucksacks and promotion material.
The guides welcome ABS, not only as an additional element of security, but
also for professional indemnity. 'It could possibly reduce negligence
claims,' says John Hogg, a guide at Andermatt. 'If you have used every bit
of safety equipment, then you have a better defence in the case of an
accident.' But he adds: 'It is not foolproof. The user has to remember to
pull the cord.'
Peter Aschauer, the German developer of ABS, is the first to underline the
limits of the system. It is not a life-saver, he points out. Used properly,
all it can do is help someone be rescued. It does not guarantee that the
person being rescued will be alive or uninjured.
Aschauer, a marketing consultant who is a powder ski enthusiast, heard about
the concept in 1980. He contacted the inventor and bought the patent. By the
mid 1980s, after tests in different snow conditions, he arrived at the
optimum size for the balloon and weight of the rucksack. He then lined up
suppliers for the main components, restricting his own activity to
assembling the rucksacks at his home near Munich with a few friends.
Active marketing, if that is the way to put it, began in 1988. Aschauer
refuses to sell the system to just anyone. He fears that the inexperienced
punter would take it as a guarantee that he does not have to worry about
avalanches any more. Thus, he sells only through licenced guides, ski
schools and mountaineering shops.
Still, word has spread quickly. Last season, he sold 700 rucksacks and, on
the basis of orders already on hand, he expects to sell more than 1,000 this
year. So far, he sells only in Europe and doubts that he will ever be able
to sell in the US because of the high risk of facing astronomical product
liability claims there.
The rucksacks come in three sizes, with storage space from nine to 36
litres. Overall weights range from 3.6 kilogrammes to 4.9kg (the system
itself weighs 2kg), and prices from DM1,600 (Pounds 650) to DM1,915 (Pounds
778). Expensive - but one could save your life.

If the ski boot fits, wear it - David Goldsmith helps you pick a vital
accessory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOLDSMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SKI BOOTS are probably the heaviest, most formidable and most alien footwear
one can encounter in life, so individual experiences of them tend to be
memorable.
When I was working as a ski instructor in Cairngorm in Scotland 19 years ago
I owned a pair of uncompromising jet-black boots, later viewed as classics.
They were Lange Worldbeaters and they were as stiff and as strong as tanks.
Lange was about the only piste-credible ski boot brand of that era. Only a
few years earlier Lange had been the first mass-producers of plastic ski
boots, while the world still thought and worked in leather.
That memory sprang back last spring at the Munich sports fair, where the
world's equipment makers show off their gear for the year to come. I sat at
Lange's glitzy stand and clipped on a pair of 1993/4 racing boots. The cosy
liner bore no comparison to the punishment I had endured in my 1974 boots
but the shell remained an unmistakable Lange, with its angular lines and
micro-adjustable clips.
The colour, however, had mutated into a weird shade of metallic lilac.
'There was a mix-up in the colour mixing department and they decided they
liked the mistake,' said Gordon Fraser, the young and enthusiastic Scotsman
who imports Lange boots into the UK.
Deja vu and colours aside, the experience brought home the extraordinary
revival of traditional clipped boots this winter. Manufacturers and skiers
are increasingly reverting to traditional four-clip boots; shells have
reverted to conventional overlaps with a tongue you pull out. The rear-entry
boot, with all its advantages of easy walking to ski lifts, easy putting-on
and taking-off, and often blissful comfort, is being swept aside.
The current turmoil in the market is as much to do with a fashion revival as
it is to a lack of common sense. The ski industry is led by an elite -
racers and instructors - whose opinions tend to colour the better judgment
of the salesman in the ski shop.
Ski boots are very personal things. In a lifetime you can count yourself
fortunate if you score two or three really successful (as distinct to
memorable) purchases. The rear-entry revolution of the 1980s was very much
led by consumer demand for more comfortable and practical footwear. The
elite, however, designed the performance out of them by filling their shells
with ridiculously soft and sloppy padding.
Currently, ski boots are available with every kind of entry - rear, mid or
front. However, the skiing performance of a boot relates very little to how
you enter it. A ski boot's primary function is to encase your foot in a firm
close-fitting environment, with a shell that does not allow too much wobble
of the lower leg.
Classic boots - those that excel against the criteria of comfort, control
and convenience - tend to be a better bet than the untested experiments that
flood the market every year. One or two of the following should be worth a
try, but remember that fit is a personal thing. Best buys do not really
exist in ski boots.
BOOTS TO LOOK AT
Salomon rear-entry: Nine years on from the classic Salomon SX91 of 1984, the
direct derivatives are still superbly designed and practical boots. Models
73 (fine for a beginner or intermediate) through to 93 (advanced/expert) are
particularly recommended. The advantages of these boots are instant entry,
memory of tightness, easy walking and the best flex control on the market.
Tecnica TNT AVS: A bright orange, head-turning expert boot with a good shell
design and superbly constructed inner boot. Has an anti-vibration sole.
Raichle Flexon Slalom: A comprehensive re-design of a classic racing boot.
Fine inner boot and interesting new clips which can be opened but re-locked
at the same tightness.
Lange Mid/Rossignol Mid: Similar designs (Rossignol owns Lange). One of the
better mid-entry designs, with a clever system that automatically locks the
forward lean for skiing when the second (of four) clip is tightened. Overlap
shell. Good intermediate's boot.
Nordica Vertech: A new variant of a traditional four-clip boot. Easy entry,
because of a translucent soft overleaf of plastic under the clips which is
fused to the main shell. Good intermediate/expert boot.
Salomon Evolution: One of three new design strategies of Salomon (the others
are the Integral and Optima) with novel features. The Evolution is the
closest to a conventional front-entry boot, but has an easily turned dial at
the back which releases the back for comfortable walking. Intermediate to
expert model options.
MAKING THEM COMFORTABLE
The most miserable thing you can face on a skiing holiday is not bad weather
but a painful pair of ski boots. 'Ski boot pain enters a different dimension
of suffering,' says David Allsop, in The Bluffer's Guide to Skiing. 'Chafed
calves, bloodless toes, suppurating blisters, mind-numbing cramps, bruises
on bruises and toenails which curl up like poppadums. If you invest in only
one item of ski wear equipment, make sure it is a ski boot which fits.'
This is indeed no bluff, but there are many ways to remedy ill-purchased ski
boots. The best ski shops are equipped with heat-stretching devices, clamps
and grinding equipment. Foam padding and custom-moulded insoles can be used
to relieve the pressure and muscular points that cause hell.
The experts in this field include a French company called Sidas, which makes
custom-fitted ski boot insoles, among other things. In Britain its equipment
and materials are deployed at a number of ski shops; Europa Sport
(0539-724740) has information.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Property: The enduring joys of Gloucestershire - Gerald
Cadogan explores a county with Roman roots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHEEP have shaped Gloucestershire. Without them, it would not be the the
attraction it is (despite the horsey exploits in Jilly Cooper's novels). For
one thing, they have paid for the county's desirable residences, which the
Romans were the first to build.
The National Trust's Roman villa at Chedworth shows how a working estate
processed the wool. The reception rooms were heated to a standard not
achieved again until this century, and were floored with mosaics. The
Cotswold demand was enough to support a school of mosaic-makers in Corinium
(Cirencester). A favourite subject for this Roman equivalent of the Wilton
carpet factory was the Greek hero, Orpheus, charming the animals.
In the Middle Ages, the wool financed great churches like Fairford and
Cirencester; the manors, rectories and farmhouses that are popular places to
live; the stately homes; and the old market towns. The weekend retreats of
Eurobond dealers in 1993 began as shepherds' cottages.
As buyers stream to Gloucestershire, it is hard to envisage the county as
the depressed backwater it was between the first and second world wars.
Employment was scarce in the villages.
Motorways have helped to change that, though. Tucked into the north-eastern
angle of the M4/M5 crossing, and bisected by the Romans' Fosse Way that
leads cross-country to Leicester, the county is accessible to the whole
country.
Outdoor pleasures await. Even for hopeless shots, it is a joy to meet in a
farmyard at 10 on a crisp winter morning for a day of tramping the hills in
a rough shoot for pheasants. And gardeners can choose their Mecca, too. In
the north of the county, near the picturesque (and touristic) Chipping
Campden, the shrines of Hidcote and Kiftsgate sit as twins on either side of
the road. Hidcote is on the high ground, Kiftsgate terraced into the scarp
where the Cotswolds drop down into the Severn valley.
Demand is keen now for top-of-the-range houses, and prices often are higher
than in counties to east and west. Some houses sell before they are ever on
the market formally, such as the grade I Daneway House near Cirencester -
medieval, with arts and crafts associations from the turn of the century -
which Knight Frank &amp; Rutley sold recently at more than the guide price of
Pounds 700,000. The agent told 12 likely buyers - and three bid.
The middle price range has been moving more slowly in recent months,
according to Antony Brassey, of Lane Fox in Cirencester. One on his books
(with Strutt &amp; Parker) is Rivermead House, on the edge of Lechlade, for
Pounds 345,000. (The river is the Thames which rises nearby).
For the same price, Jackson-Stops is selling Fennells Home Farm at Lypiatt,
near Stroud, with five acres and an annexe for help or granny. The house is
a good example of Gloucestershire vernacular: roofed steeply, with
warm-coloured stone walls broken by mullioned windows.
Leasehold flats in Sherborne House, an early-19th century pile near
Cheltenham which was converted in 1982, could not be more different. Lane
Fox offers one for Pounds 125,000 and (with Hamptons) another for Pounds
145,000. The leases have 988 years left at a ground rent of Pounds 20 a
year.
Cottages and village houses are on offer from Hayman- Joyce, Hurley Lloyd
Thorpe and Mallams. Two smart, late-Georgian boxes are the Old School House
at Aldsworth, near Bibury (Mallams, Pounds 155,000), and Malvern House in
Blockley (Hayman-Joyce, Pounds 245,000).
Two interesting town houses are Church House at Moreton-in-Marsh
(Hayman-Joyce, Pounds 185,000), well placed for the Tuesday market and
eating at the Marsh Goose as well as for being devout next door; and the Old
School in Cirencester (Lane Fox, Pounds 355,000), listed grade II with a
large panelled drawing room which was the school room. The house goes back
to late medieval times.
Kingsmead House at Didmarton, with three cottages, a stable yard and 10
acres, is ideal for those who want to hunt with the Beaufort and be close to
the horse trials at Badminton. But there is also a good garden to look
after, including a 'house' with windows and doors clipped out of yew trees.
Savills is selling it for Pounds 1.2m.
With an acre less, but only Pounds 320,000 from Humberts or John Goodwin, is
the brick Witherdine Farm at Redmarley, 10 miles from Gloucester and two
miles from the M50.
Glebe Farm at Saintbury, between Broadway and Chipping Campden, has 16 acres
and costs Pounds 390,000 from Andrew Grant. Babdown Farm is a Victorian
house near Tetbury with 214 acres (plus the chance to buy more) and barns
with planning permission. It is on offer from Knight Frank &amp; Rutley for
Pounds 850,000.
From its new Cirencester office, John D. Wood is selling the Georgian Ferney
Hill, a handsome house on the west edge of the Cotswolds, for Pounds
450,000. Melksham Court at nearby Stinchcombe is a large example of Cotswold
vernacular, with 36 acres and a fine garden. Price: Pounds 650,000, from
Bennett Jones or Jackson-Stops.
If you fancy a mill, four are on the market. Cheapest is Millers House,
outside Lechlade, which is only a part of the mill on the river Leach
(Mallams; offers over Pounds 120,000). The best known is Arlington Mill, on
the river Coln and next to the trout farm in the much-visited village of
Bibury. It was set up as a museum in 1966 and, if the buyer wants to keep
that, some of the contents may be for sale. Lane Fox is asking Pounds
250,000.
The same agent is selling Siddington Mill, on the river Churn, for Pounds
445,000 and (with Savills) Sheppards Mill, an old woollen mill restored in
1983 at Uley, in the west of the county, for Pounds 395,000.
Further information: Bennett Jones, Dursley (0453-544 500); John Goodwin,
Ledbury (0531-634 648); Andrew Grant, Worcester (0905-24 477); Hamptons,

FT  13 NOV 93 / Property: Deadline near for council tax appeals - Cadogan's
Place
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HURRY, IF YOU have been thinking of appealing against the banding for
council tax that your home was given earlier this year. November 30 is the
deadline for submitting an appeal to your local authority, which will pass
it on to the Inland Revenue's district valuer.
Eventually, he will examine the home, compare it with others in the
neighbourhood and decide on the right band after discussion with you or your
surveyor.
The Revenue hopes to settle most cases without tribunal hearings. That is
sensible, as the sums involved (the Pounds 50 or Pounds 100 difference
between the bands on the council tax bills) do not justify expensive
proceedings. But it will take time. Up to the end of September, 700,000
appeals had been lodged in England and Wales and there is certain to be a
final flurry in the next fortnight. Appeals submitted in April and May have
often not progressed beyond an initial acknowledgement.
The number of appeals looks smaller, however, if compared with the
more-than-21m abodes that have to pay the tax. Most home-owners must be
satisfied - or, at least, are prepared to acquiesce in the rough justice of
the new system which makes those who live in larger properties pay more.
There have not been any revolts against paying similar to those after the
poll tax began its short and troubled life.
Council tax is a simplified form of the old rates, based on a notional
capital value in April 1991 rather than a notional rental value, as rates
were. The task given the valuers (which were commercial firms) was to divide
the country's homes into eight bands, from A (less than Pounds 40,000) to H
(more than Pounds 320,000). The valuers were not allowed to go inside and,
as their fees per property were not large, had an incentive to be quick. But
they could consult the rating records (with details of square footage,
bathrooms, lavatories, etc).
If you wish to appeal because you think your home is in the wrong band,
telephone your local authority to find out its procedures, or go to a
chartered surveyor who handles these cases. One such is Paul Lester, of
estate agent (and surveyor) August &amp; Lester in Banbury, Oxfordshire. He
says: 'After 30 years of looking at houses, I can say at once if it is worth
appealing.' If so, the fee ranges between Pounds 50-125 plus VAT, depending
on the size of the property.
In discussion with the district valuer, the bandings of similar houses in
the same street or nearby are the telling argument. Appeals are more likely
in the lower bands, as they are narrower and so give more scope for
misplacing a property. The biggest problem Lester finds, though, is
explaining that the imputed April 1991 values are no more than that. They do
not indicate what the house would fetch if sold now.
Some owners of larger houses have worried they are in too low a band, rather
than the usual complaint of being too high. They fear this will affect the
re-sale value of their property. Is there any substance to this? 'No,' says
John Lowe, of Savills in Banbury. 'Nobody in their right mind would buy a
house based on its banding.' If the band is less than you expected, that is
your good luck.
Appeal if the band seems too high and if it is worth the cost but do not
worry if it seems too low - that is the agents' message.
* * *
NOVEMBER 30 is also the day of the first autumn Budget. It is hard to
predict how it will affect the property market, which has not advanced as
fast as many agents expected in the summer except for very expensive houses.
There have been some premium prices for them because the supply is still
short, as a market survey from Lane Fox reports. Buyers fear that if they do
not secure a place now, it will be some time before an alternative is
available.
Such attitudes should encourage more potential vendors to chance the market.
And it could help those who have to move for family or job reasons, and have
the worry of possible negative equity, not to think so much in terms of
pounds and pence but of bricks and mortar. They may receive less for their
house - but the new one will cost less. Currency is not an absolute
criterion.
If you need to move but feel hamstrung, discuss the matter with your
mortgage provider; there might well be a solution. With the present level of
demand, good houses are selling quickly. Why you have to move, and where you
want to go, are quite as important as what your present place will fetch.

The pistes of 42nd Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF THE many joys of skiing in the US is sharing chair-lifts with
strangers. A leisurely ride up a slow-moving quad provides an opportunity to
swap stories, tell jokes, compare experiences, pass on useful skiing tips .
. . and score some drugs.
Score some drugs? I'm not talking about Vail or Breckenridge here. This is
Hunter Mountain, a couple of hours' drive north from Manhattan, and New
York's favourite ski resort. At Hunter, when someone raves about the white
powder, they may not be talking about last night's snowfall . . .
It was at Hunter, one freezing January morning, when a friend was offered
some drugs on the chair lift by a couple of affable Cubans, just up from the
city for the day in their wrap-around shades and expensive ski duds.
There was nothing threatening about the invitation, they just wanted to cut
a little profit while making their way up the mountain. My friend declined
politely. The Cubans were clearly unperturbed by her refusal, because they
went ahead and enjoyed a quick smoke while they ascended. As the two skied
past us at the top of the lift, grinning cheerfully, they left behind a
pungent, sweet, instantly recognisible aroma.
Hunter Mountain is to skiing what the South Bronx is to urban living: it's
rough and tough and far from perfect, but for many people it's all they have
got. And it can be a lot of fun - if you are in the right mood, that is.
Where else in the known world would they name ski runs after city streets?
At Hunter you can ski down 42nd Street, Broadway, and Madison Avenue. And
where else would a resort name a run after something as hideous as the Belt
Parkway, a traffic-snarled dual carriageway which snakes its way around the
ugly underbelly of Brooklyn?
Brash, noisy, chaotic and not a little mad, Hunter is New York on skis. And
like New York, it is sometimes a dangerous place to be.
Don't get me wrong. It is not dangerous in the sense that you might get
mugged in the lift queue by someone toting a gun (although you never know).
No, it can be dangerous because the slopes are very crowded at weekends, and
New York's skiers take on downhill runs in much the same way as New York's
cab-drivers take on Fifth Avenue in the middle of rush-hour: at breakneck
speed and with little regard for safety, either their own or anyone else's.
The men are the worst. They ski with an extravagant abandon, eager to
impress their pals and gals with daring, dashing moves, even if it means
ending in a crumpled heap at the bottom of a green run. Hungry for attention
wherever they go, they love to talk - or rather, shout - while on the move.
In Wengen you might hear yodelling, in Val D'Isere, 'bonjour'. In Hunter,
it's 'Yo, Vinny]'
The woman can be just as terrifying. They hurtle past you trailing expensive
perfume and huge hair, jewellery glinting in the sun, cherry-red lips
mouthing a silent scream and brightly-painted eyes wide with fear and
excitement. Beware anyone in their way.
And at Hunter, you end the day like you would any normal, frantic, crazy,
New York day - jammed into a packed bar, downing cold beers and slinging
back vodka shots alongside your new friend, Vinny.
Klosters, it ain't . . .

Ski the US, more ups, few downs - Arnie Wilson explains why the American
approach is winning more and more fans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY MAKE snow in America while the reddening leaves are still clinging to
the aspen trees. They started over two months ago. In Copper Mountain,
Summit County, for example, the first snow cannon were switched on back in
September. That is the first secret of skiing in the Rockies.
The second is probably the pleasant, painless and ultra-civilised queueing,
monitored by (usually) unofficious lift attendants. There is little more
infuriating - except perhaps being cut up in slow-moving London traffic -
than a bunch of Euro-yobs pushing, shoving and elbowing you in a lift-queue,
trampling all over the backs of your skis in the process. In the US queueing
 -when necessary - is usually as genteel as waiting to meet the bride's
parents after a wedding, or forming a line to meet your hostess at a
Buckingham Palace garden party.
When snow arrives 'on time' in the Alps, and keeps coming, aficionados of
European skiing do not concern themselves with the US, where making snow is
a multi-million dollar industry. But when - as happened frequently in the
late 1980s - the snow record in Europe is poor, the US suddenly becomes a
very attractive option.
The truth is that America is always an attractive option, even when Europe
has good snow. No one would deny that in terms of size, scenery and vertical
drop, Europe has a distinct edge. But in terms of the overall quality and
pleasure of a ski holiday experience - that sometimes elusive cocktail of
good snow, well-groomed runs, enjoyable ski-school, inspiring scenery,
pleasant company, entertaining apres-ski and sheer joie de vivre - America
competes favourably.
The seemingly inherent friendliness and politeness of Rocky Mountain
Americans usually extends from the ski areas to the local towns. In the
hugely atmospheric old mining town of Telluride, Colorado - where traffic
moves at a snail's pace anyway - if a driver senses that you are even
thinking of crossing Colorado Avenue, he will slow down even more to let you
pass. Telluride must be one of the most difficult towns in the world in
which to get run over.
Which is yet another reason why, when asked which are the best ski resorts,
I usually say that although the French resorts of Val d'Isere,Tignes and the
huge Trois Vallees region of Courchevel, Meribel, Les Menuires and Val
Thorens are probably the best in the world, my personal favourites are the
likes of Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Telluride and Aspen, Colorado and Taos, New
Mexico.
As a matter of routine necessity, in order to start business at
Thanksgiving, the traditional opening day of the season on the last Thursday
in November, American resorts use artificial snow to create a huge undercoat
for the real thing when it arrives - hopefully soon afterwards. With trails
frequently reaching 10,000, 11,000 or even 12,000 feet or more, the ski
areas are high enough and cold enough in the autumn to become a snow-making
factory.
Even in the much lower Appalachians, New England winters are sufficiently
cold for snow to be manufactured on a huge scale. Killington, which
traditionally races Keystone, more than 2,000 miles away in the Rockies, to
be the first big ski resort to open in October, is a veritable snow factory,
churning it out by the ton on at least one big run on each of its six
mountains. Thus skiing on a hard core of trails is virtually guaranteed year
in, year out.
Some small American resorts without the capital to invest in snow-making
have simply had to close. In most European resorts - even those which
invested heavily in snow-making after the barren winters of the late 1980s -
snow-making is not quite the same concept. It is still seen as a way of
keeping existing natural snow topped up and repaired. If real snow does not
arrive at the right time, many European resorts are struggling, either
because they have not installed snow cannon on enough of their pistes, or
because temperatures are not low enough to make snow.
It is sometimes claimed - usually by people who have never skied there  -
that American runs are too short and American food, though served in
generous quantities, is too bland. I have never once reached the end of a
trail and thought: 'That was disappointing. It was all over almost before it
began.' A vertical drop of 3,000 or 4,000 feet is quite sufficient for most
skiers to attempt without getting puffed out and welcoming a ride back up,
so what difference does it really make whether you ski one long run or two
or three shorter ones? As for the food, there has been a transformation in
the quality of American cuisine in most of the big American ski resorts, if
not the rest of America. A French lady of my acquaintance remarked on it
herself - unprompted - during two visits this year to the Colorado resorts
of Aspen, Crested Butte and Telluride, where an international clientele has
encouraged the proliferation of skilful European chefs.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Seasonal food and drink - The best of British: Thirty young
super chefs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER THE past couple of months two serious criticisms have been levelled at
the standard of cooking in British restaurants.
The first came via Adele Biss, chairman of the British Tourist Authority,
who, after a tour of BTA offices in Europe, reported that the most frequent
inquiry from those planning to visit Britain is not concern about the
weather but about the food.
These ungrounded fears were given credence by a survey in The Economist on
the quality of life in Britain. Restaurant cooking here, it moaned, was not
comparable to that of France or Italy. It said Britain was a great place to
live if you liked 'ethnic food' and fish and chips.
I do not wish to sound John Bullish but this is balderdash. The improvement
in cooking skills over the past 20 years has been as big as that in the
quality of British produce.
Here are my top 30 'young' British chefs with apologies for any omissions -
it could easily have been 50. (Phone numbers are 071 unless stated).
LONDON
Philip Britten, The Capital Hotel, SW3 (589-5171). Smart British cooking and
particularly good value at lunch.
Stephen Bull's Bistro EC1 (490-1750), Restaurant W1 (486-9696). A thoughtful
and intense chef. The former site noisier, hotter but cheaper than the
latter.
Sally Clarke, W8 (221-9225). The freshest produce, simply grilled. One chef
who gives equal importance to salads and vegetables.
Richard Corrigan, Bentley's, Swallow Street, W1 (734-4756), is a chef with a
talent for preparing pork.
Johnathan Hayes, Chinon, W14 (602-4082). An underrated and under-exposed
talent.
Simon Hopkinson, Bibendum, SW3 (581-5817). Exquisite food in exquisite
surroundings, unfortunately now at very high prices.
Philip Howard, The Square SW1 (839-8787). Modern, rather worked, food in a
modern setting near Christie's.
Martin Lam, Ransome's Dock, SW11 (223-1611). A family affair. His wife works
on the pastry section.
Alastair Little, W1 (734-5183). Exciting cooking, the benchmark for other
British chefs.
Rowley Leigh, Kensington Place, W8 (727-3184). The number one in terms of
quality of food to quantity of customers served.
Mark and Max Renzland, Le Petit Max, Hampton Wick (081-977-0236). Fabulous
French food and great value prepared by twin brothers from Essex in the most
unpretentious surroundings.
Gary Rhodes, The Greenhouse, W1 (499-3331). Not the founder of the oxtail,
salmon fish cake and steamed pudding repertoire but one of its most eloquent
exponents.
Adam Robinson, The Brackenbury, W6 (081-748-0107). Serving good food,
Robinson is at the forefront of the culinary 'rat-pack'.
Bryan Webb, Hilaire, SW7 (584 8993). An industrious Welsh chef often
utilising the best Welsh produce.
Marco-Pierre White, The Hyde Park Hotel, SW1 (235-2000). Obviously talented.
Will his new surroundings deliver calm and consistency?
Anthony Worrall Thompson, dell'Ugo W1 (734-8000), Bistrot 190, SW7
(581-5666).
REST OF ENGLAND
David Adlard, Adlard's, Norwich, Norfolk (0603-633522),
John Burton-Race, L'Ortolan, Shinfield, Berkshire (0734-883783).
Paul Heathcote, Heathcote's, Longridge, Near Preston, Lancashire
(0772-784969).
Sonya Kidney, The Marsh Goose, Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire
(0608-51981).
Terence Laybourne, 21, Queen Street, Newcastle (091-222 0755).
Christopher Oakes, Oakes, Stroud, Gloucestershire (0453-759950).
Stephen Smith, Restaurant Nineteen, Bradford, Yorkshire. (0274-492559).
Michael Womersley, Lucknam Park, Colerne, Wiltshire (0225-742777).
SCOTLAND
Andrew Fleming, One Devonshire Gardens, Glasgow (041-339 2001).
Nick Nairn, Braeval Old Mill, Aberfoyle, Stirling (08772-711).
Andrew Radford, The Atrium, Edinburgh (031-2288882).
Ferrier Richardson, October, Glasgow (041-9427272).
NORTHERN IRELAND
Paul Rankin, Roscoff, Belfast (0232-331532).
WALES
Christopher Chown, Plas Bodegroes, Pwllheli (0758-612363).

FT  13 NOV 93 / Seasonal food and drink - The best of British: Shop until
you drop for quality - Cookery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE old proverb says, you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs.
I would add that you cannot hope to make a really good omelette without good
butter and good eggs.
Equally, you cannot expect to create authentic quennelles de brochet sauce
Nantua without first tracking down a trustworthy source of fresh pike and
freshwater crayfish. In other words, good cooking begins with good shopping.
If you know what to look for and where to buy it, you have the edge over
other cooks. So, whether your culinary aspirations are modest or incline
towards supercheffery, one of the first things you might sensibly put on
your next shopping list is Henrietta Green's Food Lover's Guide to Britain
(BBC Books, Pounds 9.99). This is a shopping primer by the greedy for the
greedy, a directory of some of the best food producers and food shops in
England, Scotland and Wales.
Like all guide books, this one is out of date in a few places even before it
reaches the bookshops. The index is much less helpful than it might be. The
boxed recipes that are dropped in here and there seem to me quite
unnecessary. I find they distract from the main thrust of the book.
It is, I suppose, in the nature of an anthology to disappoint sometimes by
omission and to raise queries about what is included. An anthology reflects
the compiler's tastes, not the reader's, and Green displays an
understandable urge to leaven her listings of well known and established
producers and shopkeepers with less obvious names and new 'discoveries'.
Some of them possibly more novel than great finds?
Maybe I am carping. The value of the book vastly outweighs its shortcomings.
Green has packed in an impressive great deal of research and she uses her
head as well as her stomach. This is not just a source book, listing
addresses and services, though there is plenty of that. It is also - and
this is the great forte of the book as I see it - richly informative about
how various foods are farmed and produced. It is opinionated, very readable
and fun, a book to dip into and to learn from.
Now that many good food producers sell via special courier delivery rather
than an expensive shopfront, Green's book should prove valuable reference
for armchair shopping. The other natural home for the book is the car. Along
with Ordnance Survey maps, restaurant guides and an up-to-date copy of
Historic Houses, Castles &amp; Gardens, I see it as part of the traveller's
basic library for weekends away and holiday rentals exploring the
countryside.
Flicking through the pages heightens my sense of wanderlust. I have half a
mind to set off now for Charles Trollope's quince farm at Clay Barn Orchard,
near Colchester in Essex. Or to St Ann's Well in Buxton, Derbyshire, where
you can take your own bottles and fill them for free with mineral water.
Even more beguiling is the thought of visiting Coads Green, near Launceston
in Cornwall, where Barbara Lake makes clotted cream and clotted cream butter
entirely by hand using the milk of her eight Guernsey cows.
Nearer to home for me is the Oxford Pick-Your-Own Shop, Elsfield, nr Oxford,
which Green commends for its unrivalled choice and for encouraging the
customer to pick (or dig) young and small. The selection (according to
season) includes globe artichokes, mangetout peas, round carrots, patty
pans, yellow courgettes, green and ruby spinach, pak-choi, Florentine
fennel, celeriac and pink fir apple potatoes.
At Shipton Mill near Tetbury, Gloucester,(tel: 0666- 505050), she tells us,
there are more than 30 different flours to choose from, 'including four
different grades of rye flour . . . and a ciabatta flour milled from a blend
of hard American, Canadian and a little English wheats.'
The entry for F C Phipps, of Mareham Le Fen, near Boston, Lincs
(0507-568235) rejoices that this is a traditional pork butcher who buys on
the hoof, slaughters in his own slaughterhouse, and makes fine hams,
sausages, pies and Lincolnshire chine, a local speciality cut that is cured
and lavishly stuffed with green herbs. It also tells the tale of Mr Phipps'
adamant defence of Lincolnshire chine. He took on MAFF and the EC and won.
Lincolnshire Chine lives on.
At Inverawe Smokehouses, Taynuilt, Argyll (08662-446) Green falls for trout
roe botargo 'bright orange with a mild saltiness and a delicate taste of
fish . . . poor man's caviar but far more interesting than the ubiquitous
lumpfish roe'.
Some of her highest praise is reserved for fruit vinegars made by Martin and
Aline Parsons of Womersley Crafts &amp; Herbs, nr Doncaster, in Yorkshire
(0977-620294). These are 'serious vinegars'. The difference between them and
other fruit vinegars is 'like trying to compare an industrially made
balsamic vinegar with a traditionally made one. Basically you can't'.
She gives the method, offers some suggested uses and lists the choice of
flavours: loganberry, mulberry, blackberry, pink and yellow raspberry.
Equally carefully made and intensely flavoured, from the same makers, are
French tarragon and dark opal basil herb vinegars and a range of 11 softly
set herb and flower jellies.
Note: where telephone numbers are given, items are available by courier
delivery service.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Seasonal food and drink - The best of British: Wagga Wagga
in Berkshire - Jancis Robinson raises her glass in appreciation of English
wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'England is the least advanced place I've ever been to.'
THIS IS the sort of thing that gets John Worontschak into trouble with
fellow winemakers in England. And how about this extract from an article he
wrote in last month's Which? Wine Monthly about his introduction to English
wine: 'On arrival in 1988, I tasted many bottles of weird-sounding wine -
Reichensteiner, Schonburger, etc - all of which purported to have captured
that delicate and crisp nature that only England's gentle summers can
provide.
'What I had in my glass was generally thin, over-acidic, oxidised, phenolic
and reeking of hydrogen sulphide. My lecturers at wine college used to
doctor down wines to this standard and mark the bottles: 'For teaching
purposes only. Do not drink'.'
Worontschak's fax machine at Twyford in Berkshire has since been buzzing
with incoming invective addressed to 'Arrogant Aussie' and worse. He swears
there are English producers he admires: Three Choirs in Gloucestershire, for
instance. But what must be all the more infuriating for his critics is that
Worontschak's English wines are so good, picking up a disproportionate
number of accolades and awards.
They have done so by ignoring the German recipe used by most English
producers and making dry, fruity, reasonably full-bodied, sometimes oaked,
rarely aromatic wines. He has applied theory learnt at Wagga Wagga in torrid
New South Wales - of all places - to England's quintessentially cool climate
in which grapes have to struggle to ripen at all. This year, though, with
its lack of warmth and surfeit of rain producing the worst vintage he has
seen since arriving at Thames Valley Vineyards in 1988, should certainly
test him.
It started when Worontschak, in his late 20s and having worked 17 vintages
in three continents as a cellar rat and progressing towards becoming a
consultant oenologist, had despaired of finding the right wine job in France
and was working in tele-sales in London.
Out of the blue, he rang a much older Wagga graduate in viticulture, Jon
Leighton, knowing vaguely that Leighton had returned to the English home
counties where he had spent his youth. Leighton finds himself with 28 acres
of Berkshire vineyard because 'for some reason I went to the English Wine
Festival in 1978 and haven't been quite the same since'.
Leighton is a first-class empirical vine grower, forever refining his
trellis systems and pruning regimes, but was in serious need of help in the
winery. Ecco Worontschak. By the 1989 vintage, many thousands of pounds had
been spent on the sort of batterie de cave that a modern Australian
wine-maker demands: the gentlest of air bag presses shielded carefully from
oxygen; a crusher that filters out the astringent stalks which Worontschak
thinks mar so many other English wines; the filter that allows them the
luxury of using only free run juice in their own bottlings and transforms
the pressings into usable raw material.
But one small winery in some old Berkshire farm buildings was unlikely to
hold Worontschak (ex-Penfolds, ex-Mondavi, ex-Beaune) for long. Thus was
born the Harvest Wine Group, an association of about 10 vineyards all over
southern England for which Worontschak helps make the wine, either at
Twyford or on the spot. A recent visit during the vintage was punctuated by
telephone messages for Worontschak such as: 'He's got the grapes sitting in
the press, but he doesn't know what setting he should have it on.'
The full Harvest Wine Group range (of about 500,000 bottles in a good year)
is sold by a third colleague based in another spartan outhouse at Thames
Valley Vineyards. Maurice Moore also displays a degree of professionalism
that is rare in the renascent but still miniature English wine business. The
entire range is on sale here at ex-cellar, or farm gate, prices.
But he can also talk major multiples with the best of them and has
negotiated own label English wines chez Tesco and Safeway for under Pounds 4
a bottle. The focus of the group, however, is on making money out of English
wine by selling serious quality at serious prices, rather than bottled
souvenirs on the tourist trail.
A new round of spending has therefore been embarked upon, on the
champagne-making equivalent of one of those John Bull DIY printing kits sold
in the 1950s and 1960s: lone automatic riddling pallet, mini disgorger etc.
The long term aim is to transform more than half the Twyford grapes into
bottle fermented sparkling wine (prizewinners on naming this stuff to be
announced shortly).
This takes advantage of their innate high acidity and neutral flavours,
while adding value (for which read price). They claim that their top of the
line fizz Leightons, made from Champagne grapes to be released next year at
about Pounds 12, has been taken for Bollinger by some Champenois.
Good on them. I have tasted only their lesser sparkling blend of English
grapes, Ascot at around Pounds 9.99, and was less impressed by it than by
HWG's admirable range of still wines, which I have served with pride.
Worontschak has been hired by Tesco to make 1993 wine on its behalf in the
Czech Republic and will probably be working for the company in Cyprus, South
Africa, and possibly even Tasmania, next year. Coals to Newcastle, surely?
Wines to confound sceptics: Stanlake 1992, Safeway Pounds 3.99; Heritage
Fume 1992, Pounds 5.49 Thresher next month; Mersea 1992 about Pounds 6.50 at
Thos Peatling, Lay &amp; Wheeler of Colchester and some branches of Waitrose;
Valley Vineyards Fume 1991 (English Wine of the Year), Pounds 7.99 Thresher
Wine Shops and Bibendum of London NW1. All these wines are available from
the Harvest Wine Group, Clocktower Mews, Stanlake Park, Twyford, Berks. Tel:
0734-344290. Fax: 0734-320914.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Seasonal food and drink - The best of British: How Britons
keep their bottle - Giles MacDonogh samples some beer . . . with a little
help from his friends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS PART of a series of occasional beer tastings at the Weekend FT we decided
to look at British bottled bitters and bottle conditioned ales. In the last
few years there has been a laudable tendency to want to put traditional
British ales back into bottles and the results are stocked by supermarkets
as well as wine chains.
In many cases the beers are simply bitters, pasteurised and carbonated to
give them sufficient shelf life to please the supermarket buyers and then be
run off into glass. Others are real bottle-conditioned ales to which the
brewers add sugar and yeast to keep the beer fresh and lively until the
moment comes to drink it; a bit like a cask-conditioned beer writ small.
These were some of the best beers we tasted.
The age of tin has not yet passed, nor have the years of unrestricted
canning helped traditional brewing skills: many brewers seem to have lost
the knack of knowing how to keep beer alive in bottle. One can only hope
that with time they will be able to iron out these problems. Only one beer
in our tasting survived the introduction of tin and that was the legendary
Worthington White Shield.
Once again the team was composed of lain Loe from the Campaign for Real Ale;
Max Wilkinson, Weekend FT editor; and myself. We tasted 26 beers and scored
them out of 20.
1) 16.4. Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout, Oddbins Pounds 1.49. Something of a
speciality drink: an old fashioned dry stout with a hefty 7 per cent
alcohol. This beer put Wilkinson in mind of smoked duck, which is not as
far-fetched as one might think, the beer is distinctly smoky with good
bonfire aromas and a liquorice-like taste.
2) 15.7. King &amp; Barnes Festive Ale, Oddbins Pounds 1.39. Our panel was
deeply impressed by this authentic bottle-conditioned ale with its big,
fruity aroma and taste.
3) 15.5. Batemans' Victory Ale, Oddbins Pounds 1.49. Brewed to assert the
independence of this Lincolnshire brewery which has been plagued by takeover
bids, this strong ale has complex aromas of malt and hay with a full,
refreshingly fruity taste.
4) 15.3. Worthington White Shield, Tesco 79p. This much-loved old favourite
has returned in a new bottle which seems to have been designed to prevent
you getting at the yeast. The panel found a slight bottle variation but in
the end there was considerable praise. I noted a yeasty fruity note:
apricots and pineapple, almost like a German wheat beer.
5) 14.8. Shepherd Neame Spitfire Ale, Safeway Pounds 1.49, Tesco Pounds
1.39. This bottle-conditioned ale was originally brewed to celebrate the
50th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. Iain recognised the aromas of
Kentish hops and praised its local character.
6) 14.5. Nethergate's Old Growler, Oddbins Pounds 1.89. This another
speciality beer: a rich and powerful porter which had the team thinking
about matching it with food.
7) 14.3. Shepherd Neame Original Porter, from Shepherd Neame pubs and select
off-licenses Pounds 1. A lot of chocolate malt had gone into this porter to
the point that Loe thought it was almost too chocolatey. Others found a big
aroma of burnt toast.
8) 14.2. Eldridge Pope's Hardy Country, Safeway Pounds 1.25. A
bottle-conditioned version of the popular draught. Our sample was slightly
hazy from the yeast with deliciously big, fruity character.
9) 14. Tolley's Strong Ale, Considerable enthusiasm greeted this spicy,
traditional ale.
Equal 10th) 13.8. Ridley's Old Bob Strong Pale Ale. This ale started out
well with its malty, honeyed aromas and its full, banana-like taste, but it
did not stay the course. We suspected it would be better for
bottle-conditioning.
Equal 10th). Black Russian. Thresher, Bottoms Up, Oddbins, Waitrose Pounds
1.69. Brewer Jim Prior rediscovered this old English recipe which had been
made popular in the Baltic States and recreated it. The result, according to
Loe, is something between a mild and a stout.
It is certainly highly individual with a bouquet of cherries, blood, dust
and burnt toast. A fine antidote to tasteless lagers.
Equal 12th) 13.3. Jennings' Cumbrian Ale. Wilkinson found this beer a little
cloying with its toffee, banana and apple character but it went down well
with Loe and me.
Equal 12th). Bishop's Finger, Pounds 1.39, Oddbins. A non-bottle conditioned
version of the Shepherd Neame bitter; firm and long; BCA, Oddbins Pounds
1.39. The unlovable label of this beer came in for a lot of criticism but
the beer in the bottle was approved. I found it spicy; Wilkinson discovered
bananas.
The following ales failed to come in the first 12 but all, with the
exception of the last two, found support from one or other of the team:
Eldridge Pope Royal Oak; Moreland's Old Speckled Hen; Nethergate N;
Bateman's XXX; Shepherd Neame's Master Brew; Thwaites Big Ben; Paul
Theakston's Black Sheep; Wadworth's Old Timer; Belhaven's Premium;
Caledonian's 80 shilling Natural; Banks' Mild; Federation Export IPA.

Skis, the long story
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

THE BEST skis complement your skills rather than frightening them away. Many
skiers would be better off on different skis, or different lengths than they
are using.
Tricky situations tend to reveal the true character and substance of skis.
In a mogul field, railway sleepers are not the handiest form of transport.
On ice it is best not to have bananas on your feet. Simple precautions can
make skis more user-friendly:
Always try out a new ski length by renting it before committing yourself to
purchase.
Make your skiing preferences - piste or off-piste, bumps or long cruising
runs - clear to the shop, as well as your abilities.
Avoid buying racing skis unless your skiing techniques include the ability
to carve, rather than skid, your turns.
Whatever you are buying or renting, make sure that the ski edges are
super-sharp. Most people have skis with blunt edges - the equivalent of bald
tyres on a wet road. An adequately sharp ski edge will produce fine shavings
from the face of your fingernail.
Likewise, make sure the skis are waxed every few days.
It is now 20 years since the greatest revolution in ski sales. The compact
ski (160cm to 180cm long) took average ski lengths down 20cm at a stroke.
The principle worked for millions of people at the time, and it is still
relevant today.
There is no inherent disadvantage or shame in taking a relatively short
length of ski. The only real compromise is a slight lack of stability at
speed - not something that most recreational skiers (who typically reach a
maximum 20 to 25 mph) experience in any case.
An echo of the compact ski reverberated in the hills last winter in the
unusual shape of the Atomic Powder Plus. The Fat Boy, as it has become
known, has the special virtue of a much greater surface area. More than 50
per cent wider than a normal ski, it floats very easily in deep, and
especially deep and heavy, snow.
Volkl and others have now copied the concept. The Volkl version - bright
yellow and called the Explosiv - is a better compromise for edge-to-edge
performance on piste, where the Atomic is so fat it is sluggish to turn.
A quite different type of short wide ski - the parabolic - is being
experimented with by two manufacturers at present: Kneissl and Elan.
Parabolic skis have a very wide tip and tail but an extremely narrow
(narrower than a slalom racing ski, in fact) waist. This means that they
turn very sharply, especially at low speeds. It means great responsiveness.
SKIS THAT WORK
Rossignol 7XK: Giant slalom-type ski. One of the finest I have used. Calm at
speed, responsive when needed. Excellent assured edge grip.
K2 TRC: Reliable torsion-box constructed ski. Good for harder snow but also
excellent off-piste. Also, the LTP, an attractive reliable ski pitched at
female skiers.
Salomon Super Force 9 3S or 2S. Monocoque (single shell outer surface) ski.
Very good, light and responsive, for tough runs, bumps and powder. The 3S
makes shorter turns, the 2S longer turns.
Volkl Renntiger. A long-established classic mid-market model, good value,
reliable carve and glide. Suitable for intermediates and good skiers.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Pink Snow - FT Guide To The World's Best Ski Resorts (9):
Wrap up warm, but with style - Lucia van der Post looks at what the
best-dressed skiers are wearing this season
</HEADLINE>

   SKI BROCHURES never tell it how it really is
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the wet, the cold, the knot in the stomach as you stand at the top of a
black run wondering how you will ever make it down, the humiliation as tiny
tots who not only knock spots off your skiing but ALSO speak fluent French
whizz past . . .
In ski brochure-land it is forever sunny. The snow is crisp, the skies blue,
the runs blemish-free. Nobody is anything but beautiful, nobody ever falls
over and nobody, of course, is anything but perfectly dressed.
We may not be able to do much about the weather and the snow but when it
comes to clothes we can at least look the part. The key, though, is which
part do you want to look?
Regular piste-bashers will know that the options are many. Chalet groupie,
old-timer, powder freak, posh yuppy, ski bunny . . . which is the look for
you?
The bray of a chalet groupie can usually be heard before she is seen but if
you spot one first you can tell who they are: they sport an all-season tan,
a kerchief round the neck, and their gear is seriously scuffed (they are
such old hands, you see). Come April they are larking about in bikini tops.
Old-timers often belong to the oldest skiing club in the world - and if they
don't they would like you to think so. They wear understated gear that looks
as if it was bought in the 1960s and probably was. All the rage though they
may be for the rest of us, one-piece skisuits are not for them. Old,
well-worn anoraks, (the wonders of Gore-Tex have passed them by), black or
navy-blue ski-pants and big leather gloves which have seen better days are
what they wear. And their skis are twice as long as anybody else's.
Powder freaks, and their near-relation, the ski-bum, are obsessed by labels.
They love Day-glo colours and go in for lots of techno-flash. Skin-tight,
rippling suits are the style for them - so aerodynamically efficient.
T-shirts, jumpers and everything from the boards themselves to the gloves
they wear will carry an all-important label that says it all.
Posh yuppies wear the latest Gore-Tex one-piece suit in a suitably
understated colour - no labels, no logos. 'Nothing flash about me' says his
clothing, loud and clear. He may only ski once a year but being up to the
minute matters - he couldn't be seen drinking his gluhwein in anything less
than this year's latest gear. Glacier glasses and a headband are the
finishing touches.
As for our old friend the ski bunny . . . treat her gently, for she is an
endangered species. Her natural habitat is the grandest bar, the sunniest
terrace, the most imposing hotel. You can spot her at once, for what she
goes in for is glamour, glamour, glamour.
Somebody once told her that there was nothing so flattering round the face
as fur, so lusciously-soft coats with fur-trimmed hoods (she has never heard
of Lynx) are what she wears. On sunnier days when she wants to create a
little stir she wears a slightly too small brand-new ski-suit from one of
the grandest of names. Now that Steinebron, the Christian Lacroix of the
ski-world, has gone under, Bogner is the name she looks for. Gloves and
wind-cheaters, blizzard protection and efficient parkas are never a part of
her armoury.
As you can see the chance for role-playing is all part of the fun of the
slopes. Whether you are looking for something practical and functional or a
pretty little number to look fetching in while wrapped in rugs in a
fur-lined sledge, the skiwear departments this year will have it.
Skiwear never changes quite as fast as the rest of fashion for the obvious
reason that, on the whole, its primary function is to be . . . well,
functional. It needs to keep you warm and dry, so not surprisingly, the
scope for flights of fancy is limited.
However, these days the fashionable looks translate much more easily into
everyday life. Most good skiwear departments have a host of beautiful (and
flattering) long-line jackets made from soft-as-butter microfibre fabrics
which not only make marvellous off-duty jackets but also provide all the
warmth and protection you need for skiing. Prices range around Pounds 390,
but remember these are real high performance garments.
The most successful skiwear is based on the layer system. Not only do
conditions and temperatures vary hugely but in extreme cold several light
layers keep the skier infinitely warmer than a single layer ever could.
Columbia, one of the most successful brands from America (Simpson of
Piccadilly in London has a good selection) seems to have got its strategy
right. Its success has been grounded in its versatility. Its speciality is
the three-in-one jacket - you buy two pieces, say, a fleece lining and an
outer jacket, each of which can be worn separately and together giving you
three options. The most basic of its three-in-ones start at Pounds 149 and
are reversible.
Skiwear has been much affected by the new, younger sports such as
snowboarding. Clothing has become both jollier, younger and tougher - the
baggier clothing (because skiboarding requires a different range of
movements), reinforced elbows, padded seats and knee pads have become chic
even for those who have never touched a ski-board. Tokka Tribe is the
with-it label to look out for here - lightweight 100 per cent micro jackets
with quilted linings and fleece tops can be worn with Lycra salopettes or
jeans.
Marks and Spencer has no offerings on the skiwear front this year but C &amp; A
deserves credit for providing the keen skier with an excellent range of
clothing at very good prices. The department store is particularly to be
recommended for those embarking on the slopes with children. For adults
all-in-one ski suits that were Pounds 200 last year are now selling at
Pounds 150 - wonderful concentrators of the mind, these recessions.
Other good ranges for children include Nevica's skisuits (padded knees,
covered zips and hidden hoods) and Snowmachine for the really tiny set
(available right down to toddler size).
The Snow + Rock skiwear group has a parka at Pounds 89.95 and a salopette at
Pounds 59.95 which must be unbeatable value. They are exact replicas of the
British Team's ski suit and have all the essential details to keep the chill
and wet out - drawstring waist and base, storm flaps, zipped pockets and a
detachable hood.
The hip set need look no further than C &amp; A's very own snowboard range -
'Ice Age'. It comes in dark, military colours with an air of heavy-duty
toughness about it. Lots of ribbed fabrics, big, baggy tops and pants that
can be worn 'heavy-duty' style over jeans.
For those looking for glamour labels, the piste equivalent of St Laurent and
Chanel, then the names to look out for probably have to be Chervo and
Outrage from Italy, and Bogner from Germany.
For chaps Bogner this year has a wonderfully classic flying suit in dark
green or burnt red (Pounds 799 - chic never did come cheap) while for women
the distinctive hallmark of the 1993 Bogner skisuit is its embroidery -
discreet and mostly the same colour as the suit, it nonetheless is
recognised by all those in the know.
More flamboyant types could go for one of Outrage's leopard or lily-printed
jackets at Pounds 279 a time while the perfectly formed can try one of Henri
Duvillard's daring body suits at Pounds 199 for the jackets, Pounds 129 for
the pants.
Those who do not live near a good ski shop might like to know that Snow +
Rock has a comprehensive free mail order catalogue (telephone 0753-830868
for a copy) from which everything the keen skier needs can be ordered.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Fashion: The designer muzzle, it's a must - Critics face
unfair pressure from peevish couture houses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STARS and the press pushed through the foyer of the Ritz and converged
on the ballroom, converted by Versace into a polystyrene and cardboard
mock-up of Caligula's palace for his 'couture' show. Push, shove, yell:
'Look, Madonna]' Scratch, elbow: 'Polanski]' Barge, plead: 'Elton]'
The uninvited were sequestered outside, along with Suzy Menkes of the
International Herald Tribune. She was banned by Versace and Ferre at Dior
for criticising their previous collections. Like peevish children, designers
will not admit unmuzzled writers for fear of . . . what? The truth? Banning
is nothing new - Chanel loved to oust trouble-makers - but it is now
commonplace as designers try to control what is written about them. Come in
if you will write a eulogy, stay out if you really intend to exercise your
professional rights as a critic. One minute, they are chasing journalists to
boost scent, hosiery and boutique sales, the next they cold-shoulder a
dissenting voice.
In the days when the publicity-shy Cristobal Balenciaga failed to issue an
invitation, journalists might be furious - but they could not accuse him of
fawning over them one moment and rejecting them the next. His manner was
consistently distanced and, therefore, professional.
Now, press / designer relations have reached comic extremes. Any semblance
of propriety or subtlety has been jettisoned. Its quid pro quo: write a good
feature and your office or home turns into a funeral parlour; you cannot see
the desk for the blooms. Write a criticism and you are persona non grata.
Change your mind next season and everything is blooming marvellous again.
One pre-requisite in this industry is a short memory.
Shamefully, the press does, with some exceptions, buckle under the pressure
of fashion empires, especially when the Italians start ganging up. The next
season, the designer's handwriting might not have changed but the
journalist's reading of it certainly has.
The problem is that fashion and beauty writers are offered sweeteners:
discounted clothes, a momentary glance into the high life, and so on.
Judgment is clouded, opinions become bias. Guffaws could be heard from New
York to Tokyo when a television expose of the industry, The Look, filmed
interviews with editors denying they were ever given gifts.
Some opinion-formers stand their ground. Consider the case of Women's Wear
Daily and designer Geoffrey Beene. When WWD sent an assistant rather than
John Fairchild, the chairman, to view a show, Beene took umbrage. The
magazine retaliated; as far as it was concerned, Beene no longer existed. He
was ignored and even air-brushed out of photographs.
Beene can get terribly peevish. When Kennedy Fraser criticised not only his
collection but his design direction in the New Yorker in the 1970s, she was
banned for several seasons. But Fraser, no pedestrian critic, not only
pointed out the faults but also constructively offered an alternative
course. Beene later re-considered his impetuous snub and now acknowledges
publicly his debt to Fraser for changing the path of his design - for the
better.
In many ways, the press is to blame for the antics of designers, having
built them into gods who are invited to pontificate not only on what we
should wear next season but also on how we should lead our lives. Endless
profiles have accorded dress-makers the role of pop-philosophers. Should we
really be so amazed that Benetton has the hubris to 'educate' us about Aids
while advertising its jerseys?
London is the bottom of the rung as far as the Milan / Paris / New York
collections' status is concerned, for none of its designers has a big
advertising budget. Perhaps it is a cynical view but one wonders why British
fashion writers flex their critical muscles so energetically when reviewing
British designers. Could it be that advertising revenue will not be affected
while, having felt frustratingly muzzled in the other capitals, they let rip
in London? It is little wonder that the British designers complain that the
British press do not support them.
Non-fashion journalists have viewed the fashion press askance for some time.
This attitude hardened late in the 1960s when the counter-culture
journalists were trying to taking on the Establishment and ask difficult
questions.
The more judicious news journalists were suspicious of the fashion editor /
designer symbiosis in the glossy 1960s colour supplements. But the rot
really set in in the 1980s when the glossies and newspapers became
style-obsessed and filled their pages with designer profiles. Now, their
Frankenstein has come home to bully them.
But informed critics - not, of course, to be confused with tabloid
sensationalists - should stand firm. A ban should be read as a badge of
integrity, proof that the journalist has spoken his or her mind (correctly
or incorrectly). Besides, designers can hardly ban everyone.
Maddening though it is, we can be thankful that fashion reporting is not as
venomous as some theatre reviewing. There is a Broadway legend of an
impresario who responded to a bad review of his play by sending the critic a
tarantula in a box. It was alive.
Perhaps we should watch out for what might lurk in those blooms.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Fashion: Jaeger, a fashion classic is reborn - Brenda Polan
meets Jeanette Todd, the driving force behind the rejuvenation of a famous
name
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRENDA POLAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE JUDGES of the Classics section in last month's British Fashion council
award had a knotty problem. Two of the nominated companies whose clothes,
while in some ways classic, were once dull and worthy had produced
collections in 1993 which were seriously desirable by even the most
fashion-conscious of women.
Marks and Spencer's progressive upgrading of the fashion content of its
clothes has been gathering pace over several years now, while Jaeger's
transformation has been accomplished in just a year. If companies can be
compared to seagoing vessels, then M&amp;S is a lumbering supertanker and Jaeger
a nimble liner.
Even so, as Jeanette Todd, Jaeger's design director, reflects, turning a
liner still takes time and a lot of ocean. 'You can't,' she says, 'do it an
a sixpence.' However, she has done it on a half-crown. So this year, the
award went to Todd and her team.
Jeanette Todd is one of the most engaging people in the fashion industry.
Her personal style turns heads. She is small, round and very blonde, wears
simple clothes and flamboyant accessories such as large pieces of costume
jewellery, Isadora Duncan scarves or eccentric hats. When prevailed upon to
offer an opinion, it is usually a trenchant one, often a provocative
understatement.
At her most dead-pan, when her voice drops to a mutter and the Scots accent
can just be detected, she is occasionally misunderstood and she finds the
company of those not sharp enough to understand irksome. Then she can be a
little frightening.
She is also a designer of exceptional talent whose commercial judgment is
impeccable. She understands the balance women seek between fashion content,
comfort, durability, helpfulness and cost. Revamping Jaeger was the job most
of London's senior designers coveted. It was not really a surprise when
Todd, head of the Burton Group's design studio and creator of the Principles
range, got it.
There is a wonderful solidity about the idea of Jaeger. It is so very
British, dressing the stalwart ladies of the suburban middle class for whom
looking smart is important but getting value is more so. They know they can
rely on Jaeger.
'It was terribly important,' says Jeanette Todd, 'not to lose that core
customer. She is very precious to us. It was a matter not of radically
changing the range, but of stretching it so that it could encompass the
taste of the women who currently shop at Nicole Farhi, Whistles and DKNY at
Harvey Nichols. She's probably thirty-plus, though she might be younger, a
gregarious, confident person, well-informed, certain of her own taste and
quick to question what fashion proposes. If there is, for instance, a
fashion colour around, she won't wear it.'
Change is evident in this winter's clothes, in a loosening up of the line,
more relaxed proportions, a fluidity and swing to jackets and coats and a
wider choice of simple basic knitwear pieces which Todd's new customer would
put under her jacket while a core customer might prefer a blouse.
It is a tentative step forward. In order to gauge just how far the range can
be stretched, however, Jeanette Todd has introduced a small additional range
at Jaeger's flagship store in London's Regent Street. Labelled Jaeger
London, it is a step or two more sophisticated and reflects the company's
new ability to get a garment from sketch pad to shop rail in between eight
and 12 weeks.
'We can react first to new information,' says Todd. 'Based on forward
fashion trends, what we see happening elsewhere in the world and on what we
know is selling well in our own shops, we can give the customer what we are
pretty sure she wants. This first London range, which is not being produced
in enormous quantities, is a trial. Does something this sharp and immediate
appeal to our customers? Can it pull in new customers? I won't panic if it
doesn't work. You have to test your limits or you never know where they
are.'
To produce Jaeger London she has piled a tough task on to what has already
been an arduous year, albeit one crowned with peer-group approbation.
Easiness is the key to the range: neutral colours of chocolate, mole, grey,
cream and black; simple shapes in leather, suede, wool jersey, flannel,
gaberdine, tweed and lambswool. In design terms it exploits the contrast
between body-hugging garments and generously capacious ones. 'I like the
interplay between tight and loose,' says Todd.
In some ways it is essentially a country look - but it one which works in
the city as well. 'A lot of people are looking for these kinds of clothes,'
says Todd. 'There is much less formality in the way people dress than there
was a couple of years ago. People are not as worried about key outfits.
Then, people were prepared to be uncomfortable in tight clothes to look
right. I don't think anyone wants to put up with discomfort now.'
Todd's early training, after Edinburgh College of Art and the London College
of Fashion (a Distinction Diploma) was with Jean Muir, the couturier, John
Cavanagh, and Murray Arbeid but her heart was in the mass market. She made
her career heading design studios for Courtaulds, Steinberg and the Burton
Group where, as well as functioning as group director of design management,
she was seconded, in 1986, to the Debenhams board as fashion director.
Consequently, when she tells you what she thinks woman want, it is based on
wide experience. Comparing her present target audience with the huge and
varied one she had at Burton she calls it 'a very narrow target.' And narrow
targets can be harder to hit.
'Exactly,' she says. 'But you have to have the courage of your convictions;
in many cases timidity is what limits what you do. On the other hand, I
would not start taking risks with the core business. And, when we feed back
into the design process what we learn from Jaeger London, I won't be.'

From the Poles to the pistes - The explorer/adventurer Sir Ranulph Fiennes
explains his lifelong passion for skiing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Sir RANULPH FIENNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR SOME years I have specialised in leading unsupported expeditions in the
Polar regions. The rules of the unsupported Pole traveller are simple: carry
whatever high-tec gizmos you wish, but accept no external support other than
your own leg-power aided by natural resources such as gravity. The greatest
technological support that is permitted within these self-imposed parameters
is, of course, the ski. Using skis, my expeditions have reached the South
Pole and also hold the existing world record for ski travel towards the
North Pole.
I learned to ski when I was in my teens with my mother and sisters in Arosa,
Switzerland. With the possible exception of windsurfing, free-fall
parachuting on to glaciers and being driven in London by my wife, I know of
no more exhilarating and satisfying a feeling than skiing downhill on fine
pistes in good weather with a bunch of speedy amateurs.
For expedition work I can truly say that I love skiing. Without skis,
man-hauling on snow and ice, north or south, is a doubly unsavoury
experience, to be avoided at all costs. With artificial skins glued to the
under-surface of our skis last March, we towed 485lb sledge-loads over
Antarctica's frozen surface despite weighing a mere third of that weight
ourselves.
Without skis we would have sunk into deep snow at every step and would have
plunged the more easily into the myriad crevasses which plagued our 97-day
journey. Light-weight, tough Norwegian langlauf skis with simple plastic
bindings are best for man-hauling in temperatures of - 50`C and below
because they enable a pliant and bulky boot to be worn - vital for the
avoidance of frost-bitten feet.
Unfortunately, in Antarctica last spring - for the first time in 20 years of
polar journeys - bulky boots proved inadequate for man-hauling loads of
nigh-on 500lb per man. So we switched to standard plastic downhill ski boots
which were rigid and allowed us enough foot purchase, when used with
'skinned' skis, to haul the mammoth loads. They also reduced my feet to
poisoned, frostbitten and lacerated pain-centres.
On returning to Britain I had to miss our annual skiing holiday because my
feet were too swollen after our Antarctica trip, when I and my colleague Dr
Mike Stroud, completed the longest ski journey in history. But in March, all
being well, my wife Ginny and I will again enjoy our favourite activity
(with comfortable boots and no sledge-loads) in one or other of Europe's two
best all-round resorts, Zermatt or Courchevel, where we have been taking
chalet holidays for 12 years now.
I love these resorts equally. In Courchevel I like to get as high as
possible, above 1850. I particularly enjoy the runs down from the Col de
Chanrosse and the Signal area. Ginny and I usually spend half an hour or so
before lunch bombing down Les Creux or towards Mont Bel Air.
Zermatt has such a wide range of skiing, with some very long runs and
endless permutations. My personal favourite is Triftji. The resort also has
great mountain restaurants to visit at dusk after a day's skiing. Many of
the instructors are of the old generation - after all, they breed Olympic
medallists here. I like the way they keep the difficult runs open in bad
weather for keen skiers instead of just closing them automatically - they
are not safety conscious, at least not to a ridiculous degree.
I love the fact that Zermatt has no cars. I hate resorts where your hotel is
in a narrow street and exhaust fumes pollute the atmosphere. It spoils the
whole effect of being in the mountains.
We sometimes holiday with other couples who cannot ski and it doesn't matter
a jot because Zermatt is great for good skiers, beginners and people who
don't want to ski at all. There is so much else to do.
Nevertheless, people can get on each other's nerves during a week's chalet
party just as much as on a six-month Polar ordeal. After some experimenting,
we have found the easiest group number to be around 10 - whether made up of
five couples or a married/singles melee.
It seems best to have at least four people who ski poorly or slowly
('carefully' being the adjective we use for politeness) with the balance
being made up of faster types. Occasionally we find ourselves landed with a
'real' skier or 'whizzer' but this is unusual, since our group is (by
chance, not choice) usually all British.
On one occasion we ended up with an ox-like young friend, a purveyor of
high-quality handkerchiefs and director of 'Magnificent Mouchoirs' who
outskied every (non-Olympic) Brit I have ever met. None of us could keep up
with him, whatever our sex, but we all tried - the males from jealousy and
the females because he was dashing and handsome.
Our chalet girls were both excellent skiers, and both lusted after our Hanky
Man. On Day Three one of them tried too hard and twisted an ankle. He
carried her down from the Klein Matterhorn run on his shoulders. Her cooking
standards never recovered.
On Day Six, the second chalet girl,trying to take advantage of her
colleague's incapacity, ended up with her entire leg in plaster. On Day
Seven, when our maestro's week was up, both girls hobbled down to the
station to see their hero off.
The only satisfactory outcome of that week of being enormously outclassed by
the Hanky Man was when, on his penultimate evening, all 10 of us raced 4km
on toboggans by night and - fuelled by gluhwein and Drambuie - reached the
centre of Zermatt by a circuitous route through deep snow. Heaving his
toboggan over a pointed snow-fence, our maestro's feet suddenly broke
through the snow crust, impaling him astride the fence stakes.
Having to ski his last few hours in a highly tender condition enabled the
rest of us to score heavily and with enormous satisfaction, under the
principle that he who laughs last, laughs longest - and not in a high
soprano.
A week's skiing is quite the best way I know of consolidating old
friendships, making new ones and having a great many healthy laughs at each
other's expense.

Long live langlauf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN

<TEXT>
PEACE. No lift queues, no maniac snowboarders. Communing with nature, a
sense of exploration, a sense of history, low-cost winter luxury.
Cross-country skiing should be more popular than it is.
While downhill skiers search for a resort that has not been turned into a
Torremolinos of the mountains, langlaufers know where to look. For them,
cross-country is what skis were invented for. Downhillers strap space-age
slabs of wood, plastic and aluminium on to their elephantine boots and are
left at the mercy of the ski lift. Cross-county skis are feather-light. They
are lapped on the underside to they do not slip backwards. The shoes are
more like trainers than plaster casts.
Each step you take glides you several metres forward; it is like wearing
seven league sneakers. And you can go just about anywhere.
Unfortunately, only a handful of resorts cater properly for cross-country
skiers. Many claim to, but it does not take long on a wind-blasted circuit
on a bare mountain in Tignes to realise that there are better ways to
travel.
What langlaufers need is trees, rivers and lakes. The best resort in Europe
is probably Seefeld, in the Austrian Tyrol. Twice host to the Winter
Olympics cross country events, Seefeld has 200km of mostly wooded tracks
sprinkled with mountain huts for rest stops. Unlike most resorts, it has a
specialist cross country school.
But Seefeld is for specialists. Those wanting interesting downhill runs and
good cross country routes could look to nearby Kitzbuhel, although the runs
are less wooded. Francophiles should avoid the purpose-built Alpine resorts
and head instead for the tranquillity of the Jura or Massif Central.
If that sounds too quiet, try Switzerland's Davos. Or St Moritz, where you
have a choice of lakeside wooded trails at the foot of the 3,300 metre
Corvatsch mountain.
The Mecca for cross-country skiers is Norway, the natural home for what is
still called by many Nordic skiing. Oppdal, 120km south of Trondheim, has
186km of trails including five floodlit tracks over 11km. With equipment
rental so cheap, and roast reindeer on the menu, what are you waiting for?

FT  13 NOV 93 / Pink Snow - FT Guide To The World's Best Ski Resorts (8):
How to cover yourself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNIE WILSON

<TEXT>
YOU MIGHT think it's expensive, you probably think it's boring, but getting
proper insurance for your ski holiday is still essential.
Getting it wrong can be costly and irritating. Worse, given the accidents
that can happen on the piste, poor or non-existent cover could even wreck
your life should you have a serious fall requiring expensive medical
treatment. Does your policy cover you for skiing off-piste? Is the accident
cover good enough, especially if you are skiing in the US? What about third
party indemnity? Does it cover skis stolen while left outside a mountain
restaurant, or skis from the rental shop?
Winter sports insurers over the past decade have suffered similar problems
to the general insurance world. When coupled with inconsistent snow
conditions, many companies have made losses which they are now trying to
convert into profit.
I have changed my cover twice in three years after discovering that things
were not quite as they seemed. I am notorious for not reading the small
print - but what if the small print is changed and no one tells you?
Initially I was insured with American Express, which illustrated its ski
insurance leaflets with a picture of a skier in powder snow. He was
obviously skiing off-piste, which seemed to suggest that skiers using the
policy would be covered. To my concern I discovered that the policy did not
cover me for skiing off-piste.
Although Amex did eventually change its policy on off-piste skiing, by that
time I had switched to one of the most reputable specialists, Douglas Cox
Tyrie, which did offer off-piste cover. What it did not cover - unbeknown to
me - was rental skis. Or rather, it did when I first took out my policy, but
last winter, after I had wrecked a ski, the company refused to pay up. The
small print, it was explained, had been changed that year.
The loss or damage of ski equipment - owned or rented - has become a serious
problem, partly because more and more skiers are using higher quality skis.
Apart from suffering losses caused by organised gangs which tour the Alps
stealing skis, Alan Lumsden, director of Douglas Cox Tyrie, says that his
company became fed up with effectively being used by rental shops to
subsidise their stocking-up with new skis each year.
He believes that some rental shop owners have decided that insurance
companies are an easy touch. As the season draws to a close, he says rental
shop staff start to complain more and more about damaged and worn-out skis
when they are returned, hoping that insurance companies will foot the bill
to replace them.
One piece of good news is that Douglas Cox Tyrie has scrapped its decision
not to cover the theft of skis left outside mountain restaurants because
other insurance companies refused to follow suit.
According to Fogg Travel, another ski insurance specialist, one feature
which has caused an 'enormous problem' in recent years has been a huge rise
in claims for holiday cancellations, which has coincided with the recession.
'With cancellation claims, insurers are to a great extent in the hands of
the medical profession,' says Colin Allum, Fogg Travel's director. 'The
problem with a skiing holiday is that whereas in the summer someone with a
twisted ankle may be able to lie in the sun and recuperate, an injury of
this kind to a skier will mean the holiday has to be cancelled. There is no
purpose in travelling on a winter sports holiday if you cannot engage in
winter sports.'
Other factors pushing up premiums include the setting-up of expensive
private health clinics in Bulgaria and other parts of Eastern Europe, and
the reduction in charter flights available to repatriate injured skiers to
the UK. More and more people will need to be brought back on expensive
scheduled services.
Some tour operators try to insist on skiers taking out the company's own
insurance. This can be the most profitable element in the holiday for the
operator and some big multiple travel agency chains, as they frequently
inflate the price originally charged by the insurance company in order to
offer cut-price holiday deals. The reductions are only available if the
client buys the insurance.
Skiers should make sure that if they are forced to buy a tour operator's or
travel agency's insurance policy that it will cover their needs. If it fails
to do so, they should make their own arrangements if possible, or top up the
policy they have been coerced to buy.

FT  13 NOV 93 / How To Spend It: At last, a showcase for real talent -
Britain's young designers have finally won the kind of backing their unique
work deserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PETA LEVI has been involved in design for many years. She started as a
journalist but, as she began to see more and more of the difficulties that
face the 13,000 students who come pouring out of British design schools each
year, she went into the business of organising exhibitions. 'What I have
tried to do,' she says, 'is to bridge the gap between Britain's graduating
designers and industry. Most new designers have such trouble getting started
and they need a place to show their wares.'
Now that her annual exhibition for the work of the best of them - at the
Business Design Centre in Islington, London - has taken off she has moved on
to the next stage. 'So many of their new young businesses were failing, not
because they lacked talent or interesting products, but because they did not
have the proper means to market their wares or places where they could be
seen,' she says.
She has therefore begged and borrowed funds and warehouse space to enable
her to open the first permanent gallery where their wares can be seen and
bought. She provides her own efforts free, Cathy Hatgis, an interior
designer, has offered her time so that it can open to the public every
Wednesday and Wolff Olins, the interior and industrial designer, has
provided the premises in the shape of a converted warehouse in his offices
near Regent's Canal.
The result is that there is now an ever-changing selection of the work of
some 60 designers. Though most of the time the work is primarily aimed at
the trade in the shape of buyers, architects, specifiers and interior
designers, the certainty that Christmas will shortly be here and with it the
need for presents that are interesting, original and not to be found
everywhere, means that many readers might well like to take time out to
visit the showcase.
The range of talents includes most of the design disciplines - everything
from textiles, furniture design, glass, ceramics, wood and metalwork to
jewellery, plastics, lighting and flooring. Here anybody interested can see
the full range of work and, if there is nothing that meets their precise
needs, they can commission a special piece.
For the season running up to Christmas, however, there is an exhibition
aimed at the more casual shopper - in other words a good selection of
smaller, take-away wares that will sit happily under the tree until the big
day.
For under Pounds 100 you could choose from hand-painted and printed silks by
Modern Primitives - hankies at Pounds 18, ties at Pounds 35, cushions for
Pounds 65 and scarves for Pounds 80.
Then there are hand-blown glass egg-cups by Marianne Buuf for Pounds 18 and
lots of mirrors for under Pounds 30 by Caroline Musson, Ashley Hall and
Keira Baldwin. Or what about hand-painted porcelain mugs at Pounds 15 by
Brenda Taylor, deep blue or maroon brass and nickel napkin rings by Clare
Thatcher for Pounds 25, or matching candlesticks from Pounds 18.75?
Those who are looking for finer or more expensive things might like to know
that Jenny Maddock does lovely silver pens for just over Pounds 100, Paul
Gower has a CD rack for Pounds 195 and Jessica Ball has produced a highly
decorative porcelain tea service for two, on its own tray, for Pounds 200.
For members of the public the showcase is normally only open on Wednesdays
from 11 am to 4 pm, although they will open by appointment on any other day.
The special Christmas exhibition with plenty of smaller, less
exclusively-priced present ideas, is on Wednesday November 24, but there
will be lots to choose from on every Wednesday from then on until Christmas.
However, although Christmas may be a chance to introduce the designers' work
to a wider range of customers, the main purpose of the showcase still
remains to encourage the notion among us all that original, creative,
one-off pieces are well worth initiating and commissioning.
A visit to the showcase gives the visitor a chance to see a large selection
of all sorts of work and helps to refine our eye and focus our taste.
Instead of buying a mass-produced dining-table, for instance, or rummaging
round the antique shops, why not consider commissioning your very own piece?
For a sum not very different from what you would pay for a routine piece in
a department store you could have the designer, the wood, the shape and the
size of your choice.
There is no need to settle for a fabric, a mirror, a piece of glass or
silver or jewellery that doesn't meet your needs and desires in every way.
At the business showcase there is a chance to catch up with some of the most
talented designers around and see whose tastes and skills most aptly suits
your needs.
The New Designers in Business Showcase is at Wolff Olins, 10 Regent's Wharf,
All Saints Street, London N1.
It is open to the public every Wednesday (from 11 am to 4 pm except during
the Christmas period when it is open from 11 am to 6 pm), other appointments
can be made by telephoning 071-435 4348 or faxing requests to 071-435 5487.

FT  13 NOV 93 / How To Spend It: Wake up to witty waistcoats - A look at
this season's essential fashion accessory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU DO not yet know that waistcoats are this season's must-have accessory
then you have clearly not been paying attention. Whether you be male or
female you need only to take yourself off to the nearest emporium for a
waistcoat to suit your mood and you can feel that you have done your bit
towards fashionability for the season.
From BhS and Marks and Spencer to the chic designer labels there are
waistcoats of every sort - pale, ascetic and almost minimalist in mood;
exotic and embroidered for when in peacock mode; tweedy for the country;
woolly for warmth; richly patterned for the show-off set; and specially
embroidered for those used to bespoke.
At Favourbrook, 19-21 Piccadilly Arcade, Jermyn Street, London SW1Y 6LX,
waistcoats are the shop's speciality. It does sell other things, most
notably some gorgeously rich and romantic evening jackets, but waistcoats is
what it is primarily known for.
The latest collection is for women as well as men and the emphasis is on
rich and original versions for evening wear. There are silk and cotton
brocades, plain and patterned velvets, wools and cashmeres. All can be
either single or double-breasted and Favourbrook has also developed a new
high-cut Edwardian style which it believes lends a more elegant look - and
who among us would not wish to look more elegant?
There is a wide range of waistcoats already in stock but there are also some
2,500 different fabrics to choose from and the shop will make to measure at
no extra cost.
Favourbrook's waistcoats never come cheap, but the fabrics really are
exceptional. For ready-to-wear or made-to-measure the prices range from
Pounds 70 to Pounds 170, depending on the fabric.
Evening jackets and coats, for those who are interested in a rich romantic
look for the evening, include brocaded hacking jackets and silk evening ones
as well as smoking versions in velvet, often with frogging and satin
linings. These range in price between Pounds 300 and Pounds 400.

FT  13 NOV 93 / How To Spend It: Sleeping sound on English wood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treske Shop started in North Yorkshire as a provider of furniture made
in good solid English hardwoods such as oak, cherry, walnut, beech and ash.
There is now an outlet in London for those who like the simple lines it goes
in for.
It is particular strong on beds, with a big range of natural wood frames
with sprung slats. One of their best-sellers is the daybed photographed
above, designed by Vico Magistretti, the Italian furniture designers.
Generously proportioned, with Futon-like upholstery, it is especially
popular for those with conservatories where they can indulge in reading
novels, listening to Mozart, eating chocolates and all the other purposes
for which conservatories are ideal.
It also would work well in a bed-sit where it could double as a sofa by day
and a bed by night. The arm drops down to form a 6 ft 3 in single bed. Made
from natural ash, it comes covered in a variety of fabrics. Prices start at
Pounds 774.
The two Treske shops are at Stations Works, Thirsk, North Yorkshire YO7 4NY
and 5 Barmouth Road, Earlsfield, London SW18 2DT.

FT  13 NOV 93 / How To Spend It: A true British Original - Lucia van der
Post welcomes a rival to the Banana bunch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL THOSE who remember the early days of the catalogues put out by Banana
Republic will mourn their passing. The combination of quirky text,
idiosyncratic drawings and the plain usefulness of the products made them
unmissable. I still sometimes read them just to cheer myself up when I think
the whole world has gone mad over logos and fancy labels.
Alas, the Banana Republic of today has gone all posh, with lots of very
smart safari clothing and no quirky catalogues. If you miss them as I do
then I think you will like the British company, Rediscovered Originals by
Harry Brown.
Though the company is only a few years old, the catalogue looks as if it has
been around for years. Harry Brown is the mythical setter of its style, the
chap who is out there travelling the world sourcing the products that fit
the image.
What Harry Brown comes back with are the sort of classic products that all
of us need at some stage in our lives. There are plain leather belts, soft,
friendly briefcases, sweatshirts and felt hats, Moleskin waistcoats and
convict shirts - as most of you will not be acquainted with these let me put
you in the picture: they are tough indigo striped cotton shirts with metal
studded buttons, patch and flap pockets and double cloth shoulder yokes and
they sell at Pounds 19.98.
There are cult products such as Doctor Martens boots, baseball caps (Pounds
6.98), Levi 501s (Pounds 35), biker jackets and the PLO Scarf (Pounds 4.98).
Then there is a really useful duffle ('discovered by Harry Brown whilst on a
fleeting visit to India') which 'is not a Louis Vitton (sic), it is not a
Gucci, it is a good old honest Harry Brown'.
Prices are good, too, with a classic leather belt selling for Pounds 14.98,
a Chambray denim shirt for Pounds 14.98, the Harry Brown duffle for Pounds
39.98 and a leather Western jacket for Pounds 139.
Harry Brown understands, too, our preference for things that do not look too
new. 'Be prepared for adventure in this strong, rugged, scarred jacket,' he
writes in the catalogue about the Indiana leather jacket (Pounds 184), while
there is also a specially battered and scarred belt (Pounds 19.98.).
Sketched here is the Harry Brown Duster Coat, Pounds 78 - 'made from special
pigment dyed cotton canvas (not waxed), it has undergone an ageing process
to give it a lived in, distressed 'been there, done that' appearance.' And
no, Rediscovered Originals doesn't sell the Harley Davidson but Adam Machell
of Adams Gym, Leeds will.
Rediscovered Originals now has shops in Leeds, Sheffield, York, Chester,
Hull, Thurrock and Newcastle. For a free copy of the catalogue write to
Rediscovered Originals, Springfield Mills, Town End, Bramley, Leeds LS13
3LY, tel: 0532-564416.

FT  13 NOV 93 / How To Spend It: Shoes, put your best foot forward - Spit
and polish is not enough: stylish footwear never comes cheap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PLASTIC surgeon once said that the difference between a beautiful woman
and a not-so-beautiful one was millimetres. The same applies to men's shoes.
The perfectly-shaped toe-cap, superbly proportioned detailing and right
height of heel set truly splendid shoes apart from the also-rans.
Bad shoes, on the other hand, always make a poor impression. They can also
be indicative of shortcomings elsewhere in a man. In a survey in W magazine,
in which leading international women were asked what they most hated in a
man's appearance, a large proportion cited badly-chosen, ill-cared-for shoes
as their sartorial bete noir in the opposite sex.
A friend tells of (her) happily accepting a dinner invitation from a
seemingly attractive tennis partner, only to be irredeemably disappointed by
his shoes when they finally met for a date. 'One glance at his Italian
wide-boy shoes and I knew instantly there was no point looking any further,'
she confides.
However, shoes often present problems. Men who normally have no trouble
choosing a good suit, the right shirt and an amusing tie often seem to lose
all discrimination when buying shoes. I often see perfectly attractive
clothes ruined by cheap, ill-fitting and grubby shoes and wish the wearer
would invest more in his footwear and less in his designer outfit.
Britain makes some of the best classic men's footwear in the world - shoes
that illustrate the traditional British idea of combining style and quality
with practicality. The best not only look good but last a very long time if
properly looked after. Although expensive at around Pounds 250, they, more
than many luxury items, offer value for money, because of the large cost of
good materials and the many highly-skilled man-hours used in their
production.
But what are the tell-tale signs of quality? 'The shape of a shoe is the
first consideration,' explains Richard Allen, of Edward Green, a leading
maker of first-class men's shoes. 'When choosing a shoe, its shape,
determined by its last, should be the same as the foot itself - straight on
the inside and curved on the outside. This means that the shoe will actually
fit as well as look attractive.'
His advice is shared by Oliver Sweeney, a fashionable shoe designer who, in
his obsessive quest for the 'aristocratically-slender look' shoe, stresses
the importance of 'the instep pointing towards the big toe and not to the
centreline of the shoe.' A correctly-shaped shoe fits the wearer from the
start and needs none of the ritual 'breaking-in' so mistakenly beloved of
sadistic nannies.
The second consideration is style and cut. As with the last, millimetres
matter. The length of the cap, height of the vamp and patterning must be in
harmony with the shape of the last. Many men make the mistake of choosing
shoes bristling with punching, tassels and nasty bits of metal and forget
that often the simpler styles look the smartest.
The next test is the quality of the 'upper' (top part of the shoe). 'The
best shoes are made from young skins, no more than twelve weeks old: they
have a fine grain and take a high polish,' explains Allen. When buying brown
shoes, he recommends asking for ones made in aniline leather. These,
although needing plenty of polishing, develop a wonderful patina with age.
He and other shoemakers I talked to are scathing about the cheap,
plastic-treated leathers used by lesser manufacturers. Suede should be
proper reversed calf or stag skin, both of which are unlikely to develop
shiny patches. Now check any decoration: punching, perforations and gimping,
if done by hand, will be crisp and even. Then test the toe and heel for
firmess: good shoes have leather stiffeners to keep them in shape.
Lastly look at the shoe's soles. 'The insole,' stresses Sweeney, 'must be
made of leather to absorb sweat, allow the feet to breathe and, most
important, form a perfect reproduction of the underside of the foot, thus
making the shoe supremely comfortable.'
The outer sole, also made of leather, should be 'welted' to the rest of the
shoe. A welt is a strip of leather placed between and sewn on to the edge of
the sole and the turned-in edge of the upper. It produces a comfortable,
elegant shoe that can be repaired repeatedly.
The soles of the best shoes are vegetable-tanned for longevity and coolness.
No stitches should be visible as they are hidden in a specially-cut channel
in the sole. Heels should also be made from layers of leather (man-made
substitutes tend to gape in the rain) and should have brass pins as they
provide the best grip. Rubber tips provide extra protection against
slipping.
The final tip for investing in good shoes is to buy them in the right shop,
one that will cater to your needs and preferences and provide a
comprehensive aftercare service. The type of shoes I have described will, if
properly cared for, last for years. However they need to be kept on trees,
regularly polished and repaired by their makers. Follow this advice and
avoid the false economy of buying shoes that are anything less than the
best.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Travel: Thaw brings anglers to the tundra - Rose Baring goes
fishing on Russia's Kola peninsula
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROSE BARING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OUTSIDE interference has been felt only twice in the remote village of
Varzuga, and it has always meant trouble. 'Ivan the Terrible sent his
oprichniki (secret police) in 1568. They killed two-thirds of the
population.' Svyatislav Mikhailovich Kalouchin paused to let this sink in,
stroking his moustache thoughtfully, before continuing. 'Then, after almost
400 years, Stalin sent his men, too.'
He caught my eyes and smiled. Both of us were outsiders.
Svet, as he is known by his western partners, or Mikhail'ich by his
respectful employees, is from Odessa, the 'pearl of the Black Sea.' For the
past four years, he has been director of the 2m-acre Rise Up Communism]
collective farm on Russia's Kola peninsula. If you imagine Scandinavia to be
the silhouette of a bad-tempered mule's head, then the Kola peninsula,
straddling the Arctic Circle, is its flattened back ears.
Beneath the surface, the Kola is rich in minerals; but the land itself is
like a massive black beach at low tide. Undulations in the sodden, peaty
soil create millions of small pools, and the only crop is forestry. The farm
is so inaccessible that it keeps its own herds of pigs and cattle for milk
and meat. Its bakery produces fresh bread daily from flour driven hundreds
of miles over rutted roads.
The main farm income derives from deep-sea fishing and salmon netting. But,
as subsidies in the state farming sector are cut, providing an income for
the 1,200 inhabitants requires the kind of lateral thinking for which
Russian managers are not generally famed. Yet Svet, a mere babe at 36,
appears to have what it takes.
As well as a recently-built frankfurter plant, he runs a factory making fur
clothing and sells fish, crabs and lobsters to the Germans. Perhaps the most
incongruous of his recent ventures is a series of partnerships with western
travel companies, offering salmon fishing on the farm's prolific Arctic
rivers.
Salmon stocks in many European rivers have been so depleted by netting that
you might pay large sums for a week's fishing and return without so much as
a story about the one that got away. The group of eight with which I
travelled caught 79 in one day. Such was their enthusiasm - and the
continuous polar daylight - that many fished into the early hours of the
morning.
There are camps on both the north and south coasts of the peninsula. The
larger fish head into the northern rivers, later in the season. It can still
feel like an early Arctic spring in May and early June, but that is not
entirely bad: the area's elephantine mosquitoes like warmer weather.
The arrival of foreigners in this introverted spot - a forbidden destination
for 70 years except for supply ships during the second world war - had its
surreal moments. We flew first to a tented camp, 130km from the nearest
village on a piece of blasted tundra with only an ancient belching tractor
engine to generate electricity. Yet, within the wind-buffeted kitchen tent,
two microwave ovens, a food processor and a pair of brand-new filter coffee
machines gleamed next to a corroded vintage refrigerator.
The locals found the western fishermen hilarious. An assorted bunch of
well-paid professionals, their kit was state of the art. Watching them cast
elegantly and continuously, the gillies grinned mischievously as they
described their own 4ft spinning rods, crude lures and landing technique -
which consists of walking backwards until the fish is lying on the bank.
Our second camp was a group of log cabins on a flat bend in the river, a
short way south of Varzuga. As we arrived by helicopter, the pilot dipped
down to look at the Church of the Ascension, a towering, 17th century wooden
structure. l was drawn to its complexity, unnerved perhaps by the utter
simplicity of the local architecture and way of life.
The cross-shaped building sits on raised wooden foundations and rises to its
central, tent-roofed tower in a series of exaggerated ogee gables. At the
top of the tower is a small, bulbous cupola, covered in wooden tiles.
Although built only with an axe, and without a single metal nail, there is
something in the arrogance of its design that is tantalisingly familiar.
Victor, a Ukrainian who lives next to the church and is building his own
wooden house, told how the village was the oldest on the peninsula, dating
from the 12th century. It had become immensely rich from fishing, furs and
the abundant supply of fresh-water pearls, which were used by the thousand
to decorate church robes and crowns. The church's upkeep was met from the
proceeds of all fish caught on religious holidays. Today, the village cannot
afford to build a house for - or pay - a priest.
On our last, gloriously sunny night, we heard for ourselves that, even
without a church, the musical traditions of the village had survived.
Valentine the fish inspector arrived with his accordian. He left at 1am,
setting off upstream in a matchstick of a boat, standing perilously every
now and then to wave goodbye. Still ringing in my ears is his aching,
melancholic song about an astronaut who dreams of his wife, his return to
earth and the numbing, romantic beauty of the Russian countryside.
Many camps on the peninsula are operated by Kola Salmon based at 25 High
Street, Hungerford, Wiltshire RG17 ONF (tel. 0488-683 222). The season runs
from late May to mid-September, and prices vary from Pounds 2,000 to Pounds
3,400 a rod per week. Non-fishing guests pay about Pounds 1,200. Prices,
covering everything except tips and drinks, include British Airways flights
to and from Moscow plus charter aircraft and helicopter transport.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Travel: Hue, serene survivor of an older Asia - Nicholas
Woodsworth climbs the pass of the ocean clouds and survives a drenching in
year-old fish sauce to reach and ancient city slowly recovering from the
horrors of war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IS FOREIGN travel always the rewarding and worthwhile thing it is made out
to be? There are moments when one cannot help asking the question.
I am usually willing to put up with all sorts of discomfort and indignity
provided the final goal is worth it. There are other times, though, when I
wonder what in God's name travel is all about. Such a moment came some 30
miles from the old Vietnamese imperial city of Hue when buckets of fermented
fish sauce began flying in through the window.
I had not paid much attention to the cargo loaded on the roof of the bus I
boarded one sticky morning in the coastal town of Danang. When 35 people are
squashed into a rusty vehicle the size of a milk float, they have other
concerns.
I worried about the furnace heat inside; about the unnatural appearance of
my left leg, twisted between a set of bony Vietnamese knees and a metal
bench support; about the competence of the driver on the steep roads of the
Hai Van pass that lay ahead. Nouc mam was furthest from my mind.
Nouc mam is one of the world's stranger concoctions. It is made by cutting
raw fish into chunks, pressing its juices, adding large quantities of sea
salt and then letting the whole mess ferment in ceramic jars for a year. The
result, a highly pungent brown liquid, is offensive to most foreigners. But
it is an essential of Indochinese life, and no meal in Vietnam is complete
without a good sprinkling of it.
Nor, it seemed, was this bus trip complete without a good sprinkling of it.
All was well as we trundled along north of Danang on a flat seaside plain of
leafy banana trees and electric-green paddy fields. It was when we began
climbing the Hai Van - in Vietnamese, the 'pass of the ocean clouds' - that
things became undone.
As the bus tilted skywards, the nouc mam in the jerry cans above our heads
also tilted. The make-shift seals on the cans' tops - plastic bags with
rubber bands around them - were no match for the brew sloshing around
inside. Within minutes, streams of reeking brown liquid were washing down
over the roof of the bus and into its open windows.
The beauty of the mountains, the aquamarine tint of the sea far below, the
bright confusion of verbena growing by the roadside, the sweet smell of the
pass's pine forests - all were lost on me. Sluiced in the stuff, the bus
stank. My fellow passengers stank. I stank.
When I could stand it no longer I crawled out of the bus's rear doors and
stood on the wide bumper beside a conductor who grinned happily through it
all. Three hours later, when we had crossed the pass and arrived in the
gracious city of Hue, I was shaken, spattered and smelt appalling under the
thick white dust that coated me.
THERE ARE few cities in the world that could entice me to travel the nouc
mam route again. A bath of fish sauce is a kick to the shins of dignity, a
serious damper on general enthusiasm for life. Hue, though, is a city for
which I would do it all again.
Other cities in the region may be roaring aggressively into a brave new
Asian century of high-tech competition. Hue, blithely indifferent, presents
another face. It is tranquil, smiling, slow and gentle. It is the serene
Asia that Asians these days only dream about. It is the ideal place to
recover from the chance circumstance of travel.
Immediately, Hue set about smoothing my ruffled feathers, seducing me with
100 subtle lures. Even the lovely, bamboo-fringed river on which it sits,
the Perfume, seemed to be named to soothe me into forgetfulness. Scrubbed
and changed, I walked out of the waterside Huong Giang hotel, across the
long bridge over the river and through the massive Quang Duc gates of the
citadel on the other bank. As I did so, I realised I was also walking into a
Vietnam far older, more mannered and less hurried than I had seen elsewhere.
Hue at sunset might be an opium eater's vision. Around the citadel's
six-mile perimeter of tall brick ramparts, the water in its moats took on
the purple and orange glow of the sky overhead. Above the imperial enclosure
 -a royal citadel-within-a-citadel - bats fluttered around the Ngo Mon gate,
an eastern fantasy of green and yellow tiles. Lush fruit trees grew against
walls black with age. Statues guarded arched doorways while carved stone
dragons looked down from gables of delicate ceramic work.
The nine holy canon; the nine holy urns; the palace of supreme peace; the
hall of the mandarins; the forbidden purple city - here were buildings and
objects with names that might be thought overblown even in an oriental theme
park. What Disney could never add, though, is Hue's air of peaceful
reflection. If the 13 emperors of the Nguyen dynasty lacked any aid to
asethetic contemplation among these pavilions, pleasure gardens, ceremonial
pools, ornamental gates and temples, I couldn't imagine what it was.
The citadel is not a dead city inhabited only by the past, though. Many of
Hue's 200,000 people live within its fortifications. Beside high palace
walls, I watched peasants in their limpet-shaped hats watering
meticulously-tended lettuce gardens. On fields where imperial horses and
elephants once paraded, small boys ran and kicked balls. Girls with dark
hair cascading down their backs drifted by elegantly on bicycles; as people
here will tell you, proudly, the women of Hue are reputed to be the most
beautiful in Vietnam.
Hue's inhabitants, it seemed to me, are also the country's friendliest.
Everywhere, I was greeted with gentle smiles and shy attempts at my own
language.
Young men in cafes, women on motor scooters, students walking home with
books in hand - all seemed genuinely glad to share their tranquil world with
the none-too-tranquil world of tourism that has breached its gates.
If the city today is remarkable for its serenity and peace, it is because
such qualites have been sought and denied so often in the past. Since its
founding in the 17th century, Hue has interspersed periods of calm with
violent and bloody episodes. It has been fought over by feudal warlords,
stormed and taken by rebel armies. From 1802 until 1945 it was the seat of
the Nguyen emperors' nominal control of all Vietnam.
Imperial oppression was matched only by colonial ferocity in maintaining
genuine control over the country. In 1885 the French attacked and sacked the
citadel: it took three entire days to burn the contents of Hue's imperial
library. But Hue's greatest cataclysm took place only a generation ago.
When North Vientnam launched its Tet offensive in 1968, Hue became the scene
of some of the bloodiest battles of the Vietnam war. Taken by the communists
and contested in brutal house-to-house fighting for 25 days, the citadel was
pounded by the South Vietnamese air force, American artillery and Viet Cong
rockets.
Much of it was levelled and more than 10,000 people, most of them civilians,
died. Of these, 3,000 were merchants, landowners, Buddhist monks, Catholic
priests and suspect intellectuals executed summarily by the Viet Cong. Many
who survived spent years in 're-education' camps assimilating an alien
ideology.
Such wounds heal slowly. Only today, with Vietnam's recent relaxation and
opening to the outside world, is Hue beginning to bloom again. If foreigners
are welcomed warmly by the people, it is because they are a sign of some
return to normality. When Hue smiles at a tourist, it is smiling at a
lifeline to happier times.
LIKE MOST of the small but growing number of visitors to Hue, I cycled to
the tombs of the emperors in the pine-forested hills that rise behind the
city. I visited the seven-story Thien Mu pagoda, one of the most celebrated
Bhuddist temples in the country. And, in the mist early one morning, I
drifted in a boat down the Perfume river, past shrines and bamboo thickets
and temple-studded islands towards the sea. Nowhere else does one get such a
sense of Vietnam's past.
In the end, though, it was not the palaces and pagodas, the hazy dreams of
the past that attracted me most, but the brighter ones of the future.
Number Six, Dinh Tien Hoang Street, is a simple restaurant with a few wooden
tables and a smoky charcoal fire, operated by a co-operative of seven deaf
mutes. The street outside is over-run by ragged street children.
Armless war veterans drop in to beg for hand-outs. It is not the kind of
place, you might think, where you would find much expression of joy or
optimism. But ask any of the young back-packers who spend their evenings
eating there. It is an extremely happy place.
Scuffed-up travellers with modest budgets are not always given a warm,
smiling welcome in the restaurants where they collect. But in Hue they are.
And the travellers reciprocate. The first evening I spent there I saw scenes
I have seen nowhere else - diners sharing jokes with beggars; small street
kids sitting on laps and knees learning simple English songs; whole
conversations about families and jobs and futures mimed in free-form sign
language.
Hue made me happy. Happy enough, after a few evenings, to put me in a
travelling mood again. Happy enough, even, for the first time in days, to
sprinkle a few cautious drops of that remarkable sauce, nouc mam, on my
dinner.
Nicholas Woodsworth travelled via British Airways to Bangkok. For those with
the courage to fly Vietnamese Airlines - it has a fearsome reputation - Hue
is approached most easily from Saigon or Hanoi.
Cars with drivers may be hired through Vietnam's state-owned tourist
organisations for a moderate sum, with Hue included on a country circuit
lasting several days.
Travel in Vietnam has been complicated by restrictions on certain areas and
the need for internal travel documents. In the past two years, however,
Vietnam has made progress in catering to growing numbers of visitors, and
the restrictions may disappear in due course.
Hue has two decent hotels, both on the banks of the Perfume river. The
smaller and older of them, the Huong Giang, is the more pleasant. River
excursions and tours to the tombs of the emperors are organised easily.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Travel: Fantasy Island in a sea of violence - Michael
Thompson-Noel visits a palace of opulence in South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FLY TO South Africa and you are aware, instantly and unmistakeably, that you
have arrived in one of the world's most violent countries.
'Three killed, nine injured in botched robbery,' said a headline in the
Johannesburg Star the day I arrived.
The story described how seven gunmen had fumbled an attempt to rob a
shopping centre. The same day, on the East Rand, three commuters had been
killed and five wounded by a gunman. And in Inanda, near Durban, five people
waiting for a bus had been shot dead.
Not surprisingly, the people who are trying to sell South African tourism
are more than a little schizophrenic. An example is John Smith, senior
manager in Europe for SAA, the South African airline.
He says that South Africa ought to be the perfect holiday destination. Yet
the legacy of apartheid - 'the one Afrikaans word which ended up in the
vocabulary of virtually every language in the world' - has meant that the
natural development of its tourism has been severly restricted.
At present South Africa receives about 350,000 European tourists a year  - a
figure, says Hill, which would be closer to 1.35m if development of its
tourism had not been so inhibited.
Inhibited or not, South African tourism is far more advanced than you might
expect. And some of what it has to offer is eerily futuristic, providing a
glimpse of the future South Africa may enjoy if only it can get there.
I was not heading for Johannesburg. I am not completely stupid. My
destination was the homeland of Bophuthatswana, two-and-a-half hours by car
from Johannesburg, where I wanted to see the Palace Hotel and Lost City
which hotelier Sol Kerzner, who has done much to transform southern Africa's
tourism, has built next to the established resort complex of Sun City.
Visionary is not too grand a word for Kerzner, 58, given the panache and
energy which mark his career. The son of Russian immigrants to South Africa,
he was born in a poor Johannesburg suburb. As a child he helped in the
family cafe. He graduated as a chartered accountant, then became a hotelier,
founding southern Africa's two key hotel groups, Southern Sun Hotels and Sun
International.
Kerzner has been the mainspring of the casino-resort industry in sub-Saharan
Africa, and also greatly boosted tourism in Mauritius and The Comores.
Sun International's Bophuthatswana subsidiary now describes itself as the
third biggest casino-resort group in the world in terms of market
capitalisation. Measured against all hotel groups (with or without gaming
facilities), it says it is 185th in terms of room numbers; 10th by net
income.
Kerzner's latest project, the Pounds 173m Lost City, is an African fantasy
theme resort. It opened a year ago and is viewed as the most ambitious
resort built in Africa. At its heart is the Palace Hotel: 338 rooms,
luxurious, different.
Gerald Allison, of US architects Wimberly, Allison, Tong &amp; Goo
International, a world leader in hotel and resort planning, says that the
first thing to understand about the Palace Hotel is its opulence. 'I know of
no other hotel in the world, past or present, that has the space and
grandeur of the Palace,' he says. 'The Palace is not a hotel masquerading as
a palace; it is a palace.'
That is over the top. Yet the Palace is indeed a remarkable creation.
Next to the hotel is the Lost City complex: the Valley of Waves (hi-tech
waterpark); an entertainment centre; special features such as the Bridge of
Time; and a fantasy jungle-garden that uses more than 1.6m plants, trees and
shrubs of 3,200 species.
The hotel has its own Gary Player-designed, par-72 golf course (impressive
desert layout, including live crocodiles in the water hazard at the 13th
hole); and there are game drives and safaris available in Pilanesberg
national park.
For South Africa, Sol Kerzner's Lost City is futuristic in the literal
sense: a projection of the good things that lie ahead. Or perhaps it is just
a chimera: a fantasy from a future that will never come true.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Travel: A slow train ride on the banana line - Mark Hodson
tours the Caribbean coast of Honduras
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK HODSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE train waited to pull out of San Pedro Sula, a ticket inspector with a
Hitler moustache marched dawn the carriage, at his side a gum-chewing
teenager with an M-16.
It was a three-hour ride to the Caribbean coast and the first-class fare was
25p. The seats were made of slatted wood; second-class was the same price
but without the seats. Welcome to Honduras, the original banana republic.
At the station a clerk had tried to persuade me to take the bus, which cost
another 10p but took just 45 minutes. 'This is not like your trains in
England,' he told me.
We pulled away with a fierce jolt, bang on time at 6.45am, and as we crawled
out of the city and an orange sun rose over the shabby suburbs, the driver
leant long and hard on his horn to clear the track of cars, children and
skinny dogs.
Our carriage had been built in 1951 but the line was older, one of those
laid early this century by the US fruit companies to transport their bananas
from their plantations to their boats.
With wheels screaming and windows rattling we passed tumbledown wooden
shacks where fat men in vests lounged on porches and naked toddlers played
with pigs in the dirt. As the train neared the coast the villages were no
longer Hispanic but black, the ubiquitous background salsa beat giving way
to a pounding reggae.
The end of the line was Puerto Cortes where passengers were let off just
outside the container port. The town was seedy and run-down, full of pool
halls with paint peeling from the walls and grim-looking prostitutes.
It was the first town in central America I had seen without a church on the
main square. In the evening I witnessed a real old-fashioned bar-room brawl
complete with flying stools and broken whisky bottles - all tremendous fun.
The morning train going east along the coast to Tela took 4 1/2 hours to
cover 30 miles. We spent the last two hours in a boxcar with a corrugated
tin roof and narrow slits for windows, which was rather like travelling in
an oven.
Tela is laid out along a long beach with white sand and palm trees; stout
black women wander up and down carrying bowls of coconuts which they crack
open for sunbathers with one deft swing of a machete.
A pair of barefoot boys banged out rhythms on upturned buckets and cymbals
made of rusted tin-can lids. Their younger brother shimmied and danced in
the hot sand.
The boys told me they lived in Triunfo de la Cruz, a small village along the
coast which I promised to visit the next day. The people there call
themselves Garifuna and speak a strange cocktail of Spanish, English and
Dutch.
They were brought to Honduras from the Caribbean islands in the 1920s and
1930s to work the plantations, and although some of the teenagers have
discovered rap music and Malcolm X baseball caps, the old men pass their
days playing dominoes or tending their neat gardens.
The houses are well-kept. The women bake coconut bread, their husbands fish
in dug-out canoes. There are no beggars or drunks and everyone looked
well-fed and happy.
On the bus back I sat squeezed between two big mamas who provided welcome
padding when the steering column broke and we veered off the road into a
ditch. We waited an hour in the thick heat, the two ladies chatting
cheerfully over my head, as the driver repaired the damage with the engine
running and the radio blaring.
On the other side of Tela was a newly-designated national park called Punta
Sal, so new that no buses yet went there. I managed to hitch a ride with a
fish salesman and balanced precariously on a freezer in the back of his
pick-up as it bumped down a sandy track.
For an hour we drove along a thin isthmus with the crashing Caribbean sea on
one side and a perfectly still, deep green lagoon on the other. At the mouth
of the lagoon was Miami, a village of two dozen thatched huts built on the
sand. Children laughed and played football on the beach while a man in a
floppy hat carved a canoe out of a tree trunk with an adze.
A fisherman took me out on the lagoon, punting his boat slowly through thick
mangrove swamps where egrets skimmed the calm water in search of lunch.
There were said to be tigers there and white-faced monkeys, but my guide
told me it was too windy for them to come out, or possibly too hot, one or
the other.
Two days down the coast I landed at Trujillo, an old port and former capital
founded in 1525. Overlooking the harbour stood the ruins of a Spanish fort.
It was a bleak spot but clearly a popular one with locals because a sign on
a wall warned: Prohibido los romances.
Above the town in an overgrown graveyard was the burial place of the
American filibuster William Walker who in 1856 successfully invaded
Nicaragua with 56 men. A few miles along the coast stood Puerto Castilla,
the point where Columbus first landed on mainland America and where the
first of many Catholic masses was said. Now there are just rows of filthy
shacks, another banana port and a closed-down shrimping station.
It is said - too frequently - that the effect of tourism is to destroy the
environment, but the scene at Puerto Castilla seemed worse. I longed to see
a monument or commemorative plaque, even a souvenir shop.
But perhaps, amid dust, poverty and hopelessness, it would be too squalid a
place to celebrate the birth of the New World. Or too poignant.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Minister for a Day: Soul before profits - Sir Peter Hall
takes over the culture portfolio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Sir PETER HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MY ONLY day as Minister of Culture would be brief and decisive. I would have
to leave sorting out the mess of our broadcasting system (now that its
traditions of public service have been so weakened) until a second and more
extensive term. I would concentrate on general policy and the performing
arts. And since I would have to do only three things, I should be home by
tea-time, if not for lunch.
I would not have taken the job, even for a day, unless new and substantial
funds were available. The money we spend on the arts is still pathetically
small compared with our European partners. So, first, I would double the
subvention to the Arts Council.
Even so, the amount is peanuts: an insignificant footnote in the defence or
social services budgets. Yet, no action could make a more dramatic change to
our society. Our quality of life would improve immediately and, with it, the
educational potention of our young people. Our tourist industry would thrive
and so would our international standing. Television and film would flourish
because of the influx of new talents.
I would then turn to the administration of these new funds. I would not wish
to control them myself or regard myself, because I was minister, as the
arbiter of taste for the arts. I would not philosophise. I would leave
policy to the artists. The further the arts are kept away from politics and
politicians, the better.
I would, therefore, reform the Arts Council and reinstate the power and
independence it had 20 years ago. It was an institution that worked
wonderfully, born as it was of the idealism and hopes of the immediate
post-war years. The council effectively solved the problem of state
interference and made a minister of culture, in the European mode,
superfluous. So, I would happily do myself out of a job.
No society, and certainly no democracy, is healthy without many independent
artists criticising and challenging it. Governments, of whatever stripe, are
uncomfortable with artists and would prefer them safely dead and elevated to
the nostalgic status of the classic. Politicians never like critics of the
present, especially if they are artists.
This insecurity can reach extreme forms: the censor always proclaims a sick
society. Yet, governments know that we treasure the lessons of the artist
more than the lessons of their rulers. We remember Mozart rather than the
name of the emperor who failed to support him.
The council's arms-length principle arose from an understanding that
governments must never proscribe what the artist says. The piper must be
paid, but the tune must be emphatically his own. Otherwise, he is useless to
us.
The council did not try to plan art into existence - always a barren and
schematic procedure. The policy was to watch out for creativity wherever it
occurred and then encourage it with a mite of subsidy. The process was
organic.
Artists also decided the policy of the council. Major painters, composers
and writers served on it. I remember the days when Henry Moore, Michael
Tippett and Peggy Ashcroft were deciding the future of the arts, helped (and
not dictated to) by the officers of the council. Now, the artists have gone
and the bureaucrats rule.
The council has declined slowly. It no longer fights for the arts and has
become an instrument of government. Its policy over the past decade has been
to reduce subsidy even if it closed down creativity. This is absurd.
The reasons why the arts need subsidy, and why society needs the arts
desperately, have been forgotten in a welter of monetarist dogma. It took
nearly 40 years to create a support structure which recognised that public
funding should be the primary support for many arts, and not the box office
income. For a brief period, this made London the international capital of
music, and the British theatre the most prolific producer of new plays -
plays, moreover, that went round the world. All this improved directly
Britain's balance of payments and the potency of its tourist trade.
British arts are one of the country's few success stories of the post-war
years. We have forgotten that their renaissance was produced by subsidy; and
that their decline is parallelled by a succession of government manoeuvres
using private sponsorship (no bad thing in itself: after all, we live in a
mixed economy ) as a covert means of reducing central subsidy.
Subsidy also kept admission prices low, so that the arts were available to
anyone who wanted them. Years of the application of market forces have
destroyed this principle. Subsidised art is now priced as high as the market
will bear, thus removing its social point. I find something obscene in
Covent Garden charging Pounds 120 for a stall seat while it receives a
subsidy of Pounds 18m a year. Your taxes and mine are not going to people
who cannot afford the arts, but to the very rich.
So, my third action as minister would help the young. I would construct my
budget so that everybody under 25 could have free admission by right to any
of the subsidised arts. Nothing would have a greater effect on the taste of
the future; or on its wisdom and maturity. I have found the arts a more
trustworthy guide to the problems of life than the dogma of any organised
religion. Art asks the right questions; it does not give easy answers.
As a democrat, I distrust paternalism and believe in freedom of choice. But
we must be given the best to choose from, not the worst. That is why the
arts are important. I fear, though, that the next few years will see the
dismantling of the subsidised arts. This process will be seen as a logical
adjunct to the end of the welfare state. At the same time, we shall be
colonised by hours and hours of cheap American television. Is this what we
want?
There would be no point in being Minister of Culture unless I was part of a
government which believed that the soul of the nation - its heritage, its
language, and its contemporary creativity - was as important as its
productivity.

FT  13 NOV 93 / The suicide cult of Kiev: Jill Barshay investigates the
panic caused in Ukraine by the White Brotherhood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL BARSHAY

<TEXT>
THE CAPTURE of the mysterious leaders of the White Brotherhood cult this
week may have ended one of the more bizarre episodes in Ukraine's
post-Soviet history.
Ukraine has hyperinflation, hazardous nuclear weapons and energy shortages,
but over the past two weeks the authorities have been preoccupied with
reports of thousands of young cult followers flocking to Kiev to join their
'living god on this earth' in a mass suicide. Fearing the worst and
inexperienced in dealing with fringe religious groups, police detained more
than 800 cult members while the authorities launched an aggressive
propaganda campaign.
The White Brotherhood, which claims 150,000 members from all over the former
Soviet Union, chose the St Sophia Cathedral Square in Kiev as its gathering
place to await the end of the world and to witness the crucifixion and
resurrection of its leader, Maria Devi Khristos, a self-proclaimed messiah.
In city streets as far away as Moscow there are posters of the Maria Devi
Khristos - whose real name is Maria Tsvygun - a young dark-eyed woman clad
in a white priestly robe with gold trim and turban. She comes from eastern
Ukraine and was formerly a member Komsomol, the communist youth league, and
a journalist.
Last week the cult said the apocalypse and their mass suicide would take
place on November 24. But later they re-scheduled doomsday to November 14
and modified their mass suicide plan to a re-enactment of the Christ story,
in which their leader is the next coming of Jesus Christ and President
Leonid Kravchuk is Pontius Pilate.
Maria Devi Khristos and the cult's reputed mastermind, Yuri Krivonogov, came
out of hiding last Wednesday, when police arrested them in the 11th century
St Sophia Cathedral, the oldest house of worship in the Slavic Orthodox
faiths. Even from jail, the cult leaders insist the end of the world is
imminent and say they have fulfilled their promise to their followers by
reaching the cathedral. Their followers keep coming to Kiev.
Ukrainian authorities are baffled. Their instinctive reaction has been to
lock the cult followers in jails, throw them into psychiatric wards or
deport them. Dozens of police patrol St Sophia Square. But it has been calm
since the arrests with only reporters standing by and parents of runaway
children hoping to spot their loved ones.
Wednesday's arrests took place after cult members, disguised as tourists,
gained entry to the church and started chanting. Museum attendants called
the police. As policemen tried to seize the cult members, a scuffle broke
out. One policeman suffered a fractured skull and about Dollars 1,600 in
damage was caused to the cathedral.
Almost 400 of the detained cult members are on hunger strike. Rather than
release the prisoners, the Ministry of Internal Affairs has decided to wait
until 'they fall unconscious from hunger' so that they can be 'force-fed.'
The authorities' anti-White Brotherhood propaganda campaign, has stirred up
hysteria among Ukraine's 52m people. Radio broadcasts warn parents to keep
their children off the streets and out of the cult's hypnotic grasp.
State-controlled television airs Interior Ministry reports, showing tearful
parents who have lost their loved ones to the cult and angry citizens who
urge that the Brotherhood be 'liquidated.' The Brotherhood is accused of
inciting fear, hatred and suicide.
Some Kiev schools have shortened their day to make sure students get home
before sundown. A rock station called upon those with extra-sensory powers
to help cult members 'rejoin society.' The Ukrainian Orthodox Church
Filaret, one of the church's highest officials, has denounced the White
Brotherhood as the 'anti-Christ.'
The propaganda campaign has drawn relatives of runaways and missing people
from all over Ukraine, Russia and Byelorussia to prisons in Ukraine to find
lost children and spouses.
Vera Sobuleva and her young daughter Anya were among about 30 relatives
knocking on the doors of the Kiev Detention Centre prison last week. Her 17
year old son, Kolya, disappeared a month ago on a trip from his
polytechnical institute to his home Lipetsk.
Mrs Sobuleva did not know for certain if her son, with whom she has had a
'difficult relationship', was in Kiev but she immediately packed her bags
and made the three-day trip after watching television reports. 'On
television they said that the White Brotherhood is taking, kidnapping
children. They said to come to the detention centre to take our children
back,' she said.
Mrs Sobuleva did not find Kolya in the prison, but other parents have found
their children.
In the prison, the cult members are calm and spend most of their time
chanting Maria Devi Khristos' name. Most refuse to reveal their names or
ages or talk about their lives before they joined the cult, explaining: 'All
this is unimportant and meaningless.'
'We are honest before god,' said one young bearded man, 'we were singing on
the streets and they've illegally arrested us. All we want is to meet our
Maria Devi Khristos. She's supposed to reveal herself.'
A young woman, clutching a pink rose and crocheted white shawl over her
face, explained how they were 'carted off St Sophia's Square in trucks like
animals. We are people first of all and we have the right to our faith.'
When asked about their faith, they referred reporters to the literature. And
literature, there is aplenty. Already the Interior Ministry has confiscated
over four tons of pamphlets and posters in apartments around Kiev.
In its 'Godly-Cosmic-Programme,' the White Brotherhood offers love and
salvation for those who have complete faith in Marina Devi Khristos and
condemns those who do not to hell.
Tamara Yustinovskaya, whose son joined the brotherhood, has formed a
parents' support group called Relief. Relief has taken issue with the
authorities' tactics and argues that the children 'need help, not
punishment.' She said the children are 'zombie-like robots . . . programmed
for death.'
But the Soviet-style psychiatric regime in Ukraine is ill-prepared to deal
with the cult. At a round table, sponsored by the Internal Ministry, one
psychiatrist asked, 'What can we do? They won't take food or talk to us.'

FT  13 NOV 93 / As They Say in Europe: If only Maastricht weren't Dutch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST AS the European Union comes into being, everyone is having another look
at it. There is the kind of reassessment that follows a night on the town,
the town in this case being Maastricht.
The mood, in spite of official denials, is 'forget it and do what we can.'
But, in Britain, the press sustains an obbligato on the iniquitous ambitions
of Brussels and its bureaucrats. The Sunday Telegraph is the most gifted
specialist in this area: each week, columns of well-researched exposes
nestle by others of polished sneers.
Suddenly, though, the shaky foundations of this erudite structure are
revealed. A writer last week made much of the discovery of a geological age
known as 'maastrichtian.' This intelligence was pressed into service as a
lumbering recruit in the struggle that continues forever.
Then came a reference to the 'infamous Belgian town.' So, one is reminded
that the corpus of British Euro-scepticism is founded on a knowledge of
Maastricht the treaty but not of Maastricht the city; it knows so much of
'Europe' and nothing of Europe.
The point of the treaty is that it could not have been written anywhere
other than in Holland, and at no time other than when the EC laboured under
the dual monarchy of Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission,
and the Dutch - the rule of grand design and impenetrable pedantry.
In the Maastricht treaty, the hand of Holland's Prime Minister, Ruud
Lubbers, works its magic in every arcane compromise, in each dreary
derogation, and in the full stop turned into masterly semi-colon.
Many in Britain will wonder if the confusion matters: Belgium, Holland -
what's the difference? All the difference in the world. Holland owes its
existence to the enterprise and vigour of the natives, Belgium to the
enterprise and vigour of others, notably the British.
In Holland, the inhabitants sleep well and eat badly; in Belgium, it is the
other way round. Belgium consists of two warring factions held together
shakily by a bankrupt government, a state permanently about to disintegrate.
Holland unites behind defiant dams and dykes. But try to build, or change,
anything else and you will be in trouble.
Belgium is visited by everyone and known by none, Everybody knows Holland,
but who goes there? Brussels has more foreign correspondents per square
metre than any other Community capital, but Belgium remains the
least-reported nation. It is also the country to which all good Dutchmen
retire to dispose of their businesses. Today, the Dutch financial press
caters to a narrow band of subscribers who live just inside Belgium.
The standard joke the country suffers is the demand to find six famous
Belgians, a list which apparently begins and ends with the singer Jacques
Brel. But, in fact, half the masters of the Dutch renaissance would have
been Belgians had Belgium existed.
And Belgium has given us Tintin, the most popular boy in the world. His
exploits are translated into all major languages but Tintin is Belgium
itself, the figure one would never notice, anonymous and unconscious of his
central role.
His universe changes shape depending on the location of the reader:
Professor Calculus is known to every English-speaking child but he is
Professor 'Sunflower', Zonnebloem or Tournesol, to Dutch and French infants.
Thompson and Thomson are English and French but, when German, become Schultz
and Schultze, while the British dog Snowy is Milou or Strupi elsewhere.
Thus, in Belgium, if you land in Zeebrugge and make for Liege, you will
never find it. You have to look for a sign to Luik; if it says Liege, you
are there. Arrive from the east and only Luttich will guide you. Belgium is
what others make it, the product of everybody else's vision, a solipsistic
dream.
To find the truth about a country, I read its papers; but these are no help
in Belgium. In Wallonia, the nation is one thing; in Flanders, another. But,
this week for once, Le Soir and the Gazet van Antwerpen were united by what
always brings the country together - strikes. In Le Soir, one reads about
France; in the Gazet, the news is from nowhere.
If only Maastricht had been a Belgian town. It would have had three names
and 15 different meanings. Each of us could have settled on the one we found
most pleasing and the treaty would be all things to all men, a rich tapestry
of clear compromises, unconcealed by academic obfuscation.
Subsidiarity would be made flesh over plates of mussels and frites, washed
down with endless bottles of Trappist ale. Breughel and Tintin would have
given us a self-indulgent Europe, one that would work (but only just), and a
happy ending. But, unfortunately for us and the treaty, Maastricht is Dutch.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors' Transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN ROGERS, the Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CLEAR two-way pull has developed in the property sector. Whereas six
months ago directors were strong net buyers of both property investment and
development companies, there has been a distinct divergence of opinion in
the wake of the sector's recent rally.
Among the sales last week was that of Phillip Davies, managing director of
Frogmore Estates, who sold 31,000 shares at 484p. The shares have
outperformed the market by 65 per cent over the last year and it is easy to
understand the desire to protect gains of that scale.
Davies is left with 113,000 shares after the sale, but it is worth noting
that he sold approximately 70,000 shares in May at around 380p, some of them
resulting from an option.
Three directors of Allied Textiles have sold a total of 113,000 shares at
515p. By far the largest sale was that of Geoffrey Willshaw, who unloaded
100,000 shares, leaving him with 760,000. Gerald Wightman, finance director
and David Fearnley sold 8,000 and 5,000 respectively.
The Allied Textiles share price performance has been largely in line with
the market and brokers are forecasting earnings growth of just 5 per cent in
the year to September 1993. Final results are due to be announced in
January.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: A kipper saved my bacon - Diary of a
Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WAITER slammed a plate with two pieces of rather ragged, cold kipper in
front of me. 'Here]' he said. This was supposed to be lunch? It looked more
like the inedible remains of someone's breakfast.
Twenty minutes earlier, I had rejected the original main course presented to
me because it was not what I had ordered. Now, everyone around me was poking
at unappetising desserts.
It was March 1990. As chairman of the governors of a local school, I had
been invited by the headmaster to attend a conference for head teachers. All
morning, we had endured being sealed in a gloomy, airless room at the
conference location: a Queen's Moat House hotel.
This experience was hardly an encouragement to buy shares in Queen's Moat.
Even when analysts and other City pundits were recommending the shares, I
avoided them, especially when business in the hotel industry clearly was
tough with an ever-increasing number of hotels being advertised for sale by
receivers.
In the same way that personal experience can often point the way to
profitable investments, it can also provide warning signals and help prevent
losses.
Early in the 1980s, I avoided investing in Trans World Airlines because of a
bad experience on a flight from the US to Britain. The cabin crew had taken
some time to be convinced that one of the engines was on fire, even though
smoke was clearly visible from the aircraft's passenger windows.
Eventually, the aircraft changed course and returned to the airport but no
TWA staff were available to advise on replacement travel plans.
After passengers had waited some hours without information, I used a pay
telephone to call TWA's head office - where I was told that the jet was well
on its way to London and could not possibly be back on US soil. This
experience saved me from large investment losses.
When Mrs Fields' Cookies was launched on the UK stock market in 1986, I
avoided it because a visit to one of its shops in London revealed a limited
product range and few customers. The shares, floated at 140p, were suspended
at 10p in 1991 and the company is now controlled by bankers.
From 1981-85, I was a director of Independent Television Publications, then
the publisher of TV Times. At one point I was told, informally, that many
thousands of badly-produced copies had had to be scrapped by one of the
magazine's printers. This was because its boss had ordered that the presses
could be stopped only with his personal approval.
On this occasion, with reject copies pouring off the presses, it had taken
some time to make contact with him and gain his assent to a temporary
shut-down for repairs. The man concerned was Robert Maxwell.
I knew from reading newspapers in 1971 that a Department of Trade
investigation had thought him unfit to run a public company. And while, no
doubt, he did help to sort out the British printing industry, I still
regarded his business methods as questionable. The printing episode revealed
that he was also rather stupid; thus, I therefore never invested in any
Maxwell-controlled companies.
My two daughters and I used to like Lyon's Maid ice lollies. I thought about
investing in Clarke Foods when it took over the ice cream interests of
Allied Lyons in January 1992, but decided to wait until the spring to assess
its sales against the competition.
We were rather surprised several times to find that our favourite was not
available in local sweet shops, and it was clear that Clarke was having
production and/or distribution difficulties. I did not invest. Clarke called
in administrative receivers in October 1992.
When I walked around London in 1989, the unlet office blocks and shops that
I saw led me to dispose of my last shares in the property sector. Thus, I
avoided the subsequent sharp downturn in property company share prices and
the collapse of companies like Mountleigh.
I still see many unlet shops and empty office blocks - yet, property shares
have soared this year and I have missed out on some spectacular gains. So,
some personal experiences are good only if other investors, especially big
institutions, share them.
Many investment decisions have to rely on such published information as
company reports and press coverage, since it is impossible to gain any
relevant personal experiences from the companies concerned. It was, however,
a personal experience that made me rather cautious about the role of
auditors.
Many years ago, I was researching a television documentary. I was about to
discuss the project with a City whizzkid when I overheard him on the
telephone. He was trying to take over another company and wanted to boost
his own company's impending results. He suggested that the numbers and
values of the company stocks should be increased for the purposes of the
accounts, as the auditors were unlikely to go around and count everything.
Recently, there has been criticism of small accounting firms such as Bird
Luckin, auditor to Queen's Moat. This almost implies that, to be really safe
in an investor's eyes, a company should be audited by one of the big firms.
However, even they have had their share of failed companies - such as
Coopers &amp; Lybrand with British and Commonwealth Holdings; Rush and Tompkins
(Dominion International); and Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Young with Bank
of Credit and Commerce International.
In my view, investment based on personal experience is the best way to avoid
corporate disaster.

IT IS possible to battle your bank and win. I hold an Abbey National
investment account which I opened earlier this year with Pounds 2,500 and
which allows two penalty-free withdrawals in a 12-month period. The terms
and conditions state: 'For account holders with a balance under Pounds
10,000, you can make up to two penalty-free withdrawals (subject to daily
withdrawal limits) in each account year.'
With this in mind, I planned to make two such withdrawals to pay for a
holiday and, later, travellers' cheques. I wanted the first withdrawal of
Pounds 1,300 to be divided into two cheques, one for Pounds 1,075.75 and the
second for Pounds 224.25.
But the cashier was adamant that this constituted two withdrawals and that I
would lose 90 days' interest on the next withdrawal, which I planned to make
the following week because I could not give 90 days' notice.
I spoke to the branch manager, who agreed that the terms and conditions were
vague on what constituted a withdrawal. My point was that this was one sum
being withdrawn at one go, and that splitting it into two cheques was an
administrative issue. Furthermore, I argued that there was nothing in the
terms and conditions to make me think otherwise. We agreed that he would get
in touch with head office and check the position.
I later received a letter from him saying: '. . . Having checked with my
head office, I confirm that this effectively represents only one withdrawal
from your account and, therefore, you are able to effect another
penalty-free withdrawal from your account between now and 1st June 1994.'
Needless to say, there was no apology for having been misled in the first
place. And although Abbey National's head office has confirmed that such a
transaction represents one withdrawal, there is no guarantee that future
customers will not be given similarly incorrect advice, given the initial
reactions of the cashier and manager.

AS WELL as skiing likes and dislikes, FT readers also had strong opinions
about which resorts they most favoured.
Peter Lambert, of Gosport, Hampshire, managed to combine a love of French
resorts with fine wining and dining: 'We almost always ski in France, always
driving there by car, which relieves the memory of travelling by air to
Geneva on a plane that always left two hours late, and the subsequent wait
at the airport for the coach to take us to our resort.
'Driving back requires a rest stop for a good dinner near Beaune; we favour
Meursault or Auxey-Duresses, since they offer a chance to visit one of the
negociants. Whoever wins the toss to taste the wines can enjoy the rest of
the journey in a blissful haze while the other drives to the coast.'
Another foodie, Petteri Kostermaa, of Helsinki, Finland, plumped for
Switzerland: 'The best skiing I had was in Verbier - it's made for serious
skiers but also has some great dining places. What depresses me about skiing
are those skiers who over-estimate their abilities, and also people who
waste chair or gondola space on lifts by not teaming up with other people.'
Andy Marks, of North Hill, London, favoured Italy, but began with a point
that applies to almost any resort: 'Great skiing holidays don't need 600km
of slopes, but adequate snow, with variety, and off-piste for those that
seek it. This usually means higher resorts.
'For ambience, Italy seems to offer the best balance between snow, sun, fun
and festivity. The most memorable meal I had was lunch on the last day of
our trip to Courmayeur: chateaubriand for two sitting outside in the sun on
the slopes, the white-hatted chef bringing it out on a silver platter. Good
wine helped this simple fare.'
Neil Carter, of Cullompton, Devon, spoke for many when expressing his
preference for 'ski-in, ski-out resorts with minimal transport problems.
Breckenridge is a big plus for this, and Arc 1800 is also good.'
Simon Clucas, of Southgate, London, also nominates Italy, namely Cervinia
and Livigno, as good value for money, and further singles out Courchevel,
Crans Montana, Zermatt ('my favourite') and Aviemore in Scotland for special
praise. However, he takes we ski writers to task: 'Many skiing articles
either cater for the knock-kneed beginner - 'it'll be a lark, honest' - or
for the affluent expert hooked on helicopters, five-star hotels and black
runs.' Point taken: mid-range resorts can combine the best of both worlds.
American resorts came in for high praise from many Pink Snow respondents.
James Walters, of Paget, Bermuda, writes: 'To ski America's premier resorts
is like treating yourself to a once-in-a-lifetime meal. One warning: go
there once and you'll want to go again and again.'
Janet Thomas, of Orpington, Kent, broadly agrees: 'Some years ago we went to
Colorado, as a catered chalet there was hardly more expensive than a top
European resort. We had a wonderful time, and without hesitation, we would
go back. The pistes are very different, but I do miss certain aspects of
skiing in Europe - there are no typical Austrian mountain restaurants and
apres ski is virtually non-existent. Having skied in the US for the past
four years, I do sometimes miss that 'let's ski to another village for lunch
and have a gluhwein on the way' approach.'
Anthony Leech, of South Norwood, London, was another fan of the US, in spite
of his chilly experience. 'A warning for those travelling to Vermont: wrap
up warm] Temperatures can fall below -30`C, with wind chill taking it down
to -50`C. The only real cure I have found is a quickly consumed,
steaming-hot alcoholic cocktail. This cure often needs administering more
than twice a day, to the detriment of the perfect parallel]'
However, the boot was on the other foot for American skier Erik Luchs, of
Newport Beach, California: 'We skied Europe for the first time in 1988 and
had the best holiday ever. We find that US resorts get wonderful snow and
the latest chair-lifts, but we found Switzerland and Austria to have all
that and, in addition, the quaint ambience only Europe can give.'
Finally, for those Britons who despair of delayed charter flights and
expensive European resorts, Roger Bade, of Morden, Surrey, actually managed
to find some decent skiing in England. 'In common with most sporting
activities in England, the main determinant is the weather. Allenheads, the
highest village in Northumberland, is probably the best ski centre in
England, close to the British &amp; Scandanavian Ski Club tow. Apres ski in the
Allenheads Inn is superb]
'There are disadvantages: it does snow before the ski tow is set up in
November; it can be difficult to start the tractor that operates the ski
tow; and the vertical drop is only 500ft. Other skiing centres in the North
Pennines include Weardale and Stanhope Ski Club, the Carlisle Ski Club, and
the Teesdale Ski Club, where on the Hartside slalom run, the ski lodge
masquerades as the Hartside Cafe during the summer]'

FT  13 NOV 93 / Pink Snow - FT Guide To The World's Best Ski Resorts (4):
Wilson skis the globe - FT Round the World expedition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Financial Times is embarking on a unique fact-finding mission (and a
little fun): to boldly ski where few - if any, in some resorts - have skied
before. In 1994, Arnie Wilson, the FT's ski correspondent since 1986, and
his French-born companion Lucy Dicker will attempt to spend the entire year
skiing, without missing a day - except on August 20 which will pass them by
as they cross the date-line in Tahiti.
Their odyssey will take them to more than 300 resorts in 13 countries. Along
the way they will compile a monthly report for the Weekend FT on their
progress and adventures - for better or worse.
En route, readers who catch a glimpse of them in their FT pink ski suits as
they flash by - or perhaps totter past - will be entitled to enter a monthly
competition to win a magnum of Mercier pink champagne. In addition, another
competition is planned with skiing holidays and ski clothing and equipment
as prizes.
In January, the Financial Times Round The World Ski Expedition begins among
the Teton mountains at Jackson Hole, Wyoming and then moves on through
Idaho, Oregon, Lake Tahoe in California, Washington, and the spectacular
Canadian Rockies in British Columbia and Alberta.
In February they will press on through Montana, South Dakota, Iowa,
Minnesota, Wisconsin - where Wilson will celebrate his 50th birthday -
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and even Alabama. March
finds them in North Carolina, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, Maryland,
Pennsylvania and New York before moving on to more conventional terrain in
Austria, Italy and Germany.
April is dominated by resorts in Switzerland and France. Then in May, Wilson
and Dicker will seek out the late snows of the Austrian glaciers before
moving on to the Himalayas, the Japan Alps and California before heading
south to the Andes resorts of Chile in mid-June. In mid-July they will be in
Argentina, and in mid-August they head for New Zealand and Australia.
The final two months will be spent back in the US, skiing through Vermont,
New York again, Maine and New Hampshire, Colorado and Utah. The expedition
finishes on December 31 1994 at its original starting point of Jackson Hole.
Sponsors include Hewlett Packard, Avis, American Airlines, Clarins, Air New
Zealand and Snow &amp; Rock, which is providing equipment. The first expedition
report appears in January.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Complex structure, attractive
returns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW business expansion scheme from the Anglia Polytechnic University is
so complicated you almost need a degree to understand it, writes Philip
Coggan. Flexit 2, sponsored by Richard Ellis Venture Consultants, could run
for as much as 31 years, at the option of the university. Nevertheless, it
is designed to offer attractive returns even if it runs beyond the normal
five-year period.
The Pounds 7.7m raised will be used to provide accommodation for students on
campus in Chelmsford. At the end of year five, the university will have the
option to buy back the properties at the equivalent of a share price of
128p. That would give higher-rate taxpayers an annualised return of 14.92
per cent, or 10.67 per cent basic rate taxpayers.
A 128p return is higher than anything available on other university schemes.
But Flexit 2 is not cash-backed and the university might decide not to
exercise its option, so there is a higher risk.
If the option is not exercised, the properties will be transferred into two
trusts in December 1998. Investors will receive an immediate cash payment of
29p a share plus a rental income, equivalent to around 51.8p a share over
the next five years. The university will then have further options to buy
back the properties after 10, 15, 20 and 25 years. The sums are designed to
give investors a gross return of 14.36 per cent over 10 years. If they pay
tax at 40 per cent on the rental income, the return falls to 12.64 per cent
net; however, the rental income is classed as Schedule A for tax purposes
and can be offset against some other property borrowings.
The university will have a strong incentive to buy the property after five
years since, at that point, the cost of its funds will rise substantially.
The most likely outcome, according to Richard Ellis, is a scheme exit after
five years.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: BES gets a medical slant -
Scheherazade Daneshkhu finds pathology and dentistry among the ventures
seeking money for expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUSINESS expansion scheme has been used to raise money for anything from
goat breeding to distilling whisky, but the latest trading ventures have a
medical flavour. HarleyScreen is a pathology laboratory which specialises in
walk-in HIV testing and vasectomies. Last year, it raised Pounds 741,000
through a BES issue and spent part buying a virology laboratory.
It is now seeking to raise a further Pounds 750,000 for two more labs to
expand the business. Shares will be issued at 120p for those who apply
before November 29 and at 125p for others. The issue is sponsored by Matrix
Securities and the minimum investment is Pounds 1,000.
Golden Hands is a dental payments scheme launched as a BES. According to the
prospectus, the aim is to help dentists gain new business while offering
discounts to patients. There would be a registration fee of Pounds 25 and an
annual Pounds 10 fee to the public in return for members receiving discounts
from participating dentists.
Nick Percival, of BESt Investment, highlights one of the risk factors
mentioned in the prospectus which states that the scheme 'is innovative and
has not yet been available to the public or the dental profession;
accordingly, its future cannot be accurately assessed.' Percival says:
'Investors should be wary of innovative companies which provide little
financial information, have not done market research, and where the
directors are part-time and therefore do not need the company to survive.'
Several new assured-tenancy schemes have also been issued, and BESt
Investment reminds PAYE investors of the importance of timing of tax relief.
They are unlikely to have enough time to obtain a tax coding change if they
receive their BES-3 certificates much beyond mid-February, and this reduces
the projected return.
BESt Investment calculates that if investors have to wait until agreeing
their 1993/94 tax return with the Inland Revenue, the exit price will be
reduced by one percentage point. 'An exit price of 117p and early tax
certificates can easily offer better value than 120p and some doubt about a
tax coding change,' it says.
Sponsor Hodgson Martin, which raised Pounds 11m in September for Magdalen
College, Oxford, is launching a second scheme for the college to raise
Pounds 7m to build accommodation. The exit price is 123p, which equates to
14.5 per cent a year for a top-rate taxpayer, but there is no cash backing.
Minimum investment is Pounds 2,000.
Accumulus Hallam II is a contracted-exit scheme sponsored by Terrace Hill
Capital for Sheffield Hallam University. It offers a fixed-exit price of
125p, equating to a return of up to 15 per cent a year after five years for
every 100p invested. Cash backing covers only half the university's
obligations. Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000.
Cavendish Gleeson Cash-Backed, sponsored by Smith &amp; Williamson, will buy
residential properties from MJ Gleeson Group, a quoted company, to let on an
assured-tenancy basis. Gleeson is to buy back shares from investors at 120p
after five years. The issue is backed by cash deposits at Lloyds bank and
the minimum investment is Pounds 1,000.
At least three housing association BES are being launched. BESSA Springboard
aims to raise money for new and refurbished property to be used by
Springboard Housing Association for homeless people. Investors can choose a
fixed-exit price of 120p (equating to 14.1 per cent to a higher-rate
taxpayer) or a return linked to interest rates, measured by three-month
Libor.
The variable return will comprise a fixed return of 80p plus 1p for every 1
per cent rise in interest rates above 5.75 per cent each quarter. Although
three-month Libor is at its lowest for 15 years, this option will be
attractive only to those who think the government will not maintain
inflation within its target range of 1-4 per cent. Minimum investment is
Pounds 2,000.
Matrix Securities is sponsor to Homes for South Wight, Isle of Wight and
North Cheshire, three housing associations which will use up to Pounds 9.5m
to provide accommodation at low rents to people in housing need. The
associations say they will provide a fixed return of 125p, equating to 14.5
per cent a year for a higher-rate taxpayer, but there is no cash backing.
Aegis VI, also sponsored by Matrix, aims to raise up to Pounds 10m for
English Churches Housing Association and offers a fixed, cash-backed exit
price of 121p. The minimum investment in both Matrix schemes is Pounds
1,000. BESt Investment describes the issue as a 'good-quality product from
Matrix with a high exit price' but believes PAYE investors would do better
to invest in a scheme with earlier tax relief than the timetable of
mid-April 1994.
First Residential Properties, which has issued a number of BES companies,
aims to raise more money to buy properties in London to let on an
assured-tenancy basis. Minimum investment is Pounds 3,000.
Ridings III, sponsored by Capital for Companies with house-builder
Persimmon, aims to buy residential properties for letting on assured
tenancies. Persimmon intends to buy back the properties from investors at a
minimum of 120p after five years (equating to 13.7 per cent for higher rate
taxpayers) and its obligations are backed by an unconditional Bank of
Scotland guarantee.
BESt Investment says that 'given the quality of the initial portfolio, there
must be a chance of some upside potential and this makes the issue
relatively attractive.' Minimum investment is Pounds 2,000.
For further details, call BESt Investment (071-936 2037) and Best BES Advice
(071-409 1111).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in British Steel shares have more than doubled this year, reflecting
relief that the group has been able to make price increases stick in the
slowly recovering UK market.
On Monday analysts expect pre-tax profits of about Pounds 10m in the six
months to October, compared with a loss of Pounds 51m last time, and
resumption of an interim dividend of 0.5p.
Most interest will focus on the progress of restructuring the European steel
industry, with the company anxious to maintain maximum pressure on the UK
government to seek the closure through the European Commission of less
efficient capacity.
The City will be looking for confirmation from British Airways on Tuesday
that the airline is riding out the recession better than its main
competitors. Pre-tax profits for the second quarter should be close to
Pounds 170m, compared with Pounds 136m last year.
Interim results the same day from BAA, which operates the UK's biggest
airports, should see pre-tax profits rise beyond Pounds 240m, compared with
Pounds 220m last time, with the dividend rising to almost 7p from 6.25p.
Analysts will be keen to see how the company's retailing interests are
faring. That part of its business is taking on an increasingly important
role as parking and landing fees aid by airlines are tightly controlled by
regulatory rules.
Commercial Union and General Accident are both expected to report
substantial increases in profits when they post their results for the first
nine months of 1993 next week.
Analysts expect GA to record pre-tax profits on Tuesday of between Pounds
195m and Pounds 230m compared to a loss of Pounds 37m at the same stage last
year.
CU on Wednesday is expected to register an increase to between Pounds 128m
and Pounds 151m, compared to Pounds 6m last year. Increases in premium
rates, especially in the UK and improved claims experience are the main
reasons.
Cable and Wireless interim pre-tax profits forecasts are in the range Pounds
490m to Pounds 520m. At Pounds 500m, C&amp;W would be 32 per cent ahead of last
year (Pounds 378m), with earnings per share up to 10.9p from 9p (adjusted).
However, most of the increased profit is attributable to currency gains on
its business in Hong Kong and the Caribbean. Currency neutral, earnings
growth is projected at slightly under 10 per cent, with UK subsidiary
Mercury performing less well than the overseas businesses.
Land Securities, the UK's biggest property company, is expected to report
flat interim figures on Thursday. Analysts are looking for pre-tax profits
of around Pounds 117m - half the Pounds 234m for the year ended March. A
small increase in the dividend for the full-year is expected, but there
might not be a rise in the interim, which was 6.3p last time.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Talks set over mortgages - Lenders
and advice bureaux to thrash out problem of those who fall behind with
payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Council of Mortgage Lenders is to meet with the National Association of
Citizens' Advice Bureaux within the next month to discuss a NACAB report*
into mortgage arrears and repossessions. The report, published this week,
makes wide-ranging recommendations for changes to legislation, county court
rules, and to the code of practice dealing with the behaviour of lenders
when borrowers fall behind with payments.
The CML, which represents building societies and centralised lenders such as
banks, has said it will look closely at the proposals and consider revising
its guidance to members.
Drawing on evidence produced by almost 250 CAB offices during 1993, the
report highlights examples of individual cases where the existing safety
nets provided by mortgage protection insurance and social security benefits
have not worked properly. CAB offices deal with an estimated minimum of
10,000 mortgage arrears inquiries every month.
The study says mortgage protection policies can often exclude cover for
unemployment and illness - among the most common reasons for people falling
into mortgage arrears. In one example, a CAB client who was a miner warned
his insurance company he was threatened with redundancy. The company then
withdrew the cover and offered an alternative policy which excluded
redundancy.
The report recommends that the Financial Services Act should be extended to
include the sale of mortgage protection policies, and that there should be
regulation of the charges that can be made when a borrower is in arrears. It
also argues that, in some circumstances, such borrowers should be able to
sell their properties on the open market at a shortfall, with an undertaking
to repay the shortfall over the outstanding period of the mortgage at the
lender's normal unsecured rate of interest.
In one of the NACAB case histories, a man who was unable to keep up mortgage
repayments after losing his job found someone who offered Pounds 45,000 for
his house - but the building society refused to let the sale go through for
less than Pounds 50,000. The house was later repossessed and sold for just
Pounds 29,000 leaving the original borrower some Pounds 21,000 in debt.
NACAB also is concerned that people sometimes do not realise that, even
after their home has been repossessed, they may still be liable for other
costs, such as interest charges for the period before the property was
resold.
While the CML is cool about some of the recommendations, it also has
concerns in some areas such as insurance policies. Insurance is seen as
particularly important because of signs that the government is keen to
encourage people to take out private insurance to protect mortgage payments
instead of seeking to rely on social security.
Ann Abraham, NACAB's chief executive, said: 'CAB evidence clearly
demonstrates the failure of voluntary regulation and the urgent need for
statutory controls in this area, particularly if the government plans to
shift the burden of protection from social security to the insurance
industry.'
*Dispossessed: CAB Evidence on Mortgage Arrears and Repossessions is
available at Pounds 6 from NACAB, Myddleton House, 115-123 Pentonville Road,
London N1.
FIXED-rate mortgages continue to be an attractive option, although borrowers
should be wary of compulsory insurance-related products and high arrangement
fees.
Two of the lowest fixed-rate deals on the market come from Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester building society and BNP Mortgages, the UK lending arm of Banque
National de Paris. Both are offering 6.99 per cent fixed for five years,
with an early redemption penalty of six months' interest. Neither offer is
tied to the purchase of insurance-related products and both are portable.
The C&amp;G mortgage (7.3 APR) has an application fee of Pounds 250, but
applicants who are interviewed in a branch will have a Pounds 50 reduction.
Borrowers must have a 10 per cent deposit although existing C&amp;G borrowers
need provide only 5 per cent. The arrangement fee on the BNP offer is Pounds
295, which will be charged only on completion of the mortgage and not on
application. The 6.99 per cent rate (7.8 APR) is for those with a deposit of
15 per cent. A larger loan will attract a higher fixed rate of 7.75 per cent
(8.1 APR).

FT  13 NOV 93 / Pink Snow - FT Guide To The World's Best Ski Resorts (2):
The uphill struggles of an FT reader - Andrew Anderson analyses the Pink
Snow letters for tales of triumph and tribulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ANDERSON

<DATELINE>
   YOU SEEK it here, you seek it there, you seek it almost everywhere
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
when it comes to skiing, FT readers are nothing if not adventurous.
A total of 55 readers responded to Pink Snow's request in early October for
'300 words on what I most like or dislike about skiing'.
Nearly 20,000 words arrived by post, fax and hand delivery, bringing tales
of sunny days on perfect pistes; frozen marathons in total white-outs;
dreamboat ski instructors; chalet girls apparently trained to cook by
medieval court poisoners; grim struggles with snowplough turns on the wrong
side of 40; broken dreams and (a few) smashed bones; near-unprintable tales
of apres ski shenanigans; and above all a sense of indomitable spirit in the
face of adversity.
Lack of space precludes anything more than the edited highlights, but here,
in FT readers' own words, is the very essence of what makes otherwise
apparently sane people strap two planks to their feet and hurtle down a
hillside in the pursuit of . . . le ski]
J Allwright, of Nottingham spoke for us all when he simply listed among his
likes and dislikes: 'Skiing well' and 'Skiing badly,' respectively. Pfyffer
Hughes, of Upminster, Essex, also put it simply: '10 reasons I like skiing:
mountains; snow; altitude; feeling of freedom; beauty; clean air; fondues;
chalets; sliding and (rather more puzzlingly) acrobatics.'
D Bennett, of Wick, Bristol, spoke for many when he wrote: 'Skiing is an
escape from cities, pollution and noise into the thrill of champagne air and
the challenge of downhill runs.' Roger Cohen, of Barnes, London, agreed, and
added a financially-aware rider: 'I enjoy the sense of exclusiveness at
prices that don't exclude me]' Gay Dowson, of Exmouth, Devon, was adamant
that he loves skiing, but again spoke for many when pointing out her biggest
dislike: 'That moment of panic when one looks down the almost sheer drop
that is the only way out. Why was I fool enough to think I could do it one
wonders? Courage, mon brave] Forget the knees of jelly and think of
England]'
That struck a chord with Alan Horgan, of Bishopthorpe, York: ''What am I
doing here?' are the most memorable words I have used while skiing. The
excitement, fear and feeling on top of the world were all present when I
first stood on top of a blue run. But that was why I was there: for the
sense of exhilaration and freedom.'
Susan Paddington, of Blackheath, London, was one of several who pointed out
that: 'The best skiing holidays have been the sunniest. Nothing is worse
than being frozen to death in a blizzard, no matter how good the skiing.'
She also had some good advice on lift queues, which proved a bugbear for
many: 'Don't let it ruin your holiday. Be like the Euros - take an evening
class in French, German or Italian, plenty of fake tan, sunglasses and PUSH
to the front] It's a state of mind - if you keep fault-finding and
criticising the resort you won't enjoy it. You can't change it - and
remember, the UK has few decent mountains to offer.
Anke Hackethal, of Bochum, Germany, loves 'the experience of speed, of the
way the piste consistency constantly changes, of the sound of skis in the
snow.' But she adds a topical environmental warning: 'I cannot ignore the
ecological consequences of mass tourism in Alpine regions. And I am angered
by the people who think that drinking large quantities of alcohol early in
the day is a necessary part of a holiday.'
Michael Grimwood, of Crawley, Sussex, found solace in big groups: 'There are
few holidays that mean, in a short time that you find yourself making
friends who like doing what you do: skiing. This especially applies if you
join a good ski school, such as the ones in Austria.'
Michael Godfrey-Isaacs, of Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire, even seemed to
enjoy falling down: 'The best thing is to ski down a steep slope on real
spring snow. If you have climbed to the top on skins then the descent is
doubly satisfying. I had one memorable descent headfirst and halfway down I
felt I was still accelerating. When I stood up my Thermos flask was still
coming down behind me.
'However, my most memorable skiing moment was effecting the mountain rescue
of a young lady who, as she was only wearing slippers, could not climb back
up the slope to her mountain restaurant after visiting the outside toilet.'
Keith Moss, of Mill Hill Village, London, likes, among other things:
'Releasing my feet from my boots at the end of the day and relaxing with a
whisky in the bath.' His dislike - 'lunatic speeding skiers who cut me up
with total disregard for my safety and their own' - was a recurring theme
with many contributors.
Many of you complained about poor flight arrangements and long resort
transfers. John Auld, of Brookthorpe, Gloucester, spoke from the heart:
'There's nothing like the start of a skiing holiday. Where in the brochure
did it say you had to get up at some ungodly hour in order to arrive at the
airport two hours before take-off? Who worries about early morning flights?
Certainly not the ski companies. Using their 'wealth of experience gleaned
from years in the business' the process of getting there has been carefully
developed to inflict the maximum amount of inconvenience, discomfort and
exhaustion. By the time you get there, after an unremarkable in-flight meal,
a Swiss airport and a tedious coach journey, you really need a holiday.'
Stephen Brookson, of Thames Ditton, Surrey, agreed. While he likes
'thinking, planning, doing and remembering skiing,' and also looks forward
to - a possible tip, here? - 'the next impending French franc devaluation,'
he dislikes, among other things: 'Never learning that the early morning
flight is a waste of time as you wait interminably at Geneva 'for the
Manchester flight'. One other bugbear: 'Silver Ski's brochure with about 40
wrong uses of it's - as in 'it is' - when they really mean 'its'.'
Michael Wilkin, of Henfield, Sussex, whose returned questionnaire was rather
sweetly decorated with doodles of ski helicopters and champagne glasses, was
nothing if not forthright in his dislikes. In his letter - headlined: To
Hell With Snowboarders] - he writes:
'The day of departure: flight delayed one hour, turns out to be two. Actual
flight perfect, but then chaos at Geneva airport. One bus is missing;
another only goes half-way there, then a forced change. Finally, out on the
pistes. Perfect] If Heaven is how you want it to be, it will be like this.
But here comes a snowboarder] Too late] My wife is sent spinning by a
snow-boarder who doesn't stop; luckily she is OK. We both agree that the
first Alpine resort to go snow-board free will be booked solid before the
season opens.'
Frances Clark, of Catford, London, rightly took her fellow skiers to task
about an issue we are all guilty of: 'Why is it that all Good Skiers forget
how difficult skiing can be? Good Skiers develop selective memories - they
cannot allow themselves to acknowledge that a difficult run is exactly that
 -difficult] So come on Good Skiers; when we beginners ask your advice, we
will respect your honesty more than your bravado.'
Andrew Baker, of Hatton, Warwick, touched on another common theme among the
dislikes: 'My worst dislike is falling off a drag lift - or so my wife tells
me; it has of course never happened to me - in the middle of a long run,
having to scramble out of the way of the very big German who flicks
cigarette ash on you as he passes, and then finding that the only way down
the ravine on either side of you is to slide down on your posterior, to the
amusement of all around.'
Patricia Clark, of Newport Pagnell, Bucks, agreed: 'What do I most dislike
about skiing? Easy - drag lifts] And T-bars are the worst of all.'
Things did get better once she finally got to the top: 'What do I like? the
fact that I, an ageing, overweight, life-long intermediate, can still enjoy
finding my way down a (fairly) steep mogul field. We've already booked for
Tignes and Lech this year - and remember that ski passes are cheaper when
you are over 60]'
Kay Beer, of Billingshurst, West Sussex, also found age and physical
attributes no barrier to enjoyment: 'I most like the knowledge that this
overweight frame with no sense of co-ordination can actually ski. When I
started, most of the time I just entertained my group with cries of
'Bugger]' as the required exercise went hopelessly wrong. But after five
days I actually entered and completed the slalom course. It was, and it
still remains, my most unexpected achievement.'
For some, however, the experience was all just too much. Nicholas Coates, of
Wargash, Hampshire, wrote in evident despair: 'I went on a skiing holiday on
the wrong side of 40 and wish I hadn't. It was an expensive and painful
experience, and even when I could ski enough, the few seconds of pleasure I
got did not justify the queueing at lifts, the discomfort of sweaty clothes,
and the noisy, ill-behaved youngsters. I have better things to do and to
spend my money on in what holiday time I have.'
Courage, Mr Coates] If at first you do not succeed, heed the words of Mrs
Pauline Eaton, of West Horsley, Surrey: 'The worst thing about skiing is
that I did not start earlier. Beginning at 40, with no sporting interest, it
took time to master the basics. Now I'm trapped in the intermediate stage -
I will never ski parallel on red runs, or ski couloirs, or jump off cliffs.
But the best thing is that I do it at all] It lets you be a child again - I
enjoy it totally because it is totally absorbing.'
Robert Cherry, of Carnforth, Lancashire, upped the age stakes considerably,
pointing out that his group, aged from middle 40s to 71, skis regularly on
the Continent and in Scotland, and 'skiing is the only exercise we take,
apart from two of us doing a little scrambling in the Lake District.'
David Stuart, of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, actually enjoyed being an Oldie:
'What I most like about skiing is getting old] At last I am free from the
tyranny of trying to be a good skier - they have taught me three different
ways of swinging my hips since 1956 without managing to make my feet go the
same way. Now I only go on the runs I think I am going to enjoy. If a
white-out appears, into the mountain huts we go. Grow old along with me -
the best skiing is yet to be]'
Meanwhile, Clive Cartlidge, of Endon, Stoke-on-Trent, supplied a
heart-warming tale: 'I am 57, the youngest in our group - my brother-in-law
is 65. When we ski together, my role is to act as eyes for him as he is
completely blind in one eye and only partially sighted in the other. I ski
in pole position, shouting instructions as to when to turn, stop etc. Only
one accident so far - my wife cracked her shoulder blade, but still kept on
skiing.'
Tales of injury were mercifully few, but Daphne Scott-Harden, of Richmond,
Yorkshire, had her fair share of drama: 'I started skiing in 1956 in
Switzerland, where I was at school. We had huge wooden skis, lace-up boots
and no bindings. I was a slow starter] Two years later I went to Austria by
mini-bus: it took over 30 hours but the cost for 16 days was Pounds 36] On
the first day I rushed out, fell over and broke my ankle. A doctor lent me a
ski-bob, and I spent the rest of the holiday on that.
'Next year I skied in Scotland. I had bought new skis and on the last run
one ski came off, the other held and I was left screaming with my foot
facing the opposite way to my leg. Luckily another doctor was skiing right
behind and jammed me full of morphine. I spent two weeks in hospital and six
months on crutches, and did not ski for seven years.
'Meanwhile I married and had a family, and for the past three years have
spent Christmas in the Alps. My husband hates Christmas and prefers just to
ski. He even hates Christmas wrapping paper - so he was mortified to find
his ski-boots full of presents on Christmas Day]'
Guy Timewell, of Uffington, Lancashire, thought that the best bit of skiing
is the, er . . . social aspect: 'Skiing is actually better than sex,' he
proclaimed. 'In fact, most times you go skiing you end up having sex.
Conversely, I am unhappy to admit that every time you have sex, skiing does
not necessarily follow.'
Quite so, but Mr Timewell also found time for more cerebral matters:
'Standing at the top of a mountain, confronted by miles of beautiful steep
piste, is a feeling that is almost incomparable. I say almost, because one
would be silly to dismiss the experience of David Platt's 11th-hour goal for
England against Belgium, and the euphoria associated with Linford Christie's
100 metre gold medal.' Thank you, Mr Timewell.
Philip Smith, of Sandy, Bedfordshire, was also a sociable soul who found
true love on the slopes: 'I love chalet parties] For me it's the best way to
ski - you meet people to ski with, people of different standards so you
don't have to ski together all the time.
'I'll admit to being prejudiced as I met my partner on a chalet holiday in
the Dolomites seven years ago. On our next trip we were invited to join a
group filling a chalet, and now we ski regularly with our new-found friends.
One of our best holidays was with the operator who declared that 'Hooray
Henries and Sloanes are recommended to book with another company, where
their unusual sense of humour will be better appreciated.''
Chalet parties and family groups, however, did not find favour with
everyone. Roger Kirk-Bell, of Cuckfield, Sussex, thundered: 'What do I not
like about skiing? The 17-year-old 'gourmet' chalet chef whose entire
experience is six weeks at Eastbourne technical college. The slovenly style
of dress at dinner that is considered acceptable in chalets - for casual,
insert the word 'unsmart'. Parents who take offspring when the 'little
darlings' just cry and moan. Why can't these 'little darlings' start skiing
on their own initiative? And I hate the French architecture that destroys
mountains and puts supermarkets on the slopes. Thanks for letting me get
this off my chest]'
Richard Pollen, of Chiddingfold, Surrey, knows more than most about 'little
darlings' on the slopes: 'As a child I did not ski until I was a young man
working in London. Now, as parents of SEVEN, we ski en famille, and return
to work mentally refreshed and physically exhausted.'
He also made an interesting point: 'I believe that skiing offers more
advantages than most sports in terms of challenge and social behaviour.
However, the decreasing cost of packaged skiing holidays has made skiing
accessible to a much wider cross section of society which, in turn, has led
to problems caused by overcrowding and lack of proper tuition. I wonder if
the 1993/94 season may see a downturn in the trend.'
Another interesting questionnaire - it was entirely devoid of information
about favourite resorts, operators and indeed skiing in general - came from
Sylvia Hays, of Oxford. Her accompanying letter made matters more clear:
'I tried to go skiing once, in New England at Christmas in 1975. But the ski
rental stores were empty and nearly all the stores were closed.' Nothing
daunted, she rented snow shoes, trudged about for a while, and then 'bought
two frozen Christmas dinners from a 24-hour corner shop: turkey, stuffing,
mashed potato, peas and cranberry sauce. Back home, we were hungry tired -
and happy. But I would still like to try skiing sometime . . . '
Lorraine Preston, of Woking, Surrey, went for the slow burn approach: 'What
do I like about skiing? The smell of the new tube of sun oil on Christmas
morning; the first television episode of Ski Sunday; hauling the skis out of
the outhouse; putting one's boots on for the first time; the first run; the
first gluhwein; the second gluhwein . . ]'
Nigel Musson, of Alderley Edge, Cheshire, was the first of many to wax
lyrical about the sport: 'The gondola groans and rumbles into the bright
morning sunlight. The vibration disturbs the fresh snow on the pylons and
the air becomes filled with millions of gleaming diamonds as the sun's rays
pierce them . . . the doors open, a quick rush, a last-minute adjustment to
bindings, and off into the wide, blue, shining day to mile after mile of
glorious piste. Isn't this what life is all about?'
It certainly is, agreed Ricardo Nunes, of Portalegre, Portugal: 'Skiing in
the main is like climbing up and down the walls of a shining, silent
cathedral effortlessly pulled by gravity. Besides, one may also indulge in
the bravado of a fast charge down the slopes, the euphoria of jumping in the
air or the childish joy of tumbling in the fluffy snow.'
None, however, waxed as lyrical as Jonathan King, of BP-Exploration,
Indonesia, who was inspired to leap into poetry:
'A few hundred words can barely suffice
to explain the allure of snow and ice
but if for example you
consider Zermatt
absolutely the best place to look at . . .
He went on in similar vein for quite some time and concluded:
But the glory from which you cannot be torn
is to gaze on the Matterhorn day, night and morn
a staggering peak which dominates the scene
magnificent and moody, stormy, serene.'
It was left to Mark Green, of Wymond Street, London, to have the final,
brief word that best sums it up: 'Will we be back next weekend? Of course]
We're mad] We're skiers]]'

FT  13 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Think second-hand for your policy -
The market in 'used' endownments and where you can get them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUYING an investment 'second-hand' implies something vaguely moth-eaten and
sub-standard. But the growing market in second-hand endowment policies
indicates that investors are not put off by the terminology. Most shares are
bought second-hand, after all.
With-profits endowment policies are the investments most often used to back
a mortgage. The fund invests in a mixture of bonds, equities and property
and pays out the investment return in the form of bonuses. These are added
to a guaranteed sum assured, which is the minimum the policy will pay if it
is held until maturity.
Bonuses generally come in two forms: reversionary, which are paid every year
and, once announced, cannot be withdrawn; and terminal, which are paid at
the end of the policy's life.
The idea is for the policy to produce a smoothed return so that the investor
is not threatened by a sudden dip in the stock markets. But this smoothing
effect has other consequences, which has led to much criticism of the
widespread sale of endowments.
The main problem is that investors who cash in policies early often receive
poor returns. On a 25-year policy - the type used most commonly to repay a
mortgage - it can easily take 10 years for the surrender value of the policy
to equal the premiums paid in.
These low surrender values are caused by a variety of factors. One is that
endowment policies give investors some life cover; that represents a cost to
the insurance company.
The company also has other costs to bear, such as the commission paid to the
salesman or adviser which might total several hundreds of pounds.
Another factor is that the bonus system forces companies to be cautious.
Because reversionary bonuses, once paid, cannot be withdrawn, companies
inevitably do not pay out all the investment return in that form. A fair
chunk is left to be paid as the terminal bonus.
The peculiarities of this system create the opportunity for second-hand
investors. Many investors want to surrender their policies early. If they
surrender after only 10 years of 25, they will normally receive far less
than they would have received as the final payout of a 10-year policy.
According to Kleinwort Benson, research shows that such surrenders average
around 72 per cent of the 'asset share' attributable to the policy. So, an
outside investor could buy a policy at, say, 85 per cent of asset share and
everybody would be happy. The policyholder gets a greater amount than he
would have done had he surrendered; the second-hand investor will have
bought assets at a discount.
Obviously, a lot of legal paperwork is needed before an insurance policy can
be transferred (assigned in the jargon) from one person to another. The
Bath-based Policy Plus arranges for an independent solicitor to handle the
transaction and to check, for example, that the policy has not been assigned
to someone else. After a few months, the investor should receive an
acknowledgement from the insurance company that the policy has been
re-assigned.
What happens then? The second-hand buyer must keep up the payments on the
policy until it matures. On maturity, he will get its full value. Providing
it is a qualifying policy (essentially, that it has a term of more than 10
years), the proceeds will be free of income tax but subject to capital gains
tax.
If the investor alters the maturity of the policy, it might become
non-qualifying and there could be a higher-rate income tax charge on the
maturity proceeds.
If the original policyholder dies before the policy matures, then the
second-hand investor will receive either the death benefit or the guaranteed
sum plus accrued bonuses, whichever is the higher. The second-hand investor
does not himself receive any life cover.
Where do you buy a second-hand policy? There are a number of routes. Foster
&amp; Cranfield (071-608 1941) holds a regular auction at which investors can
bid for individual policies. Other companies such as Beale Dobie (0621-851
133), Policy Plus (0225-466 466), Policy Portfolio (081-343 4567) and
Securitised Endowment Contracts (081-207 1666) are market-makers. They act
as middle men between buyers and sellers, making a profit from the spread
between their buying and selling prices.
A different approach is to buy shares in one of the growing number of funds
which invest in second-hand endowment policies. Kleinwort Benson is
launching its second investment trust in the field.
According to Kleinwort's Simon White, buying through a fund means investors
do not have to worry about paying future premiums. They also get the benefit
of a spread of policies managed by investment professionals. 'Few investors
would feel confident enough to know the right price to pay for a policy at
auction,' White adds.
The trust will have a 12.5-year life and, mainly, will buy policies maturing
in 2005-2006. Shares are on offer at 100p, with 50p payable on application
and a further 50p six months later.
Minimum investment is 1,000 shares. The trust will pay no dividends and all
the return will come in the form of capital gain.
Kleinwort estimates that the investor will receive a compound return of 11.5
per cent a year, assuming existing reversionary and terminal bonus rates are
maintained. On more conservative assumptions that bonus rates are paid at
90, or 80, per cent of present levels, the return falls to 10.3 and 9 per
cent respectively. That is still significantly ahead of the returns on offer
from building societies - and, since it comes in the form of capital gain,
it has the chance of being tax-free.
Shares in the first Kleinwort Endowment Policy trust were trading yesterday
at 114.5p, compared with an issue price of 100p.
Another option for investors is BZW's endowment fund, based offshore, which
will distribute its assets over the last five years of its life (from 2001
to 2005) and is designed to help investors with planning for items such as
school fees.
What returns should investors expect from second-hand policies? Over the
past few years, 25-year policies have tended to pay out the equivalent of
11-13 per cent a year over their life. Buying second-hand ought to enhance
those returns. On the other hand, bonuses are on the way down as companies
'smooth out' the effects of 1990 when they set bonuses too high.
While those returns are respectable, a good unit or investment trust ought
to earn more. M&amp;G Recovery, for one, has returned 20.8 per cent a year since
launch in 1969.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Yield attractions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW INVESTORS would be excited when offered a real yield of 3.09 per cent,
writes Michael Dyson.
But what if they were told they could buy Treasury Index-Linked 4.375 per
cent 2004 at Pounds 114.625 and, in addition to an index-linked income which
started at around 4 per cent, could expect to be repaid in 2004 at a price
of Pounds 114.625, or Pounds 157.45, or Pounds 233.285? Those are the
tax-free repayment prices, assuming inflation of 0.88 per cent, 4 per cent
and 8 per cent respectively. While the repayment of Pounds 233.285 may sound
the most attractive, inflation would mean that in real terms the return is
slightly worse.
Another approach for investors is to consider what inflation rate will be
needed to make an index-linked investment better than, say, a building
society account. This is known as the break even inflation rate. For
example, looking at the 2 per cent Index Linked 1996; to the 40 per cent
taxpayer, if inflation averages 2 per cent over the next two years, the
total net return of 4 per cent would match the best net building society
returns.
In practice, most accounts pay lower rates and even a low inflation rate,
probably below 1 per cent, would be better than deposit rates. Any 'extra'
inflation will be a bonus and, as inflation is likely to be at least 3.5 per
cent over the next two years, the Treasury 2 per cent index-linked 1996 is
significantly more attractive than a savings account.
Reports suggest the corporate index-linked market may be set for further
expansion. Of the few existing issues, Severn River Crossing 6 per cent IL
2012 continues to offer a superior inflation-proof return.
Zero dividend preference shares are as far removed as you can get from
index-linked bonds. They are investment trust shares that pay no dividend
but instead promise to repay the holders of the shares at a higher price.
For instance, Sphere IT zeros could be bought on November 11 for 91.75p for
repayment at 107.5p on October 31, 1995. The capital gain of 17.2 per cent
equates to a semi-annual gross redemption yield of 8.35 per cent.
While we would not suggest that the repayment of zeros is totally without
risk, Sphere's assets are currently 30 per cent more than is required to
repay the zeros in full and we do believe that the surplus assets provide an
effective cushion against falling markets.

LLOYDS BANK has changed the charging structure for customers who become
overdrawn. Those who go into unauthorised overdraft, or exceed their
overdraft limit, by more than Pounds 10 on any one day will be charged
Pounds 7. If the unauthorised overdraft increases by more then Pounds 10 the
next day, there will be another Pounds 7 charge. The bank is abolishing
existing charges of Pounds 10 for informing customers of their overdraft by
phone or letter or Pounds 3 for advising them by statement. The Pounds 4
charge for a cheque paid into an account and then returned is also being
dropped, as is the existing Pounds 5 fee for going into an unauthorised or
increased overdraft.
The penalty free overdraft of Pounds 100 on Classic and Current accounts
will be reduced to Pounds 50 from January.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Markets: Gold holds its gains - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD prices held this week after a strong rally towards the end of last week
had pushed prices in London up by more than Dollars 8 to over Dollars 370 a
troy ounce. The move appeared to have been started by investment funds
buying on the New York Commodity Exchange. Prices this week in London
hovered around Dollars 376.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Markets: Hong Kong shares keep on climbing - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG had another good week with the Hang Seng index pushing upwards to
close last night at 9,701.25, a rise of nearly 8 per cent over the week. The
increase can be traced back to bullish comments about China by Morgan
Stanley, the US securities firm, after a visit to China by a group of US
fund managers in September. Hong Kong is seen as the investment gateway to
China and US fund managers have been switching money away from unexciting US
and European markets to Asia.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Markets: C shares: a simple A to B - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THESE ARE heady days for the investment trust sector. Stock markets are
riding high, discounts are narrow, investors are queueing to put more money
into the industry.
Apart from the various new issues (see pages VII and VIII), existing trusts
are taking advantage of the buoyant conditions to raise new funds. Govett
Emerging Markets is looking for Pounds 30m, Foreign &amp; Colonial Smaller
Companies Pounds 40m, Amicable Smaller Enterprises Pounds 30m and Morgan
Grenfell Equity Income Trust Pounds 25m; all in the form of C shares.
The documentation for a C share issue may be complicated but the idea is
clever. When an investment trust raises new money, there will inevitably be
a phase in which the bulk of the new money is in cash. If all the shares
were lumped together in one pool, the effect for existing shareholders is
that their money would cease to be fully invested in equities. Should the
market rise suddenly, their shares would underperform.
Keeping the new money separate, in the form of C shares, avoids this
problem. The C shares are only converted into ordinary shares once the bulk
of the money is invested. As Hamish Buchan, analyst at NatWest Markets,
describes the process: 'It's as if a sister trust were being formed and they
were then merged later on an agreed basis.'
The C share structure also avoids the problem of market risk during the time
the offer is open. Under a conventional rights issue, the rights price is
set at a discount to the share price at the time of the announcement. Should
the stock market fall sufficiently for the shares to drop below the rights
price, no one would want to take up their rights and the issue would fail.
For a C share issue, the trust simply sets the price of the C shares at a
nice round number (often 100p). When the time comes for conversion, the
trust managers simply arrange the switch on an asset basis. If the C shares
have an asset value of 100p, and the ordinary shares have an asset value of
200p, then two C shares will convert into one ordinary share.
Another advantage for existing shareholders is that the C shares bear all
the costs of the issue. 'It's a very clean, neat and fair system,' says
Buchan.
But should existing shareholders take up the C shares they are offered?
There are some attractions. A C share issue usually occurs when the existing
shares are trading at a premium to asset value. (If the existing shares were
trading at a wide discount, there would be no incentive for investors to buy
C shares and thus no chance of a successful issue.)
Since a premium is evidence of demand for shares exceeding supply, the issue
of new shares is a sensible way of soaking up demand. If the premium is wide
enough, the C shares could be more attractive than buying more ordinaries.
Apart from such technical factors, the most important decision to make is:
do you want to commit more money to this investment area? If you already
have 20 per cent of your portfolio in emerging markets, then subscribing to
a C share issue might make you over-committed to a volatile sector.
If you had not even thought about buying more shares in the trust before you
saw details of the C share issue, then perhaps the issue is not for you. You
will be no worse off if you ignore it.
There is a more general point. History has tended to show that the times
when investment trusts enjoy helter-skelter expansion are often the most
dangerous times to buy their shares. The motto is invest in haste, repent at
leisure.
A danger signal can be seen in the price of investment trust warrants, which
have tended to rise sharply in price shortly after issue. Some investors are
apparently stagging such issues; selling the shares in early trading but
hanging on to the warrants.
What can easily happen is that the shares fall to say 95p (compared with an
issue price of 100p) but the warrants (often issued on a one-for-five basis)
shoot to 60p. The investor has effectively made a profit of 7p. 'Value' has
been created, apparently out of nothing.
But such alchemy cannot succeed for ever. A warrant issue is merely a
deferred rights issue, after all. At some point, new shares will be issued
and the existing shareholder's stakes will be diluted.
Warrant prices are a factor of the volatility of the assets within the trust
and the time left for exercise. (The greater the volatility and the longer
the time period, the more chance there is for profitable exercise and the
higher the price investors are prepared to pay.)
But according to Colin McLean of Scottish Value Management, who runs the
Warrants and Value Trust, some of the very long dated warrants seem
currently to be overpriced and his trust is looking for value in the
shorter-dated area.
Investors should remember that warrants are highly-geared and speculative
securities and are likely to be at their most speculative when stock markets
are trading at all-time highs.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Markets: Traders nonplussed by trade vote - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE POLITICS of international trade can be devilishly complicated
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
just try explaining what GATT, the Uruguay Round or Blair House are all
about - but US investors have adopted a sensibly direct approach to the
North American Free Trade Agreement: if Congress passes the treaty next
week, it will be good for the economy, good for US companies, good for the
stock markets, and good for President Clinton.
Their reasoning is quite simple. Investors believe that Nafta will lift
corporate profits because in a more open trading environment between the
three signatory countries the US, with its superior industrial productivity
rates and better-quality products, will enjoy the greatest economic
benefits. The expectation is that growth in US exports to Mexico and Canada
will outpace growth in imports from its neighbours to the north and south.
Investors are not alone in their optimistic view of Nafta. Most Wall Street
economists are pro-Nafta, as are the majority of business leaders, if recent
polls are to be believed.
There is, however, the dark side of Nafta to consider. What if Congress
votes no? Investors fear that a rejection of Nafta would have dangerous
knock- on effects around the world, depressing share prices in the US, Latin
America and eventually Europe, and endangering vital trade negotiations over
the Uruguay Round. By coincidence, the day after next week's Nafta vote,
Clinton will be in Seattle for a trade conference with leaders of Asian
Pacific Nations. If he arrives there fresh from defeat on Nafta, the
President's authority on trade issues will be compromised.
Investors' darkest fear is that a no vote on Nafta would throw such a
spanner in the works of world trade that it would lead to a new era of
international protectionism, higher inflation and slower world economic
growth.
In this scenario, inflation would be the biggest concern of markets. Many
economists argue that the competitive forces unleashed by the accelerating
collapse of international trade barriers have helped restrain global
inflation. Low worldwide inflation has kept bond yields at historic lows,
which in turn have boosted share prices to record highs in many markets.
Thus, any reversal in that trend - a return of trade barriers, higher
inflation, higher bond yields, - could undermine equity markets that are
already vulnerable to a sharp downward correction because of expensive stock
valuations.
Then there is the political cost of Nafta's failure to consider. Although
the President inherited the trade pact from his Republican predecessor, he
has invested a lot of his own political capital in getting Nafta through
Congress. On paper, this should not be a particularly difficult task,
because Congress is controlled by Democrats.
Yet, opposition to Nafta among Democratic legislators beholden to labour
interests is considerable. Anti-Nafta forces have warned that opening up
trade with Mexico will lead to a migration of American jobs south of the
border, where wages are much lower. Because the domestic labour market
remains weak, this line has struck a strong chord with ordinary Americans.
The result is that the President faces a tough fight ensuring that the House
of Representatives votes to approve the treaty on Wednesday.
As of yesterday, the outcome of the vote was deemed too close to call. Stock
markets in Mexico and the US, however, believe the chances of success for
Nafta improved this week. Share prices in Mexico rose on Wednesday and
Thursday, and US stocks made solid gains, following the televised debate on
Tuesday between Vice-President Al Gore and Ross Perot, who is Nafta's most
celebrated opponent.
Gore clearly bested Perot in a heated war of words, and polls taken over the
next few days revealed that more Americans had been won over to Nafta.
Whether this helped swing the votes of some anti-Nafta legislators the
Clinton administration's way remains to be seem.
Nafta is playing on investors' minds because doubts over its passage through
Congress have arisen at a vulnerable time for stock and bond prices. A week
ago bond yields jumped amid worries that resurgent economic growth might
rekindle inflation. Although data released this week on producer and
consumer prices showed that fears of rising inflation are, at least for now,
unjustified, equity investors remain nervous about rising bond yields.
Amid all the doubts over the Nafta, one thing is certain, trading on markets
next week is likely to be hamstrung by uncertainty over Wednesday night's
vote, which, like the battle over President Clinton's first budget, will be
extremely close.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Markets: Oil profits continue to flow - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS in the big integrated oil companies have cheered in recent weeks
as a steady stream of third quarter results showing strong profits growth
pushed share prices upwards. 'Higher downstream margins and successful
cost-cutting' have been the recurrent and common theme from the companies.
But a curious investor only has to visit the forecourt of their local petrol
station to see the main reason why share prices of companies such as British
Petroleum and Shell Transport and Trading have been surging.
Falling crude oil prices may have transfixed the worldwide oil industry, but
motorists searching for a sign of their effect at the pump have found little
solace.
In earlier periods of falling oil prices, vocal consumer complaints
considerably shortened the time in which oil companies were able to enjoy
widening marketing margins.
But there has been a curious absence of such clamour in recent months as
crude oil prices, as measured by the benchmark Brent Blend, declined sharply
from an average of Dollars 20 a barrel in the third quarter of 1992 to
Dollars 16.50 a barrel in the same period this year.
Shell Transport and Trading, the main Shell investment vehicle for UK
investors, and BP have both benefited from the boost in retail trading.
On Thursday Shell reported oil product sales up five per cent, helping it to
an 8 per cent rise in profits to Pounds 861m. A week earlier BP nearly
doubled replacement cost profits - which leaves out swings in inventory
values - to Pounds 332m, with refining and marketing accounting for Pounds
269, a rise of Pounds 177 against the third quarter of 1992.
The shares of both companies have performed strongly this year. BP
outperformed the FT All-Share Index by 21 per cent in the year to early
November, while Shell was up 7 per cent in relative terms during the same
period. But the figures do not tell the full story.
The markets greeted BP's results as confirmation that the company had
finally turned the corner after a rocky 18 months. During that period many
UK institutions have been decidedly stand-offish toward the company,
although their US cousins were less reticent, snapping up about 27 per cent
of BP shares.
For the first time since 1991 the company saw a cash inflow from operations
excluding disposals. The sale of non-core assets was ahead of schedule, and
debt was down by Dollars 1bn to Dollars 13.1bn. Successful cost cutting, the
current buzzword in the industry and one of the criteria investors should
look at when assessing oil shares, was writ large throughout the results.
Shell, on the other hand, displayed little impact of cost cutting, although
analysts were divided as to the reasons. Some noted that a well-run company
simply has less scope for savings. Other, such as Fergus MacLeod at Natwest
Securities in Edinburgh, says another Shell virtue - gearing of just over 10
per cent - make it harder for efficiency gains to show up in profit
improvements.
Yet another Shell virtue, according to Jeremy Hudson of Lehman Brothers
Securities in London, lies in its higher yield, more than 1 per cent above
BP. BP, however, is reluctant to increase dividends until debt is down to
the desired level and the full effects of its restructuring programme show
can be felt.
As for the future, almost all analysts suggest that investors keep a careful
eye on the oil price. BP looks set to squeeze more value out of its
businesses through cost cutting. And it will also continue to chip away at
its debt with asset sales.
But persistently low oil prices over the next few quarters combined with
sluggish economic conditions in Europe could take its toll, whereas Shell's
bigger size and greater exposure to the faster growing economies in Asia
could enable it to weather such a storm.
But if crude oil prices do fall further investors' should perhaps also keep
an eye on their fellow motorists. Shell and BP will surely be doing so, as
well as hoping that they stay sleepy and not notice if prices take a tumble.

Walt Disney Presents THE LITTLE SHAREHOLDER or The Prince and the Paupers
The film opens in a bustling 18th century marketplace in the little French
town of Marne-La-Vallee. In the background, maids are hanging bedclothes out
of windows, housewives brushing doorsteps, bakers carrying trays of freshly
baked loaves. Chickens peck around the edges, dogs chase one another
underfoot.
Enter Prince Michael of Hollywood.
Sings:
'Far, far away in the USA
We built a World, a giant fun-house
Where millions come to play and pay
Now's Europe's chance to love the Mouse.'
Chorus:
'You get rich, we get rich
We all get rich together.'
Michael (murmurs):
'As long as it doesn't rain.'
(aloud):
'Come, my friends, stump up your cash. We'll build a brave new fun-palace
right here in Europe. In fact, we'll call it Euro Disney - and you'll own 51
per cent]'
Excited villagers crowd around him, showering him with gold coins. Suddenly,
the cheerful hubbub is interrupted by a jarring crash, a puff of smoke, and
the entry of the Wicked Fairy.
Fairy: 'I am ze spirit of European culture] 'Ow dare you insult me wiz your
'orrible Mouses] I lay a triple curse upon you: ze scorn of French
intellectuals, ze protests of revolting French farmers, and ze rain of
summer 1993.'
She disappears in a fresh puff of smoke and a crash of cymbals. The screen
dissolves, and we move forward through time - to this week.
We are still in Marne-La-Vallee, but it now looks quite different. Glossy
new hostels surround the marketplace. The ramparts of a Magic Castle tower
over the square, decorated with battered inflatable Mickey Mouse figures.
Chambermaids, housewives, butchers and bakers sit on their doorsteps,
looking glum. A humble serving girl comes to the front of the crowd, dressed
in rags. She is clutching a crumpled share certificate.
Little Shareholder (sadly):
'Long years ago we put our money where our Mouse was.
We paid eight quid a share for Mickey's home.
Now Euro Disney's talking to its bankers
They wonder if they'll ever see their loan.'
Chorus:
'Prince Michael, we feel lost, abandoned, sore]
Have we been told the worst or is there more?'
Prince Michael appears talking into the telephone on a giant video screen in
the corner of the square.
Michael:
'Can't you see I'm busy building a new theme park in the US? It's bad enough
I'm having to make provisions against the debt your company owes me. I'm
certainly not in the mood to listen to any whingeing Europeans. Don't call
me - I'll call you.' (Hangs up abruptly.)
Chorus:
'Euro Disney, Eurotunnel:
Euro frenzy's had its day.
Here's a rule for our investment:
Sadly, grand dreams do not pay]'
There were other unhappy fairy-tales this week. Take the story of The
Disappointed Merchant Bankers, or Virtue Unrewarded. In any well-regulated
fairyland, the higher-than-expected profits that both Warburg and Hambro
reported would have been enough to push their shares to new heights.
Instead, both shares fell. Warburgs saw its interim profits treble and
raised its dividend from 5.25p to 6p, but its shares fell 20p on the day, to
857p.
It has a double reason to feel aggrieved: the adverse stock market reaction
was partly a response to an act of virtue, a proper breakdown of the sources
of its revenues. Brokers' analysts decided that this showed all too clearly
that a high proportion of the bank's business came from profits from its
trading desks, a potentially unstable source of earnings. The shares closed
the week at 833p, down 57p.
The Unhappy Little Builder was another of the week's dismal tales, in the
form of Costain's rights issue. It was taken up by only 28 per cent of its
shareholders, leaving much of the stock in the hands of the underwriters,
where it will hang over the shares for months. They closed the week at 26
3/4 , down 2p.
There were some cheerful fables also: Lloyd's and the Fairy Godmothers, for
example. A clutch of investment trusts have been launched to provide
limited-liability for the insurance market, and though some of the wilder
estimates of how much they might raise have been disappointed, it looks as
though investors will find at least Pounds 750m of capital for Lloyd's in
this way.
That's a sum that would have been regarded as the merest fantasy a few
months ago, and it creates a small new quoted sector for investors to
consider. So far, there has been little secondary-market interest: those
trusts floated so far, such as HCG and Delian, have seen very thin trading.
Hiscox Insurance Select, which plans to be a specialist insurer, focusing on
such areas as insuring houses and pictures for the 'carriage trade', has
seen a bit more interest.
For the market as a whole, the fairy-tale continues. Even lacklustre results
or gloomy trading statements from blue-chips such as Unilever, Shell and
National Power, failed to dismay it this week. The FT-SE 100 index stayed
safely around the 3,100 mark, closing at 3,099.1, up 13.5 on the week.
The sleeping giant - the US bond market - continued to stir in its sleep,
however. There was a particularly loud snore from the US on Wednesday,
caused by fresh inflationary fears and a disappointing Treasury auction.
Though the fairy-tale continues to promise a happy ending, it has carried
darker, Brothers Grimm overtones since last week's fall.

FT  13 NOV 93 / The Long View: Juggling the books
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOULD you buy Colombian 6 per cent loan certificates at Pounds 84? How about
Chilean 6 per cent stock at Pounds 89, to yield an attractive 7 per cent or
so? Alternatively, what about Mexico 7 1/4 per cent?
You have to be an incorrigible optimist to think so, but perhaps this is
Latin America's moment of financial maturity at last. Next Wednesday, the US
House of Representatives is due to approve the North American Free Trade
Agreement, after which Mexico at least will attain a new credit status. Its
paper could reach true investment grade. Many other Latin American countries
are also now enjoying a degree of financial standing which, historically, is
unusually respectable.
I should explain that the three bonds mentioned date from very different
periods. The Colombian loan was issued in 1822 to British investors, and it
marked the start of an amazing wave of speculation in Latin American
investments. London investors gambled more than Pounds 20m on the shaky
credit-worthiness of newly-independent nations emerging from the domination
of the Spanish and Portuguese monarchies. Within a few years the Colombian
loan, along with all the others, was more or less worthless as Colombia
itself splintered into three parts.
Chilean 6 per cents were part of the initial portfolio of the Foreign &amp;
Colonial Government Trust, which was launched in 1868 with a Pounds 1m
portfolio of what was basically sovereign junk debt. By this time, a more
sophisticated theory of geographical diversification had been developed. The
investments ranged across five continents. The yield on the portfolio was 8
per cent, beating Consols out of sight.
Although F&amp;C suffered its setbacks - as when the Spanish 3 per cent
government stock defaulted in 1875 - the trust survived and prospered for
125 years to the present day to become the UK's biggest investment trust,
with assets of more than Pounds 1.5bn.
As the fashion for so-called emerging market funds grows today, however, it
is important to look back at the portfolios of the 19th century investment
trusts. F&amp;C's investments included Brazil, Egypt, Peru, Turkey and the
United States. All of these, bar one, would today be described trendily as
emerging markets, a term apparently intended to impart an image of progress
and development in order to attract investors.
In fact, a better distinction would be between high grade and low grade
markets. Movement from second category to the first is, in fact,
comparatively rare. Many countries never emerge from the poor quality, high
risk category and this has certainly applied to Latin America.
The Mexican bond, incidentally, brings us right up to date, being an issue
originated earlier this year. So far in 1993, Mexican borrowers have raised
some Dollars 6bn in the Eurobond market, and Mexican international equity
issues in 1992 totalled more than Dollars 3bn (although the pace has slowed
this year). American investment institutions, in particular, have become
more ready to seek high returns on exotic bonds, largely because of the
sharp drop in yields on domestic investments.
The 1822-25 bubble was generated by rather less sophisticated private
investors. The first Latin American debt crisis was well chronicled in a
1990 book of that title by Frank Griffith Dawson (Yale University Press).
There were, for instance, angry scenes in 1824 when it was discovered that
Colombia was proposing to pay dividends with money owed to it by Peru, which
in turn was planning to raise the cash by floating another loan in London.
Not much has really changed: there is now a long tradition of this kind of
financial juggling by South American debtors.
Later in the century, sentiment revived; but, by 1881, only Argentina,
Brazil and Venezuela out of 13 Latin American sovereign borrowers were
servicing their debts. More money went in periodically as the defaults were
patched up, and New York replaced London as a source of international
capital in the 1920s. This culminated in yet another wave of defaults in the
1930s.
Foreign investors had done rather better, however, when they invested
directly in Latin American enterprises. After 1850, there was a big outflow
of funds from the UK and elsewhere into developing countries on the basis of
the same sort of arguments you hear now - Europe was mature and
slow-growing, and surplus capital would earn a better return in high-growth
regions. Instead of last century's railroads, tramways and water companies,
today we have toll highways and telephone monopolies.
Any paper with a sovereign guarantee on it was untrustworthy, however. In
the depression of the 1930s, bond investors retired to lick their wounds and
re-decorate their lamp shades. By the late 1960s, though, the commercial
banks arrived on the scene. Naive loan officers, bolstered by the notion
that sovereign debt could never go bad (history was definitely not their
strong subject) proceeded to recycle billions in petro-dollars to Latin
American borrowers in the 1970s.
And so to the present day. Since the late 1980s, the overhang of unrepayable
debt has gradually been cut away, mainly through the Brady-type
restructuring formula which has involved large-scale write-offs and the
securitisation of the remaining bank debts in various forms (including such
exotica as temporary interest reduction bonds). Suddenly, Latin America has
become solvent yet again - although, as usual, not by repaying its debts.
The key to ultimate respectability probably lies in developing adequate
domestic long-term capital markets: foreign providers of capital will always
be highly vulnerable unless they share a common interest with domestic
investors. In this sense, the development of pension funds in countries like
Chile and Argentina is encouraging. But history tells us that, in Latin
America, manana never comes - or, at any rate, it can be rescheduled
repeatedly.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Why the BBC should be privatised: Ian Hargreaves argues that
the corporation needs radical change to prepare for the harsher environment
it will face in the next millennium

'Broadcasting was one of a number of areas in which special pleading by
powerful interest groups was disguised as high-minded commitment to some
greater good. So, anyone who queried, as I did, whether a licence fee was
the best way to pay for the BBC, was likely to be pilloried as at best
philistine and at worse undermining its 'constitutional independence'.'
 -Former prime minister Margaret Thatcher in her recently published memoirs,
explaining how she failed to persuade Whitehall and fellow ministers of the
case for radical change at the BBC.
'Much of what passes for quality on British television really is no more
than a reflection of the values of the narrow elite which controls it and
which has always thought that its tastes are synonymous with quality . . .
My own view is that anybody who, within the law of the land, provides a
service which the public wants at a price it can afford is providing a
public service.'
 -Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch at the Edinburgh television festival in 1989.
AS THE government puts the finishing touches to a white paper on the BBC, as
good as certain to propose an unchanged funding regime for the corporation,
it is striking to recall the ferocity of the attack on public service
broadcasting which was sustained throughout the 1980s by the combined
engines of Thatcherism and Murdoch.
Two questions are prompted: just why has controversy given way to consensus?
And, is it a good thing that it has? Is it possible that Thatcher, in her
instinctive, unstrategic way, perceived a truth about British broadcasting
that her opponents are foolish to ignore?
The re-making of consensus about the BBC plainly has its roots in the
replacement of Thatcher by a more conservative successor and in the fact
that the BBC has, in response to the pressures of the Thatcher years, made
sweeping changes, designed to make itself both more efficient and more
acceptable to a Conservative government.
There is, however, a third, less obvious cause of the new consensus, namely
a shift in the politics of the broadcasting industry itself. This has had
the effect of uniting the satellite broadcasters and their terrestrial
brethren in ITV behind the BBC status quo. It is the most interesting aspect
of the consensus, because it points to the flaw which runs through the heart
of UK broadcasting policy.
With hindsight, it can be seen that Murdoch's Edinburgh lecture was the
high-water mark of the new broadcasters' attacks on the BBC. A year later,
financial pressures forced Murdoch's Sky to merge with British Satellite
Broadcasting to form BSkyB, and led him into a search for the sort of
business alliances which would help him sell satellite dishes and
subscriptions for the re-launched Sky TV.
Prime among these was a joint deal between Sky and the BBC to televise
league soccer, something which would, at that stage, have been impossible
for Sky to achieve unaided. In other words, as Murdoch became a broadcasting
industry insider, he stopped rocking the BBC's boat. No wonder the Murdoch
press duly turned friendly. Last November's green paper would, said The
Times, secure the future of 'the best all-round broadcasting organisation in
the world.'
It is less surprising that the terrestrial broadcasters should have also
swung behind the BBC - after all, the traditional ITV position is that its
own advertising monopoly is a quid pro quo for the BBC's monopoly on public
funding. But ITV is also painfully aware that the BBC is making common cause
with commercial rivals outside the ITV system, including not only BSkyB, but
also the disenfranchised Thames Television (in UK Gold, a repeats channel
broadcast on Sky); and, through BBC World Service Television, with Reuters
and Star Television of Hong Kong, which since July has also been controlled
by Murdoch.
As part of its own response to the BBC green paper, ITV commissioned a
report from consultant Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton; this set out for its client a
blood-chilling - and by no means implausible - scenario for the 1990s in
which BSkyB's revenues surpass those of the 14 ITV companies combined. If
this were to happen, by the year 2000 Britain would have three broadcasting
segments of roughly equal size: the BBC, BSkyB and ITV.
The larger, more ambitious ITV companies are thus starting to see themselves
as minnows in an ocean of killer sharks, confined by the comforts of their
regional advertising monopolies. This explains the urgency of their pleas to
government to be allowed to merge with each other.
The ITV companies, however, also believe that their own prosperity requires
a quiescent BBC, one confined safely to making high quality domestic
programmes; competing as little as possible for bought-in American material;
restricted from forming new commercial alliances; and, above all, excluded
from the market for sponsorship, advertising or pay-television. Viewed from
this angle, the new consensus on the BBC rests not upon high principle, but
on the short-term commercial convenience of rival broadcasters, buttressed
by the inability of a weak government to take a longer view.
All this is happening at a time when technology is turning the international
broadcasting industry inside out. Digital broadcast signals, along with the
spread of both satellite and cable, is dissolving technological entry
barriers to broadcasting and powering a fusion of the broadcasting,
telecommunications, entertainment and information industries. This
multi-media revolution lies behind the remarkable wave of takeover struggles
on Wall Street in recent weeks involving companies like Bell Atlantic
(telecommunications), TCI (cable), QVC (television shopping), Viacom (its
interests include the MTV global rock music channel) and Paramount, the
Hollywood studio. It also explains Murdoch's strategy to establish global
satellite distribution for his own and other companies' news and
entertainment services.
It is, perhaps, not surprising that UK broadcasting policy has simply failed
to keep up, marked as it was with the self-contradictions of the Thatcher
era: her desire to de-regulate on the one hand, but her taste for an ever
sterner moral and political oversight on the other. The result was muddle
and U-turn.
In satellite television, the government at first favoured a BBC role, then a
private sector monopoly, then did not resist Sky's entry, then sanctioned
the BSB-Sky merger without so much as a reference to the broadcasting
regulator.
In terrestrial television, policy in practice was directed mainly at
squeezing more Treasury revenue out of the ITV monopolies while requiring
the duopolists of BBC and ITV to take a quota of programmes from a highly
fragmented independent production sector.
In cable, there was a fitful policy of encouraging capital to enter the
sector while excluding British Telecom from transmitting entertainment
services on the grounds that it would be able to squash new competitors in
cable telephony.
The regulatory regime which sits atop this dizzying structure has only added
to the confusion. In essence, the BBC is regulated heavily, the ITV
companies moderately and the satellite broadcasters not at all. Ownership
rules are even more bizarre. It is possible for Murdoch to own half of
BSkyB, along with 35 per cent of Britain's national press, but impossible
for any national newspaper owner to possess more than a 20 per cent stake in
an ITV company.
The result is that, in terms of its international competiveness, the UK
faces the multi-media revolution in a parlous state. It has an inefficient,
monopolistic but fragmented terrestrial broadcasting system, and a satellite
and cable sector dominated by non-UK interests. Of only two potential world
class UK organisations on the scene, one, British Telecom, is excluded for
regulatory reasons and the other, the BBC, is stuck in the public sector
where it is condemned to behave like a public sector utility.
Does a Conservative government really think that Britain's charge in the
global electronic media battle can be led by a nationalised company? Small
wonder that Michael Heseltine, the Trade Secretary, has started recently to
harumph from his department about broadcasting matters. He will have noted
the Booz Allen study for ITV, which forecast that Britain's broadcasting
trade account will move from a surplus of Pounds 24m in 1985 and a deficit
of Pounds 100m in 1991 to a Pounds 600m deficit in 2000.
From a traditional BBC perspective, this is a more or less ideal background
for a licence fee review; the government is muddled, the competition on
side; indeed, only last week, the government conceded an index-linked fee
for the 1994-96 period.
As John Birt, the corporation's director-general, puts it in the latest
annual report: 'The case is a simple one. In the face of increasing
competition from commercial broadcasters, the BBC should use its public
funding to provide programmes that would be at risk in a purely commercial
market: authoritative news and information; ambitious and original
entertainment; and programmes to meet the complex learning needs of a modern
society.' The price demanded is, in effect, indefinite indexation of the
licence fee.
What has confused most people is that almost all public debate about the BBC
in recent months has painted Birt as a dangerous radical, bent upon
threatening all that is best in its traditions. Playwright Dennis Potter
called him a 'croak-voiced Dalek,' Michael Grade, the boss of Channel 4, a
'pseudo-Leninist.'
Such comments, along with many more ferocious, have obscured the reality.
Birt has changed the BBC's managerial style and its internal structures, but
the ethos is unchanged: to defend the existing, publicly-funded broadcasting
base and extend it judiciously when opportunity arises - for example, in the
proposed Radio 5 news and sports channel, World Service Television and UK
Gold. John Reith's body lies a'mouldering in the grave but his soul goes
marching on. Reith, remember, opposed the creation of commercial television.
In terms of the present rules of the game, Birt's strategy cannot be
faulted. But it fails to address a number of long-standing problems, from
the BBC's excessive reliance upon the goodwill of the government of the day
to the enormously difficult problems which arise in running a nationalised
company of 20,000 people which requires, for creative reasons, a honeycomb
structure but, for reasons of financial and political accountability, strong
lines of central control.
The biggest blind spot in the Birt plan, however, is that it proposes a
renewed royal charter (to run from 1996 until at least 2006) during a time
when the broadcasting landscape will be subject to further dramatic change.
The BBC is certain to see its market share plunge - its own forecasts
predict that its share of the television audience will drop from just under
half to 30 per cent inside a decade.
Although, at Pounds 83 a year, the licence fee does not look expensive
today, it will come to seem so when up-rated steadily in line with
inflation. Thus, it is likely the fee will in practice be eroded further in
real terms, forcing the corporation to seek a new deal on funding - in, say,
2004 - in a much weakened state. Therein lies the case for requiring the BBC
to kick the licence fee habit now, while it remains strong, so freeing it to
compete and to punch its weight in the international marketplace.
The key is not to imagine that an instant transition can be made from public
funding to another single source of revenue; rather, it is to devise a mixed
funding base which can be shaped during the next decade as conditions
change. That could mean some advertising (perhaps on BBC1, Radio 1 and Radio
2); planning a move to subscription (perhaps for BBC2) as satellite and
cable extend the pay-television infrastructure; and some continued public
funding, both to support wholly non-commercial activities and to ease a
smooth transition towards commercial revenues.
Arrangements of this kind would give the BBC a new freedom of action because
it would make possible a change in ownership, bringing two desirable
results. One would be to distance it from governmental influence and the
second to place it within the scope of a single broadcasting regulator, an
Office of Broadcasting, which would, in turn, work closely with the
telecommunications regulator, Oftel.
Here at last would be a framework for a UK broadcasting industry able to
take part in the multi-media revolution; it would create conditions in which
the BBC and the ITV companies could compete, develop and expand.
Privatising the BBC could be achieved in much the same way as British
Telecom, British Gas or British Airways: through a stock market flotation, a
process which would bring proven advantages in terms of access to capital,
freedom to manage, efficiency and innovation; compare BA today with Air
France. With the BBC, though, there should be something more imaginative.
This could involve devising a form of ownership which would not pass the
corporation into the hands of institutional shareholders but would place
significant ownership stakes in the hands of viewers and listeners,
employees and the BBC's broadcasting industry partners. Government could
also retain a stake, or a golden share, if that were judged desirable.
At present, the BBC is funded by the public but, in practice, expression of
the public will is channelled exclusively through government ministers, who
make all key decisions about the corporation's future. Privatised as a
stakeholder partnership - relevant UK models include the John Lewis
Partnership and NFC, the road haulage company, although there are many more
examples in the US - the public's sense of owning the BBC would be enhanced,
not diminished.
It is true that to liberate the BBC - and, indeed, ITV - from a monopolistic
pasture would be risky. By exposing the BBC directly to competition for
audiences and funds, it might lose out; it might be shown not to be good
enough. But there is no reason to believe this would happen, since the BBC
is rich in talent and enterprise.
The more likely outcome is that the new BBC would succeed. It would develop
new services on satellite and cable - perhaps an arts channel, a children's
channel, a news channel or a music channel. It could run an events channel,
offering full coverage of major national occasions such as the Wimbledon
tennis, cricket Test matches and the Proms. As television goes inter-active,
the BBC would be an appropriate vehicle for government to fund new
developments, such as an electronic jobs market.
With a structure, constitution and funding base appropriate for the
hurly-burly of the new broadcasting age, this new BBC would have a real
chance of moving into the next century as a growing, dynamic organisation.
The alternative is bleak: for the BBC, a long, morale-sapping march on an
indefinitely descending path; for the broadcasting industry, yet another
missed opportunity.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Trade boost for recovery hopes: Export outlook brightens as
monthly deficit shrinks to 6 1/2-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP drop in the UK visible trade deficit in August raised hopes
yesterday that exports would play a more important role in sustaining
Britain's economic recovery.
The Central Statistical Office said the gap between visible exports and
imports was Pounds 7.61bn in the first eight months of this year. This
followed a Pounds 1.5bn reduction in earlier estimates of the deficit
between January and July as a result of improvements to the system for
collecting data.
The trade deficit fell to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 419m in August, the
lowest monthly total for 6 1/2 years, from Pounds 1.06bn in July. The UK
recorded a surplus in the month of Pounds 310m on trade with the rest of the
European Union - the highest surplus since the start of the 1980s. The data
gave a more encouraging view about trends in the UK's trade deficit - which
until yesterday had been thought to have been increasing because of a
slowdown in exports and a pick-up in import growth.
Further positive news about the sustainability of the upturn came from a
rise in manufacturing output in September after a sharp decline in car
output in August.
Government statisticians admitted that a question remained over the accuracy
of the export and import figures, which are based on the trouble-prone
Intrastat system for collecting trade figures across the European Union.
Even so, the London stock market interpreted the trade data as helpful to
the recovery outlook. The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares, helped by a
firm opening on Wall Street, closed just 0.6 lower at 3,099.1, after falling
25 points earlier in the day.
The pound finished in European trading nearly 1 pfennig higher at DM2.5075
and half a cent up at Dollars 1.483. It also rose in New York, and in late
trading was at DM2.5148 and Dollars 1.49225. Long-dated gilts jumped 1 point
on theories that the slowdown in imports showed weak demand pressures and
consequently indicated little risk of an inflationary surge.
The Treasury greeted yesterday's economic news as 'encouraging', although
warning against reading too much into the August trade figures. Indications
that the economy is continuing on a recovery path may increase the chances
that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will risk tax increases in the
Budget on November 30 without worrying that they will hold back the upturn.
The manufacturing data, however, held out little hope of any sharp increase
in factory production. Although manufacturing output increased a seasonally
adjusted 0.4 per cent in September, the recovery was insufficient to prevent
a 0.1 per cent decline in manufacturing output between the second and third
quarters.
By contrast, output of production industries, which include the energy
sectors as well as manufacturing, increased by 1 per cent in the latest
quarter.
Export values were a record in August, continuing a strong trend since the
start of the year.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Italian police hunt for heads of drug groups: Arrest
warrants issued as corruption scandal spreads
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ITALIAN police have stepped up their search for a number of top
pharmaceuticals executives who have been implicated in the country's
spiralling political corruption scandal.
The list of those being sought includes Mr Flavio Maffeis, the suspended
chairman and managing director of Glaxo Holdings' Italian subsidiary. Some
have already been held, such as Mr Ambrogio Secondi, the chairman of
SmithKline Beecham's operations in Italy, who is under house arrest.
The new warrants, issued by Naples magistrates investigating alleged
kickbacks paid by top pharmaceuticals groups to health ministry officials,
follow renewed questioning of Mr Duilio Poggiolini, an eminent academic and
a civil servant in the ministry, who was arrested in September.
Subsequent inquiries disclosed a trove of hidden bank accounts in Italy and
Switzerland held by Mr Poggiolini and his wife. A police search of the
family's property uncovered gold coins, jewels and gold bars in a hidden
safe. Investigators confiscated modern art worth billions of lire this week.
Leading businessmen in the subsidiaries of a number of German groups are
also implicated in the scandal. Arrest warrants have been issued for Mr
Bernardino Sala, managing director of Farmadis, Schering's fully owned
subsidiary; Mr Massimiliano Pancera of Boehringer Mannheim; and Mr Enrico De
Angelis of Errekappa Euroterapeutici, a subsidiary of BASF. Mr Livio Cesare
Camozzi of Bioresearch, another BASF subsidiary, has been arrested.
The latest wave of arrest warrants also takes in some of Italy's best known
domestic pharmaceuticals entrepreneurs. They in-clude Mr Arrigo Recordati
and Mr Giovanni Recordati, the fath-er-and-son team heading the stock
market-listed Recordati group, Italy's eighth-largest pharmaceuticals
company.
Pharmaceutical Business News, the industry newsletter, reported that Mr
Marino Golinelli of the Italian concern Alfa Wassermann was in Germany but
would be returning to Italy to meet magistrates.
Glaxo, the UK's largest drugs group, said Mr Maffeis had temporarily been
released from his duties at Glaxo Italia, the company's third most important
subsidiary with sales last year of Pounds 331m. He was made chairman of the
business this year.
Mr Franz Humer, a main board director and group chief operating officer, has
been appointed Glaxo Italia's chairman. Mr Pietro Leone, finance director of
the Italian business, has been made acting managing director.
Italy is the world's fifth-largest medicines market, worth Dollars 11bn
(Pounds 7.2bn) last year, but sales have collapsed after healthcare reforms
introduced in April.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Japanese must build up a life outside work, says agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE people need to develop personal relationships and seek a purpose in
life outside work to avoid misery in old age, according to the Economic
Planning Agency.
In its annual white paper on the quality of life, the agency says the
Japanese face a need to turn away from a company-centred lifestyle to one
that seeks meaning in personal relationships and private social activities.
With the increase in free time, as working hours are shortened and more
people expect a longer life after retirement, the report says 'the lack of
personal relationships at home or in the community, particularly among grown
men who have left their jobs', has become a social issue.
The end of the so-called economic bubble of the 1980s has also reawakened an
awareness that material comforts alone cannot provide satisfaction in life.
'In order to attain spiritual fulfilment, it is important to have a variety
of options in life and be able to experience satisfaction through personal
realisation,' the white paper says.
One way to do so, the agency suggests, is to create a private world through
reading and hobbies and by improving family ties. The agency also counsels
volunteer work, thinking about nature, spending time in the countryside, and
more communication with people of other nations.
The EPA's report reflects growing concern that a lifetime spent in
dedication to a company is leaving a growing number of Japanese men
spiritually and emotionally lost once they retire.
According to an agency survey, more than 67 per cent of those questioned
aged 65 and over, and 64 per cent of those in their early 60s, saw the
meaning of life in their work. Only 25 per cent of Japanese in their 20s
felt that way.

FT  13 NOV 93 / UK probes failure of companies to win EU contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government has launched an investigation into problems UK companies
face in winning a bigger share of the Pounds 500bn-worth of public
procurement contracts awarded every year across the European single market.
It fears the failure of British companies to increase their share of
contracts in the European Union may be due to legal loopholes blocking free
trade or to unfair practices.
There is concern that complaints about discrimination are dealt with too
slowly by both the European Commission and member states, and that
procedures fail to prevent abuse.
The first stage of the investigation, which is expected to take four months,
will focus on collecting evidence, mainly through a joint survey by the
Department of Trade and Industry and the Confederation of British Industry
of 5,000 UK suppliers to EU procurement agencies.
Stage two will involve detailed examination of the problems identified. The
DTI will recruit on secondment a private sector expert in EU contracting to
provide the lead, and prepare a report for ministers. The resulting action
plan could call for changes both in Whitehall and in Brussels.
Since January 1 1993, all public works contracts worth more than Ecu5m
(Pounds 3.8m), and all supplies contracts worth Ecu750,000 or more, must be
open to competition, and must be notified in the Official Journal, a
comprehensive daily list of invitations to tender for EU procurement
contracts and of successful bidders.
In practice, the number of contracts awarded across borders has stuck at
less than 4 per cent of all contracts. Exporters complain that contracts are
not being properly advertised; that late arrival of tender forms makes it
difficult to get on bidding lists; and that after failing to win a contract
they are unable to discover the terms on which a contract has been awarded.
'There is a strong suspicion that contracts are being split up to fall
beneath the reporting threshold,' an official said.
'If advertised contracts are to be believed, no public authority on the
continent has bought furniture, bought carpets, or done any substantial
printing,' another official commented following a study of contracts
notified this year.
Mr John Chudleigh, head of Euro-bid Watch, a private consultancy, noted that
Spain had reported the outcome of just 16 of the 1,300 tenders invited so
far this year - compared with the UK, France and Germany which listed more
than 3,000 contract awards apiece.

FT  13 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The emerging markets bandwagon continues to roll. Around Pounds 350m has
been raised by investment trusts this year, while Pounds 250m has flowed
into unit trusts. Govett Emerging Markets, an investment trust launched in
July, is already back for more. Institutional investors have usually been
first in the queue for closed-end funds. So far their faith has been
rewarded. Emerging markets investment trusts have seen net assets rise by 50
per cent on average during the last year. Share prices have risen by over 70
per cent as discounts to net assets have changed into premiums.
Yet some of the premiums are difficult to understand. Kleinwort Benson's
Emerging Markets trust has traded at a 10 per cent premium to net assets
even though the firm's unit trust - invested by the same team on the same
basis - is available at par. Templeton Emerging Markets trades at a 12 per
cent premium while the firm's Luxembourg-based SICAV can be bought at net
asset value.
The charges levied by the different funds might account for part of that
differential. The closed-end nature of an investment trust should also give
it the edge in illiquid markets; a unit trust or SICAV might expect
investors to leave when times are bad, forcing the fund manager to sell
stock into falling markets. But while equity markets are rising, this
benefit counts for little. The most compelling explanation for the anomaly
is that the market for emerging markets funds is itself an imperfect,
emerging market.

Consider this dilemma. Investment funds are currently stuffed with cash
seeking out attractive investment opportunities. The UK government,
meanwhile, is borrowing too much but is eager to initiate infrastructure
projects. You might think it would be possible to satisfy both desires by
encouraging private sector investment in public sector projects. Yet further
delays in building the Pounds 2.6bn Channel tunnel rail link emphasise how
difficult it is to translate this idea into practice.
The stumbling block is over the transfer of risk. Although the government
has spent more than Pounds 300m on the rail project, it still has to agree
on a definite route and pass the necessary legislation. Yet at this early
stage in the exercise, private sector involvement is already being sought.
That may make sense from a design point of view. But it complicates the
financial equations. If the private sector is expected to carry substantial
risk, it will expect venture capital rewards - at which the Treasury will
doubtless baulk. So the rail link can probably only make progress if the
government indemnifies the private sector against a large measure of future
risk. That, though, would result in private control with public risk - the
worst of all possible worlds.
One solution would be for the government to pump prime the project and then
solicit private sector bids to complete the link. The Royal Bank of
Scotland's economists have suggested an ingenious way of adapting the
Business Expansion Scheme to allow the government to raise such funds
without much drain on the public purse. With minimal risk, private investors
could then anticipate acceptable utility-type returns.

FT  13 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Unilever
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unilever's shares have gyrated wildly this year and both the bears and the
bulls found plenty of fresh ammunition in the company's third quarter
results. European operating profits slid 2 per cent. But that represented a
resilient outcome in the face of recession, especially considering that the
poor summer, which led to Europeans licking fewer lollies, may have cost
Unilever some Pounds 20m. In the US it was a mixed bag too. Procter &amp;
Gamble's determined price offensive hit the detergent market but Unilever
made progress selling cosmetics and perfumes, which bodes well for the
critical Christmas period.
Unilever will still do well to remain as robust in the developed world, with
retailers on the rampage and recession plaguing mainland Europe. The real
investment interest concerns Unilever's progress in the rest of the world.
Its results may have been flattered by acquisitions, but double-digit growth
in underlying sales and profits highlighted Unilever's momentum in these
markets. This year, profits from the world outside Europe and North America
may represent more than 20 per cent of the total. With US investors, in
particular, paying hefty premiums for exposure to emerging markets, that
makes it all the more puzzling that Unilever remains on such a sizeable
rating discount to the London and Amsterdam markets.

FT  13 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Firm base for rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Before yesterday afternoon's better economic news from the US, London was
whipping itself up into a lather about the latest UK trade and manufacturing
output data. Third quarter output fell somewhat less than expected, thanks
partly to a revival of motor vehicle production. The trade figures must
still be unreliable; yet since they are all the government has to go on, it
is perhaps worth noting that they show exports to the European Union rising
despite the recession in continental Europe and some evidence of import
substitution at home. That does not support the case for lower base rates in
the Budget.
Of course, economic indicators are never going to lead the chancellor both
to cut interest rates and raise taxes. To a large extent Budget decisions on
interest rates must be about the appropriate mix of policy rather than a
knee-jerk reaction to the latest indicators. There is certainly an argument
for tax rises to curb public borrowing, offset by looser monetary policy. It
is by no means certain that the chancellor will agree. The easiest political
choice may be to do nothing much on tax or on monetary policy.
After all, there is not much clamour from around the constituencies for
lower interest rates; nor are corporate balance sheets under that much
strain. The stock market, which has been promising itself a cut, would be
disappointed if none emerged. Perversely, though, a steady monetary course
might actually be better for economic confidence. Precipitate rate cuts at
this stage in the cycle would do little to stimulate investment, if they set
business worrying about painful rises later.

NEWS of stronger-than-expected retail sales and a surprising bond market
rally propelled US share prices to big gains yesterday, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 22.08 at 3,684.51. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 2.75 higher at 465.39, while
the Amex composite finished 1.62 higher at 479.60, and the Nasdaq composite
up 0.36 at 779.34. Trading volume on the NYSE was 323m shares.
Prices moved higher from the opening bell as investors bought stocks in
reaction to the commerce department's announcement that retail sales had
risen 1.5 per cent in October. Analysts had been expecting a 1 per cent
rise.
The figures were the latest in an increasingly long line of economic data
that has proved stronger than expected, supporting the impression that the
economy has been growing this autumn at a pace substantially faster than in
the first half of the year.
Sentiment was also aided by the surprising reaction of the bond market to
the retail sales data. Normally, signs of economic strength depress bonds,
but yesterday bond prices rose sharply after posting brief early declines.
The gains were put down to demand from dealers, who believed recent declines
had made bond prices attractive again, at least for the short-term.
Tobacco companies were widely sought after Philip Morris said that it would
match the cigarette price increases unveiled earlier this week by its main
rival, RJR Nabisco. The prices increases have raised hopes among investors
that the damaging price war between cigarette makers has ended. Philip
Morris climbed Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 59, RJR Nabisco added Dollars  3/8
at Dollars 7 1/4 and American Brands rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 35 3/8 .
Economically-sensitive stocks were mostly higher, especially forestry
product companies. Louisiana-Pacific rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 40 3/4 ,
Georgia-Pacific put on Dollars 4 at Dollars 74 1/8 and International Paper
firmed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 65 1/2 .
Digital Equipment rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 38 1/4 after Goldman Sachs
opened its coverage of the stock by rating the shares a "trading buy'. With
the same recommendation, however, IBM eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 51 5/8 .
Best Buy plunged Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 49 5/8 in heavy trading as
investors continued to sell the stock on concern that the company will
suffer from price competition from its chief rival in the electronic
appliance retail business, Circuit City.
Canada
TORONTO ended a record-breaking week by closing at yet another all-time
high. Based on preliminary data, the TSE-300 composite index was up 11.52
points to 4,302.78. Over the week the index gained about 101 points.

<TEXT>
BARGAIN-hunting and buying of Nikkei 300 stocks boosted share prices, and
the Nikkei 225 index jumped 1.8 per cent, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225 closed up 335.03 at 18,493.55, down 0.5 per cent on the week. It
fell to a low of 18,104.21 soon after the opening, and rose to a high of
18,592.26 in the afternoon.
Volume totalled 442.9m shares against 310m. Gainers overwhelmed losers by
947 to 113 with 105 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks
surged 31.49, or 2.1 per cent to 1,566.07 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50
index rose 3.25 to 1,259.59.
The ministry of finance announced that it would allow investment trusts to
set up funds linked to the Nikkei 300 index, prompting buying of component
shares of the index.
Brokers were seen buying on their own accounts, together with some life
insurance companies. Investors were also encouraged by the absence of
selling pressure from yesterday's settlement of the November options
contract.
Foreigners were seen buying large-capital shares, including leading steel
companies. Nippon Steel gained Y12 to Y336.
Bank stocks were strong on index-linked buying and bargain hunting.
Industrial Bank of Japan gained Y90 to Y3,230 and Mitsubishi Bank advanced
Y60 to Y2,960.
Chichibu Cement, which is to be absorbed by Onoda Cement, fell Y150 to
Y1,050. Daishowa Paper, whose chairman was arrested, allegedly for bribing
politicians, found no buyers and closed at an offered price of Y1,330.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 370.08 to 20,606.36 in volume of 20.9m
shares. Aoyama Trading, a retailer of low-priced men's suits, gained Y140 to
Y8,270 after reporting a surge in interim sales and earnings.
Roundup
THE region closed the week broadly higher. Taiwan and Bombay were closed,
the latter remaining so until November 15 because of Diwali.
HONG KONG saw mixed fortunes, after recording a new intraday high of 9,726,
then losing 74 points, before finally closing higher. The Hang Seng Index
ended up 26.42 to 9,701.25, a week's rise of nearly 8 per cent. Turnover
fell from HKDollars 10.4bn to HKDollars 8.6bn.
HSBC Holdings eased 50 cents to HKDollars 89.50 while Cheung Kong gained 25
cents to HKDollars 38.25.
SINGAPORE mainly ignored a 9 per cent rise in third quarter GDP, which was
generally in line with forecasts, and the Straits Times Industrial index
closed up 2.92 at 2,112.00 , up 2 per cent on the week.
SEOUL rose to another high for the year with smaller capitalisation stocks
showing steady gains. The composite index added 8.13 to 791.47, up 2.3 per
cent on the week. Turnover was Won1,010bn.
Samsung Electronics and Posco both went against the trend, falling
respectively by Won1,000 and Won800 to Won49,000 and Won34,700.
KUALA LUMPUR saw some profit-taking but Tenaga Nasional, the utility, helped
the composite index to a gain of 4.87 to 972.47, up 3 per cent on the week.
Tenaga rose 50 cents to MDollars 13.50.
AUSTRALIA built on Thursday's gains helped by active domestic buying. The
All Ordinaries index rose 21.6 to 2,074.0, barley changed on the week.
News Corp returned to favour, the shares adding 30 cents to ADollars 10.48.
Banks were active ahead of earnings reports next week: NAB gained 14 cents
to ADollars 12.34, ANZ added 9 cents to ADollars 4.40 and Westpac rose 5
cents to ADollars 4.43.
NEW ZEALAND recovered some ground lost during the week following the general
election. The NZSE-40 capital index put on 25.37 to 2,009.89, down 7.6 per
cent since the poll. In contrast, BANGKOK's SET index finished 9.58 ahead at
1,380.84 after an intraday high of 1,399.59, up 7 per cent this week.

FT  13 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Amsterdam ahead despite
Unilever disappointment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIVIDUAL stories moved bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
AMSTERDAM rose in spite of declines in Royal Dutch and Unilever. The CBS
Tendency index added 1.9 to 135.4, for a fall on the week of just under 1
per cent.
Unilever's third quarter results disappointed many analysts - the shares
slipping Fl 2.70 to Fl 210.00, but recovering from the day's low of Fl
204.00 - coming in at the lower end of expectations. However, some brokers
commented that an element of profit-taking may also have been occurring in
recent days after the shares recorded a new closing high of Fl 218 earlier
this month.
Royal Dutch slipped to an intraday low of Fl 193.10 before closing off 30
cents at Fl 196.80. ABN Amro yesterday downgraded its 1993 earnings
estimates because of the low price for crude, and lowered its 1993 eps
forecasts from Fl 12.00 to Fl 11.50 and for 1994 to Fl 14.50 against Fl
15.00, mainly due to an improvement in the chemicals division.
FRANKFURT's cash market had a quiet session, the DAX index falling 8.32 to
2,015.01, fractionally higher on the week; but excitement in futures after
hours left the Ibis indicated DAX at 2,023.5 by the end of the afternoon.
German reaction to the US retail figures incorporated gains in both DAX and
bund futures, said Mr Nigel Longley at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. Indications
of higher 1993 profits from the Allianz management board chairman in
Budapest took the shares up DM13 to DM2,775 at one point in the afternoon
after a low of DM2,735 earlier in the day.
Turnover fell from DM7.6bn to DM6.7bn. During the session, Schering dropped
DM33 to DM1,047 on continued disappointment with its nine-month results, as
well as on concern about lower sales of prescription drugs in Europe by the
industry this year.
Linde fell another DM13 to DM816 after its forecast that lower sales would
hit profits this year.
PARIS, closed on Thursday, struggled to find new incentives, although very
heavy trade was seen in Euro Disney as domestic investors caught up with the
story. The CAC-40 index lost 9.52 to 2,096.85, a week's rise of almost 1 per
cent.
Euro Disney was suspended twice after falling by the maximum permitted
limit, before finally ending off FFr5.50 or 14.5 per cent at FFr32.50. Some
buyers were seen re-entering the market during the session. The shares have
tumbled 27.5 per cent on the week, following Wednesday's announcement of
heavy losses.
Michelin was up FFr4.40 at FFr181.50 ahead of an 8 per cent fall in third
quarter turnover, reported after the close.
ZURICH overcame some early weakness but was unable to make much subsequent
headway as the market again consolidated gains seen earlier in the week. The
SMI index finished 1.0 higher at 2,721.1 for a 2.5 per cent rise on the
week.
Speculative buying took Roche certificates SFr90 higher to a record SFr5,990
in heavy volume after a presentation to analysts on Thursday.
STOCKHOLM was moderately higher with Astra B shares up SKr3 at SKr170
following a rise in third quarter profit of some 70 per cent. However, the
pharmaceuticals group commented that profits in the fourth quarter were not
likely to show the same rise.
The Affarsvarlden general index gained 4.0 to 1,402.3, barely moved on the
week. Turnover was SKr1.4bn.

FT  13 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Reform proves an uphill struggle for
Milan - A look at the effects of political and economic change on the
Italian market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For one Milan analyst, the business outlook for Italy is like the ascent of
Mont Blanc, Europe's highest mountain on the Franco-Italian border.
For years, delays in tackling chronic economic problems such as the budget
deficit and monopolistic state industries meant the summit was so far out of
reach as to be invisible.
Then in 1992, the government of prime minister Giuliano Amato instigated a
stream of reforms, axing state spending and sweeping away restrictive
practices so energetically as to part the clouds and make the peak almost
attainable.
The ascent has accelerated under the new government of prime minister Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi. Privatisation has been pushed forward, wage indexation
abolished and inflation reduced. 'Suddenly, the summit, still some way off,
looked as if it could be conquered,' says the analyst.
But as many mountaineers know, Mont Blanc is infamous for its deep
crevasses. Out of nowhere, huge chasms, sometimes camouflaged by a thin
layer of ice, can suddenly appear.
The crevasses have emerged with a vengance this month as Italian share
prices have plummeted in the light of unexpected political difficulties in
Rome.
Though the gloom lifted slightly by mid-week, the end result left the Comit
index down 1.6 per cent on the week at 546.32. The biggest bombshells have
come over the 1994 budget, which is an essential part of the government's
budget cutting plans.
After having made reasonable progress, helped by an unprecedentedly early
start, parliamentary debate on the budget has run into trouble.
Mr Ciampi is now racing against time. Although previous governments have
missed the formal year-end deadline for parliamentary approval of the next
year's budget, some fear that he may treat failure as a point of principle,
and consider resigning.
As a former governor of the Bank of Italy, Mr Ciampi regularly fulminated
against governments which failed to meet the December 31 target.
The budget has become hostage to a broader debate about the timing of new
elections. In the past month, members of parliament fearing the loss of
their seats - or perhaps worse if involved in the corruption scandal - have
used the budgetary process to hold up broader political change.
Matters have been worsened by this month's stream of leaks about alleged
payments by Italy's security services to senior politicians, including Mr
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, now head of state.
The allegations, made by top members of the security services under
investigation for alleged embezzlement, have been dismissed by many as
deliberate disinformation. However, some of the mud has stuck, and the
impact has given a jolt to the political establishment.
The renewed political uncertainty has blocked the government's path in the
tackling of Italy's economic problems, and has even been perceived as an
obstacle to the broader process of change, which is expected to culminate in
a general election in early 1994.
Continuing difficulties on the business front have exacerbated the bearish
sentiment on the bourse. Hopes of an early end to the recession are fading;
this week, Mr Giovanni Agnelli, the Fiat chairman, suggested that the upturn
in the motor sector would come later than expected.
Separately, the warning signals from the US that the downward trend in world
interest rates might be reversed have subsided, but sentiment remains wary.
The bears have also taken note of the heavy cash calls overhanging the
bourse. On Monday, Fiat shareholders will decide at a special meeting to
approve the mammoth L3,235bn (Dollars 1.95bn) rights issue announced in
September. Other deals pending include Mediobanca's L1,000bn capital
increase and the L492bn rights issue by Ifil.
Privatisation will soon swell the demands for cash. Next month sees the
launch of Italy's first big flotation of a state-controlled company with the
sale of the government's stake in the Credito Italiano banking group. Other
disposals are due to follow thick and fast.
An initial tranche of shares in Istituto Mobiliare Italiano, the Rome-based
financial services group, is scheduled for early February. Two months later,
investors are expected to be asked to stump up for shares in Banca
Commerciale Italiana, another big state-controlled bank.
This week's bout of nerves on the stock market may be forgotten quickly if
the structural shift of retail savings from government bonds into equities,
seen during the summer, is repeated. Mr Nils Peter Gyllenbaga, an analyst at
CS First Boston in Milan, says the weight of money from private savings
could trigger renewed share price rises before long.
Before that however, the political picture will have to clarify. Though Mr
Ciampi's government may emerge from the present impasse of political
manoeuvrings over the budget and disinformation about political corruption
to return to the ascent, the upward path for Italian shares is strewn with
hazards.
The most ominous among them is the election, assuming it takes place in the
early months of next year. Observers widely forecast heavy support for the
autonomist Northern Leagues, the Democratic Party of the Left (the former
Communists) and a weakened Christian Democrat party, ever more dependent on
voters in the south.
How such a threesome could form a government is the biggest imponderable in
Italian politics at present. Although Mr Ciampi and his immediate
predecessor can be satisfied by the distance they have climbed, the rest of
the way is littered with perils.

FT  13 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shell sold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further consideration of Shell Transport's results saw the shares tumble 20
at one stage. They were hit further by heavy selling in New York late on
Thursday and there slide accounted for much of the early weakness in the
London stock market yesterday. However, a futures-inspired rally dragged
Shell back to close 14 lower on the day at 690p.
Investors had latched on to encouraging third-quarter figures from BP the
week before and convinced themselves that Shell would follow suit. In the
event the company came up with perfectly respectable numbers but they lacked
excitement and included weakness in the chemicals side of the business. Some
analysts said the company was also on a high rating while lacking the
recovery potential of BP. The latter's shares slipped 2 1/2 to 357p.
BTR was slightly weaker as speculation of a bearish Sunday newspaper article
rippled through the market. There was also talk that one analyst was
preparing an in-depth research piece on the conglomerate and that his study
would be sent to clients on Monday. In the event the shares lost only a
halfpenny at 359 1/2 p on turnover of 6.1m.
Pharmaceutical stocks were marked down at the start of trading following big
falls in the US late on Thursday. However, with the leading drugs stocks
representing a significant proportion of the FT-SE 100 index, the subsequent
rise in the futures market pulled most of the health and household stocks
upward. Glaxo was 13 off at one stage but ended the day 2 weaker at 654p.
SmithKline Beecham 'A' shares dropped 12 but ended 3 1/2 lighter at 411p and
Wellcome fell 7 before ending a penny up at 678p.
Fisons, which has suffered from concerns over allegations of bribery in its
UK regional sales promotions, rallied 4 1/2 to 143 1/2 p. There was a return
of speculation that a bid might be launched but that story raised few
eyebrows, particularly on a Friday when dealers books are being squared
ahead of the weekend.
The beleaguered food retailers rallied in the face of a week of further
negative notes from brokers. Dealers said Thursday's big deal in Tesco -
where BZW matched a buyer and seller of 29m shares at only a small discount
to the current share price - had strengthened sentiment. Tesco shares
improved further yesterday, finishing 2 1/2 up at 185 1/2 p in good volume
of 9.5m. Argyll Group climbed 9 to 258p with 8.8m traded. Shoprite Group put
on 11 to 156p.
Stores groups responded well to the latest economic statistics and the
recent positive notes on the sector anticipating a good run up to Christmas.
Kingfisher gained 8 to 662p, Marks and Spencer 6 to 402p, Great Universal
Stores 9 to 543p and Boots 5 to 515p.
Rolls-Royce shares were the outstanding feature in a weak engineering and
aerospace sector. Talk in the market suggested that the group might be set
to announce a significant link with Pratt and Whitney of the US. Yet another
denial from British Aerospace that its Taiwanese jet deal was dead failed to
stop the shares sliding. They ended 11 adrift at 430p. Profit-taking took
the shine off VSEL, down 20 at 828p. British Steel were wanted ahead of
interims on Monday, closing 1 1/2 ahead at 124 1/2 p.
Further profit-taking in SG Warburg following good figures earlier in the
week took the shares back 15 to 833p.
Courtaulds, the leading stock in the chemicals sector, rebounded 16 to 484p
as investors decided it had fallen far enough and decided to pick up shares
ahead of figures next week. In the light of the chemicals industry's
Europe-wide blight and recent disappointing results from rival companies,
the figures are not expected to sparkle. However, the shares had already
fallen from above 580p at the start of August.
Composite insurer Royal Insurance fell 10 to 306p in active as profit takers
moved in after good nine-month results and a feeling premium rates might
have peaked. Securities house Charterhouse Tilney added that it was
concerned about the insurer being hit by pollution clean-up claims in the
United States. Royal has said up to now it has only received one small
claim, related to recent fires around Los Angeles.
Strength in Cable and Wireless was attributed to Lord Young, the chairman,
who was reported to be telling US businessmen that the Mercury One-2-One
mobile telephone system would have 10m subscribers within 10 years. The
shares gained 2 to 497p.
A return of the recent bear stories on Owners Abroad sent the shares into
retreat, although turnover was relatively small. The shares slipped 6 to 78p
in turnover of just over half a million.

FT  13 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Unilever results disappoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOOD manufacturing giant Unilever fell heavily for a second consecutive
session as the market reacted badly to third quarter figures yesterday.
Pre-tax profits, at Pounds 613m, came towards the bottom of market
forecasts, with the European ice cream business particularly weak on poor
weather. However, North America was better than some expectations. The
shares, which had tumbled 27 on Thursday, fell a further 17 yesterday to
close at 1086p. Turnover was a lumpy 4.3m.
Some analysts said that the disappointing results had demonstrated the
group's inevitable exposure to the current blight in the food manufacturing
sector. Several of the other leading stocks have been hit in recent sessions
by downgrades and negative notes as brokers have responded to the price war
among the food retailers. Smith New Court, which is recommending the stock
be sold at current levels, is worried about Unilever's margins, especially
in the low inflationary environment. The broker cut its full-year forecast
by Pounds 50m to Pounds 2.25bn, with the market range around Pounds
2.20bn-Pounds 2.35bn.

FT  13 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity account ends with strong rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EQUITY trading account ended in a blaze of activity, with share prices
rallying strongly on the back of a strong government bond market and a firm
opening to the new Wall Street session. UK bonds followed sterling in a
vigorous response to an unexpected shrinking in the UK trade deficit to
Pounds 419m in October.
The FT-SE Index was down by nearly 25 points in early trading, hit by
further pressure from stock index futures, where the December contract on
the Footsie remained at a discount against the cash market during the first
half of the session. But most of the loss reflected falls in Shell, Unilever
and Glaxo, and by the close, the December contract had returned to a
premium.
After rallying slowly following the trade figures, the stock market edged
slowly upwards in modest trading volume. The excitement came in the final
two hours of dealing when Wall Street responded to strong US sales data for
October. Firmness in sterling enabled UK bonds to shrug off weakness in
Federal bonds in New York. Long-dated gilts gained nearly a full point,
while base rate optimism held the shorts steady; index linked added of a
point.
The FT-SE Index closed just short of the 3,100 mark, with the day's final
net loss of a mere 0.6 points giving a reading of 3,099.1. The FT-SE Mid 250
Index, still at the mercy of profit-takers, shed 13.5 to 3,421.1.
The recovery in equities surprised traders the more because a large UK fund
had been switching out of UK shares and into gilt-edged stocks all day -
Pounds 250m each way was reportedly the price tag. This came on top of heavy
selling this week of UK equities by a large European fund which was believed
to have unloaded around Pounds 300m worth of stocks.
Over the two-week account, the Footsie has lost 71.9 points, or about 2.3
per cent, having this week recouped 13.5 points as worries over rising bond
yields in the US have abated somewhat. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, more
vulnerable to price mark downs by nervous marketmakers, is down by 3 per
cent over the trading account.
Seaq volume increased towards the close to give a final total of 639.4m
shares, still short of Thursday's 743.1m which was worth Pounds 1.65bn in
retail business; with Friday's total yet to come, the week's retail business
has already topped Pounds 6bn.

FT  13 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TURBULENT session in derivatives yesterday saw the December contract on
the FT-SE Index move back to a premium against the cash market, writes Terry
Byland. The highlight of the day came when, in one of the largest deals
recorded in stock index futures, a US house crossed 3,500 December contracts
at virtually the day's high point of 3,116. The deal boosted trading volume
to a similar peak of just over 19,000 contracts.
It was a different story earlier in the day, however. the December contract
fell sharply to below the 10 point fair value premium as an equity seller
insured himself.
Here the contract stayed until unexpectedly good UK trade figures changed
the mood. But it was Wall Street which drove futures to their closing
strength, for a final December reading of 3,113, a three- or four-point
premium over fair value; fair value dips to around 6 1/2 when the new equity
account opens on Monday morning.
Traded options were also busy on UK and European selling of equities.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Money Markets: German call rate slips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The rate for overnight D-Mark funds slid further yesterday, raising hopes of
a more substantial easing at next week's Bundesbank securities repurchase
agreements, writes Conner Middelmann.
In a market awash with liquidity, the call money rate fell to around 6.25
per cent in late trading, down 0.20 points in the last two days. Despite the
outflow of funds in payment for the Treuhandanstalt's new bonds, liquidity
was ample, boosted among other factors by banks' well-stocked reserves at
the central bank. Reserves totaled DM59.1bn on Wednesday, the last day for
which data is available, up from DM58.8bn on Tuesday.
Given the softness in call money rates, next week's round of repos - which
has been moved forward by one day due to Wednesday's national holiday - is
expected to yield a larger drop in the repo rate than this week's one basis
point reduction. Many dealers are betting on a 5 to 10 basis point reduction
in the lowest-accepted rate from this week's 6.38 per cent.
The December three-month Euromark futures contract rose 0.04 point to 93.89.
As expected, the Bank of France at its latest open-market operation left its
key money market rates unchanged and added FFr1bn in liquidity. The Bank of
France is seen to want to keep rates steady so as not to upset the foreign
exchange market while it continues to rebuild its foreign currency reserves.
The Bank of France's weekly statement, published yesterday, showed that the
country's net currency reserves rose by FFr4.8bn in the week to October 28,
leaving the reserves still FFr28.2bn in deficit.
'It's quite disappointing - they don't seem to be taking advantage of the
D-Mark's weakness against the dollar to accelerate the rebuilding
programme,' said Mr Chris Turner, a currency strategist at Barclays de Zoete
Wedd Securities.
The three-month Pibor future rose 0.03 points to 93.53.
After tightness earlier in the week, Sterling money market rates softened
slightly after a large institution took out the bulk of the Pounds 1.5bn
shortage announced early in the day, traders said.
In the early round of operations the Bank purchased Pounds 1.25bn of bills
at an interest rate of 5 29/32 per cent, followed by another Pounds 150m of
bills at 5 7/8 per cent.
The December short sterling futures contract rose 0.05 points on strong
volume to 94.45.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: Dollar falls further against yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US dollar continued its slide against the Japanese yen yesterday amid
nervousness over next Friday's meeting between US President Bill Clinton and
Japan's prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa and the continued repatriation of
funds by Japanese investors, writes Conner Middelmann.
However, trading volume was relatively modest with many US traders absent
for a long weekend after Thursday's Veteran's Day holiday. Holiday
conditions were seen to exaggerate price swings amid a thin flow of hard
news.
The dollar slumped as low as Y105.85 from an intra-day high of Y106.65 and
is expected to retest support at Y105.90 in the near term. While fundamental
factors - the moribund Japanese economy against the US recovery - do not
warrant a depreciation of the dollar against the yen, heavy flows out of
foreign assets into Japan have favoured the yen all week, traders said.
'The Japanese economy is extremely weak and that's causing liquidity
problems for corporates and institutions who are having to sell overseas
assets and repatriate the funds,' said Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at
IBJ International.
Stronger than expected US retail sales data propelled the dollar above DM1.7
to an intra-day high of DM1.7035. However, as follow-through buying failed
to materialise the currency slid lower and was given a further downwards
push by by lower than expected consumer confidence data. The dollar closed
at DM1.6915 in London and dropped as low as DM1.6815 in late inter-bank
trading.
Some dealers expect the dollar to get a lift against the D-Mark if the
Bundesbank's next round of securities repurchase agreements produces a
larger drop in the repo rate than this week's mere one-basis-point decline.
Sterling also had a volatile day, jumping nearly two pfennigs against the
D-Mark on stronger than forecast trade data but erasing most of the gains in
the afternoon as traders took profits and squared their books ahead of the
weekend. Late dollar-sales also dragged sterling down against other
currencies. After nudging against DM2.52, sterling slipped back to close at
DM2.5075, up only slightly from Thursday's close of DM2.5000. However, in
erratic after-hours trading it jumped back to test its earlier highs around
DM2.52.
The Italian Lire shrugged off the successful passage of Italy's 1994
austerity budget in the Senate and closed at L979.7 against the D-Mark,
little changed from L979.6 on Thursday.

FT  13 NOV 93 / International Company News: Qantas finance director resigns

<TEXT>
QANTAS, the Australian airline, has lost Mr Graham Jones, its finance
director, less than one month after Mr James Strong took over as managing
director.
Qantas, in which British Airways holds a 25 per cent stake, announced
yesterday that Mr Jones, chief financial officer, had resigned afteronly 11
months with the company. It said Mr Jones would leave the carrier at the end
of November 'to pursue further specialised project roles'.
This means Qantas will have changed chairman, managing director and finance
director in nine months.
Qantas, which has seen upheavals and management changes recently as its own
international operations have been merged with those of the domestic
Australian Airlines and the combined entity prepared for privatisation,
declined to comment on whether the departure was amicable or not.
But a formal statement said Mr Jones had joined Qantas 'specifically to be
involved in the heavy programme of activities leading up to immediate public
float of the airline'.
'With the deferment (of the flotation) until probably at least early 1995,
Mr Jones said he felt he could not make the required commitment to Qantas to
stay on for at least a further three to five years, encompassing the float
and consequential beddingdown process,' the airline said.
Mr Jones had joined Qantas in mid-December last year.
Government plans to float the remaining 75 per cent of Qantas have been
pushed back several times because of the airline's poor financial results.
Last month, Qantas announced a pre-tax loss of ADollars 413.5m (USDollars
276m) for the year ended June.

FT  13 NOV 93 / International Company News: Price rise boosts Philip Morris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Philip Morris rose sharply yesterday after the US tobacco, beer
and food group said it would raise wholesale cigarette prices by 4 cents a
pack, matching an increase announced by RJR Reynolds earlier this week.
In anticipation of the Philip Morris announcement, three Wall Street
securities houses - Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers and Bear Stearns -
upgraded their ratings on the stock and increased their earnings estimates
for the company, which markets Marlboro, the world's best-selling cigarette
brand.
Afterwards Philip Morris's share price, which had climbed a day earlier on
expectations that the company would follow RJR's lead, rose steadily on Wall
Street to close Dollars 2 1/4 higher on the day at Dollars 59.
The move signals the cessation of a cigarette price war which began in April
when Philip Morris announced that it was cutting the prices of its premium
brands by 40 cents a pack as part of a plan to stem the surging popularity
of discount cigarettes.
The strategy appears to have succeeded in shoring up the Marlboro's market
share, which currently stands at about 25 per cent, against a low of 21.5
per cent before the price cut.
However, the pricing decision, which was soon followed by other cigarette
manufacturers, has led to squeeze on earnings.

DEUTSCHE Bank and Commerzbank, two of Germany's big three banks, are likely

shareholdings in Karstadt, Germany's largest department store group.
The sale is part of the complex transaction whereby Karstadt will acquire
control of Hertie, the third biggest department store group, to create a
group with turnover of DM27bn.
The transaction, widely expected in Germany, was announced formally
yesterday.
Mr Ulrich Cartellieri, a main board director of the Deutsche Bank and
chairman of the Karstadt supervisory board, said yesterday that Deutsche
Bank's stake in the enlarged group would 'not fall below 10 per cent' from
its current 25 per cent level.
Under the deal, Karstadt will buy the whole of Hertie from its current
shareholders, chiefly a charitable foundation whose main purpose is to
support research into the causes of multiple sclerosis. The foundation will
use the sale proceeds to finance the purchase of shares in Karstadt from the
banks, leaving the Hertie foundation as the largest shareholder in the
enlarged group.
Pricing details remain confidential, Mr Cartellieri said yesterday, but it
seems likely that the shares will be sold at more than the current market
price of Karstadt's shares.
As the group has a market capitalisation of DM5.2bn, the sale of the two 15
per cent stakes would thus raise at least DM750m before tax for each of the
banks. This will bring a windfall gain to the two banks' 1994 profits.
Mr Walter Deuss, Karstadt's chief executive, said there would be no need for
a rights issue to finance the purchase of Hertie. Analysts suggest that
Hertie will be sold for DM1.5bn to DM1.8bn.
The banks' move to sell the bulk of their stakes in Karstadt comes ahead of
Deutsche Bank's imminent sale of a DM1bn part of its 28 per cent holding in
Daimler-Benz.

FT  13 NOV 93 / International Company News: Japanese steel groups slip into
red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S five leading steel companies slipped into the red during the six
months ended September following the downturn in the domestic economy and
steady appreciation of the yen.
Nippon Steel, the world's largest steel producer, reported a pre-tax loss of
Y16.7bn (Dollars 155m) compared with a profit of Y14.1bn in the same period
last year, and the losses would have been more embarrassing if the company
had not taken a profit of Y17.6bn on sales of securities.
The pattern of heavy losses and large securities sales was seen at most of
the other leading steel groups, which have been in profit for the past six
years. They expect the second half will do further damage to their balance
sheets.
In response, Kobe Steel announced that it would join other makers in
requesting that staff take at least one extra day off each month from
January until March. Nippon Steel said executives would take a 15 per cent
pay cut from January.
Kobe reported a pre-tax loss of Y8.1bn, in spite of making a profit of
Y5.5bn from securities sales, NKK had a loss of Y15.4bn, Kawasaki Steel
Y8.3bn, and Sumitomo Metal Industries Y9bn. All had reported profits during
the same period last year.
Sumitomo said a cost-cutting drive had not compensated for the weakening of
domestic demand and the yen's strengthening. Along with the other makers,
Sumitomo will not pay an interim dividend.
The losses this year have raised questions about the steel companies'
diversification into computers and semiconductors, as well as forays into
theme parks, bicycle manufacturing and mushroom farming.
'As for the electronics, new materials and biomedical divisions, efforts
shall be concentrated on examining profitability in each field and in
identifying where profits can be improved as quickly as possible,' Sumitomo
said.
For NKK, which had profits of Y2.4bn on the sale of fixed assets and another
Y14.5bn from securities, the bright spot was that the company was not forced
to report a loss on the redemption of convertible bonds, which cost it
Y4.7bn in the same period last year.
The industry was fortunate in the first half to have strong export demand
from China, but Beijing's attempts to slow an overheated economy have led to
a fall in orders for Japanese steel over the past two months.
Kobe said demand from China earlier in the year had 'increased remarkably',
and the ratio of export sales to net sales rose to 19.1 per cent from 16.5
per cent in the same period last year.
Nippon Steel said the 'Japanese economy was shoved into deeper recession by
the continuing stagnation in private industry investment and consumer
spending', along with the yen's rise against the dollar.
'Further decreases in steel production and shipments are feared as domestic
demand in all fields, except public civil engineering projects, will remain
dull. Faced with this, Nippon Steel will restructure its mainstay steel
operations and steadily promote engineering and new businesses,' the company
said.

THE Hong Leong group, one of south-east Asia's biggest conglomerates, has
extended its interests in banking and finance with the MDollars 1.1bn
(Dollars 423m) takeover of the banking and finance units of Malayan United
Industries (MUI).
MUI is selling its banking group for MDollars 695m cash to the Hong Leong
Credit company and its MUI finance unit to Bedford, another Hong Leong
company, for MDollars 405m in cash.
The Hong Leong group is controlled by Mr Quek Leng Chan, a Malaysian Chinese

Mr Quek, who is said to have strong connections with some of Malaysia's
senior politicians, had been trying to gain control of a local bank to
complement his manufacturing, property and financial interests.

FT  13 NOV 93 / International Company News: Philip Morris upgraded after
increasing its cigarette prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Philip Morris rose sharply yesterday after the US tobacco, beer
and food group said it would raise wholesale cigarette prices by 4 cents a
pack, matching an increase announced by RJR Reynolds earlier this week.
In anticipation of the Philip Morris announcement, three Wall Street
securities houses - Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers and Bear Stearns -
upgraded their ratings on the stock and increased their earnings estimates
for the company, which markets Marlboro, the world's best-selling cigarette
brand.
Afterwards the share price, which had climbed a day earlier on expectations
that the company would follow RJR's lead, rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 58
3/4 in morning trading on Wall Street.
The move signals the cessation of a cigarette price war which began in April
when Philip Morris announced that it was cutting the prices of its premium
brands by 40 cents a pack as part of a plan to stem the surging popularity
of discount cigarettes.
The strategy appears to have succeeded in shoring up the Marlboro's market
share, which currently stands at about 25 per cent, against a low of 21.5
per cent before the price cut.
However, the pricing decision, which was soon followed by other cigarette
manufacturers, has led to squeeze on earnings.
Last month, Philip Morris posted a 24.8 per cent decline in third-quarter
net income to Dollars 971m and said it expected its difficulties to continue
in the fourth quarter.
In upgrading his rating for Philip Morris, Mr Marc Cohen of Goldman Sachs
said his estimate of 1993 earnings was unchanged at Dollars 4.65 a share,
against Dollars 5.65 last year.
However, he raised his 1994 profits estimate by 15 cents to Dollars 5.20.
At Salomon, Ms Diana Temple lifted her 1994 estimate to Dollars 5.25, from
Dollars 5.05.

FT  13 NOV 93 / International Company News: Umberto Agnelli quits as deputy
chairman at Fiat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE long-whispered redistribution of roles within Italy's powerful Agnelli
family was confirmed yesterday with the resignation of Mr Umberto Agnelli as
deputy chairman of Fiat.
The move is due to be formalised at a special Fiat shareholders' meeting on
Monday called to approve changes to group statutes regarding retirement
rules for executives.
In September, Mr Agnelli, who was expected to take over as chairman from his
elder brother Giovanni (Gianni) next June, suffered the embarrassment of
seeing his brother announcing that Fiat would change its retirement rules to
allow him (Gianni Agnelli) to stay on for an additional two years as
chairman.
The news followed a number of setbacks for Mr Umberto Agnelli, who has
always tended to be overshadowed by his better known and more charismatic
elder brother.
Observers have for some time been claiming to see cracks in the outwardly
solid Agnelli family structure. Apart from Fiat, Italy's biggest private
company, the immensely rich family controls Ifi and Ifil, two quoted
financial holding companies, and a string of other interests including
Turin's Juventus football club.
However, while the latest move may indicate the first step in a separation
of interests, clear interpretation of its significance has been masked by
other developments.
The most notable is the continuation of the Agnelli family line at Fiat
through the appointment of Mr Umberto Agnelli's 29-year-old son Giovanni to
the board. The newcomer, who has won his managerial spurs in a number of
executive positions outside the group, marks the fourth generation of
Agnellis at Fiat following its foundation by the family in 1899.
In a further step, seen by some as a face-saving solution, Mr Umberto
Agnelli will take on executive responsibilities as managing director of Ifi.
The latter company is the linchpin of the Agnellis' diverse business
interests.
He will remain in charge of Ifil, the holding company which under his
chairmanship has become one of Italy's biggest corporate success stories in
recent years.
The developments leave unchanged the ownership of the family holding
company, Giovanni Agnelli &amp; Co, which controls Ifi.
Only in the event of a reorganisation of the former's complex structure
might it be possible to decypher the state of relations within the Agnelli
family and to what extent, if at all, a divorce is under way between the two
brothers.

<TEXT>
AVESTA Sheffield, the Anglo-Swedish stainless steel producer, slipped into a
SKr105m (Dollars 13m) loss after financial items for the first nine months
of 1993, after failing to sustain an improving results trend in the third
quarter.
The group blamed holiday production stoppages for a third-quarter deficit of
SKr61m, which followed a second-quarter profit of SKr9m. It did not provide
comparative figures because the company was only formed through a merger
between Avesta and British Steel Stainless last November. The deal left
British Steel with a 40 per cent stake in Avesta Sheffield.
The short-term market outlook remains very uncertain, the group warned, not
least because of the volatile nickel price and weaker European prices for
cold rolled products.
However, it is still predicting a better result for the full year than last
year's SKr564m loss due to cost-reductions and the weaker Swedish and UK
currencies. Sales amounted to SKr10.66bn for the nine months. The group's
biggest division, cold rolled sheet and plate, made a SKr158m operating
profit on sales of SKr5.38bn.
It was helped by higher exports to the US and Asia Pacific which offset the
downturn in demand in Europe.

FT  13 NOV 93 / International Company News: Astra lifted by stronger sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWERFUL sales growth helped Astra, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, lift
pre-tax profits by 69 per cent to SKr5.78bn (Dollars 713m) in the first nine
months.
The figure was higher than expected, helping the group's A shares to rise
SKr3 to SKr170.
Sales for the latest period rose 43 per cent to SKr16.1bn, due to a 20 per
cent increase in volumes and the effects of a weaker Swedish krona.
Operating profits at SKr4.73bn were 54 per cent ahead. However, the pre-tax
rise was even bigger as the weaker krona helped to swell financial income to
SKr985m from SKr288m.
Sales were up 50 per cent in the UK and 58 per cent in France.
In Germany, the company's largest single market, there was a 5 per cent
downturn, reflecting the country's general healthcare cost-containment
squeeze.
Losec, the anti-peptic ulcer agent, again dominated the performance, with a
65 per cent rise in sales to SKr5.06bn.
Total sales, including those through licensees, were up 64 per cent at
SKr9.10bn.
Pulmicort, Astra's anti-asthma agent, saw a 54 per cent increase in sales to
SKr2.08bn.
The group said full-year sales growth would continue at the same level as in
the first nine months.
However, it reiterated previous warnings that profits growth would be slower
over the rest of the year because of the effect that currency gains had on
the final-quarter performance in 1992.

weeks already and is going to influence source markets. White pepper prices
declined this week to a level of about USDollars 2950/mt cif. It looks like
we are not far from the stabilization point. Black pepper was offered in
larger quantities by India and Brazil. The material could not be absorbed
failing industrial demand for nearby positions and prices consequently came

FT  13 NOV 93 / Commodities (Week in the markets): Traders nervous ahead of
Opec talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Commodities Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROBLEMS for the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries continued to
pile up this week. The oil price fell to its lowest point since the Gulf war
at one point on Thursday. Then came reports that Saudi Arabia might consider
cutting the production ceiling set in late September by Opec, and this
helped to lift the price of Brent blend for December from the four-year low
of Dollars 15.20 a barrel. But late yesterday in London the price was still
only Dollars 15.47 1/2 .
The markets also strengthened on Thursday because of a vote by the United
Nations Security Council to impose new sanctions on Libya. The sanctions are
designed to gradually erode the country's export capacity, and could affect
the its ability to export oil. However, analysts said the uncertainty over
Libyan exports could help to underpin the oil prices temporarily.
The International Petroleum Exchange in London recorded a new peak in Brent
crude futures on Thursday as the price collapsed. Some 79,667 contracts were
traded, representing an increase of 14 per cent over the previous record set
in September 1993. In addition, total futures volume, including products,
rose to a record 104,181 from the previous high of 102,530 set on August 19
this year.
Traders remain very nervous ahead of the next Opec ministerial meeting in
Vienna on November 23 in case some producers actually take notice of the
various pleas for restraint echoing around the oil world. For example, Mr
Rehda Malek, the Algerian prime minister, was quoted by a newspaper in the
United Arab Emirates on Thursday as saying that oil producers 'should show
greater restraint' in order to boost prices.
Opec's economic commission meets next Monday to discuss its forecast for
short-term demand. It will prepare a report for Opec ministers that is
expected to show a continuing decline in demand for Opec oil. 'You don't
have to be a wizard to understand. What we have here is a combination of
seasonal factors, weak world demand and stepped-up, non-Opec production,' an
Opec official said.
Coffee prices slipped by Dollars 13 a tonne in London to Dollars 1,212 a
tonne yesterday as traders expressed scepticism over Brazil's commitment to
the producers' retention scheme. Brazil has only managed to buy 25,250 bags
at three auctions - a tenth of what was needed under the scheme. Brazilian
officials said yesterday they already held more than 1m bags in collateral
against loans made to producers, and that coffee will now be counted towards
the retention scheme. The loans were due to be repaid by the end of October,
but have been rescheduled to December 15.
'Brazil has probably complied with the letter, but not the spirit of the
retention scheme,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles at GNI, the London brokers. If
the loans are paid off by December and Brazil hands back the coffee held as
collateral, it will need to have been extremely active in the market to
replace that coffee. Mr Eagles calculates that Brasilia will have to
purchase 100,000 bags a week in the next two months if it is to replace that
coffee. Given the limited success of the auction system so far, some traders
are sceptical that this will happen.
Brazilian coffee traders told Reuters news agency they were upset at being
'deceived' by the government over its auction plans. The news caused a
sell-off in the coffee market with prices expected to go lower unless the
Brazilian government is seen buying heavily in coming weeks.
Other traders criticised the retention scheme plans as being ill
thought-out, but said the Brazilians needed just a few more weeks to get
their act together. 'It's giving a bad impression to the market because the
mechanics haven't been thought through,' said Mr Eagles, 'but I have no
doubt that Brazil is not committed to the scheme.'
The sugar market slumped on Tuesday following a dramatic sell-off in the New
York market. Traders put the price drop down to technical selling by New
York fund managers, with prices falling to Dollars 279 a tonne on the London
Commodity Exchange from Dollars 286.60 a tonne. The market stabilised at the
lower level during the rest of the week.
Analysts were split in opinion about the significance of a fall in total
London Metal Exchange stocks by 149 tonnes revealed yesterday - the first
such fall for about a year.
With total stocks at about 4.25m tonnes, a lot more metal would have to be
removed before there was any solid proof that demand was improving, one
dealer pointed out. However, others suggested that the efforts some
producers were making to cut production were at last bearing some fruit.
Nickel producers have been at the forefront, and yesterday Sumitomo of Japan
joined the list of those planning production cuts. It said that in the
second half of its present financial year it would hold its nickel output
down to 16,900 tonnes compared with the 17,159 tonnes produced in the same
period a year ago and 18,065 tonnes in the first half.
Unfortunately, any upward pressure this might have put on the price was
offset by Western Mining of Australia, which said its nickel smelter at
Kalgoorlie would resume production nine days ahead of schedule on November
17 after a temporary closure for the plant could to be upgraded. The
ADollars 61m (Dollars 39.30m) scheme has lifted the smelter's capacity from
55,000 to 80,000 tonnes.

FT  13 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Egit threat to undo two investment deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE EAST German Investment Trust yesterday threatened to undo two investment
deals it had struck in the privatisation of two former east German
companies.
Responding to reports in the German media that the Treuhandanstalt agency
had suffered damages of DM100m (Pounds 40.6m) in the privatisation of
Markische Baustoff-Service (MBS) and Haushaltgerateservice (HGS), Egit said
it would take the action 'in order to avoid even the appearance of unlawful
enrichment on the part of the company'.
Egit said it would offer to sell MBS back to Treuhand for the full purchase
price, and that it would seek refund on its down-payment on HGS.
The current investigation by judicial authorities in Berlin into certain
Treuhand employees, past and present, led to reports in the media about the
activities of Egit, Ermgassen &amp; Co, its investment manager, and Dr Olav
Ermgassen, a director.
Acknowledging that Egit's statement could be seen as an over-reaction, Mr
Ermgassen said: 'We cannot be pulled through the dirt. The press rumours are
bad news for a company with blue-chip investors and worse bad news for those
companies in which we invest.'
The Treuhand agency in Berlin yesterday insisted that it was satisfied with
the Egit's performance in all the 22 east German companies in which it has
direct or indirect participation.
'Up to now all the contractual obligations (of Egit) have been maintained as
far as purchase prices, investments and jobs are concerned,' the Treuhand
said in a statement. More than 6,500 workers are employed in the companies
in which Egit has an interest, and the contracts provide for an investment
of DM480m in the coming years.
Mr Wolf Schode, representing Treuhand, said he was 'astonished' at the Egit
move, because the company had only two days ago requested an extension of
the Treuhand guarantee covering borrowing by MBS and HGS until the end of
the year.
The investigators confirmed that 51 premises were raided last Tuesday in the
investigation against the former Treuhand employees, who are accused of
profiting illegally from the sale of various companies and properties.
The Berlin judicial authorities said nobody at Egit itself was involved.

FT  13 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Ashley in court move over Spanish claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASHLEY Group, the once lossmaking window blinds and timber company, which
recently returned to profit expects to take its legal battle to reclaim
Pounds 20m, for the sale of a Spanish subsidiary, to the courts before the
end of this month.
The company said yesterday that a court date would be set within the next
few days. Mr James White, chairman, said he was confident the court case
would be decided before the end of the year.
Ashley sold Digsa, its Spanish supermarket business, in May for Pounds 53m
to the Hong Kong-based group, Parafax. Of this, Pounds 33m was debt with the
remainder to be paid in four equal instalments, the first payment being due
last week.
The deferred payment was secured on certain assets, which Ashley claims
could be repossessed if Digsa sought protection from creditors similar to
Chapter 11 in the US. Digsa did so in September and Ashley is launching
legal action to reclaim the assets.
Mr White said yesterday he would not even consider the possibility that the
courts could find in Parafax's favour.
Ashley reported interim profits of Pounds 1.6m in September, after losses,
largely incurred on the Spanish retailing side, of Pounds 13.8m.
Three directors associated with the Spanish diversification left the company
last month.

FT  13 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Stanhope extends revolving credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANHOPE Properties has extended its revolving credit facilities to 1996,
subject to continued compliance with specified covenants and to interim
reviews by the group's banks.
The group, which is joint owner of the Broadgate complex in the City of
London, announced that it had reduced its annual pre-tax losses from Pounds
214.7m to Pounds 62m in the year to June 30.
However, Stanhope's also revealed that its net assets had fallen to a
deficit of Pounds 15.8m at the year-end, compared with a surplus of Pounds
42.2m. The group has therefore called an extraordinary general meeting for
December 13.
The Companies Act requires a company to call a meeting if its net assets are
less than half its called-up share capital, to consider what action, if any,
needs to be taken.
Stanhope said this deficit should represent the nadir of the group's
performance and was against the background of an extremely severe and
protracted downturn in property values.
The board was reviewing options for strengthening the group's balance sheet,
including the possibility of raising new equity and a further restructuring
of the company's banking arrangements.
Stanhope said that last year many commentators believed that the property
cycle had reached the bottom and that by the end of 1993 values and rents
could start to rise.
'This belief has been fulfilled. The rapid and substantial fall in interest
rates, resulting in property yields exceeding bond yields for the first time
in a number of years, has benefited Grade A buildings as evidenced by the
sale of 175 Bishopsgate and two disposals since the year end totalling
approximately Pounds 70m which have taken place at Stockley Park.'
The directors said they were 'confident that the bottom of the property
cycle has passed. With the rising demand for high quality office
investments, which make up the bulk of our portfolio, we expect to see slow
but steady progress over the coming 12 months and thereafter.'
As a result of its disposal programme, Stanhope said it had reduced
borrowings from Pounds 254m at June 30, 1992, to the current level of
approximately Pounds 132m.
Turnover fell from Pounds 56.9m to Pounds 52.2m. Losses per share were
37.35p, compared with 128.6p last time. There was again no dividend.

FT  13 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Supasnaps behind Sketchley's 16% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GOOD contribution from Supasnaps helped Sketchley, the dry cleaning,
textile rental and film processing group, lift interim pre-tax profits by 16
per cent to Pounds 3.6m compared with Pounds 3.1m.
Sketchley acquired Supasnaps from Dixons last April for Pounds 4.3m, plus
Pounds 2m goodwill. Mr John Richardson, deputy chairman, said the
acquisition had 'performed exceptionally well', generating Pounds 6m of cash
to date.
Supasnaps contributed Pounds 2m to operating profits in the 26 weeks ended
October 1. However, the group warned that profits from film processing would
be significantly less in the second half because of the seasonality of the
business.
Operating profits from the rest of the group fell to Pounds 2.36m, against
Pounds 3.74m in the 27 weeks to October 2 last year.
Mr Tony Bloom, joint deputy chairman, said the dry cleaning business had
proved tough and competitive, particularly in the south-east of England.
The group was responding with an aggressive price promotion campaign.
The textile rental division, which supplies workwear for British Coal's
miners, won a net increase in customers for the first time in three years
during the half. But in spite of reduced dependence on British Coal, the
falling number of miners would continue to affect profits in the second
half.
Mr Richardson said the jewel in the crown of Supasnaps was its strong retail
management team. The group is to merge its dry cleaning division with
Supasnaps.
Mr Richardson said the group had closed 30 lossmaking dry cleaning stores
and 22 lossmaking Supasnaps branches.
It now had over 750 retail outlets, including 460 dry cleaners, and planned
to have 100 fully-integrated stores by the end of next year.
Total group revenues rose from Pounds 53.7m to Pounds 75.6m, including a
Pounds 24m contribution from Supasnaps.
Net interest payable rose from Pounds 625,000 to Pounds 721,000, and gearing
was up from 17.7 per cent to 26.8 per cent.
Earnings per share moved ahead from 4.2p to 4.4p. The interim dividend is
maintained at 1p a share.

FT  13 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Azlan for market with Pounds 50m valuation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AZLAN GROUP, a distributor of advanced computer networking products, is to
obtain a full Stock Exchange listing through a placing and intermediaries
offer which values the company at Pounds 50.2m.
Some 9.6m shares are being offered or placed at a price of 230p a share. The
offer has been fully underwritten by SG Warburg Securities. There will be
21.8m shares in issue following the offer.
Some Pounds 6m, net of expenses, is being raised to increase the company's
range of products, improve its market share and help expand its business in
continental Europe.
Under the offer, 3.04m shares are being issued by the company and 6.6m
shares are being sold by existing shareholders. Some 6.5m shares are being
placed with institutional investors and 3.1m are being offered to
intermediaries on behalf of their clients.
Azlan reported earnings per share of 8.4p for the year ended March 31,
giving a p/e ratio at the offer price of 27.4. The forecast final net
dividend for the year to March 31 1994 is 2p, giving a notional dividend of
3p. Gross dividend yield at the offer price would be 1.6 per cent.
Azlan has chosen to take the high added value approach to the distribution
of products in one of the fastest growing areas of the computer marketplace.
The company distributes only leading edge, high technology, products at an
early stage in their implementation when dealers have most need of Azlan's
expertise in selling the products to customers.
When products become commodities and gross profit margins start to decline,
Azlan's declared policy is to move into new areas which offer better
profitability. It is a risky strategy, demanding intense concentration, but
offers better margins than conventional electronics distribution. Last year
the company made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.9m on sales of Pounds 41m.

FT  13 NOV 93 / UK Company News: British Gas restructuring delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS has put off an internal restructuring plan that was due to come
into effect at the end of the month. However, the company said there would
not be a long delay in the plan to split the company's UK business into five
separate divisions.
British Gas unions suggested the company was having difficulty finding
people for the top posts - those appointments were due to be announced by
the end of November. But that was denied by British Gas yesterday.
'We've been working on this since the spring', the company said, 'and there
are a lot of formalities that need to be covered. It has just taken a bit
longer than expected.'
The restructuring involves cutting jobs by 20,000 over three years and the
company says there has been no hold-up to the redundancy programme.
British Gas could be forced to sell off its UK trading business - the part
which markets gas to households and industry - if the government adopts
recommendations made by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in August. The
company said its five new divisions could be dove-tailed to fit with the
MMC's recommendations if they are taken up by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary.
The re-organisation will split the gas sales business into a public supply
division, contract trading which sells gas to industry, installation and
contracting, and appliance retail. The pipeline and storage arm, which
accounts for 85 per cent of the company's assets, will also stand alone.

FT  13 NOV 93 / UK Company News: BVCA issues disclosure guidelines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH Venture Capital Association has issued revised guidelines for
the valuation and disclosure of venture capital portfolios.
The new guidelines are designed to make it more difficult to overvalue
unlisted investments and to encourage greater disclosure.
Mr Iain Tulloch, chairman of the BVCA valuation committee, said application
of the guidelines 'is vital if confidence in venture capital is to grow and
meaningful statistics on the industry are to be produced.'
Valuation of venture capital vehicles has often been highly judgmental,
leading sometimes to one investment being ascribed widely different values
by two investing partners' accounts. In some cases, venture capitalists have
left an investment in their books at an unchanged valuation after it hit
trouble, because in their view the businesses would recover.
The new guidelines, therefore, call for provisions to be made when there has
been a 'diminution in value' - the wording 'permanent diminution' was
previously used.
The BVCA says the adopted principles and procedures should be disclosed. The
venture capitalist is also required to give more information from the annual
accounts of the largest holdings.
They will also have to compare the aggregate of all realisations, including
receiverships, with the aggregate valuation in the investor's last accounts.

FT  13 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Poor ice cream sales check Unilever's rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POOR ICE cream sales in Europe and severe competition in the North American
detergents market held Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products
group, to a 5 per cent rise in third quarter pre-tax profits from Pounds
584m to Pounds 613m.
Almost all of the rise was because of a buoyant performance by operations in
the rest of the world sector - particularly south-east Asia and Latin
America - which increased its operating profits by 20 per cent and sales by
27 per cent.
Operating profits in Europe - the sector which provided more than half of
Unilever's sales - fell slightly from Pounds 401m to Pounds 393m.
The directors said that economic conditions on the continent remained
difficult and that they saw only modest recovery in the UK.
However, they added that there were much clearer signs of improvement in
North America, where there was a small rise in operating profits from Pounds
99m to Pounds 103m.
Sales for the third quarter to September 30 were Pounds 6.64bn (Pounds
6.25bn). For the nine months, pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 1.6bn (Pounds
1.5bn) on sales of Pounds 19.33bn (Pounds 18.19bn).
Earnings per share rose 17 per cent to 21.94p (18.77p) in the quarter and 19
per cent to 58.32p (48.84p) for the nine months.
Mr Michael Perry, joint chairman, blamed the weak results from the Europe
division on poor weather during the peak sales season for ice cream. Sales
for the three months rose slightly to Pounds 3.78bn (Pounds 3.7bn).
He said the professional foods business also continued to experience weak
demand. However, most branded foods performed well, and personal products
made further good progress.
In North America the improvement was because of a strong performance in
personal products, both in the prestige and mass-market categories, the
directors stated.
However, the rest of the world sector again provided Unilever's strongest
growth, extending the trend in the first half. Operating profits rose to
Pounds 146m against Pounds 121m on sales of Pounds 457m (Pounds 360m).
Sales in Japan were growing at an annual rate of more than 20 per cent.
Unilever's overall operating margins slipped to 9.7 per cent (9.9 per cent)
in the quarter. Net debt rose to Pounds 1.5bn compared with Pounds 1.2bn.
The group made 24 acquisitions and 14 disposals during the quarter, at a net
cost of Pounds 450m. The interim dividend is raised to 6.08p (5.2p).

THE BOARD of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television yesterday confirmed that Mr Ward
Thomas is to be group chairman of the ITV company.
Mr Ward Thomas, who helped to found Yorkshire, was appointed acting chairman
on Monday following the resignation of Mr Clive Leach.
Following a board meeting yesterday it was made clear that Mr Thomas will
manage the group, which has announced it will probably incur pre-tax losses
for the year to September 1992-93, with a small committee.
Apart from the chairman the other two members of the committee will be Mr
John Fairley, managing director of Yorkshire Television and Mr John Calvert,
managing director of Tyne Tees.
It is possible that the executive committee could continue to run the group
for some time and it is not certain that a separate chief executive will be
appointed.

FT  13 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Jessups makes sharp upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REG VAUGHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JESSUPS, the Romford, Essex-based motor dealer, yesterday announced a sharp
upturn in pre-tax profits from Pounds 317,000 to Pounds 547,000 for the six
months ended August 31 1993.
This represents the second part of a 16 months accounting period and takes
the profit total for 12 months to Pounds 707,000 compared with Pounds
506,000, on turnover up from Pounds 75.85m to Pounds 92.1m. This compares
with a peak of Pounds 2.8m in 1988-89.
Mr Ron Joseph, managing director, said profit prospects looked pretty good,
but that there was 'really no pattern to the economic pick up.' He thought
there was some pre-budget concern from the public that was holding back car
purchases, but on the whole he was bullish about prospects.
Mr Joseph said that the cost of dealership closures, management changes and
start up costs would probably total between Pounds 300,000 and Pounds
400,000. The group's franchises presently cover Ford, Volvo, Peugeot, Rover,
Nissan and Saab.
The directors said that given the current state of the market, they had
adopted a cautious approach to dividend policy. The second interim dividend
is the same as the first at 1.5p. The total for last year was 4.5p.
After-tax profits come through at Pounds 435,000 (Pounds 474,000) and basic
earnings per share at 0.54p (1.05p) affected by a more normal tax charge for
the year.

FT  13 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Lilliput flotation at 135p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LILLIPUT GROUP, the Cumbria-based manufacturer of hand-painted miniature
china cottages, yesterday finalised its flotation, pricing its ordinary
shares at 135p.
This gives a p/e of 14.5 and a market capitalisation of Pounds 31.4m. The
company is forecasting operating profits of not less than Pounds 3m for the
year ending January 2, and earnings per share of at least 9.3p.
The directors will recommend a final dividend of not less than 0.6p,
equivalent to 4.35p if the shares had been trading a full year. This gives a
notional gross yield of 4 per cent and is 2.1 times covered.
Last year operating profit was Pounds 2.13m on turnover of Pounds 13.6m. For
the six months to July 4 operating profits were Pounds 1.08m on turnover of
Pounds 7.1m.
The company is placing a total of 12.04m ordinary shares with institutional
and other investors, with 4.2m of them subject to a clawback to meet retail
demand through intermediaries.
The flotation will raise Pounds 16.25m for the existing shareholders and
Pounds 2.43m net of expenses for the company, of which Pounds 1.47m will be
used to redeem preference and deferred shares.
After the flotation the existing shareholders will continue to hold 48.3 per
cent of the shares. Of this, the executive directors, their families and
related trusts will have 22.7 per cent. Mr David Tate, the technical
director and founder of the company, will retain 3.83m shares or 16.5 per
cent of the issued capital.
Strong demand is stimulated by the 65,000-strong collectors' club. Cottages
bought for Pounds 10 10 years ago have been known to change hands for Pounds
1,600.
COMMENT
The hand-painted china country cottage industry supplies a niche market if
ever there was one. David Tate's commitment to quality and technical
innovation is in no doubt, and the company is a past master at creating
demand for the expensive, collectable end of its range. However, it is
difficult to believe that competitors will not emerge to exploit what
appears to be a lucrative market. Fashion could also be a factor in the gift
shops, where Lilliput models have to fight for shelf-space with companies
such as Royal Doulton. A p/e of 14.5 looks optimistic, and very little of
the money raised is going back to the company. A limited edition model
cottage might prove a better investment than the shares.

FT  13 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Somic shares surge 23% on recovery
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Somic surged by 23 per cent yesterday as the Preston-based maker
of yarns and woven fabrics reported what Mr Richard Blackburn, the chairman,
described as its 'best figures for 5 years'.
The shares, which touched 88p at one point, finished the day 15p up at 81p
after Somic announced that sales for the half year to September 30 grew by
24 per cent to Pounds 2.24m. This, combined with continuing cost saving
exercises, resulted in a pre-tax profit of Pounds 133,453.
In the same period last year there was a Pounds 10,151 loss, but better
trading conditions helped turn this round to an Pounds 81,249 profit at the
full year.
After a three year absence, the company is restoring the interim dividend
with a payment of 1p - last year's single final was 1.5p. Earnings per share
amounted to 4.47p (0.38p losses).
Mr Blackburn said the improvement in trading conditions had affected most
parts of the business, although there were still some areas yet to benefit.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: A better level of service won the day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BARRY REAMSBOTTOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Re your leading article on the extension of privatisation of central
government work ('Forward to Tory basics', November 8), there is a simple
reason why so many of the market tests were won by in-house teams. It is
because these teams, openly and fairly, bid to do the work cheaper and
offered a better level of service than firms in the private sector.
Unfortunately, it was the minister for public service, William Waldegrave,
who insisted on making - without producing one shred of supporting evidence
 -quite fantastic predictions about the level of savings that would accrue
from market testing.
On the other hand, there is already plenty of evidence to show the folly of
opting for further major privatisation. Water privatisation, for instance,
has brought about as much as an eight-fold increase in prices and led to the
directors of the new companies more than tripling their salaries, as well as
being able to exercise many millions of pounds in share options. Who would
now also deny that the decimation of the British Coal industry is directly
attributable to the way in which the privatised electricity generation
companies no longer need to take account of the long term energy needs of
the country?
The truth of the matter, as most informed commentators realise, is that the
civil service has undergone a whole series of efficiency reviews since 1979,
which have reduced the numbers of staff by some 25 per cent.
Next Steps Executive Agencies, which now employs as many as two-thirds of
all civil servants, must also meet very tough financial and quality targets
which are set for it every year by the government.
Last year, against a background of severe economic recession, these agencies
as a whole met three out of every four of those targets, a record most
private sector companies would dearly love to have.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is a pity that Dieter Helm (Letters, November 4) seeks to polarise
the nuclear review at its outset by branding us 'pro-nuclear' merely because
we mention some of the advantages of nuclear power. He goes on to place
himself firmly in the camp of the market-led 'dash for gas'.
We suspect that readers of the FT will understand the advantages of a
balanced energy supply portfolio in preference to a precarious dependence on
gas-fired stations selected on a single, simplistic, short-term criterion.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Bad move for transport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD P BOTWOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There is speculation that in his November Budget the chancellor may
seek to introduce VAT at some level on public transport fares. We hope this
is false.
Much of public transport is perceived to be expensive at the point of use
and this is a deterrent to its greater use. To make this perception more of
a reality by a directly imposed new tax must be contrary to what we
understand is the government's strategy for relieving congestion on the
roads. It would be a particularly ill-conceived action should any additional
revenue raised from VAT not be 'ring fenced' for the development of improved
public transport services and infrastructure.
The whole subject of taxes on transport coupled with the possibility in
future of road tolls, merits an overall review which this institute will now
be undertaking.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Drama spills off the stage: Threatened cuts in the UK arts
grant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK arts world, always a febrile community, is currently stirring itself
up into a frenzy. Next month the government is expected to cut its annual
grant to the Arts Council, which currently stands at Pounds 225.6m. The
proposed cuts will mean that thousands of arts organisations, from the Royal
Opera House, Covent Garden, to the Dodgy Clutch Theatre Company in Whitley
Bay, in the north-east, will receive less subsidy.
For the more imaginative practitioners in the arts any reduction would
signal the arrival of the fourth horseman of the Apocalypse. The other three
are already in place: the recession has caused a fall in box office income;
arts sponsorship by business has this year suffered its first decline in
decades; and local authorities, which collectively contribute almost as much
as the government to the arts, are being forced by the squeeze on their
funding to reduce their commitment. With an Arts Council cut, all four
sources of revenue for arts companies would be reduced.
A year ago Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, warned the Arts
Council that its 1994-95 budget would be 2 per cent, or Pounds 5m, less than
this year. Now the arts establishment feels that its charmed life may be
over.
Many in the arts assumed that the council would escape the axe. After all,
the total heritage budget, which includes libraries, museums, English
Heritage, as well as sport and tourism, just nudges Pounds 1bn, less than
half of 1 per cent of government expenditure. Also, the arts can argue a
strong financial case for special treatment: it attracts foreign tourists;
it provides creative exports; and it is a generous provider of value-added
tax revenue. In addition, the great national orchestras and theatre, opera,
and dance companies enjoy international acclaim. As Lord Palumbo, chairman
of the Arts Council, said yesterday: 'The arts are quite simply our great
success story. Cutting the arts by 2 per cent will not only yield no
significant saving; it will represent a net cost to the exchequer in lost
tax receipts.'
By the summer, it seemed there would be no way to avoid lower funding.
Indeed Mr Anthony Everitt, secretary-general of the Arts Council, expressed
concern that the council might suffer a Pounds 10m cut. Arts activists began
to lobby. The six leading opera companies produced a document, which was
sent to the prime minister - and opera-loving Mrs Norma Major - detailing
the impact of a 2 per cent reduction. It would mean that English National
Opera might terminate its community programme and commission no new work;
Opera North would cut its 1994-95 programme from 11 operas to nine; the
Royal Opera, Covent Garden, had already dropped a new production of Oberon.
Leading orchestras and theatre companies, such as the Royal Shakespeare
Company, joined in the campaign by alerting audiences to the threat, and
suggesting they protest to their MPs. Every influential trustee and board
member of an arts organisation was asked to put in a word if they came
across a cabinet minister. A rally in London is planned for November 23
involving hundreds of luminaries, including Richard Eyre, director of the
Royal National Theatre, and actors Anthony Sher and Timothy West.
Every effort is being made to convince civil servants and sceptics. 'This is
a real crisis,' says Mr Colin Tweedy, director-general of the Association
for Business Sponsorship of the Arts. 'Our backs are really against the
wall.'
Evidence suggests he is right. All four of the national flagship companies -
the Royal National Theatre, the RSC, the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden
and the English National Opera - are struggling with deficits which
collectively exceed Pounds 7m. Mr Jeremy Isaacs, general-director of Covent
Garden, says: 'I have run this House in the black for the past two years but
in planning next year's budget I'm looking at a shortfall of millions.' He
will be attending the rally on November 23, to point out that 'the cuts are
serious for audiences, for the public, not just for producers and
directors'.
As for the regions, Mr Chris Butcher, of the pressure group National
Campaign for the Arts, says: 'There is hardly a company we question that is
not facing some kind of crisis.' In the past few weeks the Liverpool
Everyman has gone dark; the Lyric Hammersmith has announced it will close in
April if it cannot raise Pounds 350,000 to balance its books; and London
Contemporary Dance Theatre faces a threat of closure.
A fall in box office income has made the outlook worse. Audiences in the
West End have fallen by 1 per cent in the past 12 months, and an increasing
number of seats are sold through special discount offers. The Royal Opera
House and the ENO (which saw its audience slide to 63 per cent of capacity
last season) are both considering marketing initiatives. London's South Bank
Centre is brightening up its repertoire in an effort to stem an audience
decline from 81 per cent to 61 per cent of capacity in the past 20 years.
In addition, arts sponsorship, which grew rapidly to Pounds 64m last year,
has suddenly dipped. Companies are reluctant to be seen supporting arts
events while announcing redundancies. 'If the government cuts back on the
arts, so will business,' says Sir Simon Hornby, chairman of the ABSA. 'There
is this nonsense that the arts are elitist. They are only elitist if they
don't get government support.'
The argument against elitism has been most forcefully put by local
authorities such as Birmingham, Glasgow and Manchester, which have invested
heavily in the arts to raise morale in their communities, and to promote a
better image in their search for business investment. But even they are
being forced to freeze their support. Other cities, such as Bristol and
Liverpool, through indifference or lack of income, are doing little to help
their local theatres and arts centres to survive the current crisis.
The only hope of the cavalry riding to the rescue is the national lottery.
By 1995, the Arts Council will expect to handle an extra Pounds 75m a year
from its slice of the lottery revenue, which in total is estimated at about
Pounds 375m. This is designated to support new buildings - but improving the
back stage at Covent Garden, or the heating system at the National Theatre,
or enlarging a concert hall here and a dance studio there could improve the
financial future of many arts companies, because council grants could be
spent on productions.
In theory, lottery money should not affect the amount the government spends
on the heritage. In practice, the proposed cuts were almost certainly made
with one eye on the lottery receipts. But there must be doubt whether some
worthy arts companies can survive another 18 months of financial penury.

Duke of Cornwall, Duke of Rothsay, Earl of Carrick, Baron Renfrew, Lord of
the Isles, Prince and Great Steward of Scotland and heir apparent to the
British throne is about to step on to a ceremonial conveyor belt. It will be
six, long, hot days before he can step off.
The unscheduled delay at least gives him precious extra minutes to do his
homework before the first of a thousand handshakes.
This week's visit to the Middle East has been intended principally to help
British companies win contracts in the region, though the prince admits, in
characteristically self-deprecating style, that it will be hard to calculate
its impact. With the lights of Riyadh below and one of his protection
officers changing trousers behind a curtain, the prince reflects: 'I just
hope I can be of some value and that the benefits filter down. The trouble
is that my hosts all think I have as much influence at home as their own
royal families.'
Even so, the trip to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Jordan was
designed to make every second pay; if diplomacy was the name, trade was the
game.
The meetings with kings, sheikhs, crown princes, prime ministers and
businessmen was the product of a year's preparation. While the royal party
may ultimately be hostage to the time-keeping of its hosts, it is the job of
the small household team, which last weekend set out with 'the boss' from
RAF Lyneham, to make things run as regally as possible. The spotlight
inevitably falls on Prince Charles, but the success of the show depends
largely on those who remain in the shadows. They are surprisingly young -
not a fogey among them - and show few traces of the pecking order said to
afflict the much larger Buckingham Palace household.
Heading the prince's 12-strong group in the Gulf was Stephen Lamport, the
prince's deputy private secretary, seconded six months ago from the Foreign
Office and recently forced to endure an unwelcome moment of fame as a
witness in the arms-to-Iraq Scott inquiry. During the day he regularly
speaks into the prince's ear, though even over a late-night drink with the
future monarch, his proximity never converts to familiarity.
Alongside him is Commander Robert Fraser, a grammar school-educated naval
barrister who has been equerry to the prince for nearly three years and will
shortly go back to the Navy. The boyish Mr Fraser, dressed in white and
dripping gold braid, is 'Mr Fixit', on hand for as many hours as his boss
needs him.
At home, he might be weeding out some of the 4,000 invitations a year
extended to the prince. If he ever entertained ideas of grandeur, they would
quickly have been crushed under the weight of gifts which the royal visitor
attracts, and which the equerry often has to carry.
The spoils of diplomacy include models of sailing dhows, endless bouquets
and an armoury of ceremonial daggers and swords which the prince confides
should be sufficient to equip his own bodyguard. Gifts, however, are a
two-way business. The princely progress left in its wake paintings, Wedgwood
urns, Cartier boxes and leather-framed photographs.
Neither Detective Inspector Tony Parker nor Detective Inspector Andy
Crichton carries anything but a pistol - discreetly tucked away on the right
hip under a City suit. DI Parker has been watching those watching the prince
for 10 years. DI Crichton has seen eight years' service, and although he has
been to operas and stage shows the world over he has never seen any of them.
The only worrying moment this week came when an unpublicised death threat
was made against the prince during a visit to the edge of Abu Dhabi's
desert, the 'empty quarter'. Hundreds of soldiers hid among the mountainous
sand dunes to scour for assassins.
The two men ease off only when the prince is safely in the inner sanctum,
chatting on an immense sofa under one-ton chandeliers with King Fahd of
Saudi Arabia, in a gold-embossed hall of mirrors with the Emir of Kuwait or
amid a forest of flowers with the ruler of Abu Dhabi, where they argue the
merits of a good compost.
Surgeon Commander Robin Clark is a royal physician on a two-man rota
attached to the prince. In one hand he carries a black case containing basic
medical supplies, and in the other a heavy metal box holding trauma
equipment. Never far away is the refrigerated blood bank; the unthinkable
has been thought of.
Always present is Allan Percival, recruited recently from the Northern
Ireland Office to be the prince's press secretary. His task is to 'sell' the
prince's visit in the face of other royal story distractions back home.
Formerly with the Ministry of Defence, he is an experienced press officer
and will play a big role in explaining the prince's future agenda.
Other members of the entourage have no public face but they are no less
important to the organisation and smooth-running of the trip. Mary Ann
Malleret and Elspeth Walker, the two secretaries, work late while Michael
Fawcett, the prince's young valet, works sporadically. The quintessential
picture of sartorial elegance, he sets out the prince's clothes and runs his
bath. He starts work when his employer switches off for the day.
Ron Lewis, the Welsh, white-haired travelling yeoman, first worked for the
Duke of Edinburgh until, more than 30 years ago, his son was big enough to
have his own baggage. The luggage gets heavier as the paraphernalia grows en
route.
For his added comfort, the prince takes with him Bernie Flannery, his butler
for more than three years. A chirpy young man, he helps 'the boss' start the
day and can influence his mood, especially if he gets something wrong.
Wherever he is, the prince appreciates familiar objects - like the drinks
tray - in their usual places. Bernie, who worked for eight years on HM Yacht
Britannia, has developed an eagle eye.
When the prince goes aboard Britannia - last week in Damman and later Abu
Dhabi - another support team goes into action. The atmosphere is more
formal, the hierarchy unbending.
His Royal Highness is met by Rear Admiral Bob Woodward, the ruddy-faced
ex-Buccaneer pilot who captains the 40-year-old vessel. Britannia's
glistening engine room, like something out of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,
steamed flat out for eight days to be on time for the prince after
salmonella poisoning struck down some of the crew in Cyprus, where they were
stationed during the Commonwealth heads of government conference. The
admiral was close to being late for the first time in his career.
In the cramped, hot kitchens Carolyn Robb and Chris Barber, two chefs flown
in from St James's Palace, fought for space to help provide food for two
on-board dinners and an entourage already suffering from banquet fatigue.
On Thursday night, from the same kitchen, came a premature birthday cake for
the prince, who is 45 tomorrow and who is returning home today to be on duty
at London's Cenotaph for Remembrance Sunday. As the birthday boy blew out a
single candle, one of his team whispered: 'He's spent every year of his life
getting ready for the job. No Prince of Wales has been better prepared.'
While the informal celebrations were under way, on the other side of the
world, four members of his household were working hard in Australia. Their
mission, to get ready for January, when the prince's royal caravan gets back
on the road.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Team spirit hit for six: Japanese loyalties are breaking
down as 'free agents' are on the rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Hiromi Makihara is typical of the old-style baseball heroes fondly
portrayed in the Japanese versions of British boys' own adventure tales.
A pitcher (bowler) for the Yomiuri Giants, the country's most popular team,
Mr Makihara is determinedly stoical on the playing field and, in moments of
great tension or supreme elation, betrays no more than a raised eyebrow or a
curling lip that could be the beginning of a smile.
Twelve years on the team and apparently a Giant for life, Mr Makihara threw
his best curve ball this week, tempting baseball and social commentators to
take a big swing at an explanation.
He has become a 'free agent', and wants to join another team where he will
be properly appreciated. In other words, he is prepared to trade in his
black Giants' cap for more money. His new salary is undecided but is
expected to be more than Y100m (Pounds 635,000).
While Japanese boys are regaled by traditional tales of sci-fi fantasy and
adventure, the stories are really more about loyalty, and are a form of
preparation for the corporate loyalty of adult life.
In his own way, Mr Makihara was wearing the blue suit of a salaryman on that
pitcher's mound, and his unshake-able loyalty was that of the middle-manager
from Mitsubishi or the bulldozer salesman from Komatsu. The defection of Mr
Makihara and a few other baseball stars through the newly introduced free
agent system has prompted the general conclusion in the media that Japan is
becoming a 'free agent' society.
Politicians have been leaving the Liberal Democratic party, the
parliamentary version of the Giants, to create new parties, while workers
are said to be job swapping, and shoppers forsaking their brand loyalty.
These sudden changes of uniform have left the Japanese doubting the
durability of loyalty at a time when leading companies are calculating
whether they can afford to make a lifetime commitment to their workers.
Nippon Steel, which sets industry trends, is planning to halve its graduate
intake and maintain a smaller core of lifetime employees, hiring and firing
the remainder when necessary.
Workers are interested in job flexibility, but the economic downturn has
made them wary of a flexibility that may mean unemployment. The Shukan
Gendai, a magazine popular among commuters, has a cover story this week
describing 'The salaryman's great depression', and promising to provide
answers on 'all those issues which cause unease', including life after
sacking and borrowing money to supplement shrinking bonus payments.
A senior executive at a Japanese bank explained that his institution had
lost employees to high-paying foreign banks in Tokyo, but 'the scalping
problem is not so serious now', as staff want the security of lifetime
employment which non-Japanese institutions do not offer. Salaried workers,
surveyed by Meiji Mutual Life Insurance last month, are putting less
emphasis on pay and more on the quality of working life. Only 17.1 per cent
sought more money, while 44.5 per cent wanted stimulating work.
This comes at a time when Japanese consumers have become more discerning
about price, and want better value for money, regardless of old loyalties to
prestige brands.
In Tokyo, a government-backed 'individuals' import centre', which was opened
in 1987, enables consumers to flick through some 1,500 catalogues and order
German ski wax or buy Japanese-made industrial equipment from a US company,
cutting out a few layers of middle-men.
'Last October, we had about 50 people a day, but now we are getting 200 or
300 people,' says Mr Tadamichi Shiramatsu, a manager. 'In the past, people
were interested in importing luxury goods. They don't care so much about
brands now, and are looking for something different for their home. Japanese
are relatively rich, but they want to spend money wisely.'
However, sales figures suggest prestige brands still have weight, as long as
they come with quality, and a person's self-perceived place in a group is
still central to Japanese identity, whether the group be a university
old-boy network or the supporters' club of the Yomiuri Giants. But Mr
Hiroshi Minami, director of the Japan Psychology Centre, suggests that the
governing creed in Japan is gradually shifting from the collective to the
self-centred.
'At the root of this shift is technical skill. If people have confidence in
their skills, they can move to wherever the skill is appreciated,' Mr Minami
said, though he cautions that this applies to elites such as the
entertainments industry, and not yet to the factory floor.
'This phenomenon is spreading among the people in society who are regarded
as talented. But if you look at the supporters, you still find that there is
strong sense of the collective.'
Now free agents have an important new role model: Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the
prime minister, formerly an outfielder for the LDP, who leads the Japan New
party.
He is strong on technical skill and, at last count, had a 70 per cent
approval rating, higher than any other administration since 1946.
When Mr Hosokawa's patchwork coalition inevitably falls apart under the
weight of its differing views, ranging from the religious right to the
socialist left, he will have a chance to test the market for political free
agents.
Given his good record as prime minister, he could cobble together another
multi-coloured coalition, knowing that if Makihara can leave the Giants,
voters might find it acceptable for Hosokawa to play wherever he likes in
politics.

Sir, In your leader, 'Europe by any other name' (November 11), you indicate
that the question of what the new institutions for Europe should be called
is a 'small matter', even 'legalistic'. You grandly decide to cut through
the Gordian Knot and ignore the legal framework, not to mention the European
Community, and (no doubt to the delight of the federalists and
Euro-propagandists) opt to adopt the expression 'European Union' as the
institutional nomenclature for Europe.
Repeatedly we were told in the House of Commons this past year that the EC
and the EU are entirely distinct and that the great victory for the
government at Maastricht was that we had negotiated the inter-government
pillars of the EU. Euro-realists were vilified for daring to suggest that
this was a Pyrrhic victory. Your leader has proved our point.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Man in the News: Wooden-top carving a role - Al Gore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton White House has been so much on the defensive, both at home and
abroad, that any small victory offers a welcome psychological lift.
It was understandable, then, that vice-president Al Gore's apparent defeat
of a shifty and ill-tempered Mr Ross Perot in this week's televised debate
about the North American Free Trade Agreement should have 'elated' President
Bill Clinton and put a new spring in the step of many of his staff.
The role is a traditional one for vice-presidents and would-be
vice-presidents during an election campaign: take the battle to the enemy
with the slogans and personal assaults that might sound unpresidential from
the top of the ticket.
On policy questions such as Nafta this attack-dog role is less usual, yet by
most measures Mr Gore appears to have carried it out effectively.
Opinion polls conducted for the CNN network and USA Today newspaper
immediately after the debate showed that Mr Gore had enhanced his approval
rating to 72 per cent, compared with 57 per cent before.
Perhaps more remarkably, Mr Gore may even have improved Nafta's chances of
passing its crucial test on Wednesday in the House of Representatives. The
same poll showed that 57 per cent of those questioned favoured the trade
pact after the debate, compared with only 34 per cent before.
For Mr Gore, the surge is the latest climb in a roller-coaster ride up and
down the public opinion polls. Since his entry into Congress in 1977, the
public perception of the Tennessee politician has oscillated between
'wooden-top (policy) wonk' with a future on the fringes, and cerebral
heavyweight bound for the very top.
It is true that Mr Gore speaks slowly in public, and moves his robust body
with the grace of a marionette. Yet the 'wooden' label that he acquired
during his failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 has
stuck to him with more tenacity than may be warranted.
Friends describe him as a dryly humorous prankster with an uncanny knack for
balancing a broomstick on his nose. And it is Mr Gore himself who most often
tells the joke: how do you tell Al Gore from a roomful of Secret Service
agents? Answer: he's the stiff one.
As a campaigner in 1988 and again in 1992, the occasional wooden speeches
alternated with stirring, often effective, sometimes even emotional
harangues. And in the campaign debates, he was always an accomplished
performer.
This week, the perception of woodenness served him well, by ensuring that he
needed to do no more than hold his own against the sharp-tongued Mr Perot to
be declared the winner. His performance was not flawless - the main lapse in
preparation was his inability to respond with details when Mr Perot falsely
denied his charges of hiring lobbyists - but it did the trick.
It is not just the perceptions of Mr Gore's personality that have
oscillated. The assessments of his clout as vice-president have also
fluctuated.
Newspaper reports either portray him as a deputy president with real weight
in the Clinton administration, or as an ambitious man champing furiously at
the limitations of his job, which has always been largely ceremonial.
There is not much that Mr Gore can do about this. John Adams, the first man
to hold the job, described the vice-presidency as 'the most insignificant
office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination
conceived'.
The one real power the vice-president holds is the casting vote in the event
of a tie in the Senate. Mr Gore is unlikely to match the record 29 such
votes cast by John Adams, but already has two important tie-breakers under
his belt from this year's budget battle.
Mr Gore likes the description of the job made by Thomas Marshall,
vice-president under President Woodrow Wilson: 'He cannot speak, he cannot
move. He suffers no pain. He is perfectly conscious of all that goes on, but
he has no part in it.'
But the vice-president is no cipher and is better positioned to play a
significant role in the administration than those of his predecessors who
were picked to balance the ticket ideologically.
As centrist southerners just two years apart in age, Mr Gore and Mr Clinton
operate on the same wavelength on many issues. During last year's campaign,
Mr Clinton sometimes stole lines from his running mate's speeches, and he
still sends drafts of many of his speeches to the vice-president for advice.
Mr Gore has clearly carved himself a role in some specific areas, notably
technology, including the space programme, and the environment. He has also
taken on the task of 'reinventing government' through simpler management and
deregulation.
These specialities closely parallel those of Mr Dan Quayle in the last
administration. Mr Gore, however, has avoided taking on institutional
responsibilities in the way that Mr Quayle did through his chairmanship of
the National Space Council and of the Council on Competitiveness.
But he has placed allies in key positions in the agencies overseeing these
areas: Ms Carol Browner as head of the Environmental Protection Agency and
Mr Jack Gibbons as the president's science adviser.
Possibly of greater significance for the Clinton presidency, Mr Gore is
credited by some in the administration with instilling in the president a
sense of discipline.
Here again Mr Gore's influence is cemented by the appointment of his allies
in the White House power structure, notably Mr Roy Neel, his own chief of
staff, who took over as deputy White House chief of staff this summer.
In the longer perspective Mr Gore's victory over Mr Perot may prove
ephemeral. He may have helped Nafta's prospect marginally but he has no
casting vote in the House of Representatives. It is in that chamber that the
Nafta will live or die.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Flash cash isn't all that glitters: As champagne corks start
popping in the City again, can industry compete in the career stakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the City of London's champagne bars, teeming again after three bleak
years, dealers and financiers are regaling each other with stories of their
fabulous earnings.
Here is one: 'A foreign exchange trader (at a Swiss bank based in London)
was paid such a big bonus, well over Pounds 1m, that the computer which the
firm uses to calculate bonuses could not cope - once the number reached
seven digits, the computer aborted the program.'
Then there is the spend-spend-spend version: 'The boys were paid such big
bonuses that they popped out of an afternoon (sic) to buy their girlfriends
new cars.'
Conspicuous consumption is back in the Square Mile, as the profits of
stockbrokers and securities firms soar. Trading volumes in the stock market
have risen; there has been a glut of securities issues and new businesses
have sprung up to deal in the complicated financial products known as
derivatives.
Last week SG Warburg, a leading UK investment bank, reported that its
profits for the first half of the current financial year had almost trebled
to Pounds 149m. A few days earlier, it had been reported that Mr Kaveh
Alamouti, a dealer in London for Japan's Tokai Bank, had earned Pounds 9m
last year.
There are very few City earners in Mr Alamouti's league. But many of his
colleagues and competitors are expecting substantial Christmas bonuses.
'There are more than 100 people in our London office who will get a bonus
exceeding Dollars 100,000,' said a 32-year-old executive at a US investment
bank.
As these City tyros toast their good fortune, there is a less celebratory
mood in British industry. When glasses are raised in a manufacturing
company's boardroom, it is often to salute senior managers, with 20 or 30
years service, taking early retirement as part of cost-saving programmes.
In many parts of industry, the end of the recession is barely noticeable -
belts are still being tightened. Though profits of many big companies, such
as Imperial Chemical Industries, are recovering, they remain well below
their peak.
Given the stark contrast between the fortunes of the City and industry, what
do the graduates who entered the job market between 1980 and 1987 think
about their career choices and prospects? Has going into the City lived up
to its glittering promise? Or do young industrial managers derive sufficient
satisfaction from their jobs to compensate for their lower earnings?
Collecting responses from the City, which is thronging with young men and
women in their late 20s and early 30s doing interesting, highly paid and
responsible jobs, was easy. However, thirtysomethings in charge of
production or sales divisions at manufacturing companies were more elusive.
Several avenues proved dead-ends: a couple of business consultancies failed
to suggest manufacturers with suitable interviewees; the chairman of a
leading manufacturer said he would scour his myriad subsidiaries for a
bright young industrialist but his office later left a message that 'we have
plenty of people who are between 37-45 but no one in the age group you
want'; Imperial Chemical Industries imaginatively put forward an
untraditional subject - a woman manager, Ms Ginny East, from Kingston
Polytechnic.
But Ms East turned out to be an accountant, who has always worked on the
financial side of ICI and is currently in investor relations - in other
words, she is doing what is effectively a City job.
So where are all the young industrialists? A whole generation appears to be
under-represented in British industry. Statistics provided by Mr Michel
Ozaria, the French director of the London Business School's Career
Management Centre, indicate what happened. Almost half of the LBS's business
graduates in 1985 went into financial services and only 11 per cent into
manufacturing industry.
A 32-year-old investment banker, expecting a Pounds 300,000 bonus this year,
says: 'I don't know anyone who had a good degree from a good university in
the 1980s who went into industry, because the opportunities were not there.'
In part, he is referring to the substantial sums which can be earned in the
City. Mr Ozaria says the average starting salary, ignoring bonuses, for a
1985 MBA graduate was Pounds 27,500 in the City, compared with under Pounds
21,000 in manufacturing.
He is also referring to promotion prospects. ICI says its graduate intake in
1979 is only now being promoted to relatively senior production or marketing
roles. The Institution of Mechanical Engineers says that out of 2,194
members in senior management jobs, only 55 are aged 28 to 34.
But industry does provide compensations apart from money for the rare
individuals who are promoted young. Three who have climbed the corporate
ladder quickly are: Mr David Lewis, a 28-year-old company operations manager
with Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate; Mr Alan Rosling, currently with
the Downing Street policy unit which advises John Major, who at 31 has
already been chief executive of a lingerie business for Courtaulds Textiles
and is about to become marketing and planning director of United Distillers;
and a former stockbroker, who asked to remain anonymous, now running a
medium-size manufacturer of consumer goods.
All are enthusiastic about their careers and believe that 'making things'
provides satisfaction difficult to obtain in the City. Only the former
stockbroker shows any bitterness about City extravagance. He says: 'When we
go into the wood-panelled gents at our financial advisers, we always say
that if anyone offered us an office decorated quite as opulently we would
move in tomorrow.'
Mr Lewis has not had the time to ponder City lifestyles. Unilever has pushed
him hard, giving him six different jobs since he joined its graduate
training scheme in 1987 from Trent Polytechnic. He now has 33 people
reporting to him and is in charge of co-ordinating the marketing plans for
the detergents produced by Unilever's Lever Europe subsidiary. Though
department managers at Lever Brothers earn about Pounds 30,000 a year,
excluding London weighting, Mr Lewis shows no trace of regret at having
turned his back on the far higher salaries available in City firms.
Though the financial service industry has been a powerful magnet for talent,
industry's attempts to counter the attraction appear half-hearted. After Mr
Rosling graduated from Harvard Business School in 1988, he did not find
British industry rolling out the red carpet: 'I had written to 50 of the
leading companies in the country when I came out of business school. Most
did not reply, most were not interested in someone of my background.'
Eventually Mr Martin Taylor, recently appointed chief executive of Barclays
and then in charge of Courtaulds Textiles, took him on with the promise:
'I'll either give you a management role in a year or sack you.' Within a few
months, Mr Rosling was sent to Bristol to run Piersons, which makes Marks
and Spencer's lingerie.
However, Unilever and Courtaulds are unusual in giving considerable
responsibility to younger executives. 'Promotion in industry comes with
age,' says Mr Paul Compton, a stockbroker who began his career with the
engineering firm AE. 'Even Leonardo would have found it difficult to get a
decent job with a British manufacturer until he was 30.'
After Cambridge, where he was sponsored in his engineering degree by AE, Mr
Compton spent a year as an assistant to its manufacturing director, but
decided to quit when told that his next job was 'effectively as a foreman
producing a particular type of piston in a factory employing 200 people'.
He says: 'Going to a piston factory in the north feels like going to do
national service.' He would have been away from his Cambridge friends and
contemporaries for several years and the prospect of a senior management job
was remote.
So in 1986, Mr Compton sent applications to several City firms. At 30, he is
now an analyst of engineering companies for the stockbroker, Credit Lyonnais
Securities, and talks frequently to Mr Colin Hope, chairman of T&amp;N, which
bought AE. 'When I was at AE, I met the head once and was told about it
three months in advance.'
Rubbing shoulders with those at the top is fairly commonplace in the City.
In general, firms are prepared to give considerable status and power to
young people.
'I chose financial services because I wanted to work for an international
business and one which presented greater challenges,' says Mr Martin
Fraenkel, a 33-year-old vice-president of Chase Manhattan, the US bank, who
is in charge of bullion trading and the fashionable business of constructing
complicated deals involving commodities and derivatives. 'Apart from the
financial inducements, there was also the opportunity to acquire more
responsibility earlier than in manufacturing.'
A graduate of Oxford University, Johns Hopkins in the US and the business
school, Insead, in France, he says: 'I have never actively talked to a
manufacturing company about employment.'
While Chase offers a diverse career because of its size and geographical
spread, many City firms do not. Nor do most most of them offer much scope to
manage people. Such opportunities are limited because of the flat management
structures of most financial institutions.
This can be a disadvantage for some. Though Mr Compton loves his job, he
says it has not changed very much for years. Others who joined the City
during the mid-1980s boom are more despondent. 'Of course I earn far more
than I could in industry,' says one broker. 'But I am bored out of my
skull.'
Some of the 1980s graduates have risen through the City as far as they can.
There are simply not enough senior jobs to go round. Now, manufacturing may
be able to woo them if it has the confidence to give them top jobs. Industry
has one significant advantage over the City, for all its handicaps - it can
offer a long and varied management career.
So although the champagne corks are popping again in the Square Mile, the
less flamboyant lifestyle of an industrial manager no longer seems so
unattractive for an increasing number of City executives. They want more
from life than chasing big deals and an end-of-year bonus, however fat.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Trade hitch for markets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TO MOST investors, whether in the United States, Britain or elsewhere, next
week's vote in the US House of Representatives on the North American Free
Trade Agreement (Nafta) seems a rather remote affair. The possibility of an
adverse outcome is not being allowed for in a market whose chief worry is
still that the low point in the US interest rate cycle may have been
reached. Certainly, in itself, the success or failure of this regional trade
deal cannot have more than a marginal impact on global investment returns.
Yet if Nafta were lost, it could prove to be an important turning point for
the markets.
The present high level of both bond and equity prices around the world owes
as much to perceptions about longer term changes in economic structure as to
short term views about the state of the economic cycle. While valuations
have come to look more and more speculative by historic standards, they have
derived increasing support from the belief that the forces of disinflation
will prove to be much stronger than expected; and that a global economic
upturn will receive an unprecedented demand boost in the second half of the
1990s as three to four billion people in the newly industrialising countries
are absorbed into the global economy.
There is little doubt that the economies of Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin
America will provide an increasingly buoyant market for the developed
world's capital goods and will contribute to higher living standards in the
West by exporting low cost consumer goods.
As a highly competitive source of supply they will also act as a powerful
restraining influence on prices in the tradeable goods sectors of the OECD
economies. The outcome of this disinflationary growth should be an increase
in global living standards that would have much in common with the period of
growth and falling prices in the late 19th century.
Sheltered
Yet this benign scenario is substantially predicated on continuing trade
liberalisation, without which the newly industrialising countries will be
constrained in their ability to pursue the kind of export-led growth
hitherto enjoyed by the dragon economies of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and
South Korea. And since trade is a positive sum game, it is not just the
developing countries that stand to lose if the climate is more restrictive.
Protectionism would ensure that producers in the low growth economies of the
developed world would be sheltered from competition. Downward pressure on
prices would thus slacken. Efficiency would suffer. If Nafta fails next
week, the immediate impact will be felt in emerging markets where much of
the froth in the global bull market has lately been concentrated.
The fall-out would be particularly heavy in Mexico, which last year
attracted nearly Dollars 9bn of equity capital from the US - not much less
than the sum US investors pumped into the world's second largest equity
market in Japan. But there would be wider ramifications, not least because
of the threat to the Uruguay round for which the deadline has been set at
December 15.
The Clinton administration's position would be weakened; and that weakness
would coincide with continuing uncertainty about the position of the French
government, whose readiness to give in to populist pressure over the Air
France strike might be replicated in its dealings with the French farmers
over the Gatt.
Balance
Equity markets would suffer from the initial blow to business confidence.
And a rise in global bond yields, as the disinflation story confronted a
setback, would inevitably rub off on equity prices too. A more protectionist
trade climate would be most unlikely to put an end to economic growth. It
would merely be a dampener. But coming after a long period of very full
stock market valuations, a change in trade policy would have
disproportionate psychological importance.
For the best part of 15 years the world has been in the grip of a powerful
tendency towards globalisation and liberalisation. The balance of power in
economic matters has shifted away from governments towards markets. The
result has been a much faster pace of change, with considerable strains
being felt in the labour markets of many OECD countries.
Defeat for Nafta might be taken in the markets to imply that this beneficial
shock to the supply side of the world economy was coming to an end and that
politicians were successfully reasserting control over markets in response
to the clamour from those who have found the pace of change too painful. The
symbolism would be powerful. That is not to say that it will happen; and
since a shift towards protectionism would ultimately be bad for everyone's
living standards, it should not be allowed to happen. The victory of US
vice-president Al Gore over the maverick protectionist billionaire Ross
Perot in this week's television debate offers modest grounds for hope. Next
Wednesday's vote is certainly no mere technical matter. It should be watched
with some trepidation.

FT  13 NOV 93 / System for credit scoring opened up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEOPLE REFUSED credit will be told more about the reasons under guidance
about the use of 'credit scoring' published by the credit industry
yesterday.
The guide to credit scoring - the method of deciding whether to give
consumer credit on the basis of points for characteristics such as age and
employment - has been revised for the first time since it was issued 10
years ago.
The guide sets out procedures, techniques and arrangements for checking
scoring systems. Its coverage has widened to include the banks, building
societies, mail-order traders and other retail credit providers such as
shops that issue in-store cards.
In future people whose application for credit has been 'credit scored' and
refused will have a right to be told that this method of assessment has been
used, and be given the main reason for the decision.
This might be that they had failed to acquire enough points on the credit
scoring, that the rejection was based on credit agency information, or that
they fell outside the policies of the organisation offering credit - for
example, of lending only to homeowners or to people in a particular age
range.
The credit industry has resisted suggestions that potential borrowers who
are rejected should be given more detailed information - it is worried about
the risk that this knowledge could be used to manipulate further
applications by omitting or changing the damaging information.
In a report on credit scoring from the Office of Fair Trading last year Sir
Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, highlighted the importance
of providing more information to customers as a way of increasing confidence
in the system.
He accepted the case for not having detailed guidance about the factors used
in scoring, but hoped to see emphasis placed on personal information about
potential borrowers rather than on more non-personal data such as where
people live.
The OFT is to update its leaflet for the public 'No Credit?'.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Names step up pressure for out-of-court payment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ERRORS AND omissions insurers must pay at least Pounds 900m if an
out-of-court settlement to legal disputes at the Lloyd's insurance market is
to be acceptable to loss-making Names, leaders of the loss makers said
yesterday.
The insurers, many of which are Lloyd's syndicates, cover agents against
legal awards for negligence. Lloyd's has identified contributions from them
as a source of funding for any deal with the loss-makers. Lloyd's is also
trying to persuade agents, brokers and accountants to make donations and is
prepared to contribute from its central fund towards a settlement. It hopes
to offer details of a deal to Names by early December.
The Lloyd's Names Associations' Working Party, which links 37 groups of
loss-making Names that are claiming up to Pounds 3.5bn in compensation, said
yesterday it believed the exposure of the insurers to the Names' claims
could be 'as high as Pounds 1.5bn'. The working party described as
'derisory' a possible offer of Pounds 300m said to be under consideration by
errors and omissions underwriters.
'We are doubtful a total offer will make sense if the E&amp;O contribution is
anything under Pounds 900m,' said Mr Christopher Stockwell, chairman of the
working party.
Separately, Lloyd's said it would 'vigorously defend' a writ served earlier
this week by a Name alleging criminal and civil fraud, false accounting and
negligence. The writ seeks to cancel any contract with Lloyd's from November
1981.

TWO businessmen who ran Therm-A-Stor, a double-glazing company, were both
cleared of fraudulent trading charges after the Serious Fraud Office dropped
its prosecution more than six weeks into the trial. It had alleged at
Birmingham Crown Court that Mr John Morris, the company's founder, and Mr
Anthony Bonnar, managing director, had defrauded customers and suppliers of
more than Pounds 12m.
The SFO said the trial had been abandoned after the emergence of unforeseen

THE government yesterday outlined restrictions on where and how tickets for
the national lottery can be sold, Raymond Snoddy writes.
Mr Peter Brooke, National Heritage secretary, said he planned to issue draft
directives preventing the rolling-over of prizes that have not been won for
more than three consecutive games.
Mr Brooke made clear he does not want to see games or machines, including
video machines, which encourage excessive playing; games which would
encourage under-age playing or excessively priced tickets.
Mr Brooke also said tickets should not be sold by or to those under 16 or
sold in the street - apart from kiosks - or in betting shops, at horse or
dog-racing tracks, in bingo or gaming clubs or even commercially in homes.
The lottery's operator should be chosen by next spring.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Planned A-level grade attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW top grade will be created for the highest achievers in A-level exams
under proposals announced last night by Mr John Patten, the education
secretary.
The move is part of a package of reforms to the exams, which form the basis
of the university admissions procedure.
The changes brought a negative reaction from teachers and from university
admissions tutors.
Mr Patten said the new 'A-starred' grade was needed 'to reward exceptional
ability among the growing number of candidates now obtaining A grades'.
Below the new grade there would still be five grades of pass, ranking from A
to E.
The Committee of Vice- Chancellors and Principals, which represents
universities, said there was no evidence that the new grade would help
admissions tutors, and that the move was 'somewhat depressing because it
provides another way to reject a candidate'.
The universities added: 'What is needed is candidates for university
education with a broad education.'
The National Association of Head Teachers accused Mr Patten of 'tinkering
unhelpfully with a system he appears not to understand'.
The committee welcomed, however, Mr Patten's proposal to ask the Schools
Curriculum and Assessment Authority, the quango that controls exams, to
encourage greater take-up of Advanced Supplementary (or AS) levels.
Each AS-level is intended to be at the same level of difficulty as an
A-level, but requiring only half as much work. The intention is that
candidates specialising heavily in one group of subjects can maintain some
breadth by taking an AS-level in a different subject.
Take-up of AS-levels has been disappointing, mainly because many schools
believe that in most subjects they are too difficult and worth rather more
than half an A-level. Some headmasters complain of timetabling difficulties.
Mr Patten also called for the authority to implement a common code of
practice for A-levels to ensure greater consistency between exam boards  -
particularly in spelling, punctuation and grammar.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Receivers hold out hope for Swans: The future of the yard as
a further 510 job losses were announced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWAN HUNTER, the Tyneside shipbuilder, is to shed a further 510 jobs because
work on the Type 23 frigate HMS Westminster will be completed this weekend,
receivers Price Waterhouse said yesterday.
The new round of cuts, which will reduce the company's workforce to 1,040,
brings to 1,400 the number of jobs lost since the receivers were called in
six months ago today.
Union leaders and local Labour MPs said the redundancies were another
devastating blow, particularly for riverside areas of Tyneside where male
unemployment is more than 40 per cent.
Swans' only substantial remaining work is to complete sister frigates
Northumberland and Richmond, due for delivery in May and November 1994.
But union leaders said they had not given up hope that a buyer would emerge
for the company. 'There's still hope for Swan Hunter, we aren't dead yet,'
said Mr Tommy Brennan, Tyne chairman of the Confederation of Shipbuilding
and Engineering Unions.
The receivers, who are talking to four parties interested in acquiring Swans
for shipbuilding, said they remained determined to retain the 'golden
nugget' of skilled employees, in the hope the company can be sold as a going
concern.
Mr Gordon Horsfield, one of the receivers, disclosed yesterday that two of
the potential bidders were interested primarily in warship building. The
others would also wish to build merchant vessels. The four include foreign
companies.
The receivers have also approached companies potentially interested in Swans
to see whether they would consider forming a consortium.
He said the potential buyers, none of which had submitted a concrete bid,
were waiting to see what the November 30 Budget said on defence spending.
They were also interested in whether Swans would be granted eligibility for
European Union intervention funding, which would provide a 9 per cent
subsidy for merchant orders. The receivers expect an answer within five
weeks.
Swan Hunter went into receivership on May 13, two days after it lost the
fight for a Navy helicopter carrier to rival VSEL, based Barrow-in-Furness,
Cumbria.
Mr Mark Homan, Price Waterhouse's UK corporate recovery partner, Mr
Horsfield, responsible for corporate recovery practice in the UK regions and
Mr Ed James, Newcastle-based corporate recovery partner, the receivers, were
appointed by Lloyds Bank. At the time the company had net debts of Pounds
40m, of which Pounds 12.1m was owed to Lloyds.
The receivership, one of the biggest in Britain this year, has involved
about 40 Price Waterhouse staff, including eight full-time at Swans. The
firm has spent about 10,000 hours on Swans and its bill has exceeded Pounds
800,000.
Shipbuilding has made a powerful impression on some of the team. 'One or two
of our managers have got so enthused they'd be happy to stay there for
ever,' said Mr Horsfield. 'One of the team's gone native - he wears a hard
hat a lot,' said Mr James.
Worldwide advertising of the yard brought 76 inquiries, whittled down by the
receivers to 22 involving shipbuilding. These were reduced to a hard core
with track records which would reassure the Ministry of Defence and other
potential Swans customers. 'They don't want accidents like this to happen
again,' said Mr Horsfield.
Because of the receivership, the yard has found it difficult to win
substantial work, apart from the MoD's agreement to let Swans complete the
three frigates.
Unusually, the receivers tried to form a stand-alone vehicle, Swan Hunter
Neptune, involving local authorities and the Department of Trade and
Industry, to carry out the Omani patrol boats order that Swans was near to
clinching in May. This proved impossible because of the long-term commitment
required.
Without selling any shipbuilding assets, the receivers have raised Pounds
7m, mainly by claiming shipbuilders relief from Customs and Excise and
chasing trade debtors. Some of this money has provided working capital and
some has gone to Lloyds Bank.
In spite of the bruising job losses the receivers have maintained good
relationships with Swans unions, who share the objective of finding a buyer
for the company. Mr Horsfield said they were the most commercially astute
trade unionists he had come across.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Major aims to boost 'back to basics' campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, will give fresh impetus to his 'back to
basics' campaign next week in a speech linking traditional social standards
with economic success.
His determination to raise the profile of the campaign emerged after a
series of meetings on law and order in London yesterday. The prime minister
told community leaders in Ealing, west London, that he shared the widespread
frustration about rising crime. He urged people to give more help to police
efforts to catch criminals.
He said: 'We need to encourage a greater sense of responsibility and a sense
of self-discipline if we are to get down to tackling the roots of crime.'
The main impetus of Mr Major's drive will come on Monday, when he plans to
use his annual speech to the Lord Mayor's banquet in the City of London to
stress that the initiative is 'more than an exercise in nostalgia'.
His central theme will be that voters strongly support the government's
plans for a return to traditional values in areas such as law and order. He
will argue that the campaign, launched at last month's Conservative party
conference in Blackpool, is an integral part of the government's economic
strategy.
Mr Major will argue, for example, that traditional values in education can
play an increasingly important role in improving the skills base and
competitiveness of industry.
He will also link the campaign firmly to traditional rightwing economic
values such as support for sound public finances and low inflation.
Mr Major has told friends: 'The way to make Britain great again in the
future is by getting these things right now.'
The government's commitment to the campaign was further underlined last
night by a series of speeches by senior ministers stressing their belief in
traditional values.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, told the Conservative Group for Europe
that 'the prime minister's back to basics message applies just as much to
economics as it does to law and order and education'.
The message was rammed home by several other leading Conservatives,
including Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman; Mr John Redwood, the Welsh
secretary; Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, and Mr John Patten,
the education secretary.
Labour launched a counter-attack, suggesting that the stress on traditional
values may move to the centre of debate when the parliamentary session
starts next week.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Levitt 'tried to blame others'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROGER LEVITT, former chairman of the collapsed financial services group,
tried to blame others for the fraudulent activities of his company, it was
alleged at the Old Bailey yesterday.
Mr David Cocks QC, prosecuting, said that when first interviewed by police
Mr Levitt told them that everything had been done 'behind his back'.
Mr Cocks said that during these interviews Mr Levitt seemed to be placing
blame on everyone's shoulders except his own.
This was completely untrue, he said, since Mr Levitt was at the heart of the
fraud which involved illegally injecting Pounds 21m into the ailing company,
forging bogus invoices to cover these funds and misleading Fimbra, the
self-regulatory organisation for independent financial advisers, about the
state of the Levitt Group's financial affairs.
Mr Levitt and three other former directors, Mr Mark Reed, Mr Alan McNamara
and Mr Robert Price, all deny a charge of fraudulent trading between April
1989 and December 1990.
Mr Cocks said Mr Levitt's blatant dishonesty was demonstrated by the
deception practised on his 'great personal friend', the thriller writer Mr
Frederick Forsyth.
At a meeting between the two men in May 1990 the author had agreed to invest
Pounds 400,000 in bonds with the Levitt Group and wrote a cheque on the
spot.
The money was placed in the Levitt Group's own accounts, however, rather
than clients' accounts, to help keep it afloat, Mr Cocks said.
A false invoice was then created which claimed Mr Forsyth had paid the money
in return for 'commercial advice and negotiations on book rights'. Mr
Forsyth would be called as a witness and tell the court this documentation
was 'complete moonshine', Mr Cocks said. 'You couldn't have a more blatant
example, the prosecution say, of dishonesty,' he told the court.
The trial continues.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Nissan's strategy shies away from the R-word: Richard Donkin
and Chris Tighe find the union sceptical of the 'no-tears' deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN'S PLAN to reduce staffing at its Sunderland plant was presented
yesterday as a 'no-tears' severance package and a triumph for industrial
relations.
But seasoned union officials greeted it as a traditional job-shedding
announcement in face of a fall in demand. Mr Harry Morgan, regional officer
for the AEEU engineering union, said: 'It's a new company with new ideas,
rapidly learning they aren't all that different when it comes down to basics
like job losses.'
Faced with falling demand across Europe Nissan had reduced line speeds and
redeployed 200 production-line workers. This week it closed its night shift
to halve production, a measure that will last until the end of February.
Yesterday it said it had decided to use its employee consultation machinery
rather than to impose a job-shedding plan from above.
Last month Mr Peter Wickens, Nissan's personnel director, asked the 10
employee representatives on the company council if they would take soundings
from the 4,600 employees - of which 2,400 are on the manufacturing floor.
He said: 'We told them we have no monopoly of wisdom, 'we are prepared to
listen to anything you and your constituents have to say about the handling
of the situation'. It was asking one hell of a lot of the elected
representatives. I wasn't aware of any company that had done this before.'
The hard fact facing the employees was a reduction in volumes from the
270,000 cars originally planned for this year - reduced to 246,000 in late
September - to between 200,000 and 240,000 cars for next year.
Mr Kevin Reah, a manufacturing staff representative on the council, said the
consensus among the workforce was to return to the day and night shift
pattern that had existed since 1987 as soon as possible.
Employees, he said, wanted to protect their earnings but did not want to
sacrifice job security by accepting conventional redundancy, in which the
company would have fixed targets for shedding labour.
He added: 'It was important to everybody that there should be no compulsion
on anyone to leave. When I joined the company I genuinely believed I was
joining the company for life.'
But the employees decided that some kind of severance deal might be
desirable. Mr Pat Quinn, production supervisor and a member of the company
council, said: 'We asked if a way could be found to allow people to leave
the company who wished to leave it.'
The management's formula presented to the employees yesterday was that the
company should attempt to move to a five-day/three-night shift pattern by
the beginning of March and that all employees be offered six months' salary
 -in most cases between Pounds 7,000 and Pounds 7,500 - to apply for what
Nissan terms 'a discretionary separation payment'. Because there are no
job-shedding targets, the company has had to include flexible arrangements
for returning to the full shift pattern.
Nissan retains the right to turn down applications to leave so that a
suitable balance of skills can be maintained.
The Inland Revenue has agreed to treat the deal as a tax-free payment under
its rules for redundancies although Nissan itself refuses to use what Mr
Wickens calls the 'R-word'.
Union officials pointed out, however, that the stark fact remained that a
Japanese company was shedding jobs.
'A rose is known by many names but it's still just a bloody flower,' said Mr
Tom O'Neill, AEEU divisional organiser.
He questioned Nissan's suggestion that the deal was a 'milestone'. He said:
'If you don't accept what the works council have discussed, what's the
alternative? The alternative is two-day working.' The AEEU had not been
involved in negotiations but he suggested the union could have been useful
to the works council, whose members lacked experience. 'Short-time working,
redundancy and complete closures - we're virtuosos at it. You achieve it
through experience, not overnight.'
Nissan said it was too early to gauge the uptake, but the average age of the
manufacturing workforce was about 26 and it believed some might welcome the
opportunity to change career.
Worker representatives said working practices and training programmes at
Nissan meant ex-employees were often sought after by other manufacturers.
But the success of the plan may hinge on whether workers who take the
severance terms qualify for benefit. Mr O'Neill doubted they would.

THE NATIONAL Association of Pension Funds has lobbied 200 MPs in an effort
to head off threatened Budget changes to the taxation of pension funds.
Employee contributions to pensions are tax-deductible at present, and
employees are entitled to a tax-free lump sum on retirement.
There has been speculation that the chancellor might attack some of these
privileges. The association argues that taxing pension funds 'would increase
the cost to employers providing final salary schemes'.

<TEXT>
SCOTTISHPOWER is understood to have reached an agreement with British Coal
which will involve the privatised power company continuing to take coal from
the Longannet deep mine in Fife after an existing agreement expires in 1995,
James Buxton writes.
ScottishPower agreed in 1991 to take between 2m tonnes and 2.5m tonnes of
coal a year from Longannet until March 31 1995. Earlier this year it said it
wanted to negotiate a new agreement so that both sides could take a
longer-term view of the future of coal supplies.
Yesterday Mr Eddy Hindmarsh, British Coal's head of operations, told union
leaders at Longannet that prospects for maintaining high volume sales from
the pit and from opencast sites looked promising. Negotiations with
ScottishPower were at an advanced stage, he said.
ScottishPower is expected to reveal details of the agreement with British
Coal on Tuesday.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Salvation Army starts fraud action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SALVATION ARMY has started overseas civil action to recover the Dollars
8.7m (Pounds 5.76m) of which it was defrauded last year.
New information has triggered action to recover assets in California and the
Netherlands. Sources at the charity said yesterday they had identified the
destination of nearly all the money which was passed over for legitimate
investment in letters of credit but was dissipated around the world.
It has emerged that new investigations have been triggered connected to the
fraud - including inquiries by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, the
Dutch police and the US Securities and Exchange Commission. UK detectives
plan to widen their inquiries soon - to the US and the Netherlands. They may
also visit Argentina.
Of the Dollars 10m originally handed over by the charity in May last year to
ASLK-CGER Bank in Antwerp, Dollars 8.7m was transferred to Banque
Continentale du Luxembourg (BCL) and then on to London, the Netherlands and
the US. Dollars 500,000 remains frozen in the BCL account.
A further Dollars 500,000 of the original money was paid from the ASLK-CGER
account to the Salvation Army to give the appearance of profits on
investment activities, although no such profits had been generated.
Investigators believe Dollars 3.3m was transferred from BCL back to the UK -
Dollars 200,000 to an account in the name of Tilen SA created by Mr Stuart
Ford, a Birmingham businessman; Dollars 2.5m to Edge &amp; Ellison, Mr Ford's
solicitors; and Dollars 600,000 - less substantial fees for Mr Ford - as a
loan secured against worthless German inter-war bonds to Phoenix Airways.
No criminal charges have been brought, although Mr Ford and Mr Robert Adey,
a solicitor with Edge &amp; Ellison, were separately arrested, questioned and
released on bail. They denied any wrongdoing.
The remaining Dollars 4.35m of the charity's money was transferred to Cregem
Bank International and then on to Kansallis International, two other banks
based in Luxembourg.
From here, more than Dollars 3.2m was transferred to Mr Harold Glantz of
Continental Capital Markets of New York, where much of it was spent on
houses in Malibu and Santa Monica.
The remaining Dollars 1m held by Kansallis was transferred to Dutch accounts
of ABN-AMRO in the Hague and Rabobank in Utrecht, and has been linked to Mr
Guido Haak of Delta Management, a company based in the Netherlands.
The charity believes it will recover between Dollars 2m and Dollars 3m
directly from assets on which its money was spent, and the rest by civil
actions.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Industry leads improvement in trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VALUE of exports hit a record in August while import growth has
flattened, with a particularly good trade performance by manufacturers.
The deficit with the rest of the world on all merchandise goods - the
visible trade deficit - came out in August at Pounds 419m, the lowest
monthly total for 6 1/2 years.
In August the trade deficit on manufacturered goods was Pounds 26m, the
lowest figure since July 1991 when there was a small surplus.
Excluding oil and erratic, high-price items such as ships, gems and
aircraft, export volumes grew 2.5 per cent in the three months to August
compared with the previous three months. In the same period the equivalent
measure of import volumes was flat.
In the year to the June-to-August period export volumes excluding oil and
erratics rose 3.5 per cent. The corresponding measure of import volumes grew
just 0.5 per cent.
The seasonally-adjusted figures from the Central Statistical Office result
from large revisions to data now thought to be flawed due to problems with
the new Intrastat system.
Instrastat was introduced in January to provide a new way of gathering trade
data within the European Union after the abolition of EU customs barriers.
It is based on collecting statistics from individual exporters and importers
rather than customs staff.
In August the value of exports came to Pounds 10.39bn, 5 per cent higher
than the Pounds 9.91bn in July. Imports fell 1.5 per cent to Pounds 10.81bn
from Pounds 10.98bn.
Between June and August the deficit was Pounds 2.41bn, after Pounds 3.04bn
in the three months to July. The last time the trade deficit for a full
quarter was lower was in the second three- monthly period of 1991 when it
was Pounds 2.02bn.
The deficit with non-EU nations in August was Pounds 729m, after Pounds 744m
in July, while August saw a surplus of Pounds 310m on trade with the rest of
the EU. The CSO said this last figure was the biggest monthly number 'since
about 1980'.
On manufactured goods, the deficit in the first eight months of the year was
Pounds 3.9bn, after Pounds 7.3bn in the whole of last year and Pounds 3.6bn
the year before.
The revisions to earlier data by a six-strong team of CSO officials centred
on altering the system of seasonally adjusting the figures from Instrastat.
The office also revised downwards its earlier figures for price increases
for both exports and imports, covering 10,000 classes of products. The CSO
believes prices of exports excluding oil and erratics rose 10 per cent in
the year to the last three-month period, while import prices on the same
basis rose 11 per cent. Prior to the revisions the office had believed
prices were rising faster, especially for exports, and had a correspondingly
lower figure for volume growth.
In the three months to August values of exports excluding oil and erratics
rose 2 per cent on the preceding three months and 14 per cent on the same
period 12 months previously. Equivalent imports rose 11 per cent and zero
respectively.
In the June-to-August period exports of finished goods rose 3 per cent
compared with the previous three months, and 17 per cent on a year
previously. Imports of similar products fell 1.5 per cent between the two
periods and rose 13 per cent over the year.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Levitt 'tried to put blame on others'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROGER LEVITT, former chairman of the collapsed financial services group,
tried to blame others for the fraudulent activities of his company, it was
alleged at the Old Bailey yesterday.
Mr David Cocks QC, prosecuting, said that when first interviewed by police
Mr Levitt told them that everything had been done 'behind his back'. During
these interviews Mr Levitt seemed to be placing blame on everyone's
shoulders except his own.
This was completely untrue, he said, since Mr Levitt was at the heart of the
fraud which involved illegally injecting Pounds 21m into the ailing company.
Mr Levitt and three other former directors, Mr Mark Reed, Mr Alan McNamara
and Mr Robert Price, all deny a charge of fraudulent trading between April
1989 and December 1990.
Mr Cocks said the blatant dishonesty was demonstrated when the thriller
writer Mr Frederick Forsyth in May 1990 agreed to invest Pounds 400,000 in
bonds with the Levitt Group. The money was placed in the Levitt Group's own
accounts, however, rather than clients' accounts.
The trial continues.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Civil engineers warn Clarke not to cut building projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FRAGILE and hesitant civil engineering recovery would be reversed if the
government announced spending cuts in road and rail construction in the
Budget this month, industry leaders warned yesterday.
A survey of 139 companies conducted last month showed a sharp rise in the
number of companies being asked to tender for work compared with 12 months
ago.
Thirty-one per cent of companies reported a rise in tender invitations
compared with 26 per cent reporting a fall. The balance of those reporting
increases over falls was the third highest in the 14 years that the
Federation of Civil Engineering Con-tractors has been conducting its survey.
On the other hand 37 per cent of companies expected orders to fall during
the next 12 months, compared with only 8 per cent expecting orders to rise.
Mr John Hackett, federation director-general, said the apparent conflict in
the findings was due in part to 'a fear that government, by cutting road and
rail programmes, would upset the fragile recovery which appears to have
begun in parts of the market'.
Clients had also increased the size of tender lists in the hope that
increased competition would force prices even lower. Due to a shortage of
big projects large national contractors were bidding for smaller works which
they might have ignored previously.
Mr Hackett said: 'The clearest signs of better times ahead are coming from
our members in London and the south-east which have seen relatively the
greatest decline in workload during the recession.
'In general large firms are doing better, while smaller firms are holding
their own. Middle-sized firms, by comparison, are continuing to have a very
rough time.'
The number of houses sold by Britain's biggest estate agencies in October
was the lowest monthly total this year according to a survey published
today.
The survey by the industry-appointed Board of the Ombudsman for Corporate
Estate Agents covered 26 companies representing 4,200 branches. Mr Peter
Constable, group chairman, said that sellers had become extremely cautious
ahead of the Budget.
Mr Constable warned Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, not to make any
further reductions in mortgage tax relief in his Budget.
The rate of relief, available only on the first Pounds 30,000 of borrowings,
is already planned to be cut from 25 per cent to 20 per cent from next
April.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Ford no longer the pay-rise driver: Wage bargaining at the
motor manufacturer used to be copied throughout industry. Times have
changed,
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORD pay deal, sealed late on Thursday, is no longer the trendsetter for
collective bargainers that it once was.
Ford has been rather more generous than most manufacturing companies over
the past few years. However, one senior personnel manager yesterday said
that the company still had 'a psychological significance', partly because it
was so widely written about.
Pessimists on pay inflation will say that the Ford deal - 2.5 per cent now
followed by a rise of either 3.5 per cent or the rate of inflation next
November, whichever is greatest - shows how deeply embedded inflationary
habits are. Ford has been losing more than Pounds 1m a day since 1990 and
faces another sharp fall in production because of weakness in the European
market.
Given the widespread fear of unemployment, a pay rise comfortably above
inflation this year and no less than inflation next might seem rather high.
It follows a two-year deal which gave 5 per cent for two years running and
has proved more generous than expected in relation to inflation.
Incomes Data Services, the independent pay analysts, has announced the
decline and fall of the pay freeze and has been predicting a resurgence in
pay for some time. The Ford deal suggests it may be right.
There are other signs. The monthly reports sent in by regional officials of
the AEEU engineering union show a sharp increase in the number of pay offers
going to strike ballots in some of the traditional parts of manufacturing.
Workers at Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port plant in Cheshire are expected to start
an overtime ban from next week after rejecting a pay offer of 2.5 per cent
this year and 3 per cent plus a 1 per cent lump sum payment next year.
There is also anecdotal evidence - from the building industry among others -
that many companies have cut employment so far that they badly need to hang
on to those people they have kept, which means granting higher pay rises
than they want to.
However the optimists on pay have strong arguments too. Ford says that the
deal is likely to be at worst neutral in terms of unit labour costs. It
expects to improve productivity by at least 2.5 per cent a year over the
next two years.
Mr Robbie Gilbert, head of employee relations at the Confederation of
British Industry, broadly welcomed the deal and said that it was at about
the average settlement level in manufacturing.
The Engineering Employers' Federation yesterday produced average settlement
figures for August to October running slightly lower at 2.13 per cent. And
unit labour costs in manufacturing remain negative although slightly down on
the minus 4 per cent of May.
Mr Ian Thompson, the federation's chief economist, said: 'We find no
evidence at all of a pay resurgence at present.
'There is the expectation of higher inflation, but in many companies that is
balanced by the pressure created by price cuts in their main product
markets.'
The CBI also continues to celebrate a broader reform of British pay
bargaining. A paper on pay and employment for next week's CBI conference
says that 74 per cent of employers use performance-related pay for at least
some of their employees.
It also says collective bargaining now covers only 34 per cent of employees,
that 59 per cent of the main pay decisions affecting manual employees are
taken at plant level, and that - according to a Gallup poll - more than half
of employees believe that pay and conditions should be bargained between the
individual and their employer.
But the pessimists can point to the stubborn persistence of 'pay drift'  -
bonuses, overtime and probably performance pay too - which means that
average earnings are still rising at about 4 per cent a year although
reported settlements are averaging only 2.5 per cent.
Earnings, in other words, continue to rise at about twice the level of
inflation in spite of high unemployment.
Relatively generous pay rises - made to look historically low by the
inflation rate - combined with continuing productivity improvements in
manufacturing, is what most employers are seeking - and getting.
Many public-sector workers faced with a second year of squeeze will feel
left out. Such an outcome is also not good for job creation, since employers
are concentrating resources on keeping existing staff happy.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Manufacturing output increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REBOUND in car output in September caused manufacturing production to
increase slightly after a decline in August, the Central Statistical Office
said yesterday.
But manufacturing output fell fractionally in the third quarter after rising
strongly in the first half of this year and is now estimated to be growing
at an underlying rate of just 1 per cent a year.
The CSO said manufacturing production increased by a seasonally-adjusted 0.4
per cent in September after a 0.6 per cent decline in August.
Output of the production industries, which group mining, quarrying, oil and
gas extraction and the electricity, gas and water supply sectors with
manufacturing, rose 0.1 per cent in September, offsetting a decline of 0.1
per cent in the previous month.
The CSO estimates that production industry output is growing at an
underlying rate of about 2 per cent a year.
Total output of the production industries rose 1 per cent in the third
quarter compared with the three months to the end of June and was up 2.8 per
cent compared with the third quarter of last year.
By contrast, manufacturing output fell 0.1 per cent in the third quarter and
was 1.6 per cent higher than in the third quarter of last year.
Output trends varied in the different manufacturing sectors. Among consumer
goods car output rose 1.9 per cent in the third quarter, largely because of
a 9.6 per cent increase in September. Among investment goods the output of
transport goods fell 3.3 per cent in the quarter, reflecting falling
production of ships, aerospace products and commercial vehicles.
There were also wide differences in the energy sector. Coal production rose
2 per cent in the latest quarter but was 23 per cent down on the previous
year. Oil and gas extraction jumped 7.5 per cent in the latest quarter and
was up nearly 19 per cent from the third quarter of last year, reflecting
the 'dash for gas' among electric power producers.
Third-quarter output of the electricity, gas and water supply industries was
5.5 per cent up from the second quarter and last year's third quarter,
reflecting increased demand during the cool summer.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Government rejects CBI currency call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT was on the defensive yesterday over its European policy after
Mr Howard Davies, director general of the Confederation of British Industry,
warned it not to close off the option of a single currency.
Mr John Major insisted that Britain was not 'remotely ready' for a single
currency. The prime minister added that he believed businessmen were 'very
much behind the government's approach'.
In an interview with BBC Radio Mr Davies said: 'What we are slightly
concerned about is a feeling that the government is prepared to dismiss the
prospect of a single currency in the longer run, or exchange-rate stability,
which we think are, in the long-term, of interest to the business
community.'
The CBI fears the government is closing off its long-term options in Europe.
A survey of business leaders, to be published tomorrow, shows many in
business in favour of a single currency.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, appeared to distance
himself from some anti-European remarks by some colleagues at last month's
Tory Party conference. He said: 'We have taken historic decisions to move to
a single market. That process is bound to create difficulties and short-term
controversies.'

FT  13 NOV 93 / Unlucky or unwise?: The troubles at Euro Disney
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER and JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS EURO Disney going to ground Dumbo the Flying Elephant, lock the door to
Sleeping Beauty's Castle and abandon its theme park to rodents less cuddly
than its current presiding mouse?
The closure of Euro Disney looks unlikely, despite the announcement this
week of a net loss of FFr5.3bn (Pounds 600m) for the year to September 30.
Too much money and prestige have been invested in the theme park for it to
close. The embarrassment to the French state would be enormous. Bringing
Euro Disney to its site east of Paris, rather than to Barcelona or London's
Docklands, was an all-party achievement.
The planning and building of Euro Disney spanned the periods in office of
one Conservative prime minister, Mr Jacques Chirac, and three Socialists -
Mr Laurent Fabius, Mr Michel Rocard and Mrs Edith Cresson.
The employment consequences of closure would be severe, adding 10,000
jobless to the 3.2m already unemployed in France.
The embarrassment would be no less severe for Walt Disney, which has a 49
per cent stake in the park. It was the strength of Disney's management and
marketing reputation which convinced many investors and lenders that the
park could not fail. US followers of the company flicked aside any European
doubts.
The moment Euro Disney's gates opened, its boosters said, visitors would be
overwhelmed by the professionalism and artistry of it all. Europeans would
flock to the park; its share price would soar. Says one analyst: 'I wonder
what they were all on. I'd like to smoke some.'
Nor would closure solve the problems of the French banks and financial
institutions, including the Caisse des Depots, the state investment arm,
which are owed the bulk of Euro Disney's FFr21bn debt. If the park were to
close, they would lose it all; there would be few buyers for six hotels 32km
east of Paris.
A fairground operator might like to run some of the rides for day trippers
from the capital, but they would be unlikely to generate the cash to provide
the banks with any reasonable return. Ripping the rides off their moorings
and selling them to operators elsewhere would not make much of a dent in the
debt either.
Receivership is also difficult to envisage. The receivers would have to find
an operator to run the park. There is probably only one company with the
expertise to run an amusement park the size of Euro Disney: Walt Disney.
Disney would have to be paid to run the park, of course, which shareholders
and creditors might find difficult to take.
Despite the depth of the park's financial crisis, Euro Disney, its creditors
and France appear to be stuck with one another.
Euro Disney and its creditors will attempt to construct a financial
restructuring between now and next spring. Analysts expect the period to be
marked by brinkmanship. Walt Disney has already issued a veiled threat that
it will refuse to provide any more money. It said this week that it had
'agreed to help fund Euro Disney for a limited period.' The banks might
start speculating about receivership.
In the end, analysts expect an agreement to be struck. It might involve a
rights issue, a debt for equity swap or further investment by Walt Disney.
Whatever the outcome, all sides will be stuck with the question of what they
do next. Euro Disney's management has already taken some steps to improve
the park's attractiveness to visitors. Last month it said it was cutting its
winter hotel prices. As from January, a family of four will be able to stay
in the Santa Fe, the cheapest hotel, for FFr300 rather than FFr375. Earlier
this year, the company said it would cut winter admission prices by 30 per
cent.
Euro Disney frequently points out how unlucky it has been since it opened in
April last year. Europe has been blighted by recession; the French franc has
been strong, deterring visitors from the UK and Italy. If the recession has
been the full cause of Euro Disney's problems, the financial restructuring
only has to carry the park forward to more clement economic times.
Only when Europeans begin spending freely again, will investors learn the
answer to a more uncomfortable question: was the whole idea misconceived?
Will Euro Disney fail to recover even when other European companies do?
There were some who argued before the opening that the park was a mistake.
They focused on culture and the weather. The park does feel as if it is in
the wrong place. Why build a fake castle on a continent full of real
castles? Where is the thrill in a simulated flight over Big Ben when
millions of package tourists routinely fly in and out of London? Why, in
short, bring a theme park to a continent which is already a theme park?
Consumers do not have to share French intellectuals' objection to US culture
to avoid Euro Disney. They merely have to feel they would prefer the real
thing - at the Disney park in Florida. Florida does appear to be violent,
but its theme park is no more expensive per night than Euro Disney and the
sun shines.
The problem is not that visitors are put off Euro Disney by the Parisian
weather; many of the attractions are covered. The difficulty is that they do
not see Euro Disney as the place to take their annual holiday, given the
sunny alternatives. Too many visitors are day-trippers. Hotel occupancy
averages only 55 per cent.
It might have been a good idea for Disney to build the park without hotels,
or with fewer hotels. Its ambitions were bigger than that; those who were
convinced by them might be living with the consequences for many years to
come.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Chetniks accuse Milosevic
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Vojislav Seselj, the ultranationalist leader and main rival to Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic, yesterday accused Mr Milosevic of getting rich
from the wars in Croatia and Bosnia.
Mr Seselj said the Serbian president was behind hard currency swindles and,
with other Belgrade officials, had amassed war booty from Bosnia.
Mr Seselj is an MP and commander of the Chetniks, a paramilitary unit
accused of human rights atrocities.
His remarks coincided with the publication in Serbia for the first time
since the eruption of war two and a half years ago, of eyewitness accounts
of atrocities committed by the Chetniks in Bosnia and Croatia.
The accounts have fuelled speculation that Mr Milosevic, desperate to get UN
sanctions lifted, may be prepared to change his mind and hand war criminals
 -possibly including the Chetniks - to an international war crimes tribunal.
The UN war crimes tribunal on former Yugoslavia is due to open on November
17 at The Hague.
Mr Seselj, accused Mr Milosevic of wanting to foment a civil war in Serbia
in order to call a state of emergency and cancel the elections.
Vojska, the Yugoslav army magazine, accused the Chetniks of murder and rape.
But diplomats said the charges may be aimed at the domestic arena to
eliminate Mr Seselj's Radicals in the elections. Up to 40 members of his
party have reportedly been arrested in the past two weeks.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Puerto Rico split on union with US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PUERTO RICANS go to the polls tomorrow to decide whether to remain a
possession of the United States, become the 51st state of the union, or
become independent.
After a campaign dominated by a debate about the economic merits of
independence or union, polls this week indicated little support for
independence in this Caribbean island of 3.7m people.
Support is evenly divided for the other two options - retaining the current
'commonwealth' relationship with the US or becoming a fully fledged state of
the union.
However, the decision will be only a first step, since the result will not
be binding on the US Congress and legislators in Washington will have to
approve or reject any change in the island's status.
President Bill Clinton has said he will accept any decision made by Puerto
Ricans, but congressmen are unlikely to welcome the prospect of a new, poor,
mainly Spanish speaking state.
The island is officially described as having a 'freely associated'
relationship with the US. Puerto Ricans are US citizens, but cannot vote for
a president. The island has a commissioner in Washington who has no vote to
influence legislation.
But Puerto Rico's 'commonwealth' status has allowed the island a significant
economic advantage under section 936 of the US revenue code which has
encouraged mainland companies with subsidiaries in Puerto Rico to deposit
their profits, tax free, in local banks. The deposits have become a pillar
of the Puerto Rican economy.
Puerto Rico's current political status has also given it federal welfare
funds of about Dollars 4bn per year from Washington, and hundreds of
millions more from rebates of federal excise taxes and duties.
A change to statehood is being supported by the incumbent New Progressive
Party of Mr Pedro Rossello, the governor, while the opposition Popular
Democratic Party wants to retain the current status.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Hunger to worsen in Africa, says FAO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MADELEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD agricultural production will increase more slowly in the next 20 years
but will continue to outpace population growth, the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organisation says in a study released today.
Output is expected to rise by 1.8 per cent a year compared with 2.3 per cent
a year in the last two decades. Population growth is likely to slow from 1.9
per cent now to 1.4 per cent a year.
The study, Agriculture: towards 2010, predicts that by that year food
available to people in Asia, the Near East, North Africa, Latin America and
the Caribbean will increase from 2,500 calories a head a day today 'to at or
above the 3000 calorie mark'. This is only marginally below calorie levels
in industrialised countries.
South Asia is also expected to make progress, with the percentage of
chronically undernourished people halving to about 12 per cent.
But little progress can be expected in sub-Saharan Africa, warns the study.
By 2010, Africa may have 300m undernourished people, 32 per cent of the
population, against 180m today.
'The scourge of chronic under-nutrition, in terms of absolute numbers
affected, will tend to shift from south Asia to sub-Saharan Africa,' it
says.
Worldwide, about 650m people are likely to be undernourished in 2010, the
report predicts, against 800m today.
It recommends that industrialised countries should transfer their
agricultural technologies and management practices to developing countries
in ways 'that do not discourage mixed cropping, small farmer practices, and
ways that do not lead to the dominance of mineral fertiliser and
pesticides.'
Cultivated land in developing countries is expected to grow from 705m
hectares today to 850m hectares by 2010, and this could increase pressure on
tropical forests.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France's stock market watchdog, the Commission des operations de bourse,
said yesterday it was examining the way Euro Disney released its results
this week and the movement in the leisure group's share price, writes John
Ridding in Paris. Euro Disney's shares have fallen by more than 25 per cent
on the Paris and London stock markets following Wednesday's announcement of
first year results showing a net loss of FFr5.3bn, largely the result of
exceptional charges.
The COB said the investigation was a routine procedure in cases of large
share price movements and announcements concerning large losses or
acquisition bids. It did not imply criticism of the company and was not to
be confused with the opening of a formal inquiry. The size of Euro Disney's
exceptional losses, which totalled FFr3.6bn, took the market by surprise and
increased the urgency of a capital restructuring at the group.
Yesterday, the share price fell sharply in Paris, closing down FFr5.5 at
FFr32.5. In London, where it suffered a steep decline on Thursday, when the
Paris market was closed, the company's shares rose 2p to 370p.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is ready to supply Israel with advanced ground attack fighter
aircraft that could include the sophisticated McDonnell Douglas F-15E.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, said after a meeting in Washington
yesterday with President Bill Clinton that the US leader had 'gracefully
told me and all the Israelis of your decision to strengthen the security of
Israel.'
Mr Rabin said this included maintaining Israel's edge in military technology
through the supply of advanced aircraft, the lifting of barriers on the
export of advanced computers, and an effort to strengthen Israel's
anti-missile capacity.
Mr Clinton said the details of the agreement had still to be worked out at a
meeting on Monday between Mr Rabin and Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary.
Officials said the final decision on whether the package would include the
F-15E had not yet been made.
The F-15E Eagle is a dual - role fighter which can be used both to establish
air superiority and for strategic bombing missions.
In the Gulf war two squadrons of F-15Es were used mostly to drop
laser-guided bombs on night missions.
At a joint press conference at the White House after their meeting, Mr
Clinton and Mr Rabin both called on Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the
Palestine Liberation Organisation, to condemn the killing of a Jewish
settler last month by terrorists apparently affiliated to his Fatah
organisation.
As Mr Clinton and Mr Rabin met, Israeli soldiers shot and fatally wounded a
Palestinian who fled from a roadblock in the occupied West Bank. Two
Israelis were stabbed in knife attacks by Palestinians.
Mr Rabin asked the US to help arrange 'quiet contacts' to move forward peace
talks with Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. Mr Clinton promised to try to persuade
the Congress to maintain financial aid and loan guarantees 'to help Israel
defray the cost of peace.'

FT  13 NOV 93 / Boeing secures Dollars 1.6bn Gulf Air order for 777s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOEING has won a Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1bn) order from Gulf Air, the flag
carrier of Abu Dhabi, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar, for up to 12 of its new 777
wide-body airliners.
The deal, involving six firm orders and options for an additional six, is a
blow for the European Airbus consortium which in recent years has won about
70 per cent of new aircraft orders in the Middle East.
But Boeing stepped up marketing efforts in the region and is aiming to take
about 65 per cent of the Middle East airliner market during the next ten
years, says Seddick Belyamani, head of Boeing sales in the region.
Boeing said it had now won about 70 per cent of all new orders in the world
market for wide-body jets since it launched its big twin engine 777
programme three years ago, competing against the Airbus A330 and A340 and
the McDonnell Douglas MD11.
Airbus had already sold six four-engine long-range A340 airliners to Gulf
Air and had been hoping to sell more of its wide-body aircraft.
Emirates, the Dubai-based carrier and Gulf Air's biggest regional
competitor, has also opted for the 777 with firm orders for seven aircraft
and options for another seven.
The Gulf Air deal brings the total 777 firm orders to 136 aircraft with
additional options on 100 aircraft.
Gulf Air has chosen the US General Electric GE90 heavy thrust engines to
power its 777s. This is the engine also selected by British Airways for its
fleet of 777s. The GE90 competes against the Rolls-Royce Trent, which will
power Emirates 777s, and the US Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000.
For Boeing, the Gulf deal is important. The airliner market continues to
remain depressed, forcing manufacturers to cut production at the same time
as maintaining heavy development spending on new programmes.
Boeing will roll out the first 777 next spring with the first flight
scheduled for June 1994. First delivery of the new widebody will be to
United Airlines of the US in May 1995. Gulf Air will get its first six 777s
between 1997 and 2000 with the six options for delivery after 2000.
Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas are engaged in combat for a Dollars 6bn
order for up to 60 aircraft from Saudia, the Saudi Arabian carrier.

<TEXT>
IT WAS the third hijacking in a week, and the seventh this year of a Chinese
airliner to Taiwan.
When an MD-82 Northern China Airlines jet was hijacked to Taipei yesterday
with 82 passengers on board it underlined yet again problems of lax security
and safety standards on Chinese aircraft.
The epidemic of hijackings is not only causing huge embarrassment to the
Chinese aviation authorities, it is also threatening fragile co-operation on
a range of issues across the Taiwan strait.
Mr Jason Hu, the Taiwan government spokesman, expressed the hope after an
aircraft was hijacked on November 5, that 'Beijing will take effective steps
to prevent a recurrence of such incidents.' Seven days and two hijackings
later, Mr Hu's remarks appear like so much crying in an aircraft's
slipstream. Chinese official undertakings to combat air piracy have come to
little.
This latest rash of hijackings coincided with talks on the island of Xiamen
between Chinese and Taiwanese representatives on ways to deal with air
piracy and other criminal activities.
Among the most contentious issues is Beijing's demand that Taiwan return the
hijackers to stand trial. Taipei is insisting on prosecuting the air pirates
itself until an accord can be worked out with China to facilitate their
return.
In recent cases tried in Taiwan, hijackers received sentences of 10 years,
much less severe than those likely on the mainland where hijacking is
punishable by death.
And so the pattern continues. An aircraft is hijacked to Taiwan; the
offenders surrender without fuss on arrival in Taiwan.
The hijackers, on their arrest, exhibit little remorse at the prospect of
cooling their heels in a Taiwan jail.
'For us ordinary folk living on the mainland who want to come to Taiwan, we
can't think of any methods other than hijacking,' said Wang Jihua, a factory
worker who hijacked an aeroplane to Taiwan earlier this week.

Taiwan's Premier Lien Chan, yesterday called for a review of the policy of
prosecuting hijackers on the island rather than repatriating them to China,
Dennis Engbarth reports from Taipei.
Mr Jason Hu, director of the government information office, said Mr Lien had
also ordered 'the transport ministry and other concerned agencies to review
the significance of the latest hijacking incidents, including China's
possible motives.'
Military specialists inspected the aircraft for intelligence-gathering
equipment amid concern that hijackings may be being used by Beijing to
gather military intelligence.

<TEXT>
THE BENEFITS of peace on the Israeli economy will far surpass any negative
impact, according to the first report on implications of peace carried out
by Bank Hapoalim, Israel's largest banking group.
Israel will gain from increased tourism, which accounts for a quarter of all
foreign currency revenues and earned Israel Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.22bn)
last year. It is expected to expand dramatically with a doubling of the
number of visitors forecast for next year.
The main negative impact will be the threat to Israel's textile, poultry and
vegetable sectors from cheap imports from the Palestinian entity.
The bank is more optimistic than many Israeli economists about the impact on
Israeli-Arab trade after the lifting of the Arab boycott. It says the
economic potential of the Arab countries is too great to ignore.
A specific dividend will be the import of cheap oil and gas from Arab states
directly, lowering Israel's energy costs.
The removal of the secondary and tertiary Arab boycott, which places
sanctions against companies that do business with Israel and companies that
deal with companies that trade with Israel will be more significant and
yield results quickly.
The bank adds that Israel will benefit by the influx of Dollars 2bn of aid
into the Palestinian economy over the next five years as Palestinians turn
to Israel for consulting services, raw materials, technology and Israel's
financial system.
Israel yesterday received some of the first concrete political and economic
dividends from its peace accord when Zimbabwe said it was establishing full
diplomatic relations with the Jewish state and Tunisia ended the ban on
Israeli tourists.
Both moves, part of a gradual easing of Israel's isolation by Arab and third
world countries, will help win popular support in Israel for the peace
process.

THE BENEFITS of peace on the Israeli economy will far surpass any negative
impact, according to the first report on implications of peace carried out
by Bank Hapoalim, Israel's largest banking group.
Israel will gain from increased tourism, which accounts for a quarter of all
foreign currency revenues from service exports and earned Israel Dollars
1.8bn (Pounds 1.22bn) last year. It is expected to expand dramatically with
a doubling of the number of visitors forecast for next year.
The main negative impact will be the threat to Israel's textile, poultry and
vegetable sectors from cheap imports from the Palestinian entity.
The Bank is more optimistic than many Israeli economists about the impact on
Israeli-Arab trade after the lifting of the Arab boycott. The combined GDP
of 13 out of 15 Middle Eastern countries is only Dollars 280bn, but 'the
economic potential of these countries is far too great to ignore.'
Direct trade will grow slowly but a specific dividend will be the import of
cheap oil and gas from Arab states directly, lowering Israel's energy costs.
tiary Arab boycott, which places sanctions against companies that do
business with Israel and companies that deal with companies that trade with
Israel will be more significant and yield results more quickly.
The report says Israeli fears that the opening of Israel to free imports
from the occupied territories will flood the Israeli market with cheap goods
and hurt employment are 'exaggerated' because of the small size of the
Palestinian economy. But it says that agriculture, especially poultry and
eggs, will be affected by the reduction of Israeli controls, although those
sub-sectors are already subject to smuggling into Israel.
However the Bank also says Israel will benefit by the influx of Dollars 2bn
of aid into the Palestinian economy over the next five years as Palestinians
turn to Israel for consulting services, raw materials, technology and use of
Israel's financial system.
Joint ventures could provide an additional growth path.
The report predicts that the Palestinian economy will have a growth rate in
double digits for the next five years and could double its current GDP of
Dollars 2.5-3bn in six or seven years.
The bank says, however, that the peace dividend is unlikely to lead to
significant cuts in defence expenditure, currently 11 per cent of gross
domestic product. It says the main military threat to Israel - Iran and Iraq
 -will continue to pose a challenge to the Jewish state.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Coalition pressures LDP over reforms
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ruling coalition yesterday stepped up pressure on the opposition
Liberal Democratic Party to compromise by next week on plans to reform the
scandal-ridden political system.
The government will close committee negotiations with the LDP on Monday and
commence a wrap-up debate in parliament. This is the constitutional prelude
to voting on proposals for the biggest political change since the second
world war, or reaching a firm accord to revise them.
Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, has proposed a meeting this
weekend with Mr Yohei Kono, the LDP's president, to seek an agreement. By
last night the LDP had not agreed a time for the meeting.
The wrap-up debate, condemned by the LDP as an attempt to steamroller
negotiations, is no surprise, since it is the natural next step from public
hearings on the reform plans, which ended on Thursday. However, it shows
that the government wants to re-establish control over the schedule, delayed
by the LDP, said political analysts.
Mr Hosokawa is eager to make progress on reform by the time he meets US
President Bill Clinton at the Asian Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in
Seattle at the end of next week.
The Japanese leader has indicated he will resign if the plans do not pass
parliament by the end of the year. However, forced votes are rare in the
Japanese parliament, which traditionally makes outline agreements on
legislation at the committee stage.
The government's four political reform bills propose a switch from the
present system of multi-seat constituencies for the lower house, to a
mixture of single seat constituencies and proportional representation.
Company donations to individual politicians would be banned, to be replaced
by a state subsidy for political parties.
The differences between the coalition and the LDP are over the numerical
split between seats chosen by constituency and proportional representation
vote. Each side prefers the split most likely to benefit it in an election.

FT  13 NOV 93 / ANC to dominate country's top court
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
South Africa's proposed constitutional court, the main institution charged
with protecting the country's fledgling democracy, is likely to be dominated
by political appointees chosen by the African National Congress.
According to joint proposals from the ANC and the ruling National Party, to
be incorporated in the new constitution to be finalised early next week, the
new President (likely to be from the ANC) will effectively control the
appointments of all 11 Constitutional Court members. He must consult the
multi-party cabinet before deciding, but no other party is likely to be able
to muster sufficient support to overrule him.
The liberal Democratic Party last night condemned the proposal, saying it
jeopardised the independence of the judiciary and 'could result in the most
important court in South Africa being politicised, centralised and
hand-picked by a new government.'
The proposal is especially important because the court will play a big role
in determining the nature of the new South African government. Given the
large number of vague compromises in the draft constitution, the court will
have considerable powers of interpretation.
The proposal comes at the end of a week in which the National Party has made
numerous concessions to the ANC on issues such as the country's official
language as well as the powers of regional governments in policing.
Unable to decide on one national language, the ANC/NP opted to have 11
official languages. This is likely to mean English will be the de facto
official language.
The National Party has undermined its claim to have negotiated a federal
constitution by agreeing that South Africa should have one national police
force rather than regional forces as demanded by regionally-based parties.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Japanese bow to business on environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE parliament yesterday bowed to pressure from ministries
representing powerful business interests and passed a law of ambiguous ideas
rather than concrete controls to conserve the environment.
The environmental protection bill, consisting of 46 articles, failed to
include a controversial environment tax or legislation on environmental
assessment standards.
Instead, it contained clauses calling for the creation of a society which
could 'develop while maintaining a healthy environment,' and 'conserve the
global environment through international cooperation.'
The country's environmental agency had hoped to implement a tax to limit
carbon dioxide emissions and to make it obligatory for industrial projects
to have environmental assessments. Last year, an advisory group for the
agency proposed imposing a carbon tax on consumption of petroleum, natural
gas and coal, to control carbon dioxide emissions and to secure a source of
revenue to promote the use of solar energy and energy saving technology.
This was met by fierce opposition from the ministry of international trade
and industry (Miti), and the transport and construction ministries, whose
views reflected the views of many top Japanese companies. Many have publicly
embraced environmental themes with enthusiasm, but their strong opposition
to policies limiting domestic growth has hampered change and Tokyo's role in
the international debate on environmental issues.
Advisory panels to Miti last year reported that a carbon tax would do more
harm than good, triggering an 'international migration of industry.' The
construction ministry fears an environmental assessment system, would hamper
new projects.
The bill passed yesterday, contains a watered down version of the intended
measures by the environmental agency. It calls on a 'business to assess the
environmental impact of a project and take proper consideration to conserve
the environment,' and also states that the government should 'make efforts
to obtain the understanding and co-operation of the people' when it sees the
necessity of an environment tax.

FT  13 NOV 93 / HK accord sought on less contentious issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR Chinese official for Hong Kong welcomed a suggestion to solve less
contentious elements first in the Sino-British talks over Hong Kong before
continuing discussion on difficult issues.
Mr Wang Qiren, deputy-director of Beijing's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office, was quoted in the pro-communist Ta Kung Pao as saying that a
settlement of the less difficult issues first was a 'good method' for moving
forward.
However, he referred only to the 1994 local government elections, and not
the 1995 polls for the Legislative Council (LegCo) which makes the law in
Hong Kong.
Earlier this week Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, indicated
that more time for talks might be available if Beijing agreed to a reduction
in the voting age to 18 years; to abolishing appointed seats for local
government polls due next year; and to single member constituencies for 20
of LegCo's 60-seats in elections due in 1995.
This was the substance of an offer put to Britain more than a week ago in
Beijing.
The UK government expects Beijing to table the offer formally next Friday
when the sixteenth round of Anglo-Chinese talks on Hong Kong begins.
Hong Kong government officials said that without agreement on these issues
Mr Patten feels he will have no alternative but to present his entire
package of proposals to LegCo.
Any agreement would allow negotiations about the difficult issues involved
in the 1995 elections to proceed for a few weeks more.
London and Beijing, however, still remain deeply divided over the method of
voting in the so-called 'functional constituencies,' which represent the
business and professional class in Hong Kong, and the principle that members
of an election committee, which will elect 10 members to the 1995 LegCo,
should themselves be elected.

FT  13 NOV 93 / China wary of economic 'hard landing'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S main task in its latest efforts to bring an overheating economy
under control was to avoid a 'hard landing,' a senior Chinese official said
yesterday.
Mr Lou Jiwei, director of the macro-economic department of the Commission
for Restructuring the Economy, said the government was involved in the
difficult task of trying to ensure continued economic growth while
maintaining the anti-inflation fight.
'In a market economy, it is quite normal for a government to adopt austerity
measures. But here whenever we talk about austerity and control people get
nervous,' said Mr Lou. 'People only want to hear about expansion.'
His remarks coincided with a meeting in Beijing of the Central Committee of
the Communist party, China's top policy-making body. The party plenum is
approving reforms in banking, finance, tax, trade and enterprise management.
Tax reforms will cover personal and corporate income, and also lay down a
new formula for revenue-sharing between the centre and the provinces.
Mr Lou, who is a close adviser to Mr Zhu Rongji, senior vice-premier in
charge of the economy, provided some revealing insights into the
difficulties associated with efforts to manage the Chinese economy through a
difficult phase.
He spoke of 'huge pressures' from the provinces over a credit squeeze
imposed in mid-year that was aimed at taking the steam out of speculative
areas such as real estate, and at imposing stricter financial discipline on
state enterprises.
Among other points made by Mr Lou were.
China had cut M1 money supply growth to an annualised 18.6 per cent in
October, down from 41 per cent in April and May. He indicated that the
central authorities may have 'overdone' efforts to curb monetary growth, by
getting it below 20 per cent so abruptly.
The inflation target at the end of first quarter next year was 10 per cent
for the whole country compared with 14.5 per cent for the twelve months to
September. Price rises in the main urban centres exceeded 20 per cent in
September.
Economic reforms next year would concentrate on the 'micro' aspects of the
economy such as banking, finance, and taxation.
Mr Lou said the authorities would approach enterprise reform cautiously.
Efforts would be devoted to 'transforming' the management of state
industries, many of which were loss-making. 'We can't fight on too many
fronts at once,' he said in reference to pressures on the reformists from
left and right.
The Chinese official said that for the time being commercial banks would be
obliged to carry the burden of providing credit to faltering state
industries, but 'one day we will need debt-restructuring for enterprises and
banks.' He said it was fortunate that the Chinese maintained one of the
highest savings rates in the world.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Trade accords 'will benefit US'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RATIFICATION of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Uruguay
Round of talks on trade liberalisation would bring substantial cumulative
benefits to the US economy, a survey of 35 economic forecasters concluded
this week.
It says that ratification of the Nafta, over the next 15 years, would raise
the real level of the US gross domestic product by 3 per cent. A successful
Gatt deal would add a further 4 per cent over the same period.
Conducted by the London-based Consensus Economics, the survey nevertheless
reflected considerable uncertainty about success either in next week's Nafta
vote in the US Congress, or in meeting the December 15 deadline for
completion of the Uruguay Round.
The US forecasters gave a 57 per cent chance that Congress would ratify the
Nafta, but assigned a bare 51 per cent chance of the Uruguay Round being
successfully completed.
The findings coincide with signs in the US of a swing in public opinion
behind the Nafta.
Public support for the pact has leapt from 34 per cent to 57 per cent in the
wake of a nationwide televised debate this week between Vice President Al
Gore, and Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who is a leading Nafta
opponent.
The Consensus Economics survey points to Nafta providing a Dollars 4.5bn
(Pounds 2.9bn) boost to US exports in the first year after ratification,
rising to an annual Dollars 13.2bn by the year 2005.
Gains from a successful Uruguay round outcome would be even more marked,
boosting exports by Dollars 6.5bn in year one, and more than Dollars 24bn by
2005.
US imports would rise, but less markedly.
The forecasters see the agreements trimming inflationary pressures, slowing
the rise in employment costs, and generating a 'small net increase' in jobs.

satellite pictures in a move that may open a Dollars 1bn market in the next
few years, Reuter reports from Washington.
Central Intelligence Agency director James Woolsey is to announce
conditional support next week for allowing the use of 'remote-sensing'
systems capable of picking out objects as small as cars from 400 miles in
space.
The matter has been under review for more than a year, delaying among other
things, reported requests by Spain, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates
to buy US spy satellites.
Officials said Mr Woolsey had decided to support industry proposals for the
sale of imagery sharp enough to distinguish ground objects as small as one
metre in diameter. But Mr Woolsey remained wary of allowing overseas sales
of the hardware itself for fear that unrestricted availability of
spy-quality images could endanger national security if it fell into hostile
hands.
US companies are banned from using satellites to gather pictures beyond a
certain measure of sharpness, except as part of highly classified
reconnaissance work for intelligence agencies and the Defence Department.
Mr John McMahon, president of Lockheed Missiles, estimated the proposed spy
picture business would add at least Dollars 1bn in sales and generate 30,000
jobs in the US.

FT  13 NOV 93 / German deficit nears DM235bn record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
GERMANY'S budget deficit will this year reach a record DM235bn (Pounds
95bn), or 7.2 per cent of gross national product, according to figures
published in Bonn yesterday.
In spite of a last minute demand by parliamentarians for a further DM5bn cut
in central government spending next year, the 1994 deficit will still reach
more than DM220bn, or 6.8 per cent of GNP, and may well be much higher,
according to the calculations.
The calculations include the deficits of the federal government as well as
the 16 states, local authorities, and a string of public sector funds and
bodies such as the Treuhand privatisation agency, German railways and the
mail services.
Mr Rudi Walther, chairman of the parliamentary budget committee, and a
member of the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), published the
figures yesterday, accusing the ruling coalition of being 'financially and
morally at an end.' He said the budget was sinking 'into a chaos of debt'.
He was presenting the results of the budget negotiations for next year,
concluded late on Thursday night, in which the federal government deficit
will be kept below DM70bn, only thanks to the imposition of an
across-the-board DM5bn 'global reduction' agreed by members of the coalition
at the last minute.
Hopes to keep the federal deficit to only DM68bn were dashed by the latest
estimates of tax revenues next year, published earlier in the week, which
suggest a DM2.7bn shortfall below the original estimate on which the draft
1994 budget was based.
In addition, the federal labour office is expected to run a further huge
deficit next year, as unemployment continues to rise.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, now has to find ways of saving the
extra DM5bn, on top of the painfully-negotiated DM21bn savings package
already pushed through.
Mr Walther's figures suggest that the overall public sector debt will reach
DM1,923bn in the current year, or 61.6 per cent of GNP, rising to DM2,169bn
next year (66.8 per cent of estimated GNP), DM2,317bn in 1995 (67.4 per cent
of estimated GNP), and only dropping to 65.4 per cent of GNP by 1997.
All those figures suggest that public sector debt in Germany, when including
the debts of all public authorities like the Treuhand, the post and the
railways, will remain well above the 60 per cent of GNP limit proposed for
European economic and monetary union.

South Korean foreign minister, in Seoul.
Sir Leon also asked South Korea to open its rice market as part of the
Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - something
Seoul has persistently refused to do, demanding an exception to the

FT  13 NOV 93 / Libyan oil industry slow to feel sanctions impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT will take at least six months before the latest United Nations sanctions
imposed on Libya begin to seriously hamper the country's oil industry,
according to western experts.
Libya yesterday denounced the sanctions, which were imposed by the Security
Council on Thursday because of Tripoli's refusal to surrender two suspects
in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Scotland.
The ban on new equipment as well as parts and spares for the country's oil
transport, processing and export facilities is designed gradually to erode
Libya's export capacity. One western oil company executive familiar with the
Libyan industry said the sanctions 'were unlikely to be the straw that
breaks the camel's back.' But they will close loopholes left over from
earlier trade restrictions, he said.
The main impact could be felt first in Libya's refineries, where fires and
machinery breakdowns are relatively common especially in older facilities.
The refinery boilers, furnaces, fractionation columns, pumps, catalytic
reactors, and prepared catalysts which are covered by the ban can easily be
bought on international markets, although the Libyans 'might have to pay two
or three times the going rate' for the items, according to the executive.
The ban on air transport to Libya means any urgently-needed spare parts that
are acquired will have to be shipped or moved overland from neighbouring
countries.
The sanctions on equipment such as loading buoys and single point moorings
for crude export terminals and flexible and floating loading hoses will
reduce Libya's ability to repair any damage to maritime export facilities
which commonly during the winter storm season in the Mediterranean.
Oil industry analysts do not expect any sudden fall-off in Libya exports,
which last month amounted to 1.37m barrels a day. The latest sanctions leave
untouched the country's hydrocarbon export revenues, which amounted to
Dollars 9.5bn last year - some 95 per cent of its hard currency earnings.
And there is little evidence that European countries such as Italy, Spain
and Germany which buy the high-quality, light crude oil from Libya would
agree to a full oil embargo.
The sanctions are also unlikely to have any short-term impact on over a
dozen international oil companies with production or exploration operations
in Libya.

PRESIDENT Clinton said yesterday he was close to winning enough votes in
Congress to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement, Reuter reports
from Washington.
'I've got a list that makes me think we can do what we always thought we had
to do,' said Mr Clinton, who is engaged in intense lobbying for the accord
to create a free trade zone among the US, Mexico and Canada.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen claimed the administration was within 10
votes of the 218 majority needed to win in the House of representatives.
'Between now and the 17th we'll be able to put it over the line,' he said.
Nafta opponents scoff at such claims. Representative David Bonior of
Michigan, a top House Democrat, claims his forces already have 221 pledges
to vote against the pact, three more than the needed majority.

GREEK riot police yesterday fired teargas to disperse scores of masked
youths who hurled stones and set a fire-engine alight after an anti-Nazi
march in Athens, Reuter reports from Athens.
Police said that about 100 youths had run amok after the peaceful march by
some 2,000 students who were protesting against a recent attack on a teenage
girl by a neo-Nazi group.
Riot police fired teargas near and into Athens University business school,
where the rioters had fled after they set the fire-engine alight.
Earlier students had marched through Athens, chanting 'Down with Fascism'
and 'Never, never, never' as they waved banners aloft, sang and danced their
way along central Stadiou street.
The march was called after the public order ministry ordered an
investigation on Thursday into a neo-Nazi group that allegedly had etched a
swastika on the face of a teenage student.

FT  13 NOV 93 / EU forces Bundesbank rethink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank will have to adopt alternative methods of fine-tuning German
money market interest rates when, as is probable, it abandons its Paragraph
17 facility early next year.
Under Paragraph 17, government funds deposited in non-interest bearing
accounts at the Bundesbank are injected into the money market at market
rates to ease temporary liquidity shortages.
The facility is now threatened with abolition because of stipulations in the
Maastricht Treaty for European Monetary Union that ban the use of central
bank credits to finance national budgets during the second stage of EMU,
which takes effect on January 1, 1994.
German public authorities currently must deposit funds free of interest with
the Bundesbank in return for short-term cash credits from the central bank.
But once cash credits are banned, those deposits will no longer be
mandatory. As a result, authorities will be able to invest their money more
lucratively elsewhere, removing the pool of public funds hitherto available
for Paragraph 17 operations.
These changes pose two challenges to the German authorities. The government
is given an opportunity to find a more lucrative home for its funds in
short-term money market instruments or on accounts with
government-affiliated credit institutions, such as Kredit fur Wiederaufbau.
Meanwhile, the Bundesbank must find another flexible instrument for
fine-tuning its money market operations. 'A similarly fast and
well-targetted arrow ..is hard to find,' noted Mr Hermann Remsperger, chief
economist at BHF Bank in Frankfurt.
Mr Remsperger suggested the Bundesbank could intensify the use of other
tools, such as currency swaps, 'fast repos' (unscheduled tenders for funds
against securities which have to be repurchased within a few days) or
so-called 'lightning repos', like fast repos but targetted at a handful of
banks.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Accord clears the line for sale of railways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE way to the privatisation of the German railways was cleared last night,
with a hard-fought compromise negotiated by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the
prime ministers of Germany's 16 federal states.
A row over how to finance the future of local commuter rail services, which
might be threatened by privatisation, had to be taken to the ultimate German
political summit to break the deadlock.
Now plans for the creation of a privately-constituted Deutsche Bahn AG can
go into effect next year, leading to the eventual creation of three
independent companies to run passenger transport, freight transport, and the
rail infrastructure.
Last night's deal was greeted by the German industry federation (BDI) as a
'victory for commonsense,' after the federal government had agreed on new
measures to help finance the cost of local transport in coming years.
The deal means that the 16 states will in future have a share in the planned
oil tax, to be introduced next year to finance the railways' reform. The
combined Deutsche Bundesbahn, in west Germany, and the Deutsche Reichsbahn
in east Germany, need the finance to service a DM70bn (Pounds 28bn) debt
burden.
Cross-party agreement, and the acceptance of the federal states, was needed
for the rail reform, which requires changes in the German constitution.
In 1995 and 1996, Bonn will provide DM14.5bn for the states to subsidise
commuter services, including DM8.2bn from the oil tax, which comes into
effect on January 1. The total federal subsidy, including the oil tax
element, will rise to DM15.3bn in 1997, and as much as DM17.3bn by the end
of the century.
The figures suggest that the federal government has had to pay handsomely
from future revenues, in order to buy the agreement of the states to the
rail reform plan.
The privatisation is planned to take place over 10 years but the national
system will only be responsible for inter-state and cross-border travel,
leaving the loss-making commuter services in the hands of the state
governments.
Mr Matthias Wissmann, the transport minister, said the negotiations had been
carried out 'without any ideological debate.' He hopes to introduce the
amended bill on rail reform in the Bundestag this month, with the hope of
having final approval by the beginning of December.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Washington drops charges against Gallo
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US government has dropped its charges of unethical conduct against Dr
Robert Gallo, the Aids researcher who is credited with co-discovering the
human immuno-deficiency virus with France's Institut Pasteur.
Doubts over who discovered what and when have clouded the question of who
should receive both the glory and the profits from the discovery of HIV and
the development of a test to detect it.
The Office of Research Integrity in the US Public Health Services yesterday
announced that it was dropping charges that Dr Gallo had failed to give
proper credit both to Institut Pasteur and to other US scientists.
Dr Lyle Bivens, the office's director, repeated the substance of the
allegations against Dr Gallo but said that he was withdrawing the charges.
He said that this was because a ruling last week by an appeals board of the
Department of Health and Human Services on a case brought against one of Dr
Gallo's associates had 'established a new definition of scientific
misconduct.'
The office had originally found Dr Gallo and his associate guilty of
scientific misconduct in a report issued a year ago.
No-one questions that Dr Gallo and his team at the National Institutes of
Health near Washington made a significant contribution to knowledge about
HIV, and was the first to prove that it was the cause of Aids.
But Dr Gallo has acknowledged that the virus on which he based his HIV test
was in fact based on a sample sent to him by Professor LucMontagnier's team
at the Institut Pasteur.
Yesterday's announcement leaves unclear the fate of the 1987 agreement in
which the French and US governments agreed to share the proceeds of the HIV
blood test, which are estimated to have exceeded Dollars 50m (Pounds 34m).
While negotiations have never really re-opened, France has raised questions
about the equity of an agreement reached on the basis of misleading
information.
A number of other investigations of Dr Gallo's conduct, both by district
attorneys in Maryland and Washington, by the Department of Health and Human
Services and by Congressman John Dingell, are still under way.

DEUTSCHE Aerospace might have to close more German factories and shed a
further 11,000 jobs if business and political conditions fail to improve,
the loss-making Daimler-Benz subsidiary warned yesterday.
The threat emerged during talks in Munich at which Dasa executives rejected
regional political leaders' appeals for a reprieve for six of the company's
52 sites and at least some of the 16,000 jobs scheduled to go by the end of
1996.
The group, which includes Germany's stake in the European Airbus and
joint-venture Eurofighter projects, announced its closure plans last month,
bringing to nine the number of factories, maintenance and logistics centres
facing the axe.
Mr Jurgen Schrempp, Dasa chairman, suggested five more might be in danger in
a newspaper interview published yesterday.
He rejected offers of financial support from the Bavarian and Lower Saxony
governments. Dasa needed no subsidies, he said after the meeting, but
government had to decide whether Germany needed a defence, aircraft and
space industry.
Mr Edmund Stoiber, Bavarian prime minister, said a Bonn cabinet commission,
chaired by Mr Theo Waigel, federal finance minister, was to be set up to
review aerospace and defence policy. Issues to be addressed included
possible indirect means of stimulating the industry and a moratorium on
space spending cuts.
Mr Schrempp also rejected claims from the Lower Saxony government that the
doomed Lemwerder aircraft maintenance works was profitable. The site, which
employs around 1,000, lost DM35m (Pounds 14m) last year. Aircraft
maintenance was simply not an economic proposition in a high-wage economy
such as Germany's, he said.
Dasa, which accounts for around 80 per cent of the country's aerospace
industry, aims to return to profit in 1995. The present job cutting and
works closure programme is intended to save DM1.5bn a year.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Five abstain from ban on N-waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPLETE ban on dumping radioactive waste at sea was voted for by 37
countries yesterday. Five further countries, including the UK, abstained
from the vote, but they have 100 days to consider their position.
The vote extends the 1972 London Convention on dumping at sea, which already
bans high and intermediate level radioactive waste, to include an indefinite
ban on low level waste.
The vote was taken at the end of a week-long meeting held at the London
headquarters of the United Nations International Maritime Organisation.
Apart from the UK, the abstainers were France, Belgium, China and Russia.
The UK said scientific research showed controlled disposal of low and
intermediate radioactive waste at sea might in certain cases be the best
practicable option, and had negligible impact on the environment. However it
stressed it had no immediate plans to dispose of radioactive waste at sea.
Russia recently admitted dumping radioactive waste and spent nuclear
reactors in the Sea of Japan and the Arctic, provoking an angry response
from Japan, South Korea and the US. It said this week it would be prepared
to halt dumping at sea if it received foreign assistance.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Horst Seehofer, the German health minister, yesterday announced new
measures to improve the testing of blood products in the wake of Germany's
biggest medical scandal.
The new regulations require all blood products, which by law must be tested
against the HIV virus that causes the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
(Aids), to be re-examined before they are put on the market.
The Paul-Erhrlich Institut, which conducts similar procedures for serum and
vaccines, is expected to be given responsibility for the new controls, which
will include detailed lists of all involved in the preparation of these
products.
The regulations include a four to six months quarantine for blood products
as the HIV virus may be present but too young to be detected. They will come
into force on January 1.
Mr Seehofer also announced that the federal state will create a DM20m
(Pounds 8m) fund to compensate AIDS victims who acquire the HIV virus
through a blood transfusion. The German Red Cross said yesterday it would
give an additional DM3m to the national Aids foundation.
The new measures follow allegations last month that UB Plasma, a Koblenz
company, had sold blood products containing the HIV virus. A second company
called Haemoplasma from Lower Saxony is also being investigated for for
allegedly failing to regularly test blood products.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Nissan to cut UK output and seek smaller workforce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN is to halve production at its Pounds 900m car plant at Sunderland in
north-east England during the first two months of 1994 and reduce the
4,600-strong workforce.
The Japanese company is taking drastic action because of the impact of the
continuing steep decline in west European new car sales, which have fallen
by 15 per cent in the first 10 months of this year.
Nissan, the first Japanese carmaker to establish a car plant in Europe,
insisted it was not abandoning its commitment to full job security, but it
was seeking to reduce the workforce both through increased natural wastage -
currently running at about 4 per cent a year - and an 'agreed separation
programme'.
Staff in all areas at the Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK) plant, which
started production in 1986, are to be offered six months' salary to leave
the company, but there will be no compulsory redundancies. Payments will not
be based on length of service.
Nissan insisted the action could not be termed a voluntary redundancy
programme, as it had set no target for the reduction it was seeking in the
workforce.
Mr Ian Gibson, managing director, said the company had told employees 'if
you want a job, you have it'. Job security 'remains our chief priority', he
said.
Nissan has already moved to single-shift working for November and December
by eliminating the night shift, in order to cut output from 1,200 cars a day
to about 600. Some 2,400 of its 4,600 employees will now work alternate
weeks only on day shift for at least four months to the end of February.
They will remain on full basic pay, which averages Pounds 13,164 a year for
an assembly line worker, but will lose night shift bonuses which average
Pounds 183 a month. A 3.5 per cent pay increase due in January as part of a
two-year deal will be honoured.
Nissan said it expected its UK car output to fall next year to
200,000-240,000. It has already cut production this year to 246,000 from the
270,000 previously forecast.
The proposals for the severance package, which could involve payments of
Pounds 7,000-Pounds 7,500 on average for assembly line workers, together
with the commitment to job security and the guarantee of no compulsory
redundancies, had come from the workforce, claimed the company.
The Nissan workforce has fallen from a peak of around 4,800 earlier this
year through natural wastage. Nissan is suffering losses on its worldwide
operations and the impact of recession in Europe is expected to push the
Sunderland production plant into loss for 1993.
Chris Tighe writes: Mr Harry Morgan, north-east regional organiser for the
AEEU engineering workers union, said the 'agreed separation programme' was a
play on words. 'Traditionally we would say they're asking for volunteers for
redundancy except they haven't put a number on it and they've said that if
there are not volunteers nobody will be paid off.'

FT  13 NOV 93 / Divers find hidden charms of the Ruhr: Tourism has come to
an industrial heartland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCUBA diving in a flooded coal bunker may not be everyone's idea of fun. The
same could apply to hiking over slag heaps, especially in Germany's Ruhr
valley. But there is a demand, and there is a supplier.
It is the job of IBA Emscher Park, a North Rhine-Westphalian state
development company, to seek out new ways of enhancing the charms - for
investors, visitors and residents - of Germany's one-time industrial heart.
It has an eye for the unusual, and no shortage of willing voluntary helpers.
For example, the potential of the flooded honeycomb of underground shafts
and ore and coke bunkers beneath the redundant Meiderich steelworks, closed
in 1986, and now part of the North Duisburg Country Park, was first detected
by members of the Duisburg diving club.
Recently given permission to explore, they surfaced bubbling with reports of
clear waters and still-intact hydraulics systems and complete electrical
installations. Even the public address loudspeakers were still there.
The club's subsequent request to have the works' redundant gas holder
converted into a 7-metre-deep training tank is currently under
consideration, according to the IBA's Ms Anette Kolkau.
For the less adventurous, the park's surface attractions include the
preserved remains of three blast furnaces.
For those with the legs, there is a hiking trail, more than 100km long and
meticulously marked, which arches across the northern reaches of Dortmund,
through pockets of greenery, over slag heaps, past pit heads and through the
ageing workers' settlements of the Ruhr. The route, taking in such unlikely
tourist destinations as Kamen to the north-east of Dortmund and
Castrop-Rauxel to the north-west, was mapped out by the Sauerland mountain
club and is also now under the IBA's custodianship.
According to the IBA, the route offers walkers a broad insight into an
industrial region in the process of structural change.
As if to quell any doubts about the scenic attractions of the Ruhr, last
summer's opening to the public by the energy group Ruhrkohle of its private
industrial railway is said to have attracted 8,000 visitors, who were able
to travel on the 1928-vintage Rheingold train.

FT  13 NOV 93 / DTI orders inspection of Queens Moat group after losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has appointed inspectors
to investigate Queens Moat Houses. The hotel group announced a loss of
Pounds 1.04bn two weeks ago and is talking to banks about refinancing its
Pounds 1.18bn of debt.
The company welcomed the investigation and said it was in the best interests
of shareholders. Mr John Bairstow, former chairman, said he would co-operate
fully with the inspectors.
Under Section 432(2) of the Companies Act 1985, inspectors can be appointed
if circumstances suggest fraud, misfeasance or misconduct, or if
shareholders have not been given information they might reasonably expect.
Since QMH's difficulties became public in March and its shares were
suspended, all those who were directors at the time have resigned. The
Department of Trade and Industry asked the inspectors 'to look at various
matters drawn to the department's attention in respect of transactions and
accounting issues' highlighted in the 1992 results announcement.
The announcement referred to suspected breaches of company law - notably
involving the payment of Pounds 33.3m of dividends over the past three years
 -and sale and leaseback transactions involving directors that should under
stock exchange rules have been declared to shareholders.
It also said new directors had been unable to find the working papers used
to produce the 1992 interim results. It is likely that the inspectors will
question former directors on the issue.
Mr Bairstow said: 'I can't tell them anything. David Hersey was finance
director. He is a very precise and pernickety chap.' Mr Bairstow said he was
sure Mr Hersey - who was suspended from the company in April - kept a master
set of the papers in his filing cabinet. 'I very rarely went into his
office,' Mr Bairstow said,
Although the DTI gives inspectors a remit when appointed, it is up to them
to decide how far their investigation will go. They are not given a time
limit, since investigations can be complex.
The inspectors are Mr Adrian Burn, the London region managing partner of
accountants BDO Binder Hamlyn, who has been involved in previous DTI
investigations, and Mr Patrick Phillips QC, a barrister with experience in
accountancy and finance.

FT  13 NOV 93 / US retail sales surge confirms speed-up in growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SURGE in retail sales in October provided further confirmation that US
economic growth is accelerating.
The Commerce Department said yesterday that retail sales rose by 1.5 per
cent last month and by 6.2 per cent in the year to October. That was the
seventh consecutive monthly rise in sales and the biggest increase since
April. Analysts had expected a gain of only about 1 per cent.
The figures helped lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which closed up
22.08 points at 3,684.51. Bond prices initially fell because of the figures
but they later recovered on technical buying.
Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, called the figures a 'clear signal that
our economy is improving'. He said: 'Real growth is accelerating as
inflation continues to decline.'
The sales increase was led by a 3.6 per cent rise in car sales between
September and October. Sales of furniture and building materials rose 3.9
per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively, reflecting robust homes sales.
Department stores and restaurants registered increases of 1.1 per cent and
0.8 per cent.
The figures follow buoyant statistics indicating that growth is accelerating
in most sectors after a disappointing first half.
Most analysts are projecting economic growth at an annual rate of 3.5 per
cent to 4 per cent this quarter, after growth of 2.8 per cent in the third
quarter when output was depressed by flooding in the Midwest. Annual growth
was only 1.3 per cent in the first half.
Signs of accelerating growth have been causing jitters in bond markets,
where yields have moved back above 6 per cent, because investors fear such
growth will put upward pressure on inflation and prompt a tightening of
monetary policy.
But many economists say growth will slow down next year because consumer
spending is outstripping personal incomes.

FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Foreningsbanken loss grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S fifth biggest bank, Foreningsbanken, yesterday announced an
operating loss of SKr1.46bn (Dollars 180m) for the first nine months, up 52
per cent from the same 1992 period.
The result was dragged down by SKr3.38bn in credit losses, a 29 per cent
increase from last year.
The bank expects a full-year loss of around SKr2bn and credit losses of more
than SKr4bn.
The results were announced as the group unveiled details of a series of
share offers, which could raise as much as SKr3.4bn in new equity as part of
its plans to remain privately-owned and obtain a stock exchange listing.
The Swedish government is providing a SKr2.5bn guarantee, which can be
utilised by the bank if its capital adequacy falls below 9 per cent over the
next three and a half years. At the end of September, the ratio was just 5.5
per cent.
A consortium centred on the LRF, the Swedish farmers co-operative, is
guaranteeing SKr2.5bn of the new issue, which will be priced at SKr15 per
share.
A further SKr400m worth of shares will be offered to Swedish and
international institutions, while SKr500m is available for
over-subscription.
The bank aims to be quoted on the Stockholm Stock Exchange from January 1.
STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the debt rating agency, yesterday posted a negative
outlook assessment on Investor, the main holding company of Sweden's
powerful Wallenberg family, because of concerns about Saab-Scania, its 100
per cent owned vehicle and aerospace unit. A slide in profits at Saab-Scania
contributed to an 80 per cent fall in Investor's half-year profits to
SKr406m as it was hit by weak demand.
S&amp;P said the revision of its outlook assessment from the previous status of
stable, did not necessarily imply that a downgrade in Investor's debt rating
would follow. But it reflected concern about Saab-Scania's medium-term
ability to generate surplus cash flow for its parent amid 'depressed market
conditions and capital expenditure requirements'.
The agency said this could force Investor to rely on further asset sales.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Bremen steel sale provokes outrage

<TEXT>
GERMAN private steelmakers expressed outrage yesterday at the decision by
Klockner-Werke, the diversified steel group, to sell its steel mill to a
consortium led by the city state of Bremen.
Officials at Thyssen, the largest steel group in Germany, said the decision
was purely political and would run against the European Union's efforts to
reduce overcapacity in the European steel industry.
Klockner-Werke decided yesterday to sell 75 per cent of its integrated steel
mill in Bremen for a symbolic DM1 each to four local companies. These
include Hiberg, a state-owned holding company, the Bremer Vulkan shipyards,
Hegemann, a company manufacturing shipping equipment and the city's
electricity utility.
The Bremen government plans to keep the loss-making steel mill open with its
current crude steel capacity of around 3m tonnes. It will privatise part of
the profitable electricity utility to raise funds and inject DM200m in the
steel mill.
The decision eliminates a rival offer made by Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch,
Germany's two largest steemakers and Usinor-Sacilor, the French steel group.
The consortium wanted to close most of the plant, keeping open only its
modern cold-rolling facilities.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Union is to provide a showcase for President Boris Yeltsin of
Russia in Brussels next month on the eve of the European summit - and of his
own parliamentary elections.
Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister and holder of the EU
presidency, said last night after meeting Mr Yeltsin in Moscow that he had
invited the Russian leader to Brussels on December 9 to sign a declaration
of intent preparatory to a signing of the Treaty of Partnership between the
EU and Russia, which for technical reasons cannot be signed until the end of
December.
The European summit is on December 10 and 11, and the Russian elections are
on December 12.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, the Russian deputy premier who has, with Sir Leon
Brittan, the Brussels trade commissioner, thrashed through the agreement
which was finally approved in principle earlier this week by EC foreign
ministers, said that all matters of principle had been settled and all main
compromises made. 'It now only remains to put these principles into a
detailed language,' he said.
The Partnership Treaty should usher in a closer political and economic
dialogue between the EU and Russia.
Mr Dehaene said that Russian exports to the EU countries were eight times
more than to Japan and 27 times more than to the US, while the member
countries contribute 65 per cent of the assistance to Russia. He said that
yesterday's visit by himself and Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission
president, was the beginning of a series of meetings which would put the
dialogue between Russia and the EU on the same footing as between the EU and
the US and Japan.
Mr Willy Claes, the Belgian foreign minister, said that they had no doubt
that the elections in Russia - to which the EU would send a number of
observers - would be free and democratic, and mark a 'historic turning
point' for the Russian people.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Pohl breaks silence about Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Karl Otto Pohl, who resigned after 11 years as president of the German
Bundesbank two years ago, has broken his silence and has spoken out about
'defects' in the Maastricht treaty on European union.
In two lectures this week at the London School of Economics, the man who was
once Europe's best known central banker and is now part-time chairman of the
well capitalised Cologne-based Sal Oppenheim private bank,
left a 500-strong audience in no doubt of his scepticism about the likely
impact of the European Monetary Institute. The EMI is being set up in
Frankfurt next year to supervise the next stage of the planned move to
European economic and monetary union (Emu).
He risked inflaming old wounds with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, with whom
relations have soured because of Mr Pohl's criticism in 1990-91 of the
financing of German reunification.
Mr Pohl said mistakes over introducing the D-Mark into eastern Germany were
partly to blame for German budgetary imbalances which have caused the
Bundesbank to maintain tight money. This had worsened the European
recession, and made Emu prospects 'much less favourable'.
Mr Pohl referred defiantly to his celebrated remarks in March 1991 that the
aftermath of German monetary union had been 'a disaster'. The controversy
stirred by these comments helped lead to his resignation, and rankles still
with Mr Kohl. 'The Chancellor did not like the remark. But it was not
wrong,' Mr Pohl said.
Although he took care not to criticise directly Mr Kohl or the present
Bundesbank leadership, Mr Pohl took issue with the central bank's reliance
on monetary targets to guide interest rate policy. 'Money supply figures
should be used with caution,' he said.
On the next stage of Emu, Mr Pohl damped some European politicians' hopes
that the EMI would have a role in monetary decision-making. 'You must always
be aware that the EMI will have no decision-making powers. This is something
the Bundesbank will always insist on. The Bundesbank is not ready to share
responsibility with this new institution.' Trying to sound diplomatic, he
added: 'The creation of the EMI in Frankfurt might appear a rather academic
event without much practical relevance. I wouldn't say that. It could be
useful in some respects to continue the work of the European committee of
central bank governors to develop tools for a common monetary policy. But
this could also be carried out by the governors' committee.'
Mr Pohl said the main issue facing Europe was combating unemployment and
opening the west to the former eastern bloc. 'We can't solve these problems
by establishing a monetary institution in Frankfurt.'
Because of 'hidden unemployment', he said the true figure for unemployment
in Germany was between 5m and 6m compared with the official total of 3.5m.
'It's the same problem in Spain or France.'
Mr Pohl said the Maastricht treaty dealt more with the past than the future.
'I'm not sure whether a treaty which seeks to establish monetary and
political union in the west is the right answer to those countries (in
central and eastern Europe) who say they are also part of the European
community and European culture.'

FT  12 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Reuters attacks its partners
in Globex system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REUTERS has accused its two partners in Globex, the after-hours electronic
futures trading system, of breaching their obligations under their joint
venture agreement.
Under the existing deal, the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, which jointly developed Globex with Reuters at an
estimated cost of Dollars 80m, have control of the day-to-day running of the
system.
In a letter to the Chicago Board of Trade dated Friday, Mr Simon Yencken,
Reuters' general counsel, chides the exchange for promoting its own
home-grown computer trading system, Project A, at the expense of Globex, and
for failing to list its agricultural futures contracts on the Globex system,
as promised more than a year ago.
'As a result of its actions, the CBoT has put the Globex Joint Venture in
breach of material obligations under the 1992 Globex Agreement,' Mr Yencken
wrote to CBoT chairman Mr Patrick Arbor.
Mr Bob Crooke, at Reuters in New York, said the company was reluctant to
comment on what it considered to be 'private and confidential'
correspondence. He said Reuters was awaiting a reply from the CBoT.
The letter, which was released anonymously to Chicago media in an escalation
of the dispute, underscores the uncertainty over the future management of
the system.
Reuters is the primary investor in Globex, which has disappointed its
developers since its launch 16 months ago, with the two Chicago giants
generating less than 15 per cent of Globex volume. Fearing competitive
disadvantage, other world exchanges have been slow to sign on to the system
and put themselves under Chicago's control.
Reuters is widely expected to restructure the Globex agreement early next
year, giving some management powers to the Paris futures exchange, Matif,
which generates 85 per cent of Globex's volume. Reuters is also negotiating
separately with Liffe, and is expected to give it a voice in governance if
it agrees to join Globex.
Reuters needs to add Liffe products and to distribute terminals in Asia in
an effort to make Globex profitable.
Although Mr Yencken's letter singles out the CBoT, both the CME and the CBoT
continue to operate after-hours trading mechanisms that compete with Globex
and limit its effectiveness.
Mr Arbor said he had not seen the Reuters letter. However, he said Globex
was in need of an overhaul: 'I've just come from New York and the situation
is not good. Globex is not being used, there is no demand, (companies) are
having trouble staffing for the product, and I saw machines in people's
closets.
'Globex is in the 'Kitty Hawk' stage. It will work, eventually there will be
a use for it, but right now the governance needs to be addressed.'

FT  12 NOV 93 / Wearing down the sceptics to release a flow of money: A look
at progress in raising institutional funds for the Lloyd's insurance market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News this week that backers of the Nelson Lloyd's Trust were scrapping a
Pounds 60m venture to seek corporate capital for the Lloyd's insurance
market raised eyebrows in London. After all, it is not every day that the
names of Cazenove and Lazard Brothers, the bluest of blue-chip city
institutions, are associated with failure.
And it was a failure all the more galling in view of the success enjoyed by
many rival banks and securities houses. Twelve investment trusts and
companies have been launched in the past three weeks - including two
yesterday. Although some of the funds have been scaled back in size, pension
funds and life assurance companies have already committed more than Pounds
600m to the Lloyd's market for 1994.
Several other schemes are scheduled for launch before the end of this month.
Lloyd's hopes that about Pounds 1bn in corporate capital will be committed.
But even the present level of capital raised represents an achievement for
Lloyd's. As recently as July, officials were cautiously predicting that
Lloyd's could attract as much as Pounds 500m 'with a fair wind and a
following breeze'.
Lloyd's has had to overcome a series of obstacles. New rules meshing its
internal rules with stock market regulations have been drafted against a
tight timetable and senior managers have conducted a delicate political
campaign to persuade existing Names - the individuals who have traditionally
supported its capital base - to approve the initiative.
Above all, the insurance market has persuaded cautious city institutions to
back it. Mr Robert Hiscox, deputy chairman of Lloyd's of London, who has
headed the market's search for corporate capital, says UK financiers
initially poured cold water on the idea. Interest only began to pick up
after US investment banks, such as Salomon Brothers, became involved in
developing schemes.
Managers of many Lloyd's syndicates, who earlier this year feared they had
insufficient capital to stay in business, are now flush with capacity and
turning away potential corporate money. CLM Insurance Fund, sponsored by
Sedgwick Group and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said recently it had scaled back
its fund because of the difficulty in securing 'good quality' capacity on
Lloyd's syndicates. Two agencies - Sturge Holdings and London Wall Holdings
 -abandoned plans to form their own listed trusts because they had obtained
enough capital from other sources.
Yet the scrapping of the Nelson trust provides the clearest indication that
the supply of capital - as well as the demand for funds - is also limited.
Mr Nigel Rogers, managing director of the Octavian Group, which jointly
sponsored the Nelson initiative, says: 'Institutions have set aside a
certain amount of money but this is not a bottomless pit.'
Indeed, scepticism among the investment community remains widespread.
According to one fund manager who is an enthusiast for Lloyd's, well over
half the UK investment community is not interested at all. Some leading
institutions are firmly set against any involvement.
Sceptics point to the potential volatility of future returns from the trusts
and to a lack of transparency in the character of many of the investments.
'There is a problem explaining to pension fund trustees that you are putting
their money into Lloyd's,' says one fund manager.
One measure of the modest scale of institutional interest is that the Pounds
600m in funds committed to Lloyd's compares with Pounds 350bn available for
investment each year by UK pension funds. The National Association of
Pension Funds (NAPF) considered holding a special seminar on Lloyd's at its
February conference, but abandoned the idea because there was insufficient
interest from members. 'It is interesting that there are a lot of people who
have given these things a wide berth,' says one fund manager.
Many investors have overcome fears about the ability of Lloyd's to create a
reinsurance company to 'ring fence' billions of dollars of liabilities from
US asbestosis and pollution claims. 'There is evidence to suggest that
Lloyd's syndicates are better reserved than the average UK composite,' says
one fund manager. 'We accept that the ring fencing may not fully protect you
from prior year claims, however in a composite there is no protection.'
Even so fund managers are investing relatively small amounts of money. Few
investors are prepared to risk more than Pounds 25m. Smaller funds, such as
Premium Trust/Premium Underwriting, which is raising Pounds 33m to support
40 syndicates, are backed by some two dozen separate institutional investors
with maximum stakes of about Pounds 3m each. One investor who manages Pounds
18bn of funds says he is prepared to put only Pounds 5m-Pounds 10m into one
of the larger Lloyd's trusts.
Even some enthusiasts say they do not see the investments as permanent. 'It
is a marginal investment and not one that we would hold for the entire
cycle,' says one fund manager. 'There is a danger that everyone wants to get
in and get out at the same time,' says another.
Yet whatever the pros and cons, the institutional investment has been
sufficient to spawn a mini stock market sector. Mr Mark Henderson, of
Clerical Medical, the life assurance group, takes a positive view of
prospects for the quoted companies. He says that if Pounds 1bn is raised,
the quoted Lloyd's investment trust sector will be equivalent in size to a
small Footsie stock, a level sufficient to encourage further interest.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Market curb on auditors proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUDITORS WILL be restricted from underwriting or marketing new issues under
draft ethical guidelines issued by the accountancy profession yesterday.
Any accountancy firm which acts as the sponsor on an issue for a client will
be excluded from underwriting or marketing the issue.
The guidelines - which supplement the accountancy ethical rules on corporate
finance - have been redrafted following changes to London Stock Exchange
regulations earlier this year.
The exchange's revised 'Yellow Book' of regulations on listing allowed
accountancy firms for the first time to act as a sponsor on an issue of
shares or securities.
The draft guidelines were circulated by the Chartered Accountants Joint
Ethics Committee.
The ban prevents auditors as sponsors from pricing shares or securities,
although it says pricing does not include advice to a client on the content
of an offer document.
The new rules say public documents and circulars should prominently show the
name of the marketing firm and 'make abundantly clear' the roles undertaken
by different advisers.
Mr Jock Worsley, chairman of the committee, said it was vital that a
sponsoring auditor should not be involved in marketing or underwriting,
although he welcomed the general principle that auditors should be allowed
to become sponsors.
Consultation on guidelines is open until December 15.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Kohl rebukes CSU ally over Europe
</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday restated his passionate commitment to the
goal of European union, and rejected any revival of nationalism in Germany.
His speech to the German parliament was an unequivocal rebuke to Mr Edmund
Stoiber, the Bavarian prime minister and his political ally.
In an effort to stem popular scepticism about European integration, he said:
'For Germany, there is no alternative to European unity. Securing and
continuing the task of European unification concerns the very fate of this
continent, but above all of our country.'
He warned that if the European Union became no more than a 'glorified free
trade zone' as Lady Thatcher, the former British prime minister, wanted it
to be, 'it will not last long into the next century.' It was essential to
complete the political underpinning of the union, if the 'evil spirits of
the past' were to be kept under control.
His words won support from a great majority of the Bundestag, in a
hastily-arranged debate on the future of Europe and the outcome of the last
European summit.
Yet Mr Stoiber, the political strongman of the conservative, Bavaria-based
Christian Social Union (CSU), the sister party of Mr Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union (CDU) in the ruling coalition, sat unrepentant.
After speaker after speaker from the government benches, and from the
opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), denounced his views, he said: 'I
stand before you condemned of high treason.'
Accusing his fellow politicians of suffering too long from guilt over their
national identity, he declared: 'We do not want a European nation in the
place of nation states.'
Even before yesterday's debate took place, Mr Rudolf Scharping, the leader
of the SPD, had pledged his support for Mr Kohl's European commitment, in a
remarkable demonstration of cross-party solidarity over the issue.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister and leader of the Free Democratic
Party (FDP), had warned that all his fellow ministers in the European Union
were shaken and dismayed by Mr Stoiber's views.
European union did not mean that Bavarians would lose their identity, he
said.
Yet it was left to Mr Kohl to make the resounding restatement of Germany's
European commitment, and seek to head off international fears of a growing
nationalist sentiment in the country.
'How political union will develop in all its details we still cannot say
today,' he said. 'Nobody wants a European mono-state. But I also hope that
nobody wants to go back to the nation-state thinking of the 19th century:
the rivalries of power politics of earlier times must be banished to the
past.
'Germany is and will remain our Fatherland. But a united Europe is our
common future.'
Mr Stoiber denied that he was anti-European. He believed in a European
union; he believed in a single market; but he rejected a European federal
state.

FT  12 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Activity in Burton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Disappointing finals from Burton prompted very heavy turnover in the shares,
which fell 10 3/4 to 66 1/4 p. Analysts downgraded their full-year forecasts
for the stores group as fears abounded that margin pressure will continue to
impact on revenues in the next financial year.
Although the pre-tax profits figure came at the bottom of market
expectations, it was the decline in sales since the year-end in August which
most worried commentators. 'The latest figures show that margins seem to be
under pressure in their core businesses,' said a stores specialist.
Burton blamed the fall on its stores modernisation programme which meant the
closure of a number of sites. However, analysts said this simply underlined
the difficulties facing the group in the short term and was a continuing
factor likely to overhang the shares. Burton launched a Pounds 163m rights
issue last January to cut debt and fund the accel-erated refurbishment
programme. Analysts downgraded to a range of Pounds 43m to Pounds 60m for
1994. By the close turnover came to 49m shares.
Switching out of Shell and into BP drove the latter up 2 to 359 1/2 p on
higher than usual turnover of 10m shares. Other oil issues attracted
intermittent bouts of selling pressure, with Enterprise 4 off at 461p and
Lasmo 2 1/2 easier at 128 1/2 p.
Pict Petroleum featured the small exploration stocks, racing up 9 to an
all-time high of 157p after the market began to pick up hints of a
substantial exploration success in North Sea well 29/2c. Pict has a 17.5 per
cent stake in this well, which optimists think could contain up to 100m
barrels of oil.
Scholes edged up to 173p after the chairman's positive remarks at the agm,
while Molyneux jumped 6 to 71p after the preliminary figures.
Cable and Wireless attracted a series of flurries of strong buying interest,
with numerous UK and overseas funds chasing the shares after the Hong Kong
market moved up to an all-time high point. The stock price settled 10
stronger at 495p on exceptionally heavy volume of 9.6m shares.
Vodafone was bolstered by hints of renewed US demand, finishing 5 1/2 firmer
at 546 1/2 p after keen turnover of 5.7m.
GEC shares were looking decidedly wobbly late in the session after one of
the market's most aggressive marketmakers offered the stock in size. The
close for GEC was 334p, down 7, with 6.1m traded.
Diversified media conglomerate Pearson, which owns the Financial Times,
advanced 16 to 574p after announcing a 63 per cent gain in third-quarter
profits to Pounds 100.6m. The announcement came with details of the Pearson
demerger of Royal Doulton.
The group is to give one Royal Doulton share for every 10 Pearson shares
held. After the figures were given, analysts lifted full-year forecasts to
around Pounds 209m.
Television shares were boosted by growing optimism that the government will
not oppose mergers within the industry. The most likely takeover candidates
are considered to be Anglia, which improved 16 to 415p, LWT, 10 higher at
508p, and Yorkshire Television, up 15 at 206p.
Publisher United Newspapers retreated 12 to 523p on growing nervousness over
the threat that VAT will be imposed on newspapers when the Budget is
announced at the end of November.
Mirror Group Newspapers held firm at 154p as the group said it was
considering a takeover bid for all or part of Irish Press Group.
With Paris closed, there was big turnover in Euro Disney as investors
continued to sell following Wednesday's announcement of huge losses and
financial restructuring require-ments. The shares again tumbled, closing 68
weaker at 368p after an unusually high 258,000 shares traded. The stock has
now fallen 29 per cent in the past two days.
Food manufacturing stocks were mostly resilient to the recent spate of
negative news and comments. Cadbury-Schweppes was lifted by a positive note
from Kleinwort Benson and the shares added 4 1/2 at 470p. Strauss Turnbull
and Hoare Govett were optimistic on prospects for Northern Foods, 6 higher
at 228p.
However, Tate &amp; Lyle, off 6 at 376p, was said to be undermined by cautious
comments from SG Warburg. Unilever was weighed down by nerves and
profit-taking ahead of results due today. The stock dropped 27 to 1103p.
In a dull drinks sector, Allied-Lyons stood out, the shares adding 6 at
552p, with Kleinwort Benson positive.
Cautious comments on Burton's current trading left Storehouse trailing, the
shares losing 9 to 185p.
Worries over the chief executive's post at Lucas Industries were said to
have once again undermined the shares, which finished 3 1/2 cheaper at 173p.
USM-quoted Sherwood Computers came under pressure at the outset of trading,
opening around 25p weaker at 120p and promptly plunging to 90p after
revealing that full-year results will fall below market expectations. By the
close the shares had fallen even further, settling 60 down at 85p, having
touched 83p.
Kewill Systems, on the other hand, was chased higher, closing 11 firmer at
255p, the shares' highest level since they plummeted almost 30 per cent in a
single session in January 1992. Kewill is scheduled to announce interim
figures on November 22.

FT  12 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Tesco deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Food retailers were once again prominent as one institution baled out of
Tesco, BZW buying the 29m shares at 173p and placing them in the market at
174p. Another institution is believed to have bought the entire stake.
The deal took turnover in the supermarket group to 65m shares, the biggest
daily volume for six years. The shares moved up as news of the deal reached
the market, dealers observing some buying interest in the stock at these
levels. They closed 4 ahead at 183p.
However, Tesco was not immune from the continuing stream of negative notes
on the sector, with James Capel yesterday joining the list of brokers to cut
forecasts for the leading supermarket stocks in the wake of the recent price
war developments. In addition, Hoare Govett and Smith New Court both issued
sell notes on J. Sainsbury. Its shares slid further, although a late rally
limited the fall to 2, closing at 366p. Kwik Save shed 7 to 592p and Argyll
Group 2 to 249p.

FT  12 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Mixed welcome for Shell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKET'S recent love affair with Shell Transport, which took the shares
up to a record 724p, was halted yesterday after the oil group announced
third-quarter results broadly in line with expectations. 'The stock market
is a very fickle place at present, and there is nothing wrong with these
numbers except that the super optim-ists have been marginally disappointed,'
said one sector specialist.
He said the oil sector had possibly been carried away on a sea of optimism
prompted by BP's recent excellent figures and those of the US majors.
Some of the market's more enthusiastic analysts, and specifically many of
those in the Netherlands, had pencilled in a net income forecast on a
replacement cost basis of Pounds 900m for the period. The actual figure came
out at Pounds 861m, at the top end of most UK forecasts.
Among the market bulls, Mr John Toalster at Strauss Turnbull described the
results as 'operationally good' and said he remained 'more than happy with
the shares', noting the positive points, such as gearing of only 3.8 per
cent and cash reserves of Pounds 6.7bn. Of the more cautious brokers, Mr
Nicholas Clayton at Nomura said: 'The long-term bull case for Shell remains
intact, but the shares look well up with events.'
Mr Fergus MacLeod at NatWest Securities commented: 'After outperformance of
25 per cent against a similar stock like Exxon this summer, driven by UK
optimism on these issues and dislike of BP, they are vulnerable to even mild
disappointments; our recommendation remains hold/underperform.'
At the close, Shell was 18 lower at 704p, with turnover of 10m the highest
single day's trade since May.

FT  12 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie 3,100 lost in uneasy market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORRIES over global bond yields were put on hold yesterday in a London
market lacking a lead because of the Armistice Day closure of several other
leading financial centres. The disappointing trend in New York bonds on
Wednesday offset the firm performance by Wall Street.
After an attempt to move forward, UK equities were halted by Shell Transport
reporting third-quarter figures below market hopes. With Euro Disney's
trading losses still a negative factor, and some UK company results also
unfavourable yesterday, the market lost most of its early gain, and also the
3,100 mark on the FT-SE 100 Index, which closed only 1.2 up on the day at
3,099.7.
Once again, stock index futures provided much of the direction for the
equity market. The leading securities houses, having used stock index
futures as a means of repositioning themselves in a deteriorating stock
market, were struggling to balance their commitments in both derivatives and
the underlying stocks.
Some traders expressed satisfaction with the day's market. Others, however,
noting some late institutional selling, feared that a sizeable cash-raising
might be pending. It was a slack day for UK economic data and investors were
evidently content to wait for the US October retail sales figures, due
today. Next week is heavily weighted with economic news from both the UK and
the US, and will also be featured by speculation ahead of the monthly policy
meeting at the Bundesbank.
Once again, there was heavy turnover in the food retailing stocks which have
suffered severely over the past month from clear signs that a price war is
hotting up in the sector. In contrast, the international blue chips, lacking
a convincing lead from New York, stayed out of the picture.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index continued to drift lower, shedding a further 5.8 to
3,434.6. Seaq volume remained fairly good at 743.8m shares compared with
778m on Wednesday when retail or customer business was worth Pounds 1.7bn -
at the higher end of this year's daily averages.
Firmness overnight in the Hong Kong stock market brought some support for
Far Eastern issues, notably HSBC and Cable and Wireless. Zeneca provided a
firm support among pharmaceuticals, as the shares rebounded from a period of
weakness.
Domestic stocks continued to tread water ahead of the Budget due at the end
of the month from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer.
Some building and construction stocks improved on underlying expectations
that a cut in base rates will not be long delayed but there was little
support for the store and retail issues after Burton Group, the high street
clothing retailer, reported higher profits but disappointing sales growth.
Bank stocks, also keen reflectors of base rate hopes in the stock market,
could make little headway and closed near to overnight levels having lost a
scattering of early gains.
Although inclined to leave the London market to its own devices until US and
European markets return to full power, UK strategists expressed concern over
the poor outcome of the US bond auctions which, they feared, may continue to
depress the US Federal bond sector.

FT  12 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TECHNICAL position-taking drove stock index futures yesterday in the absence
of any fundamental economic impetus, while business in traded options was
dominated by heavy activity in Asda, writes Peter John.
The December FT-SE futures contract was inspired by a powerful performance
from Wall Street on Wednesday. It opened sharply higher at 3,114 and the
mark-up provided a good basis for a strong start in the underlying equity
market. December hit a high of 3,122, but there was little serious buying to
sustain the rise and the contract petered off through the day.
By the close it had dribbled back to 3,102, near its low of the day and only
two points above the cash market. This compared with fair value of around 10
points. Turnover was very poor, with only 6,846 December contracts dealt by
the official close.
Many dealers considered that at 3,100, December was at the middle of a
100-point range which will continue until the Budget.
Traded options turnover was dominated by three large deals in Asda, said to
have been carried out by Sheppards on behalf of Cazenove. The deals
apparently involved 2,630 January 50 calls bought at 4p each, 2,730 January
60 puts bought at 11 1/2 p and 2,630 January 50 puts sold at 4p. Total
options turnover dipped to around 36,000 lots from just under 40,000
previously.

FT  12 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities end softer in
active holiday trade
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US SHARE prices edged to slightly lower levels yesterday in surprisingly
active trading for a Veterans Day holiday, which closed the country's banks
and shut the bond market, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 1.12 off at 3,662.43 and the Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 shed 1.06 to 462.66, but the Nasdaq composite was 2.48 higher
at 778.98. NYSE volume came to 287m shares.
Athough equity investors remain concerned about rising interest rates, the
closure of the bond market yesterday allowed them to concentrate on more
positive factors for most of the session. Chief among these was the growing
hope that the North American Free Trade Agreement will be approved by
congress in next Wednesday's crucial vote.
Until as recently as a few days ago, Nafta's chances of being passed by
legislators looked slim, and stocks were depressed by the prospect that the
new free trade axis between Canada, the US and Mexico would collapse at the
final hurdle.
Following Tuesday's televised debate between Mr Al Gore, the US
vice-president, and leading Nafta critic Mr Ross Perot, the markets now
believe that the pact's chances of success have improved.
In spite of the tentative optimism, equities shifted direction late in the
session amid weakness in bank and insurance stocks. In the final hour of
trading, the Dow slipped into negative territory as an earlier 11-point gain
dissolved.
McDonnell Douglas jumped Dollars 5 to Dollars 104 7/8 after the defence
contractor told analysts it had reduced debt and boosted margins. AT&amp;T rose
Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 56 3/4 in heavy volume as investors celebrated the
news that the telecommunications group had won a big contract to provide
equipment to Pacific Telesis.
Another Dow stock on the rise was Philip Morris, which put on Dollars 1 3/8
at Dollars 56 3/4 after analysts at two broking houses, Goldman Sachs and
Salomon Brothers, upgraded their ratings on the stock following recent rises
in cigarette prices.
The Gap climbed Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 38 5/8 , a new 52-week high, on
news of third-quarter earnings of 54 cents a share, up from 43 cents a year
ago and well above Wall Street forecasts.
Bear Stearns rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 22 3/8 following an article in the
Wall Street Journal highlighting the company's recent strong profits
performance. The stock was additionally helped by a buy recommendation from
Prudential Securities.
Canada
TORONTO extended its winning streak to four sessions as surging precious
metal shares led the way. The TSE 300 index closed 21.7 up at 4,291.3,
another record peak. Rises led falls by 428 to 340 after 79.5m share volume.

FEARS OF an imminent plunge in share prices were dispelled after morning
buying by financial institutions, and the Nikkei average closed higher in
spite of arbitrage unwinding later in the day, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The 225-issue index finished 36.81 better at 18,158.52, after a day's high
of 18,328.63 and low of 18,076.41. Volume totalled 314m shares, against
Wednesday's 386m, investors retreating to the sidelines ahead of Friday's
settlement of stock options contracts.
Rises led falls by 503 to 474, with 187 issues unchanged. The Topix index of
all first section stocks was off 0.20 at 1,534.58, and in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 3.93 to 1,238.18.
Government officials denied the possibility of fiscal support for the
slumping stock market. Mr Jiro Saito, vice-finance minister, said stock
prices should be formed on the market's supply and demand.
However, a rise in East Japan Railway and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
eased fears of further falls in share prices. JR East gained Y21,000 at
Y472,000 and NTT advanced Y14,000 to Y778,000, encouraging investor
sentiment.
Daishowa Paper lost Y260 to Y1,460 after Mr Ryoei Saito, its chairman and
known for his impressionist art collection, was arrested, allegedly for
bribing politicians. The case is the most recent revelation of a Japanese
prosecutors' crusade against political corruption. Construction companies,
which have also been investigation targets, firmed yesterday, Taisei adding
Y5 at Y635 and Shimizu Y16 at Y835.
Banks were still weak on arbitrage linked selling. Industrial Bank of Japan
fell Y50 to Y3,140 while Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank declined Y20 to Y2,180.
Securities houses, however, firmed on bargain hunting. Nomura Securities
rose Y70 to Y1,850 and Daiwa Securities Y20 to Y1,280.
Retailers were higher on hopes that deregulation will help earnings.
Ito-Yokado rose Y90 to Y5,380 and York-Benimaru put on Y140 at Y4,700.
Mining issues were depressed by profit-taking. Nikko Kyodo slipped Y5 to
Y428 and Sumitomo Metal Mining lost Y2 to Y837.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved up 72.25 to 20,236.28 in volume of 20.3m
shares. Construction and textile issues gained ground on bargain hunting.
Roundup
THE REGION'S markets generally built on Wednesday's gains. Bombay was closed
for a holiday.
HONG KONG climbed a further 3.7 per cent as overseas interest remained firm.
The Hang Seng index rose 349.39 to 9,674.83, slightly below its intraday
high of 9,714.24. Turnover jumped to HKDollars 9.3bn from Wednesday's
HKDollars 5.8bn.

FT  12 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Renewed foreign demand for golds
provides lustre - A look at Johannesburg's prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the ANC, called in September for the
lifting of all remaining economic sanctions against South Africa, investors
have been trying to assess the implications for the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange of the country's readmission to the global investment community.
The task is not simplified by a backdrop of political uncertainty and
violence.
In terms of traditional criteria the JSE, like many of the world's major
bourses, is in demanding territory. Although the industrial market has
performed poorly this year - it has risen by only 5 per cent to yesterday's
4,607from 4,359 at the start of the year - it is currently on a p/e ratio of
15, compared with an average of 9.5 since 1980.
This is only marginally below the 15.4 multiple seen just before the market
crashed in October 1987, and underlying earnings growth remains anaemic.
Notwithstanding the case for caution, Mr Johannes van der Horst, general
manager of investments at the life office Old Mutual, South Africa's largest
institutional investor, recently predicted that the industrial index will
have reached about 5,100 by October 1994, implying a total return (including
income) of 15 to 20 per cent for the year.
This assumes, uncontroversially, a continuing decline in interest rates and
modest earnings growth on the industrial index of 12 to 15 per cent. He
believes this could reach 25 per cent, 'if things go right for a change', a
hope supported by yesterday's preliminary GDP figures showing 8 per cent
growth in the third quarter.
Two points can be made about this analysis. First, if there is a crack in
world markets, and the US in particular, all bets are off. The JSE
Industrial index tracks the Dow very closely and if it turns down, the JSE
is sure to follow. Secondly, if there is no such crack, Mr van der Horst is
probably erring on the side of caution.
There are certainly some who believe that the market, in a year's time, is
likely to be closer to 6,000 than 5,100.
The case for greater optimism is based largely upon anticipation that there
will be significant foreign buying of the JSE in the coming year. Most of
the activity is expected to come from the US, where many investors have only
been freed recently from sanction constraints to invest on the JSE. The
current year has already seen a reversal of the pattern occurring in
previous years when foreigners were net sellers of equity.
This has largely been on the back of the US purchase of South African gold
shares, which helped to drive the golds index up to a high of 2,149 at the
end of July after starting the year at 768. After dropping to 1,457 in
mid-September, it has since recovered to its current level of 1,900 on the
back of a firmer bullion price.
While most Johannesburg brokers remain bullish about gold, US buying is
expected across a broad spectrum. Mr Richard Stuart of brokers Martin &amp; Co
notes that there is 'plenty of US money looking to come in'.
He says that US investors are not particularly concerned about ratings,
which are not high compared with their own market. They believe, too, that
earnings are depressed after four years of recession. 'They will just buy
the socks off the market. They know how their herd behaves - it will not
wait for earnings growth to come through.'
Although, in the first instance, this will be 'hot' money coming from the
hedge funds, and likely to cause great volatility on the JSE, more sober
money is also having a look.
There is talk of up to seven country (or Southern Africa) funds being set
up, while the prospect of the International Finance Corporation (IFC)
classifying South Africa as an emerging market and Morgan Stanley including
the coun-try in its international index could trigger significant index
buying.

FT  12 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt sees action in
financial sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR bourses continued their quiet spell, with Paris and Brussels closed
for a holiday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT saw some action in financials as the DAX index closed virtually
flat, easing 0.51 to 2,023.33.
Turnover fell from DM8.4bn to DM7.6bn. Commerzbank rose DM6.60 to DM350 on a
reported forecast from Bank Julius Baer in Zurich that the German bank may
lift its 1993 dividend by DM2 to DM12. Bayernhypo and Bayernverein, interest
rate sensitive, fell by DM1.50 to DM452.50, and by DM4.50 to DM503.
There was a similar pattern among insurers where the leading stock, Allianz,
eased DM8 to DM2,762 but AMB put on another DM30 to DM1,500, up by DM615, or
69 per cent since early June and by DM200 since September 30.
AMB had a mid-year run as AGF of France increased its stake. Its more recent
climb is being put down to ill-founded German speculation about the
prospects of a full AGF takeover. The price was not justified on
fundamentals, said a London analyst yesterday, putting AMB's true net asset
value at DM1,100 at best.
Elsewhere, Schering, the pharmaceuticals group, slipped DM15 to DM1,080 on
nine-month net profits down 3.5 per cent after a 3.4 per cent rise at the
half-way mark.
MILAN moved ahead after the cumulative 4.2 per cent decline of the previous
two days. The Comit index closed 5.52 higher at 538.97.
Mr Michele Pacitti of NatWest Securities believed that the weakness had been
overdone and that buyers were being attracted back by lower prices. He added
that some short covering was also evident ahead of next week's end of the
monthly account.
A firmer trend emerged among telecoms, which had led the market lower. Sip
added L191 or 6.4 per cent to L3,183 and Stet was L229 or 6.6 per cent
higher at L3,725.
Olivetti rose L88, or 5.8 per cent to L1,615 as the house arrest order
imposed on Mr Carlo De Benedetti was lifted by Rome magistrates.
AMSTERDAM was disappointed with Royal Dutch although the third quarter
results were broadly in line with expectations. The oil group shed Fl 4.50
to Fl 197.10 as the CBS Tendency index slipped 0.7 to 133.5.
Royal Dutch said that a strong performance in the oil and gas divisions was
offset by higher losses in the chemical sector. Unilever, which is due to
report today, lost Fl 3.90 to Fl 212.70.
ZURICH gave in to profit-taking which left the SMI index 22.0 lower at
2,720.1.
In a weaker insurance sector, Winterthur was SFr25 lower at SFr855 and Swiss
Re gave up SFr40 at SFr3,780.
A SFr30 rise to SFr5,900 in Roche certificates was attributed to buying by a
small Swiss bank.
Nordic markets differed. Unibors Securities upgraded index targets for both
Norway and Finland, forecasting 640 for the Oslo All-share by the year-end
and 1,600 for the Hex, as interest rates continue to decline.
STOCKHOLM regained its composure after Wednesday's fall with the
Affarsvarlden general index putting on 16.2 to 1,398.3. Turnover was
SKr1.3bn.
Astra, the pharmaceutical group, gained SKr4 to SKr163 in the B shares ahead
of third quarter figures due out today.
OSLO was pulled down by lower oil prices and a slight rise in three-month
interest rates. The All-share index lost 3.6 to 591.3 in turnover of
NKr351m.
Norsk Hydro fell NKr3.50 to NKr213.50.
COPENHAGEN saw weakness in Novo Nordisk, which fell DKr8 to DKr639 in spite
of Wednesday's 14 per cent increase in third quarter profits. The KFX index
ended down 0.37 at 103.09 in low turnover of some DKr480m.
ISTANBUL closed nearly 2 per cent stronger on hopes that the government may
accelerate the privatisation programme. The composite index added 325.7 to
15,197.2 in turnover of TL1,300bn.
TEL AVIV fell back as investors took profits after the market's recent
gains. The Mishtanim index lost 3.11 to 251.34 in turnover of Shk464m.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: Yen firms against the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN currency trading all but ground to a halt as markets in the US,
Canada, France and Belgium remained closed for national holidays, writes
Conner Middelmann.
Most currencies languished in directionless trading, and with many US market
participants expected to take a four-day weekend, today's session could be
similarly uninspired.
The Japanese yen saw most of the action yesterday and firmed markedly
against the dollar, which closed in London at Y106.45, down from Y107.20 on
Wednesday. The dollar's breach of key support at Y106.70/80 quickly sent it
sliding as low as Y106.25 before recouping some of the loss.
According to Mr Chris Furness, senior currency analyst at the market
analysis firm IDEA, there is intermediate support for the dollar at Y106.20,
with strong support at Y105.20.
'At that point we would expect to see some action from the Bank of Japan,'
he said. The Bank of Japan and the US Federal Reserve were rumoured to be
intervening in support of the dollar overnight, but most traders said they
saw no evidence of such actions.
The dollar recouped an initial fall against the D-Mark to finish at
DM1.6915, up from an intraday low of DM1.6855 and little changed from
Wednesday's close of DM1.6920. The next impetus for the dollar could come
from the release of October US retail sales figures at 1330 GMT today, with
most traders expecting a month-on-month 1.2 per cent gain.
One reason for the D-Mark's softer tone were statements from Bundesbank
director and central bank council member Otmar Issing, who said in a
magazine interview that the Bundesbank will explore its scope for future
rate cuts by 'probing with small steps'.
Mr Issing also said that further easing hinges on developments in Germany's
inflation rate and in its M3 money supply growth measure, and warned that
risks to German price stability are not yet fully subdued.
Also dampening the German currency was the softer call money rate, which
declined to around 6.35 per cent, from 6.45 per cent on Wednesday, amid
ample liquidity in the banking system.
Sterling extended the previous day's recovery and briefly breached the
psychologically important DM2.50 barrier. However, it ran out of steam at
that level and ended the day at DM2.5000, up from DM2.4975 on Wednesday.
'In these thin markets almost any trade will move the currency, but that
does not necessarily mean the move is sustainable,' commented a London
currency trader, who expects sterling to remain locked in a narrow range
until the November 30 Budget.
Traders today will be looking to the publication of UK September industrial
production numbers to provide evidence of the latest state of the UK
recovery. Information in recent days has suggested that it is patchy and
uneven.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Money Markets: Call rate eases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Money market activity in Europe was subdued yesterday by national holidays
in France, Belgium and the US, leaving rates stable on thin volume, writes
Conner Middelmann.
The rate for D-Mark overnight money slipped further to around 6.35 per cent
from Wednesday's 6.45 per cent on comfortable liquidity conditions in the
banking system.
Banks' ample reserves at the central bank and Wednesday's liquidity
injection at the Bundesbank's repo allocation softened the call rate. Again,
banks made no borrowings at the Bundesbank's 6.75 per cent Lombard facility,
reflecting the abundant supply of liquidity. The December three-month
Euromark futures contract rose 0.02 point to 93.86.
However, some traders noted that Friday's payment of some DM7bn for the new
Treuhandanstalt bonds and next week's tax outflows could drive the call rate
slightly higher.
Due to a German national holiday on Wednesday, next week's repos will be a
day earlier than usual, with the Bundesbank calling for bids on Monday and
allocating the funds on Tuesday.
Elsewhere, the Austrian National Bank said it will lower its GOMEX money
market intervention rate by 10 basis points to 6.1 per cent effective on
Friday.
The Bank of France at its repo operation today is expected to leave its 6.45
per cent intervention rate unchanged. Dealers do not expect it to ease rates
before Germany and the Netherlands have moved.
In the Netherlands, the call rate continued to trade below the 6.10 per cent
special advances rate at 6.00 per cent, reflecting ample money market
liquidity following recent generous market operations by the central bank.
This has many dealers expecting another near term cut in the advances rate.
Another uneventful day in the sterling money market left rates broadly
unchanged from the previous sessions. According to one money dealer, some
market participants have been scaling down their hopes for a substantial
base rate reduction accompanying the November 30 Budget.
The December short sterling futures contract eased 0.05 point to 94.41.
The Bank of England announced a shortage of Pounds 1.4bn, which it later
revised upwards to Pounds 1.45bn.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: A spanner in the cocoa cycle -
Indonesia is at odds with older producers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS no doubting the enthusiasm of cocoa experts for their industry.
During a half-hour 'cocoa break' at last month's International Conference on
Cocoa Economy in Bali an excited delegate was seen grasping a waitress. 'Is
this made from fermented or non-fermented Sulawesi beans?' he asked,
pointing to his hot drink.
Such eagerness may finally be rewarded with the industry climbing away from
a 10-year crisis of declining prices and over-production. Marking an
important shift, world consumption of 2.44m tonnes in 1992-93 outstripped
production and the past few months have seen a 25 per cent rise in world
prices to nearly Pounds 1,000 a tonne. With the cycle turning, prices are
likely to go higher and Mr S. Wateridge, economist at ED &amp; F. Man, the UK
commodity trading house, forecasts that cocoa prices will reach Pounds 1,400
a tonne within the next 18 months.
Softening the effect of the world production shortfall has been the recent
decision of the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) to sell down its
230,000 tonne buffer stock over five years. Mr Wateridge believes, however,
that the industry has 'effectively moved from a period of structural surplus
to structural deficit, (which) can only be eliminated by higher prices'.
Such talk has excited the interest of speculators who can see that today's
cocoa prices in real terms are less than a fifth of their 1978-79 peak. They
have been encouraged by forecasts of a continuing rise in world consumption
set against a projected decline in output from the Ivory Coast and Brazil,
two leading producers.
Cocoa's history of volatile prices may not be repeated, however. Almost
certain to spoil the speculators' party is Indonesia, where surging
production will balance declines elsewhere. The likely result is a low
ceiling on the current up-turn in world prices.
While the production of most cocoa nations has stagnated, Indonesia's has
risen from 7,000 tonnes in 1980 to 180,000 tonnes last year. Analysts say
the country will add 40,000 tonnes each year until the year 2000. Such
forecasts, however, are based on poor information, particularly regarding
the planted area of cocoa in Indonesia likely to enter production within
five years.
A weak statistical base has made a mockery of the ICCO's recent forecasts.
In January, the organisation said Malaysia and Indonesia would each lift
production by 50 per cent between 1991 and 1997 to 315,000 tonnes and
320,000 tonnes respectively. Ten months later, it has put Malaysia's 1997-98
production at 258,000 tonnes and Indonesia's at 463,000 tonnes. 'These huge
differences . . . clearly highlight the need to improve statistical
transparency on tree-stocks,' suggests Mr Henri Jason, senior ICCO
economist. Greater transparency, however, is unlikely.  Indonesia and
Malaysia are not members of the ICCO and have been conspicuously slow to
endorse the organisation's proposal to limit production to raise prices.
The conference highlighted a sharp divide between traditional producers in
Latin America and Africa, and relative newcomers in south-east Asia. Whereas
the low world price may be exacerbating the problems of the already poor
farmers in countries such as the Ivory Coast and Nigeria, in Indonesia cocoa
is seen as a means of alleviating rural poverty.
Behind the divide are varying levels of productivity in each country. The
Food and Agricultural Organisation estimates that in 1989-1991, the average
yield per hectare in African countries was 380 kg, compared with 779 kg in
Malaysia and 1,177 kg in Indonesia. As a result, cocoa is remunerative for
most farmers in south-east Asia but not in Africa. The answer would be for
African and Latin American countries to raise productivity, but there are
factors militating against this. Their plantations are older and less
productive, and their governments are removing subsidies from inputs such as
fertiliser as part of World Bank programmes.
While less productive countries would like higher prices, this depends
largely on Indonesia agreeing to limit its output. An agreement excluding
Indonesia would most probably only worsen the plight of African and Latin
American cocoa producers. As Mr Mario Amin, a Brazilian cocoa economist,
pointed out: 'In order to improve market prices, some short-term actions
have to be taken by the whole group (of cocoa producers) and not just in an
individualistic manner'.
Few of the conference delegates, however, expected Indonesia to act against
its interests. As Mr Wateridge explained, 'the other producers are their
(the Indonesians') rivals, not their partners', and if Indonesia is content
with current prices, there is little other producers can do.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Minister to lobby EU over
Spanish abattoirs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NICHOLAS Soames, UK agriculture minister, said he would protest strongly
to the European Commission about conditions in Spanish abattoirs after the
RSPCA released undercover videos of the grisly ways used to butcher
livestock.
Mr Soames said he was 'appalled' by the film of lambs being paralysed by
having their spinal chords severed with a screwdriver. 'It is completely
unacceptable. It is in flagrant abuse of the European rules and
regulations,' he said.
New European rules on abattoirs came into effect at the beginning of the
year stating that all animals must be stunned before slaughter.
Mr Alastair Mews, assistant chief veterinary officer at the RSPCA, said the
films showed that, although paralysed, many animals killed in Spanish
abattoirs were fully conscious when their throats were cut. 'I'm a hardened
vet, I've seen some ghastly things, but this is the worst ever,' Mr Mews
said. 'It's nothing short of organised barbarity.'
The RSPCA has visited six abattoirs in Spain with the same methods in use at
all of them. 'There are pigs which have not been stunned properly, they are
coming round while their throats are being cut and screaming,' said Mr Mews.
The organisation plans to put its findings to the Commission in the hope it
will tighten up enforcement of animal welfare rules in abattoirs across the
European Union.
Mr Mews said he believed Britain should withhold the export of live animals
to Spain in protest at conditions in the abattoir industry. Around 2m live
sheep are expected to be exported this year to Spain and France - about 20
per cent of the UK's total sheep-meat exports.
The RSPCA is urging farm ministers to introduce restrictions on the
transport of live animals because of the appalling conditions in which they
are kept. The organisation is pressing for journey times to be kept to eight
hours.
Mr Mews said that animals bound for slaughter on the continent often
travelled for up to 40 hours in inhumane conditions without food or water.
He said Germany, Holland, Luxembourg and the Scandinavian countries had
joined in enforcing maximum journey times and he wants the UK government to
follow.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Out of the continent of need -
An African is to head the UN's food agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MADELEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOOD deficit countries in Africa can expect a higher priority following the
election of Mr Jacques Diouf, a 55-year-old Senegalese diplomat, as the next
director-general of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation.
Chosen on Monday by FAO's 168-member countries, Mr Diouf takes over at the
start of 1994 for a six-year term. But he is taking a 'wait and see'
attitude to reforms in the UN's largest and probably most bloated agency.
With a mandate to help increase food output, and an annual budget of about
Dollars 7m a year, the FAO employs 6,200 people, about half of them at its
Rome headquarters. The candidate who ran Mr Diouf a close second in this
week's election, Mr Geoff Miller of Australia, wanted to get many of the
Rome staff out into the field.
Mr Diouf appears to have no such plans. 'I don't want at this stage to say
what I will cut and what I will not cut; this would be completely
irresponsible,' he said after his election. His first action would be 'to
make sure I have all the facts - facts concerning the operations, programme,
management, financial aspects, scientific quality and governance. Once I
have all these elements, then I will be able to know what I should do and if
reforms are needed.'
FAO's management under its present director general, Mr Edouard Saouma, has
come under strong criticism for an alleged dictatorial style and this has
led some countries to withhold their contributions in the last few years.
Mr Diouf will be the first African to hold the post and believes that the
significance of his election is that the continent with the 'greatest need
for a solution to the agricultural problem is Africa'. Over the last 10
years, worldwide food production has increased by 24 per cent and population
by 20 per cent, he pointed out, while 'in Africa production per capita went
down by 5 per cent. We have to correct that.'
With degrees in tropical economy and agricultural economics, Mr Diouf is a
former executive-secretary of the West Africa Rice Development Association
which is trying to increase rice output in the region.
FAO has to face challenges of food production, equity and justice, he says.
'We have 780m who do not have adequate access to food, 190m below the age of
five who have protein deficiency, and we expect by the year 2000 to have a
90m tonne cereal deficit in Africa and Asia. We have to get the
organisational, financial and human resources to face those challenges.'
He discounted the idea that land set aside for farming in North America and
Europe should be used to grow food for the third world. 'My main concern
will be to ensure that food deficit countries manage to produce enough for
their own security - that is the priority.'
Solutions to food problems do exist, he stressed: 'There are grounds for
hope and many countries are successful; if we can take the example of
successful countries we can move forward.' Promising to eradicate any
corruption he found within the FAO, Mr Diouf said the 'most important thing
about this organisation is its credibility'. Its funds come from member
nations, he said, who want to be assured that they are well used.
FAO's new chief is likely to be given a honeymoon period by western
countries that contribute most of its funds. The United States plans to
clear off Dollars 80m of arrears to the FAO by the end of 1995. The daunting
task facing Mr Diouf is to improve the efficiency of a cumbersome
organisation to enable it to make a more substantial contribution to
overcoming food shortages.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Talk of Opec cut revives oil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPORTS that Saudi Arabia might consider cuts in the production ceiling set
in late September by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries
yesterday lifted oil prices after the benchmark Brent blend fell to new
post-Gulf war lows.
The price of Brent blend for December rose to Dollars 15.65 in late London
trading after earlier falling to Dollars 15.20. One London trader said the
news agency report caused 'the market to perceive that Opec might cut the
ceiling' of 24.52m barrels a day. 'People were hesitating to sell,' he said.
The report, however, did not say whether Saudi Arabia was prepared to cut
its own 8m b/d quota.
The markets also strengthened as a result of the vote in the United Nations
Security Council last night to impose new sanctions on Libya that could
affect its ability to export oil. The ban includes new equipment, such as
high capacity pumps and refinery machinery, as well as parts and spares for
Libya's oil transport and export facilities. It is designed gradually to
erode the country's export capacity, but the uncertainty over Libyan exports
could help to underpin the oil prices temporarily, according to analysts.
The quick reaction to the Saudi report highlighted the growing nervousness
of the markets ahead of Opec's next ministerial meeting in Vienna on
November 23. Yesterday Mr Rehda Malek, the Algerian prime minister, was
quoted by a newspaper in the United Arab Emirates as saying that oil
producers 'should show greater restraint' in order to boost prices.
On Monday, Opec's Economic Commission meets to discuss its forecast for
short-term demand. It will prepare a report for Opec ministers which is
expected to show a continuing decline in demand for Opec oil. 'What we have
here is a combination of seasonal factors, . . . weak world demand and
stepped-up non-Opec production,' an Opec official said yesterday.

COFFEE lost Pounds 6 a tonne yesterday to reach Pounds 1,264 as traders
waited anxiously for the latest Brazilian coffee auction which was due to
take place after the market's close. Brazil's commitments to the producers'
retention scheme mean it had to buy 264,000 bags of coffee in last night's
auction and a final auction to be held today. Traders yesterday expressed
scepticism about whethe producers could manage to buy so much in such a
short time. A depressed NICKEL market extended early losses by the close,
dealers said. Trade support around the Dollars 4,600 a tonne level
eventually gave way and a sluggish fundamental picture did little to help
the price, which ended at Dollars 4,587.50 a tonne, down Dollars 105.
Analysts suggested nickel had further to fall. The Baltic Freight Index
(BFI) faced a testing period following the reform of its component routes
and its performance will have to be assessed in a year's time, Baltic
Exchange chairman Peter Tudball said. 'The BFI is effectively on trial until
next year. But if the (latest reforms) can't succeed in winning back more
volume (to the freight chartering market), it is difficult to see what
will,' he said.
