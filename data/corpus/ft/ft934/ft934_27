FT  12 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Demand for silver outstrips
supply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMAND FOR physical silver has soared in the past week so that vaults in
London cannot keep pace and there is a 14-day delay in processing
deliveries.
Much of the metal is on its way to India or Saudi Arabia. According to Mr
Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, Saudi
buying surged recently because of fears that the local currency, the riyal,
might be devalued. 'Silver is seen as a cheap hedge against devaluation,' he
pointed out.
'And the Indians are almost gobbling silver up now that their domestic
prices have fallen sharply,' he added. The Indian government's recent
decision to ease some of the import restrictions on silver has seen the
premium paid in India fall by about 14 per cent this year so that it is now
only Dollars 1.50 an ounce above the international price compared with the
peak of Dollars 8 it reached in 1990. 'The smugglers' loss has been the
Indian consumer's gain,' he said.
Mr Arnold suggested that the shortage of physical metal would be only
temporary. 'The world is awash with silver,' he pointed out. He estimated
that world silver stocks probably totalled more than 30,000 tonnes. 'Last
year's silver supply deficit was about 385 tonnes, according to the
Commodities Research Unit. So stocks could meet the deficit for no less than
82 years.'
The Xerox Corporation's recent claim that it had discovered a silver-free
film for use in the graphic arts sector of the photographic market was also
bad news for silver producers, he said. If Xerox captured half this
particular market it would be the equivalent of cutting consumption by 4 per
cent. 'Prices of anything are made at the margin. A loss of 4 per cent
consumption has to mean lower average silver prices, all things being
equal.'
Silver's price has recovered strongly since news of the Xerox discovery
first hit the market two weeks ago at which time it dipped to Dollars 4.20 a
troy ounce. Last night it closed in London at Dollars 4.545, down 3 cents.
Eastman Kodak of the US said it will soon begin customer testing of a new
prints-from-slides process using the digital PFX system. But an official
said it would have no significant impact on silver usage.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME cuts ring-dealing charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Metal Exchange is to cut contract levy charges to be paid by
ring-dealers next year by nearly 60 per cent - from 12p to 5p per 'lot'. Its
action is in response to complaints from some ring-dealing members that they
are not getting a fair deal.
The exchange is experiencing record business and it further demonstrated its
financial strength yesterday by deciding to return Pounds 2m of the levies
raised this year to all clearing members. It paid a Pounds 1.5m levy rebate
for 1992.
The LME board has been wrestling for some time with the problem of how to
handle complaints from some of its 16 ring-dealing members that they were
carrying a greater share of the burden of running the exchange and facing
more risks than non-ring-dealing members but not getting commensurate
returns.
Now, as a first move, the board has decided that next year the ring-dealers
will pay lower contract levies - those for other LME members remain at 12p a
'lot'.
For four years the LME's business in tonnage terms has risen at an annual
average of 30 per cent. By the end of October this year it was 45 per cent
ahead of the same months in 1992. Turnover is expected to reach USDollars
1bn compared with Dollars 700m last year. The LME reported pre-tax profit
just above Pounds 1m for 1992 compared with Pounds 1.4m a year earlier.

GRUPO Financiero Serfin, the Mexican finance house, filed a registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a global offering
of 6.5m American depository shares and 9m series L limited voting shares in
Mexico, AP reports from Mexico.
The company said it would offer the ADSs, each representing four series L
shares, through an underwriting syndicate managed by CS First Boston, Morgan
Stanley and Serfin Securities.
The company said it would make the 9m L share offering through a Mexican
syndicate in Mexico, and the Mexican government would sell 5m of the L
shares. The offering price for the ADSs would be determined by the price for
its series B shares on the Mexican stock exchange.

FT  12 NOV 93 / International Bonds: African Development Bank to re-finance
Dollars 800m debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE African Development Bank (AfDB) intends to re-finance the equivalent of
Dollars 800m worth of maturing debt in the Eurobond market next year. It
also plans to raise the equivalent of Dollars 200m to Dollars 300m in new
funding in 1994.
This year, the AfDB has raised Dollars 850m in the Eurobond market and in
the Samurai market, the Japanese domestic bond market for foreign borrowers.
Mr Kofi Bucknor, AfDB chief treasurer, said the maturing debt was
denominated in D-Marks, French francs and Swiss francs and was likely to be
re-financed in those currencies or in the dollar.
Mr Bucknor, who was in London yesterday to meet investors, added that the
AfDB would continue to be an active user of the Samurai market where it was
able to obtain favourable funding rates.
The AfDB achieved a yield spread of 45 basis points over Japanese government
bonds on its offering of 20-year Samurai bonds earlier this year. This was
marginally below the yield spread of 48 basis points over US Treasuries on
the bank's Dollars 500m 30-year Eurobond issue which was launched in March.
Among yesterday's issues, the 1996 Olympic Games in Sydney gave a touch of
glamour to the first Eurobond offering from Federal Airports Corp (FAC), the
Australian government-owned airport operator.
FAC raised Dollars 200m through an issue of 10-year Eurobonds. Due to the
holiday in the US yesterday, the pricing of the bonds was postponed until
today, when they will be priced to yield 65 basis points over the
when-issued 10-year US Treasury.
Lead manager CS First Boston said the bonds had a good reception among
European investors who were keen to increase their exposure to the
Australian corporate sector after several years of neglect.
Fears that US interest rates could start to rise in the coming months are
likely to prompt more corporate borrowers to tap the Eurodollar sector.
National Power, the UK's largest electricity generator, said yesterday that
it was planning to launch a dollar-denominated Eurobond offering, via
Merrill Lynch.
The market expects the offering to raise Dollars 300m, have a maturity of 10
years and be priced to yield 65 to 70 basis points over underlying US
Treasuries.
The German state of Baden-Wurttemberg raised DM500m through an offering of
20-year Eurobonds. However, holders have a put option on the bonds from
2003. Lead manager Morgan Stanley said the put option enabled investors to
choose the final maturity of the bonds.
Two UK building societies took advantage of continued investor demand in the
UK for high-yielding paper to raise capital in the Eurosterling sector.
Alliance &amp; Leicester extended the maturity profile of the Eurosterling
floating rate note (FRN) market when it raised Pounds 200m worth of senior
debt through an offering of seven-year FRNs.
Lead manager Samuel Montague said yesterday's issue of FRNs offered
investors a yield spread of 30 basis points over Libor, eight basis points
more than the current yield spread on Alliance &amp; Leicester's five-year
notes.
'Yield spreads on deals at the shorter end have tightened so investors are
willing to take on another two years for the extra yield,' said an official
at Samuel Montague.
Nationwide Building Society raised a total of Pounds 200m yesterday, by
launching a Pounds 125m offering of 25-year Eurobonds and by increasing its
13 1/2 per cent Pounds 125m Eurobond issue due 2000 by Pounds 75m.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: Approval of budget cuts lifts Italian
issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S high-yielding government bond markets enjoyed the biggest gains on
a day when some European markets and the US were closed for public holidays.
Italian government bonds gained about half a point, benefiting from the news
that the Senate had finally approved cuts for the 1994 budget which will cut
L31,000bn from the deficit. The budget legislation will now pass to the
lower chamber.
Spanish government bonds ended firmer following the release of poor
unemployment figures which showed the Spanish jobless rate rising to 17.2
per cent in October.
Dealers said the jobless news had raised some hopes that the Bank of Spain
would lower interest rates at today's repo. The Spanish bond futures
contract rose 0.06 on the day to end at 101.97, having touched a high of
102.23.
GERMAN government bonds ended lower in thin trading and the bund futures
contract saw selling pressure at the 99.62 level, falling back to close at
99.46.
Mr Otmar Issing, Bundesbank board member, was reported saying that the
central bank would cautiously test the scope for further interest rate cuts
as price and money supply growth pressures eased, but dealers said the news
did not have much impact on the market.
INDEX-LINKED gilts were the main movers in the UK government bond market
yesterday, with dealers suggesting that the fall of over half a point for
the second consecutive day was probably due to a couple of big US investors
taking profits.
Conventional stocks saw little activity, with longer-dated gilts slipping
about  1/32 . The December long gilt future closed  1/16 lower at 113 7/8
while the December short sterling contract settled five basis points lower
at 94.40 as dealers said hopes of a near-term cut in the base rate appeared
to be evaporating.
JAPANESE government bonds ended weaker on profit-taking, in the wake of the
recent rally which saw the futures contract reach a six-year high earlier in
the week.
The rate on three-month certificates of deposit fell to an all-time low of
2.32 per cent yesterday.
Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, said he expected
money market rates to continue to decline.
'The bond market has discounted a lot of the recent bond-positive news, but
given the way the economy has performed recently there's still further room
for the market to rally,' he said.
The March futures contract, which took over yesterday as the most heavily
traded contract from the December one, opened at 114.45 and ended at 114.30.
The December contract fell to 115.10 from 115.17.

restructuring agreed

<TEXT>
A GROUP of US investors in Trump Taj Mahal, the debt-laden Atlantic City
casino, has agreed with Mr Donald Trump, the New York property developer, to
put together a restructuring of the Taj Mahal's debt and equity securities.
The move will allow Mr Trump to buy the remaining partnership interests in
the casino that he does not already own. It will also satisfy debt
obligations of the Taj Mahal Associates company, which owns the casino, and
reduce Mr Trump's considerable personal debts.
Mr Trump built the Taj Mahal in 1990 just as his group's finances began to
crumble and the local gaming market began to deteriorate.
The central purpose of the deal is to reduce the Taj Mahal's Dollars 828m in
long-term debt and guaranteed obligations. Under the terms of the
restructuring, that figure will be reduced to about Dollars 692m of
long-term debt once the deal is concluded next March.

PASMINCO, the Australian zinc and lead producer, yesterday announced plans
to raise ADollars 88m (USDollars 58m) of new capital by a private placement
of 72.1m new shares at ADollars 1.22 each, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
The move will increase Pasminco's issued capital by about 10 per cent.
Pasminco's two biggest shareholders, CRA and North Broken Hill Peko will
both participate in the issue, subscribing for approximately 21.6m shares,
or 3 per cent of the pre-placement issued capital. This is the maximum they
are allowed to subscribed for under the Australian law.
CRA and North Broken Hill will fund the purchase by converting approximately
ADollars 26.4m of a Dollars 40m drawn portion of a loan facility which they
have provided to Pasminco. The total facility is for ADollars 100m.
Pasminco said that it would use the funds to reduce debt, which has already
fallen recently due to the sale of a UK zinc smelter to MIM. It added that
negotiations with the Dutch authorities over the Budelco zinc smelter in the
Netherlands, in which it holds a 50 per cent interest, had 'progressed
constructively' and it expects agreement to be reached before the end of
1993.

FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Microsoft alters distribution
chain for Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MICROSOFT, the world's largest personal computer software supplier, is
changing its European distribution methods as part of its strategy of
retreating from activities other than software development and manufacture.
It plans to eliminate one link in the software distribution chain to
European customers.
The group intends to open a European distribution centre at its
manufacturing facility in Dublin, Ireland, which will eventually provide a
single warehouse and distribution service for its European distributors.
In the UK, Microsoft's principal distributors are Merisel and Frontline.
The new Irish distribution centre will remove the need to carry inventory in
each country and Microsoft's warehouses will be phased out over the next
year.
The company has been acting as its own master distributor in Europe,
importing products separately in each country and supplying them to
distributors.
'Microsoft is a software company, not a distributor and if we are to
continue to be successful we must focus on this,' said Mr Bernard Vergnes,
president of Microsoft Europe.
'In the past five years we have seen Europe move towards being a single
market with more companies wanting to do business at a pan-European level,'
he added.
The company is working with distributors to establish electronic links which
will enable products to be manufactured to order.
Distributors will place orders directly with the manufacturing plant.
Microsoft operates this system in the US where it deals with only three main
distributors.
In comparison, it has arrangements with almost 100 distributors in Europe.
The company's Irish manufacturing plant is producing software at the rate of
about 12m units a year.

NEDCOR, South Africa's fourth-largest bank, met market expectations with a
17 per cent rise in earnings per share to 251 cents in the year to
September, from 215 cents last time.
The results, which are identical to those of its two main competitors,
confirm the bank is in sound health. Its shares have enjoyed a substantial
re-rating over the past year, their price rising to R24 from a low of R13.75
in November 1992.
There was a good performance from the Perm, the home loan arm of the group,
which has encountered problems through its high exposure to the difficult
township market. The Perm increased net income by 22 per cent to R85m
(Dollars 19.3m) from R70m.
Mr Richard Laubscher, managing director, said the Perm's bad debt level was
20 per cent down on last year, and that 94 per cent of the total bond book
was fully paid up to date.
Net interest income in the group rose by 11 per cent to R1.8bn from R1.62bn,
while other income rose by 14 per cent to R1.18bn from R1.04bn. Specific and
general risk provisions increased by 22 per cent to R282m from R231m - more
than that of some competitors. Mr Chris Liebenberg, chief executive, said:
'We want to be as conservative and realistic as possible.'
A 9 per cent fall in the tax bill helped boost attributable earnings by 23
per cent to R501m from R408m.
The dividend rose by 17 per cent to 77 cents per share from 66 cents. Group
advances grew to R40bn from R34.7bn and total assets rose to R51.7bn from
R47.3bn.

FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Litigation gives Mitsui second
thoughts - A look at the setback in plans for a merger of two Japanese
pharmaceutical groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON SIGNING a merger agreement with Toyama Chemical earlier this year,
executives at Mitsui Pharmaceuticals were delighted at extending their range
of antibiotics and issued an optimistic profit forecast for the new
company's first year of trading.
But a closer look at Toyama Chemical has prompted Mitsui Pharmaceuticals and
the Mitsui group to step back from the agreement reached in April, and
request that the two sides restart negotiations in the hope of signing
another contract late next year.
Mergers are rarely simple in Japan, as prospective partners are often unable
to agree on the mixing of their rigid management hierarchies. But the
scrapping of the Toyama-Mitsui agreement highlights how the excesses of the
so-called 'bubble era' of the late 1980s have added to the risks of
corporate marriage.
The delay is a loss of face for both companies, but Mitsui Pharmaceuticals,
a subsidiary of Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals, thought it safer to wait until the
settlement of litigation pending over the collapse of a Toyama affiliate,
Yuho Chemical, which had debts estimated at Y40bn (Dollars 373m) when it
failed in late 1990.
Yuho was a conservative chemicals company until the late 1980s, when it
diversified into property development and became friendly with the recently
dissolved Itoman trading house group, which found itself entangled in art
scams and underworld deals.
Sanyo General Capital, a financial affiliate of Sanyo Securities, a
second-tier Japanese broker, has launched a legal action against Toyama
Chemical to recover Y5bn in compensation for loans made to Yuho.
The prospect of inheriting at least one legal action, and perhaps more if
the case was successful, led Mitsui Pharmaceuticals to think again. The
retreat was complicated, however, as Sakura Bank, at the centre of the
Mitsui family of companies, is also a main bank of Toyama Chemical.
'In principle, there is no problem, but the companies will make a new
agreement based on the most recent financial data. We will also solve
problems relating to computer systems, company rules and the legal case,'
Mitsui Toatsu said.
Mitsui says that 'we are told' that Toyama will have no responsibility, but
'we will see what happens in the court case'. Toyama is more enthusiastic,
arguing that the merger will definitely be remade when the two sides sort
out differences over management structures and computer systems.
These are the more common disagreements between potential merger partners,
along with asset valuation, which was sometimes arbitrary before the bubble
era, and has since become an even greater source of contention. Companies
have been very reluctant to write down the value of assets in the wake of
the bubble's collapse.
An emerging problem is redundancy payments, as many Japanese companies have
failed to keep pace with retirement benefit schemes, partly because only 40
per cent of the provisions are tax deductible. But the need to cut
workforces creates a larger than expected liability for companies merging
with or acquiring an underfunded partner.
In the longer-term, as Toyama and Mitsui discovered even before joining
hands, keeping middle managers happy and streamlining the hierarchy are
difficult to balance. Nippon Steel, the world's leading steelmaker, was
created in 1970 through the merger of two companies, and the presidency is
still alternated between managers who joined from the two different streams.
However, Mitsui had been prepared to tackle these difficulties in the hope
of building a pharmaceuticals company comparable to those of the Mitsubishi
and Sumitomo keiretsu, or corporate families. Mitsui also said that it and
Toyama had research and marketing systems that would complement rather than
compete with each other.
Despite these benefits, the Mitsui group has decided that it doesn't want a
share of Toyama's legal troubles. Another new characteristic of the
post-bubble climate is a greater willingness by Japanese companies to take
legal action to settle disputes.

FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Economic slump boosts Japanese
suit makers

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S discount suit makers saw interim profits for the six months to
September surge as consumers turned to cheaper products due to the prolonged
economic downturn.
Aoyama Trading, the leading manufacturer and retailer of office workers'
blue suits, reported a 34.5 per cent jump in non-consolidated pre-tax
profits to Y12.2bn (Dollars 114m) on a 38.7 per cent rise in sales to
Y76.6bn. After-tax profits soared by 41 per cent to Y7.2bn.
The company, which is known for its aggressive discounts, has been actively
launching new outlets throughout the country.
It opened a store in the luxury shopping area of Ginza in Tokyo this year.
For the full year to March, Aoyama expects a 15.9 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits to Y35bn on a 32.5 per cent increase in sales to Y150.9bn.
Aoki International said its interim pre-tax profits rose by 8.3 per cent to
Y5.3bn, helped by an expansion of sales outlets.
Half-year sales advanced by 10 per cent to Y36.1bn, while after-tax profits
rose by 3.5 per cent to Y2.5bn.
The company said sales at existing stores were stagnant because of the bad
summer weather, but it saw an increase in demand for its original design
items. For the full year to March, Aoki expects a 20.7 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits to Y13.6bn on a 16.4 per cent advance in sales to Y94bn
after the planned launch of 21 new stores.
Sankyo, the Japanese drugs company, said pre-tax profits for the half year
to September rose by 11 per cent to Y39.7bn due to firm sales and
cost-cutting efforts.
The company posted a 2.7 per cent increase in sales to Y206.2bn and a 27 per
cent rise in after-tax profits to Y17.2bn.
For the year to March, the company expects a 9.5 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits to Y77bn, while sales are expected to remain almost flat at Y399bn.

red in first half

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MITSUBISHI Petrochemical, the Japanese plastics and chemical producer,
reported a Y5.4bn (Dollars 50m) pre-tax loss for the first half to
September, as leading customers demanded price reductions during a difficult
trading period.
In the same period last year, Mitsubishi Petrochemical had a pre-tax profit
of Y6bn, but it slipped into the red as sales in the first half this year
were down 9.6 per cent to Y169.7bn, partly because industrial customers were
hurt by the yen's appreciation and the advantage of cheaper imported raw
materials was lost.
Profits were eroded by maintenance work at a petrochemical complex. .For the
full year to March, it is forecasting a pre-tax loss of Y5.5bn, against a
profit of Y8.3bn last year, on sales of Y350bn, down from Y372bn. It said an
interim dividend would not be paid.
Asahi Chemical Industry, the chemicals, plastics and synthetic fibre
producer, said its pre-tax profits fell by 50 per cent to Y8.77bn during the
half year to September and sales by 6.3 per cent to Y456.4bn.
It expects profit for the full year of Y22bn, down from Y35.2bn last year
and from its previous forecast of Y30bn.
Teijin, Japan's leading maker of polyester, suffered a 33.2 per cent fall to
Y6.06bn in pre-tax profit for the first half. Textile sales fell 13.7 per
cent and chemical sales 9.5 per cent.
Total sales slipped 8.8 per cent to Y154.8bn, and sales for the year are
forecast at Y320bn, a fall from Y332bn last year. Pre-tax profit for the
year is expected to be Y11.5bn, compared with Y17.5bn last year.

FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Shares in Dreyfus surge after
merger talk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Dreyfus Corporation rose sharply yesterday after an announcement
by the New York mutual fund group that it had been in merger talks with an
unnamed financial institution sparked speculation that the company would
become a bid target in the financial services industry.
After rumours of an impending takeover had driven Dreyfus's stock up Dollars
4, or 10 per cent, to Dollars 44 7/8 , the company was forced to issue a
statement saying it had been in merger discussions with an unnamed company,
but they had been terminated.
The announcement depressed the stock price, but they still ended the day up
Dollars 2 at Dollars 42 7/8 as investors bet that other companies would soon
display an interest in acquiring Dreyfus, which is one of the country's
biggest mutual fund companies with Dollars 80bn in assets under management.
Industry analysts said yesterday that a banking group had probably been in
merger discussions with Dreyfus. The mutual fund industry has enjoyed
unprecedented growth over the last few years and banks have been eager to
get into the market. Analysts suggested that one of several big banks,
including NationsBank, Mellon Bank, Banc One and JP Morgan, would be keen to
buy the fund group.

FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Walt Disney's historical vision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALT DISNEY, the US entertainment group, yesterday announced plans to build
a new theme park, featuring re-enactments of events in American history, on
a 3,000-acre site in northern Virginia, just west of Washington, DC.
The company said the park and a related shopping complex could open as early
as 1998 if agreements on development were reached with local and state
governments.
It would create some 3,000 jobs in the area.
Confirmation of the long-rumoured scheme came just 24 hours after Euro
Disney, the Paris theme park in which Walt Disney has a 49 per cent stake,
reported annual losses of Dollars 930m.
Virginia is a growing tourist destination, with attractions which include
the restored colonial village of Williamsburg and several theme parks,
including those operated by Paramount Communications and brewer
Anheuser-Busch.
Disney said its park would be different from the others it operates which
focus on Disney characters, in both subject matter and presentation.
It would use new technology to allow visitors to 'participate' in historical
events by, for example, piloting a world war two aircraft and taking part in
Revolutionary and Civil War battle re-enactments.
Visitors would also meet life like dummies of US presidents using Disney's
audio-animatronics technology.
The village, near the civil war battlefield of Bull Run, would also include
a high speed 'thrill' attraction called the industrial revolution.
The project has yet to receive planning permission, and complications here
could scupper it: Disney abandoned a Dollars 3bn marine park in Long Beach,
California, which it had announced in 1990, because of regulatory and
environmental concerns.
Congressional sources said the company hoped the Virginia park would attract
up to 30,000 visitors a day.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GAP, the US casual clothing store chain, impressed Wall Street yesterday
by reporting a double-digit increase in earnings despite a flat retailing
environment.
Net income advanced to Dollars 78.9m, or 54 cents, compared with Dollars
62m, or 43 cents, in the corresponding period of 1992, when excessive
inventory forced the clothing chain to mark down many prices.
The results exceeded the forecasts of analysts, who had expected earnings of
47 to 50 cents, and triggered so much buyer interest that stock trading was
briefly suspended. When activity resumed, the share price shot up Dollars 3
1/4 to close at a 52-week high of Dollars 39 5/8 .
In the three months to the end of October, sales rose by a moderate 8.6 per
cent to Dollars 898m, against Dollars 829m in the year-earlier quarter. The
gain comes during a disappointing season for some US apparel retailers.
Mr Thomas Kully, an analyst with William Blair, a New York securities firm,
said the chain maintained a tighter grip on its inventory this autumn by
limiting its collection to the most popular items.
In the nine months to end October, net income was up to Dollars 149.1m, or
Dollars 1.03, on revenues of Dollars 2.23bn, a 10 per cent gain.

FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Pacific Bell to invest Dollars
16bn in 'super-highway'
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PACIFIC Bell, the telephone company serving California, yesterday announced
plans to spend Dollars 16bn over seven years to create a multi-media
communications super-highway across its territory. It also awarded American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph a contract estimated at some Dollars 5bn to supply key
parts for the system.
The project is among the largest network modernisations announced by a local
US telecommunications group as both these companies and cable television
operators start to pour capital into the creation of inter-active,
multi-media communications networks.
It is also a coup for AT&amp;T, which will act as systems integrator for the
network and supply much of its hardware. Its contract is said by Pacific
Bell to be the 'single largest network equipment purchase in
telecommunications history'.
Pacific Bell, a subsidiary of the Pacific Telesis telecommunications group,
said the modernisation programme would begin next year and initially
concentrate on the heavily populated centres of San Francisco, Los Angeles,
Orange County and San Diego.
More than 1.5m homes would be hooked up to the super-highway by the end of
1996 and more than 5m homes - or 60 per cent of those it now serves  - would
be connected by the end of the decade.
In addition to advanced telecommunications, Pacific Bell intends to offer
video services, bringing it into direct competition with local cable
television operators.
However, before it can get into the video market it must first overcome a
ban on telecommunications companies entering this area, imposed under the
1984 cable act. Another local telecommunications group, Bell Atlantic, has
already won this right through court action.
The investment is a bold step for Pacific Telesis, which has held back from
the US rush into multi-media services and alliances between programme
providers and communications distributors. It said yesterday it believed it
could obtain programming without taking an equity position in a content
provider.
The company said it could fund the upgrade by cutting Dollars 500m to
Dollars 1bn from its cost structure, with no additional expense to
rate-payers and no additional debt for now.

A LEANER, more competitive Air Canada continued its turnround in the third
quarter despite slow economic recovery and slack operating revenues.
It reported third-quarter operating revenues of CDollars 1.03bn (USDollars
795m), up 2 per cent from a year earlier, and operating income of CDollars
94m, against CDollars 39m. It was the fourth consecutive year-to-year gain
at the operating level and an improvement over the June quarter.
Final net profit was CDollars 43m, or 56 cents a share (fully diluted),
against a loss of CDollars 14m, or 19 cents.
For the nine months, revenues rose slightly to CDollars 2.73bn and operating
income was CDollars 82m, against a loss of CDollars 97m. After restructuring
and financial charges, the net loss was CDollars 236m, or CDollars 3.20,
against a loss of CDollars 307m or CDollars 4.14.
Air Canada has raised about CDollars 200m with the issue of 35m units at
CDollars 5.75 per unit to an underwriting group led by RBC Dominion
Securities. Each unit comprises one new common share and one half a warrant.
A full warrant will allow the holder to buy one Air Canada share for
CDollars 6.25 over the next two years.

FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Dark horse Nextel looks for a
winning line - A look at a company making an impact in the US cellular
telephone sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXTEL Communications, a six-year-old New Jersey radio dispatch service
company, this week burst on to the scene as a potential new rival to
established US cellular telephone services. The little-known company came
into the limelight with the acquisition of mobile radio spectrum rights from
Motorola of the US for Dollars 1.8bn in stock.
Formerly called Fleet Call, Nextel is the second largest company, behind
Motorola, in the US 'specialised mobile radio' (SMR) market, providing radio
dispatch communications services for taxis, delivery vans and the like.
Growth in the SMR sector has been constrained by the lack of radio-frequency
capacity in most US cities, making it a sleepy backwater in an otherwise
booming business.
But Nextel has ambitious plans to build its SMR business into a national
network, using new digital technology from Motorola which in addition to
dispatch services will provide mobile telephone, messaging and paging
services.
The Motorola deal tops a series of smaller transactions through which Nextel
has acquired radio licences and stakes in other companies with licences.
These deals have given it access to 45 of the 50 most populous regional
markets in the US.
Since its formation Nextel has raised Dollars 1.2bn through public and
private equity and debt offerings. But the company has paid for most of
these acquisitions with stock, taking advantage of a run-up in its share
price from Dollars 15 at the beginning of last year to Dollars 47 1/8
yesterday on the New York stock exchange.
In another deal announced this week, Nextel reached an agreement with Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone of Japan, one of the world's largest
telecommunications companies.
NTT will assist Nextel with the design and management of a network
connecting all of its SMR sites throughout the US. To cement the deal, NTT
will acquire a 1 per cent stake in Nextel, or about 1.5m shares, for Dollars
75m.
Motorola, which received a 20 per cent stake in Nextel in exchange for its
radio licences, has also provided the company with Dollars 260m in credit
facilities for the purchase of Motorola equipment.
Other Nextel shareholders include Comcast, a cable television and cellular
phone service company, which holds a 12 per cent stake, with rights to boost
its holding to 30 per cent; Matsushita Communications, which owns about 5
per cent, and Northern Telecom.
Investors have been lured to Nextel by the promise of a high-growth US
market for mobile communications services. There are about 13m cellular
phone subscribers in the US, and the market is expected to grow 40 per cent
this year.
Nextel's digital mobile phones will not be compatible with existing analogue
cellular services. However, the company believes it can attract customers by
offering 'integrated' mobile communications services and improved quality.
'Currently 64 per cent of our dispatch customers also carry a cellular
telephone, while 53 per cent carry a pager,' said a Nextel spokesman.
For these and the increasing number of business travellers who carry a
collection of electronic devices, integrated communications services with a
single multi-purpose handset is expected to have a strong appeal.
Nextel will also provide integrated billing and says its prices will compare
favourably with multiple services purchased separately from competitors.
'No longer will customers be required to carry two or three pieces of
hardware, paying two or three bills to two or three different service
providers,' said Mr Brian McAuley, president and chief executive of Nextel.
Nextel is testing its technology and marketing strategy in Los Angeles where
it began a pilot project with about 500 customers this summer.
Full scale marketing will begin in January, with Nextel targeting businesses
such as estate agents, film and TV producers, caterers and others who
typically carry more than one communications device. Eventually, Nextel aims
to tap into the growing consumer market for mobile communications.
Nextel plans to move quickly. It aims to have a California-wide network in
operation early next year, with New York and Chicago to follow by mid-1994
and a nationwide service by the end of 1995.
The cost of deploying its services across the US could be more than Dollars
1bn, and it may be years before it turns in a profit, analysts warn. In the
year ended March 31, Nextel lost Dollars 9.6m on Dollars 53m revenue.
Competition is also mounting, with leaders in the US cellular telephone
market, such as GTE and PacTel Cellular, beginning to upgrade to digital
technology. Personal Communications Service 'Pocket' telephones are also on
the horizon, promising yet another option for mobile communications.
So far Nextel is the only company in the US mobile communications market to
promise a nationwide service. With the cellular telephone industry locked in
a battle over digital technology standards, Nextel may become the dark horse
that comes out ahead in the mobile communications race.

FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: IBM may sell off Federal Systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines is 'exploring the possibility' of selling
all or part of its Federal Systems Company, a US-based division that sells
computers and services to the Federal government.
IBM said it had been contacted by several companies acting individually,
which were interested in acquiring all or part of FSC. In the past, similar
inquiries have been turned down. Now, however, faced with declining profits,
IBM is apparently more receptive to such offers.
'We are evaluating several proposals,' a spokesman said, while emphasising
that no decision had been made. FSC sells almost exclusively to the US
government. Its contracts typically involve complex systems integration
projects, such as air traffic control.
A large portion of its business is with the US Defense Department and the
division is also responsible for sales of office computers to all government
agencies.
The distinctive nature of FSC's business makes it a potential candidate to
be sold as IBM struggles to reduce costs and boost its profitability.
FSC employs 11,400 people, almost all of them in the US. The division posted
1992 revenues of Dollars 2.2bn, up from Dollars 1.9bn the previous year, but
its business has been relatively flat over recent years amid US defence
spending cuts.
For 1992, the division recorded a net profit of Dollars 71m after being
assessed for a portion of IBM's restructuring charges.
The sale of FSC would, however, break an historic tie between the US
government and IBM. Traditionally, IBM has been one of the largest suppliers
of computer equipment and services to the US government.
Although the federal government is the largest purchaser of computer
equipment and services in the US, it is a notoriously difficult customer.

FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: SAS seeks large cost reductions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System (SAS) yesterday announced plans to cut costs by
between SKr2bn and SKr2.5bn (Dollars 304m) in an acceleration of its drive
to improve profitability and strengthen its financial position.
The airline, which disclosed a SKr1.13bn pre-tax loss for the first nine
months on Wednesday, said it aimed to be back in profit by 1995 at the
latest. The cuts, about 16 per cent of the airline's controllable costs,
centre on the closure of 12 unprofitable routes and the disposal of non-core
businesses.
The group wants to avoid enforced job losses among its 39,000 staff, hoping
instead for a reduction in numbers through natural attrition.
SAS said the cuts took into account its plans to merge with KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines, Swissair and Austrian Airlines in the so-called Alcazar project,
but added they would go ahead even if the proposed tie-up collapsed.
'It's important to Alcazar that we get our costs under control, but it's
even more important if we end up standing alone,' SAS said.
It said its fleet had too many aircraft types, and an excessive amount of
capital employed.

UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, is to acquire Bertolli,
the Italian olive oil and vinegar business formerly owned by the
state-controlled SME group.
Last month, SME, which is being dismembered via sales to the private sector,
sold its Cirio, Bertolli, De Rica (CBD) canned foods, edible oils and milk
division to Fisvi, an Italian agro-industrial holding company.
Fisvi has now sold Bertolli, Italy's second-biggest olive oils group, to
Unilever. The disposals follow an unsuccessful bid by Unilever to purchase
the entire CBD division directly from SME's parent, the IRI state holding
company.
Unilever has now achieved its aim of just acquiring the olive oil business,
its target from the beginning. The deal, which encompasses the Bertolli
olive oil brand, production and marketing operations in Italy, and foreign
sales channels, will add Dollars 150m to Unilever's worldwide turnover in
olive oil.

FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Volvo looks at rights option to
Renault deal
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLVO, the Swedish motor group, is sounding out shareholders over a big
rights issue in case plans to merge its vehicle operations with France's
Renault collapse.
The rights issue is part of contingency proposals being worked on by Volvo
as shareholder opposition mounts to the company's link with Renault, which
the Volvo board is determined to push through.
According to the Swedish business daily Dagens Industri, Mr Soren Gyll,
Volvo's chief executive has met a number of big shareholders to discuss the
plan. The paper said Volvo's car division needed around SKr5bn (Dollars
618m) to manage on its own.
Volvo declined to comment on the report, although it said last month that a
stand-alone future would require up to SKr8bn of new capital
Mounting domestic criticism has persuaded many analysts that Volvo
shareholders may block the merger.
Their concern centres on the timetable for Renault's privatisation and the
golden share provision. The latter would allow the French government to
reduce Volvo's ownership of the combined group from 35 per cent to 20 per
cent if their jointly owned holding company were dissolved.
Mr Gyll acknowledged the scale of the revolt in a television interview on
Wednesday evening, when he admitted that Volvo was directly negotiating with
the French government over the issues. 'It looks like the shareholders are
completely against the deal and we will tell our partners that,' he said.
Skandia, the Swedish insurer with a 3.6 per cent voting stake in Volvo, is
the latest big shareholder to threaten to vote against the merger.
Mr Bjorn Wolrath, Skandia chief executive, said: 'In my opinion very
fundamental changes are needed from the French government on the golden
share and on future privatisation to turn round Swedish 'no' opinion.'

INCO plans to take a USDollars 70m pre-tax charge against first-quarter 1994
earnings to cover the costs of recently-announced cutbacks by the
Toronto-based nickel producer.
At an analysts' meeting, Inco officials painted a mildly encouraging picture
of the international nickel market, predicting a drop in Russian supplies to
the west and a significant decline in inventories early next year.
While Inco's 1994 earnings will be hit by lower output and the shutdown
charge, the company is giving high priority to further cost-reduction.
Its break-even nickel price is expected to fall below the Dollars 3.13 per
pound projected in 1993, down from Dollars 3.19 last year. Capital spending
will be cut to Dollars 150m in 1994 from Dollars 193m this year and a recent
peak of Dollars 573m in 1990.
Inco predicts that world nickel supply, excluding eastern Europe, Russia and
China, will fall to 320m lbs in the first quarter of 1994 from 385m lbs in
the final quarter of this year. London Metal Exchange stocks, which have
risen steeply over the past three years, are expected to drop to 220m lbs
from 270m lbs.
Inco plans to cut its own output by 16 per cent next year.

Last month, SME, which is being slowly dismembered via sales to the private

Fisvi will use the proceeds to help finance its L307bn purchase of the
entire CBD group. It has announced a big rights issue to fund the remainder.
The transaction will consolidate Unilever's dominance of the L 1,300bn

FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Ciga stock to resume trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in Ciga, the troubled Italian luxury hotels group controlled by
the Aga Khan, will today have the chance to indicate for the first time
their reaction to this week's announcement of a L700bn (Dollars 425m)
capital increase and restructuring plan.
Under an unprecedented ruling by the Consob stock market and companies
watchdog, shares in Ciga can now only be traded once a week, on Fridays. The
ruling followed a long period of suspension and almost normal trading last
week.
The new rescue plan, prepared by Mediobanca, involves the injection of fresh
capital, a partial moratorium on interest payments and the conversion of
some bank debt into equity.
The new cash will come from Forte, the UK hotels group, which will
contribute L80bn in liquidity and also L300bn in the form of Italian hotel
assets. Further details are expected to emerge after a Ciga board meeting
early next month.
Ciga warned this week that if the proposals, which have received a hostile
reception from some creditor banks, are not accepted at a special
shareholders meeting on January 20, it might have to go into temporary
receivership.
Italian bank creditors, which have lent more than L1,000bn to the
loss-making group, are expected to approve the proposal.
However, foreign creditors, particularly those which have lent to Fimpar,
the Aga Khan's holding company which controls Ciga, have been more hostile.
Barclays, a lender to both Ciga and Fimpar, recently came out strongly
against the plan.
Opponents claim counter-offers by other hotel groups, such as an expression
of interest from the US Hyatt group, have not been adequately considered by
Mediobanca.

FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Schering forecasts 3% decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCHERING, the Berlin-based pharmaceuticals and chemicals company, expects to
pay an unchanged dividend of DM13 for 1993, on net profits likely to be down
by about 3 per cent on last year's DM262m (Dollars 155m), Mr Klaus Pohle,
finance director, said yesterday.
At the nine-month mark earnings were DM194m compared with DM201m in 1992,
according to an interim report. The company blamed the fall on increasing
competition and prices pressure in the drugs business, and falling plant
protection sales.
Turnover in Germany, hit by recession and health service reforms, fell 12
per cent to DM694m, while foreign business grew 4 per cent to DM3.36bn.
The company's shares, which have performed strongly since its multiple
sclerosis treatment, Betaseron, was approved by the US authorities last
July, lost DM15 on the Frankfurt stock exchange, closing at DM1,080.
Schering stock has also benefited from the company's sharpened focus on the
pharmaceuticals business. In its most recent move, it agreed to merge its
plant protection operations with those of Hoechst, retaining only a minority
stake.
According to Mr Pohle, sales of Betaseron in the US next year are likely to
exceed DM300m compared with DM30m in the current period. Approval for its
use in Europe is not expected before 1995.
Meanwhile, the VCI federal chemicals industry association forecast another
poor year for the sector in 1994. Although volume sales might improve,
turnover and profits would remain unsatisfactory, it said.
For the current year, it expected volumes to fall 3.5 per cent and
industry-wide turnover to drop almost 7 per cent. With an eye on the current
wage negotiations, the association warned of more job cuts to come after
30,000 this year.
Unit labour costs in the first eight months of 1993 were more than 3 per
cent up on the year, while average productivity had risen only 0.3 per cent.

FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Japanese cement groups to merge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S biggest and sixth-largest cement-makers are to merged next year. The
link-up is designed to create economies of scale in the face of weak demand
and competition from cheap imports.
Onoda Cement, the leading producer, and part of the Mitsui Group of
industrial companies, will merge next October with Chichibu Cement. They
will form a group, to be called Chichibu Onoda, with annual capacity of
17.94m tonnes, nearly a quarter of Japan's annual demand of 80m tonnes.
At yesterday's closing price in Tokyo, Onoda was capitalised at Y241.8bn
(Dollars 2.25bn) and Chichibu at Y65bn.
The merger will allow them to cut distribution costs by Y300m in the first
year, to March 1995. This will double, to Y600m, savings in the following
year, said Mr Takaharu Unno, Onoda's senior managing director. Annual sales
of the merged group will be an estimated Y264.5bn in the first year, on
which taxable profits are forecast at Y8.2bn.
The pair also plans to shed an unspecified number of workers over the next
three years through natural attrition, said Mr Takahashi Kurihara, president
of Chichibu.
The merger could be the first step in a welcome restructuring of the cement
industry, said Mr Masaya Fujimura, head of the cement association of Japan.
Japanese cement demand has dropped 38 per cent over the past decade, from
130m tonnes annually. The government's attempts to boost public works
through three spending packages over the past 18 months have had little
effect, said company executives.
They blamed this on a drop in office construction, and local government
caution over letting new contracts, in the wake of a wave of arrests of
construction industry executives and public officials. On top of this, there
is stiff competition from cement imported from South Korea, which has become
increasingly cheap as the yen has risen in value.
The pressures on the industry were underlined yesterday when Onoda announced
a 31.5 per cent drop in pre-tax profits, to Y1.76bn in the first six months
to September, from Y2.57bn last time. Sales fell 6.5 per cent to Y105.3bn.
Onoda warned that turnover would fall by the same percentage, to Y218.7bn
for the full year to next March, the first sales setback for seven years.
Pre-tax profits are set to fall by 40.6 per cent to Y5.3bn.
The merger will by undertaken on an equal share exchange, at a rate of 2.1
Onoda shares for one Chichibu share.

KARSTADT and Hertie, respectively the largest and third-largest department

In a brief statement, the Essen-based Karstadt said its supervisory board
had reached agreement with the trusts which control the privately-owned
Hertie to buy all parts of the smaller company's business.
The deal, details of which will be revealed today by Hertie, has been widely
expected in Germany for several days.
It will create a group with turnover of DM28bn (Dollars 16.6m). With sales
of DM7bn last year, Hertie is about one-third the size of Karstadt, which
had sales of nearly DM21bn in 1992.
The transaction is likely to value Hertie at DM1.5bn or more. The rationale
will probably be the need to combine forces, given the depressed state of
the department store market.
The federal cartel office in Berlin has already hinted it will order the
merged companies to sell stores in a number of cities including Berlin,
where the two are well-represented. However, the deal as a whole seems
unlikely to be blocked.

FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: SAS seeks to reduce costs by up
to SKr2.5bn

SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System (SAS) yesterday announced plans to cut costs by
between SKr2bn and SKr2.5bn (Dollars 304m) in an acceleration of its drive
to improve profitability and strengthen its financial position.
The airline, which disclosed a SKr1.13bn pre-tax loss for the first nine
months on Wednesday, said it aimed to be back in profit by 1995 at the
latest.
The cuts, which amount to about 16 per cent of the airline's controllable
costs, centre on the closure of 12 unprofitable routes and the disposal of
non-core businesses.
The group wants to avoid enforced job losses among its 39,000 staff, hoping
instead for a reduction in numbers through natural attrition.
SAS said the cuts took into account its plans to merge with KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines, Swissair and Austrian Airlines in the so-called Alcazar project,
but added they would go ahead even if the proposed tie-up collapsed.
'It's important to Alcazar that we get our costs under control, but it's
even more important if we end up standing alone,' SAS said.
The group said its fleet had too many aircraft types, and it had an
excessive amount of capital employed.
It did not disclose which non-core businesses would be sold. Candidates
likely to be considered include its hotel, tour, catering and credit-card
operations.
Among the routes to be closed between December 1993 and September 1994 are
Copenhagen-Los Angeles, Bergen-London and Gothenburg-Amsterdam. The 17
aircraft made redundant are likely to be sold.
SAS said it was responding to the market situation. 'The airline business
remains in a state of crisis worldwide. The global recession, coupled with
deregulation, has brought about wide-spread overcapacity and put intense
pressure on fares,' it said.

Murdoch share row
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
INSTITUTIONAL fund managers yesterday sought to involve the Australian
Securities Commission in the heated debate over differential voting rights.
Mr Rupert Murdoch sparked the debate with his desire to introduce a new
class of 'super shares', with multiple voting rights, at News Corporation,
the media, film and publishing group.
At present, share structures incorporating differential voting rights do not
feature on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). The exchange is already
considering whether it should change its listing rules to permit these in
the wake of News Corp's proposal.
Yesterday, the Australian Investment Managers' Group (AIMG) - which
represents most of the large institutional shareholders - said it saw
implications for the takeover provisions written into corporate law. It
'would encourage the ASC to explore' these, it said.
After a meeting of members, the AIMG formally expressed 'overwhelming
support' for the principle of one share, one vote, and 'strong opposition to
any proposal that effectively allows a major shareholder to gain and pass
control of a corporation without paying a market premium'.
There are fears in this case that, because the super shares would lose their
multiple voting advantage if they were sold, the Murdoch family interest
would enjoy 'creeping control' of News Corp over time. Mr Murdoch currently
controls - directly or through Cruden Investments, the family company -
almost 33 per cent of News' equity.
Mr Peter Griffin, chairman of the AIMG and vice-chairman of Rothschild
Australia Asset Management, said the fund managers were concerned that the
introduction of differential voting rights would be 'extraordinarily
detrimental to the image of the Australian capital markets'.
If control of corporations became concentrated in the hands of minority
share-holders, Australian companies could also be 'severely constrained in
their ability to tap international and domestic capital markets'.

FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Swithland listing in jeopardy as result of
uncertain placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ATTEMPT to place shares in Swithland Group, the Midlands motor retailer,
ends this morning against a background of City predictions that not enough
shares will be sold to allow its plans for a listing to go ahead.
Swithland's placing was planned in two stages: first the sale of 12.34m new
shares to raise Pounds 10m gross and 370,370 shares owned by Mr John Hayes,
the founder and chief executive; and, second, the sale of 5.79m shares owned
by NatWest Ventures, Swithland's venture capital backer, and the Hayes
family. The price of the shares was 81p each.
The placing, sponsored by Ionian Corporate Finance, was not underwritten and
the issue prospectus stated that if Harris Allday Lea &amp; Brooks, the brokers,
could not sell all the 12.7m shares of the first stage, the placing and
plans for admission to the Stock Exchange would be abandoned.
City concern about Swithland appears to have increased following reports of
its brushes with the Office of Fair Trading on questions of consumer credit
regulation.
Swithland acknowledged in its prospectus two legal disputes with APS
Realisations and Dixon Moutrie Silkstone, which are advertising agencies,
the first being in administrative receivership.
In both cases the agencies are claiming that Swithland has not paid its
fees. In both cases Swithland is making counter-claims.
The placing was designed to provide funds for expansion and to provide an
exit, or partial exit, for NatWest Ventures. In what looks now as the
unlikely event of a successful placing, the Hayes family stake in Swithland
will be reduced to less than 30 per cent.

FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Pilot to raise Pounds 15m via placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REG VAUGHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PILOT Investment Trust, specialist investor in smaller companies, yesterday
reported a 25 per cent increase in net asset value per ordinary share in the
period from its launch date on March 5 to September 30 and announced plans
to raise Pounds 15m net via a placing of C shares at 100p each.
The net asset value increased from 96.8p to 121.1p and at October 29 had
risen further to 125.5p. Profit before tax to September 30 was Pounds
388,000 and earnings per share 1.2p. The directors declared an interim
dividend of 0.5p. This is considered a base level from which it hopes to pay
a progressively rising dividend.
The company proposes to raise the Pounds 15m by way of a conditional placing
of 12.3m C shares and an offer of up to 3.07m C shares.
Sir Peter Michael, chairman, said yesterday that the company was interested
in the smaller companies in the UK index which had been 'unloved for some
years'. He said Pilot targeted companies with young dynamic management teams
which had trimmed the companies down and were ready to grow.
The directors believe that there are many attractive investment
opportunities in Pilot's target sector of quoted companies with a market
value of up to Pounds 30m. There are about 1,000 of them with a combined
value of Pounds 10bn.
Manager of the portfolio, Rutherford Asset Management, has undertaken a
rearrangement of the initial stocks accepted at the launch. The Pounds 25m
raised at the launch has been fully invested for some time and the company
now has borrowings of about Pounds 1m. Of the net cash available after the
launch costs more than 50 per cent was invested in capital raising
situations.

FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Channel Holdings at Pounds 808,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANNEL Holdings achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 808,000 for the six
months to September 30. That compared with Pounds 191,000 for the half year
to December 31 1992, while for the 15 months to March 31 1993 there were
profits of Pounds 308,000.
The results include a full contribution from Carflow Products (UK) a
supplier of mechanical vehicle security products, and a maiden contribution
from CQR Security Products, a manufacturer of components for intruder
alarms.
The acquisitions added Pounds 5.94m to total turnover of Pounds 7.66m
(Pounds 1.03m) and Pounds 511,000 to operating profits of Pounds 805,000
(Pounds 182,000).
The directors said both companies performed well, achieving 'good growth in
the UK and export markets.' They expected cash generation to remain strong
for the rest of the financial year.
Earnings per share worked through at 1.7p (1p) adjusted and a maiden interim
dividend of 0.5p is being paid - 1p was paid for the preceding 15 months.

FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Acquisition costs hit Molyneux
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCELERATED interest payments resulting from an acquisition left Molyneux
Estates, the USM-quoted property investor, with a pre-tax loss of Pounds
2.53m for the year to June 23, against Pounds 1.1m.
As part of buying out its partner in the Overgate Centre, Dundee, the
company repaid Pounds 1.47m of interest early. The accounts reflect the
consolidation of Overgate, with the comparatives being restated, but not the
completion of the acquisition.
Turnover for the period was Pounds 3.96m (Pounds 3.6m) reflecting the
continued increase in income receivable. Losses per share were 11.24p
(3.07p).
The company said that with the increase in the capital base following the
placing and open offer to fund the acquisition combined with a fall in
interest charges and increased rents receivable it saw the future with
confidence.
In view of the present profitability a final of 1p is recommended, the first
dividend since 0.5p was paid in 1991.

FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Business Post margins decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Business Post Group, the parcel and express mail company which
came to the market in June, fell sharply yesterday after its first results
showed a drop in profit margins.
Shares in Business Post were placed with institutions at 120p, valuing the
group at Pounds 60m, but they yesterday shed 22p to 113p.
Pre-tax profits increased by 15 per cent to Pounds 2.2m in the six months to
September 30, while sales rose by 22 per cent to Pounds 19.1m. Gross profit
margins fell in the first half from 14.3 to 11.7 per cent.
Mr Torquil Montague-Johnstone, finance director, said the group had
succeeded in broadening its customer base by attracting larger customers,
but this work yielded lower profit margins. However, he hoped the group
would be able to maintain profit margins at their existing levels through
managing the business mix.
Mr Peter Kane, chairman, said: 'The flotation is enabling the group to widen
its customer base, attracting larger customers whilst increasing the level
of traditional business and thereby improving the overall quality of the
group's earnings.'
Despite the slower than expected recovery from recession, the number of
consignments by Business Post Ltd had increased by 35 per cent. The two
smaller subsidiaries, UK Mail and Business Post International, had increased
the number of consignments handed by 86 per cent and 71 per cent
respectively.
Mr Kane said the group was now in a strong financial position to extend its
regional hub network. New hubs were being built in Manchester, Bristol and
Leeds and all would start operating in the new year.
He said: 'These developments will greatly enhance capacity and operational
efficiency and are expected to generate incremental profits.' Mr Kane said
the second half had started well: 'October and November are typically two of
the best trading months and October revenues were comfortably ahead of last
year, with Business Post Ltd achieving record consignment volumes in recent
weeks.'
Earnings per share rose to 3.3p (3.2p) and the interim dividend was 1.2p,
compared with a notional 0.97p before.

FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: IMC enters battle for control of ICD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BATTLE for control of International Communication &amp; Data, the marketing
services company, took a new twist yesterday when IMC Industries announced
it was raising Pounds 994,000, part of which may be used to take up an
option on ICD shares.
The move could give IMC, the USM-quoted soft drinks and leisure group, a
stake of up to 11 per cent which would be used to support three of the
present ICD board members, including Mr David Cicurel, the chairman,
retaining their positions.
Mr Cicurel, who is also chairman of IMC, said the decision to take up the
option depended on a number of other factors being in place. He declined to
say what these were saying that he did not want to give away too much
information to the opposition.
PSB Group, a direct marketing company in which Mr Stephen Morris has an
interest, is attempting to replace the three directors with its nominees
giving it control of the board. PSB claims to control 23.6 per cent of
voting rights in ICD.
The option was granted on 6.95m shares at 7p in lieu of a fee for the
services of Mr Cicurel as non-executive chairman. Since his appointment a
reorganisation of ICD has been undertaken. ICD's shares closed at 11p, down
 1/2 p
IMC is raising the cash through a placing of 11.3m shares at 3 1/4 p with
Mercury Asset Management, giving it a holding of 4.3 per cent, and a
1-for-10 rights issue at the same price. IMC shares closed unchanged at 3
3/4 p.
Mr Cicurel said he was expecting a bitter battle but was in bullish mood.
'We have done very well since I came in for the shareholders. The other side
it trying to get control of the company on the cheap.'

FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Three 'interested' in Body Shop Singapore
franchise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCHCAPE, Littlewoods and Jusco were all interested in buying the franchise
of Body Shop International's Singapore business and head franchises in a
number of other Asian countries, Ms Anne Downer, the former head franchisee,
claims in the writ she issued against Body Shop.
Ms Downer claims Body Shop turned down the three companies as potential
purchasers. Body Shop said it could not comment on the three companies, but
said it disputed all Ms Downer's claims. It is thought Body Shop did not
receive formal offers from the three, which were dealing with Ms Downer. The
writ was issued in response to Body Shop's closure of the 11 shops in
Singapore.
Ms Downer's franchise to operate the Singapore business originally expired
in October 1991. After some negotiation she agreed with Body Shop to
continue with the franchise until October 29 1993, while trying to sell the
business.
Any buyer would have to be acceptable to Body Shop. Body Shop said yesterday
it had adhered to this agreement at all times.
Ms Downer appointed Schroders Asia to handle the sale and it approached a
number of possible buyers with an information memorandum. She claimed the
three companies had indicated a strong interest in buying the business, but
that Body Shop rejected them.
Inchcape has international marketing activities, handling the import,
distribution and marketing of a number of leading brands in East Asia and
occasionally operates retail outlets. Littlewoods is a large chain store
operator in the UK. Jusco is an important Japanese retailer, which operates
the Body Shop business in Japan.
When she had not sold the business by the expiry date, Body Shop was awarded
an interim injunction against Ms Downer in Singapore. However, Ms Downer is
claiming she was entitled to a further eight week extension of the
franchise.
The Singapore business accounts for less than 1 per cent of Body Shop's
worldwide retail sales. The businesses in other territories where Ms Downer
was the head franchisee - Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Thailand and Taiwan - are being operated by sub-franchisees.

FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Penna losses at Pounds 118,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PENNA, the USM-quoted holding company for the Sanders &amp; Sidney outplacement
consultancy, yesterday announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 118,000 for the
half year to September 30 against profits of Pounds 1.03m.
In September, when the company issued a statement warning of an interim
loss, the shares fell by 35p to 130p. Yesterday they closed unchanged at
127p.
Mr John Beard, chief executive, said the outplacement market was less active
than last year and the group's focus had been to cut overheads and introduce
new levels of service in response to the highly competitive environment and
client requirements.
He added that the directors would continue to review appropriate
opportunities for expansion or diversification into related business
sectors.
Turnover fell to Pounds 3.89m (Pounds 5.42m). Losses per share came through
at 2p (13.9p earnings) and the interim dividend is cut to 1p (3p).

FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Waddington advances 16% to Pounds 9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFIT RISES in its packaging and games divisions offset a fall in the
printing side at John Waddington and led to a 16 per cent pre-tax increase
from Pounds 7.76m to Pounds 9.01m in the 26 weeks to October 2.
Although the advance was broadly in line with expectations, the shares
slipped 12p to 245p, affected by the mixed nature of the results.
In the packaging division, overall operating profits rose to Pounds 6.1m
(Pounds 5.68m) on turnover up at Pounds 74.9m (Pounds 61.7m). Within the
plastic packaging side, the US food services business performed well,
lifting operating profits by Pounds 1m to Pounds 2.7m on turnover up at
Pounds 23.5m (Pounds 13m). Carthage Cup Company, bought in May for Dollars
5.4m (Pounds 3.57m), chipped in profits of Pounds 400,000 on sales of Pounds
4.6m.
Mr Geoff Gibson, finance director, said Carthage added a more downmarket
range to the existing portfolio. There had been a 25 per cent increase in
volumes in the US to meet demand, but the price had been a certain lack of
efficiency.
On the food and drinks side, profits slipped to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 1.5m) on
turnover of Pounds 22.9m (Pounds 21.2m).
Within paper and board packaging, cartons raised profits 17 per cent to
Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 1.8m) on turnover up at Pounds 16.3m (Pounds 15.2m).
However, the labels business increased its losses to Pounds 800,000 (Pounds
300,000) on turnover flat at Pounds 6.8m. Mr Gibson said that although the
lost Heinz contract had been replaced with new business, albeit at lower
margins, there had been problems with self-adhesive labels.
Mr Martin Buckley, group chief executive, said he was 'disappointed' with
the specialist printing division, where profits shrank to Pounds 1.52m
(Pounds 2.33m) on sales of Pounds 25m (Pounds 23.6m). The decommissioning of
a press at Chorleys, the confidential printer, had led to a one-off dent in
profits, though higher margin work has been possible since. The recession on
the Continent had hit the continuous stationery side.
The cash-generating games division lifted profits to Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 2m)
on turnover down Pounds 500,000 at Pounds 11.9m. 'Essentially a marketing
business', according to Mr Buckley, it is now moving into the toys side with
a distribution deal for radio-controlled toys.
About a third of Waddington's business is in the US where it is seeking
acquisitions - 'the multiples expected are more reasonable', said Mr Gibson.
Group turnover climbed to Pounds 118.2m (Pounds 108m) and operating profits
to Pounds 9.83m (Pounds 9.48m). The interim dividend is raised to 3.8p

Mr David Ling, finance director Densitron International, the electronic
components manufacturer, said yesterday the company had 'no specific' plans
to expand into Japan.
Earlier, speculation that the company was planning to make a significant
acquisition in the country had lifted the company's share price by 6p to
36p.
Mr Ling said he knew of no other reason for the rise in the share price.

FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Northumbrian Water dips 42% - Pounds 8.9m
provision for Amtec and dividend lower than expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHUMBRIAN Water, the smallest of the privatised water companies, has paid
the price of unsuccessful diversification with a 42 per cent drop in interim
profits and a lower than expected dividend.
Sir Frederick Holliday, the chairman, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds
22.6m for the six months to September 30, while sales were 20 per cent ahead
at Pounds 148.2m. The shares, which had fallen from 690p last week on
rumours of heavy provisions, closed 9p down at 658p.
The sharp profits fall was largely due to an Pounds 8.9m provision for
Amtec, the underground pipe maintenance business which was one of
Northumbrian's earliest diversifications post-privatisation. Amtec,
purchased for a total of Pounds 5.8m, incurred a further Pounds 2.2m in
operating losses.
Northumbrian's failure on Amtec follows a Pounds 25m provision at Thames
Water last month and is likely to fuel further the debate over
diversification. 'It will reinforce investor nervousness about the quality
of the unregulated earnings in the water industry,' says Mr Robert
Miller-Bakewell of NatWest Securities.
Mr Michael Taylor, finance director, admitted Northumbrian had made mistakes
with Amtec. 'We did not successfully integrate the businesses we bought,' he
said. A lack of experience had also left Northumbrian ill-equipped to deal
with competition in a declining market, he said.
Profits were also depressed by an Pounds 8m fall in investment income to
Pounds 600,000. The group expected this to recover by at least Pounds 7m in
the second half because of bond investments.
Mr Taylor said the company had achieved a 'very strong performance' from the
core water and sewage businesses. Operating costs had been cut by about
Pounds 3m to Pounds 72m, with pre-tax profits up from Pounds 30.8m to Pounds
39.2m. The non-regulated businesses, including Amtec, returned a Pounds
400,000 loss against profits of Pounds 3.4m last time.
The dividend was increased by 8 per cent to 8.1p (7.5p) and Northumbrian
expected to pay a final of 16.2p. Earnings per share fell from 56.7p to
30.3p.
COMMENT
Although the provisions include goodwill adjustments of Pounds 6m, the
losses and remaining charges are proportionately as significant for
Northumbrian as those unveiled recently by Thames. Add to that questions
over the unreliability of earnings from its investments and Northumbrian
does not seem to have come far since privatisation. The regulated business,
like others in the sector, appears solid. This will help it achieve forecast
profits of Pounds 63m after exceptionals, against Pounds 69m last year. On a
prospective p/e of 7.2, it would appear the jury is still out.

FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Ruberoid flotation price fixed at 150p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PRICE of 150p a share was fixed yesterday for the flotation of Ruberoid,
valuing the roofing subsidiary Tarmac is spinning off to the market at about
Pounds 72m.
Roughly 60 per cent of Ruberoid's turnover is in commercial contracting, of
which about 70 per cent is refurbishment. The balance of its sales come from
manufacturing and distributing a range of bituminous waterproofing systems.
The issue will raise Pounds 68.8m for existing shareholders, principally
subsidiaries of Tarmac, and Pounds 2m for the company.
More than 30m shares, 65 per cent of the issue, are being placed firm with
institutions. The balance, 16.5m shares, is being placed subject to clawback
under the public offer for sale.
On forecast pro forma pre-tax profits of Pounds 7m for the year to
end-December, the issue price gives a pro forma p/e of 14.3 times.
The total dividend of 5.4p the directors would have recommended for the year
to December 1993 if the company had been independent would have given a
gross yield of 4.5 per cent.
The offer closes on November 18 and dealings are expected to start on
November 25.
COMMENT
Contracting is a low margin business carrying some risks. In the UK
Ruberoid's main market, new construction, is limited by the glut of
commercial property. The company's reliance on refurbishment is therefore a
comfort. Also, Ruberoid has already taken full provisions against
contracting losses and enjoys good shares in its markets. The risks and low
growth profile are reflected in the company's cheap 14.3 times rating which
compares with others in the mid-20s in the building materials sector.
Coupled with its dividend yield the stock Tarmac failed to sell to a trade
buyer should reach a reasonable premium in a high market.

FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Appleby Westward drops 28%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Appleby Westward Group dived 20p to 178p after the USM-quoted
grocery distributor reported a 28 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 730,000 for the 28 weeks to September 11.
Sales for the period were down 8 per cent to Pounds 38.2m, while earnings
per share fell to 8.5p (11.9p). However, an unchanged interim dividend of
3.2p is declared.
Mr Roger Harvey, the chairman, explained that the shortfall partly reflected
the planned reduction in gross margin necessary to help the company's
retailers. Additional costs were also incurred in reducing the workforce and
re-aligning the productivity payment scheme to its warehouse and transport
staff.
Following an agreement with Watson &amp; Philip, its distribution network now
covers Wiltshire, Dorset, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. Although the
initial transition had gone smoothly, Mr Harvey said commission payments to
Watson would affect profits, especially in the first two years of the
six-year agreement.

mortgages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Birmingham Midshires, the UK's 13th largest building society, has acquired
Pounds 17.8m of housing association mortgages from the Bank of Wales for an
undisclosed amount, writes Alison Smith.
The portfolio comprises loans to 14 registered housing associations in Wales
and one in Bristol.
This is the society's first acquisition of this type of loan book, though it
already has experience of lending to associations.
Over the past 18 months, buying residential mortgage books from other
sources, including Sumitomo Bank and the United Bank of Kuwait, has already
taken the society's assets to more than Pounds 4bn. In the past five years
it has bought mortgage books totalling just over Pounds 300m.
The society sees acquisition as a faster route to increasing asset size than
organic growth, and as an alternative to merger - although it does not rule
out combining with the right partner.

FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Interest costs cut Staveley to Pounds 7.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER interest rates on UK deposits reduced pre-tax profits at Staveley
Industries, the measuring and mechanical engineering company which also owns
British Salt. They fell from Pounds 9.1m to Pounds 7.5m in the six months to
October 2.
However, the board declared a maintained interim dividend of 2.3p out of
earnings per share of 4.9p (6p) and said the payment reflected its
satisfactory financial position.
'While it is still early to predict the year as a whole, growth will be hard
to obtain although the longer term is positive,' Mr Brian Kent, chairman,
said.
The interest charge increased from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 700,000,
reflecting the lower income on deposits as well as higher net borrowings of
Pounds 25.4m (Pounds 20.9m). Gearing at the period end was 29.4 per cent,
against 26 per cent a year earlier and 22.8 per cent at the year-end.
Turnover rose to Pounds 166m (Pounds 155.8m). The company said sales in
continental Europe were particularly buoyant, because of the strong order
position at the beginning of the year.
Operating profits fell 12 per cent to Pounds 8.2m (Pounds 9.2m) as the
company absorbed charges of Pounds 1m associated with cost-cutting within
the mechanical and electrical services and weighing and systems groups.
Trading remained difficult.
Operating margins fell to 4.9 per cent (5.9 per cent).
Minerals contributed Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 5.7m) to operating profits on sales
of Pounds 17.1m (Pounds 15.7m), with British Salt enjoying steady volumes.
Measurement gave a reduced Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 2.9m) on sales of Pounds
77.7m (Pounds 67.1m) as some continental European and North American
businesses suffered reduced orders.
Operating profits at mechanical and engineering services fell to Pounds
500,000 (Pounds 1m), hit by cost cutting, on sales of Pounds 68.7m (Pounds
70.2m). Staveley said order intake showed a 'favourable swing', with
contracting down 8 per cent but maintenance up 19 per cent.

FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Sherwood shares fall 41% on further profit
warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHERWOOD Computer Serv-ices shares lost 41 per cent of their value
yesterday, closing down 60p at 85p after the company's second profits
warning in four months.
The USM-quoted financial software company said that market expectations of
pre-tax profits of between Pounds 1.5m and Pounds 2.1m would not be met. At
the same time, it said that Mr Charles Taylor, finance director, was
resigning to take up a similar position with another, unspecified, computing
services company.
Mr George Matthews, chief executive, said there was no connection between
the profits warning and Mr Taylor's resignation.
He said there were three reasons for the company's failure to maintain its
predicted trading improvement. The local government market was proving
difficult and action had already been taken to reduce costs.
The life and pensions business was generally good, but a large customer's
decision to continue using Sherwood's bureau service rather than moving to
Sherwood's packaged software had cost the company some Pounds 500,000 in
licence fees.
Finally, there were continued problems in the Lloyd's insurance market. The
company has about 180 people working in that area and jobs would be lost as
it reduced costs, Mr Matthews said. He was not prepared to indicate how many
redundancies would be involved.
Last year Sherwood made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3m on revenues of Pounds
20m, but profits fell to Pounds 541,000 at the half-way stage after
difficulties in the Lloyd's market forced a profits warning in August.
Mr Matthews said the life and pensions business would continue to show good
growth, but he saw little improvement in either the local government or
Lloyd's market in the year ahead.

FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Rental side behind advance to Pounds 3.22m
at Warner Howard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRENGTH in rentals helped Warner Howard, the hot air hand dryer and laundry
equipment company, improve interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.01m to
Pounds 3.22m in spite of a fall in turnover from Pounds 11.2m to Pounds
10.7m for the half year to August 31.
The board declared an interim dividend of 2.27p (2.12p) out of earnings per
share of 9.11p (8.59p).
'In our rental business, which contributes about 85 per cent, volume held
up. We have had a higher incidence of cancellations than we previously had.
In the main it is straightforward company failures,' said Mr Harvey Adams,
the finance director.
The company said it had held prices although contracts renewed on existing
equipment would normally be at reduced rates.
Warner has more than 35 per cent of the market for rented hand dryers but
dominates the market for rented commercial laundry equipment with roughly a
75 per cent share and has a small commercial catering equipment rentals
business.
Mr Adams said rentals were generally more popular in recession: 'We are not
a recovery stock because our revenue flow tends to be quite stable.'
Warner diversified its business in June with the acquisition of Gerrard
Gamble Group, the commercial kitchen equipment suppliers.
'Not only has this given us an immediate source of rental income which is
welcome, but it has also taken the company into the relatively untapped
market of renting commercial kitchen equipment,' said Mr Ronald Hooker, the
chair-man.
Warner does not disclose balance sheet figures at the halfway stage but said
it had no gearing and cash flow was positive. It would consider any further
acquisition opportunities.

VSEL, the Cumbrian-based builder of Trident submarines, reported a steady
increase in profitability but said it would be several months before it knew
whether the current review of UK defence expenditure would require changes
to the group's strategic plan.
For the six months to September 30 the company's pre-tax profits increased
by 11 per cent to Pounds 28.8m, although sales were flat at Pounds 233m
(Pounds 234m).
Lord Chalfont, chairman, said he expected results in the second half to be
at least at the level achieved in the first half and he remained encouraged
by the prospects for 1994-95.
He said the successful completion of HMS Vanguard, the first Trident
submarine which was accepted into service with the Royal Navy in September,
had increased confidence in the outcome of the Trident programme as a whole.
'The second boat in the class, HMS Victorious, was launched on September 29.
These achievements are reflected in the results for the half year. Work on
the two remaining Trident submarines is progressing satisfactorily and in
line with programme.'
The last Upholder Class submarine to be built at Cammell Laird was handed
over to the Navy in July and Birkenhead Yard was closed as planned, ending a
long history of shipbuilding on the Mersey. Discussions with a prospective
purchaser of the shipbuilding areas of the yard were continuing.
Satisfactory progress was being made at Barrow and at Kvaerner Govan on the
Clyde on the contract for a helicopter carrier, which VSEL won with a bid of
Pounds 139.5m in a competition with Swan Hunter, the Tyneside yard which
then called in the receiver. VSEL said it had made appropriate provisions to
cover possible design and management risks on this type of contract.
Mr Noel Davies, chief executive, said VSEL had offered to take over the
management of building three Type 23 Navy frigates at Swan Hunter, although
it would be necessary to reach manning agreements with the trade unions.
A tender had been submitted, in collaboration with Hunting Engineering, for
work on the Common New Generation Frigate project - a joint British, French
and Italian programme to develop a new European warship.
Further tender submissions are expected to be made, including a bid to be
prime contractor of the Batch 2 Trafalgar submarines and for replacement
assault ships.
Earnings rose to 49.3p (44p) and the interim dividend is being lifted from
9p to 10.5p.
COMMENT
VSEL's shares have had a good run this year, helped by the group's knocking
of its competitor Swan Hunter out of the ring. The group never concealed
that its bid for the helicopter carrier was a loss-leader to get it back
into building surface ships. Mr Davies believes most of VSEL's products will
survive the defence review, although the scale and timing of orders may be
affected. Meantime, the group has accumulated Pounds 270m of cash and seems
philosophical about the possibility that it may be taken over in the ongoing
shrinking of the UK defence industry. The shares trade on a undemanding
prospective multiple of about 8. They are underpinned at that level by a
premium yield and the strong cash position, but are unlikely to move ahead
until the Chancellor makes clear his intentions towards the defence budget.

FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Oxford Instruments improves 19% to Pounds
5.1m as orders show recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OXFORD INSTRUMENTS, the advanced instrumentation group, reported a 19 per
cent increase in interim pre-tax profits yesterday and said the rate of new
orders was showing 'strong signs of recovery'.
Pre-tax profits grew from Pounds 4.26m to Pounds 5.07m in the six months to
September 26. Earnings per share increased by 12 per cent to 6.6p (5.9p) and
the interim dividend is being increased by 7 per cent to 1.5p (1.4p). The
shares closed up 8p at 296p.
The profit improvement was underpinned by an 8 per cent increase in
turnover. This grew to Pounds 48.6m (Pounds 45.1m) buoyed by new orders,
which Mr Peter Williams, chairman and chief executive, said were up 10 per
cent from the start of the year.
With 85 per cent of sales outside the UK, Mr Martin Lamaison, finance
director, said the group mainly used sterling's devaluation to improve its
competitiveness and boost sales volumes rather than to enhance margins.
Operating profits jumped to Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 797,000) more than
offsetting a decline in interest income to Pounds 359,000 (Pounds 500,000),
mainly reflecting the group's lower mid-year cash balances of Pounds 2.6m,
down from Pounds 6.7m at the start of the year.
The Pounds 4.1m decline in cash balances represented an increase in working
capital, reflecting the stronger order book and progress with long-term
contracts and the group's second Dollars 25m (Pounds 16.5m) synchrotron
machine.
Despite earlier concerns over the impact of uncertainties in the US
healthcare market, Mr Williams said sales and profits from its magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) joint venture with Siemens held up well. Oxford's
share of income from the joint venture slipped slightly to Pounds 2.81m
(Pounds 2.96m).

AMBER DAY Holdings, the discount retailer, has agreed to sell its import and
distribution division Dennis Day to its current management.
The Amber Day board had decided earlier in the year to dispose of the
division and return to its What Everyone Wants core retail chain. Earlier
this month the group revealed that pre-tax losses for the year to July 31
were reduced to Pounds 2.09m (Pounds 7.75m). Dennis Day incurred losses,
after provisions and before interest and tax, of Pounds 4.6m on turnover
Pounds 8.7m. At July 31, it had net liabilities of Pounds 4.1m.
Amber Day will receive Pounds 659,000 of book debts. The consideration for
the sale of the shares is Pounds 1.

FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Lloyd's trusts approach limit of capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO MORE Lloyd's investment trusts were launched yesterday amid further
indications that the limit of institutional investor interest in the new
Lloyd's schemes is being reached.
Angerstein Underwriting Trust, an investment trust sponsored by NatWest
Markets and Stace Barr, the Lloyd's agency, announced that it aimed to raise
Pounds 75m through a placement and offer for subscription, while a smaller
vehicle, Corporate Membership, also issued its prospectus.
Corporate Membership, formed by individual members of Lloyd's and sponsored
by Peel, Hunt, the stockbrokers, is seeking to raise Pounds 20m through an
offer for subscription.
However, SG Warburg and Chartwell, which planned to raise between Pounds
100m and Pounds 150m for New London Capital, are understood to be planning
to scale back their fund to between Pounds 75m and Pounds 85m.
At Angerstein, Mr Charles Phillips of NatWest Markets said Pounds 67.5m had
been placed with institutions, although it was aiming to raise Pounds 23m
from retail investors.
Angerstein will provide Pounds 111m of capacity on syndicates recommended by
Stace Barr, its independent Lloyd's adviser. Corporate Membership said it
had secured in excess of Pounds 16m of secured capacity from syndicates and
had identified a further Pounds 15m of syndicate capacity.

FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Overseas activities give boost to Bank of
Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANK OF IRELAND yesterday disclosed doubled pre-tax profits for the half
year, helped by a sharp improvement in retail banking operations in the US
and Britain.
The profits rise for the six months to end-September was from IPounds 65.8m
to IPounds 130.9m (Pounds 124.5m). Earnings per share of 15.2p compared with
6.6p. Results from businesses outside Ireland were IPounds 40m ahead of the
corresponding period last year.
The figures were also helped by a 32 per cent fall in loan loss provisions
to IPounds 43.1m (IPounds 63.8m). However, provisions within its corporate
banking operations in Ireland rose to IPounds 10m (IPounds 3m) as a result
of two large losses.
Profits for the retail banking business in Ireland rose to IPounds 80.7m
(IPounds 66.7m), while British operations returned to a profit of IPounds 1m
(IPounds 5.7m deficit) and an IPounds 3.5m loss (IPounds 27.3m loss) for its
New Hampshire businesses.
The bank reported a return to a profit of Dollars 6.1m (Pounds 4.03m) for
New Hampshire in the third quarter, to appear in its second half results. It
has disposed of non-performing assets, reducing them to IPounds 28m against
IPounds 84m at the end of 1992.
Mr Maurice Keane, deputy chief executive, said that retail banking in
Ireland had performed well despite 'not very strong loan demand' from retail
customers. He said cost-cutting in Britain had produced a 'leaner, fitter'
business.
Mr Keane said problems with non-performing loans in New Hampshire had
largely been solved. The cut in non-performing assets had been accompanied
by a growth in provisions cover to the level of 250 per cent of the
remaining assets.
The bank's tier 1 ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets strengthened
to 7.3 per cent (6.6 per cent at the end of 1992) following the bank's
IPounds 100m rights issue earlier this year largely used to repurchase
preference stock.
The interim dividend was increased to 3.75p (3.13p).
COMMENT
Bank of Ireland's strong share performance this year is justified by its
brisk correction of past problems overseas, and strict control of domestic
business. A cut in provisions despite a hiccup in large corporate lending
shows the benefits of this discipline. Full year pre-tax profits of IPounds
260m would give earnings per share of 30p, a multiple of about 10. This is
not a dangerous price for a well-managed business, but the lack of loan
demand afflicting all banks means there are questions over future growth.

FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Royal Doulton promises 3p dividend after
demerger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL Doulton, the fine china company, yesterday announced that it intended
to pay a dividend of 3p to shareholders after its demerger from its parent,
Pearson, publishers of the Financial Times.
The group made the announcement in its listing particulars document,
published after some initial difficulties late yesterday. The particulars
stated that on a pro forma basis, Royal Doulton would have paid a notional
full-year dividend of 6.6p.
The document also warned shareholders not to expect a robust performance
from Royal Doulton in 1993 as profits would be hit by redundancy costs and
short-time working.
Pearson will offer 54.9m Royal Doulton shares on a one-for-10 basis. A rough
guide to the price at which Royal Doulton may start trading on December 2
can be found in a listings footnote. Pearson has agreed to buy from Royal
Doulton shares at 244p, if necessary. This is likely to occur only if
Pearson issues more of its own shares before then.
On a pro forma basis, Royal Doulton has net debt of Pounds 39.5m. Gearing,
normally high at this time, is 38 per cent.
The particulars also state that Royal Doulton's first-half results - which
show a deficit of Pounds 3.8m - include a Pounds 2m exceptional charge for
losses on the sale of the Canadian Financial Post newspaper group to another
Pearson company. Pearson last year transferred the Post into Royal Doulton
Canada for tax reasons.
The demerger got off to a shaky start yesterday as the stock exchange
recalled early copies of the particulars.
It is believed that the document contained errors over holdings in Royal
Doulton which Lazard Investors and associated companies of Lazard Freres
will have after the demerger. Lazard Brothers is sponsoring Royal Doulton's
introduction to the official list. Pearson has a stake in the Lazard
investment banking group.
Some 25 to 30 incorrect copies of the document were collected from analysts
who had attended a meeting.
Meanwhile, Pearson said its third-quarter pre-tax profits rose from Pounds
61.7m to Pounds 100.6m. The shares rose by 16p on the news to 574p.

FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Royal hits Pounds 113m at nine months -
Composite provides further evidence of insurance market recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL INSURANCE yester-day provided further evidence of the recovery in the
insurance market when it reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 113m for the
first nine months of 1993, compared with a loss of Pounds 83m during the
same period of last year.
Earnings per share were 19.2p compared with 5.3p. After disposals profits
amounted to Pounds 116m compared with Pounds 9m last time.
The strength of the investment markets has also helped restore the group's
balance sheet.
Capital and reserves amounted to Pounds 2.15bn (Pounds 1.48bn) at September
30, and the solvency ratio - which measures net assets as a percentage of
non-life premium income - amounted to 59 per cent.
The 'significant recovery in results' reflected 'the overall insurance
environment' and the impact of moves to increase efficiency and improve
skills, said Mr Richard Gamble, chief executive.
Much of the improvement was concentrated in the UK where premium income grew
by 7 per cent to reach Pounds 1.23bn (Pounds 1.15bn).
Premium rate increases were especially strong in commercial lines business
with average increases of 31 per cent for employers' liability, 22 per cent
for product liability and 35 per cent for marine.
Despite indications of rate competition in the personal motor market, Royal
said its own motor rates were 13 per cent higher than last year.
Premium growth was particularly impressive at The Insurance Service, the
Bristol-based direct insurer, where premium income rose by 40 per cent. In
the UK the group's operating ratio (claims and expenses as a percentage of
premiums) in the UK fell to 99.8 per cent, compared with 118.4 per cent last
year.
Higher weather losses were partially responsible for a deficit of Pounds 7m
(profit Pounds 12m) in the US. But profits at Royal Canada and Royal
Insurance Global, which handles the insurance accounts of international
clients, increased.
However, some analysts are concerned about the pace of growth.
Mr Tom Bennett, analyst with Paribas Capital Markets, said UK results were
'excellent' but said the group as a whole 'is still in convalescent mode.'
Worldwide general business premiums increased to Pounds 2.79bn (Pounds
2.54bn). Underwriting losses fell to Pounds 285m (Pounds 435m) while
investment income rose to Pounds 388m (Pounds 345m). Income from associated
undertakings rose to Pounds 20m (Pounds 17m).
Estate agency losses amounted to Pounds 7m (Pounds 11m) and losses from
long-term insurance amounted to Pounds 8m (Pounds 12m).
Pre-tax profits at Royal Life fell to Pounds 37m (Pounds 38m). Loan interest
at the level of the holding group amounted to Pounds 29m (Pounds 25m).

FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Second cash call from Hemingway Properties
to finance acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEMINGWAY Properties, the lossmaking property group formed through a reverse
takeover of Marylebone Estates in August 1991, is making its second cash
call in six months. It also forecast it would pay a dividend in 1995.
It is raising Pounds 32.3m net of expenses through a placing and open offer
of shares and convertible bonds to finance a Pounds 35m purchase of eight
properties.
The deal follows a Pounds 21.9m placing and Pounds 30.2m acquisition which
was announced in June.
The deal would increase basic net asset value from 25p to 28.2p a share or
from 27p to 29.4p on a fully diluted basis.
Hemingway is to issue 66.2m shares at 31.5p, with shareholders able to buy
one for every two held, or 10 for every Pounds 6.40 nominal of stock held.
It will also sell Pounds 10.6m of new convertible stock, which will merge
with an existing convertible, at a 17 per cent premium to par.
Shareholders can buy Pounds 2 nominal of stock for every 25 shares held or
Pounds 1 nominal for every Pounds 4 nominal of stock held. The conversion
price on the new stock is 37.4p a share.
After the issue, the group's debt would be Pounds 51m compared with
shareholders' funds of Pounds 45m.
However, if the Pounds 22.6m convertible stock is counted as equity, gearing
falls to less than 50 per cent. Hemingway said this 'relatively modest level
of gearing' would allow it to make further acquisitions funded by debt.
Annual rental income from the properties being bought, which includes five
industrial estates, two offices and a shopping centre, is Pounds 3.5m. It is
expected to grow to Pounds 4.2m in five years.
After financing costs and expenses, Hemingway expects the properties to
contribute Pounds 2.2m a year before tax.
The vendors of the properties are a group of private property investment
companies representing institutional investors.
Hemingway is planning a capital reduction next year to wipe out an
accumulated deficit on profit and loss reserves. It is expected the deficit
will be worsened by the 1993 results.
However thereafter the company is expected to make a profit in 1994 and
plans to pay a dividend in 1995 of 0.4p in respect of the 1994 financial
year.

MR HUGO BIERMANN, the entrepreneurial chairman of Maddox Group, resigned
yesterday as the troubled computer maintenance company announced an Pounds
18.9m interim loss and a financial restructuring package, including a rights
issue.
The 7-for-8 rights issue, consisting of 390m 1p shares at par, is
underwritten by Williams de Broe and aims to raise Pounds 3.6m net, which
will be used to repay creditors. The shares closed 1 1/4 p lower at 1 3/4 p
yesterday. Like other aspects of the package, the rights will be subject to
shareholders approval at an extraordinary meeting on December 4.
Under the restructuring proposals, worked out over the last four months by
the new management team, the company will then be renamed Wakebourne  -
after its remaining profitable personal computer maintenance and support
company.
Mr Biermann, who has also resigned as a director, said yesterday that he
thought it would be 'good for the group to have a lower profile' without him
and said he was 'in a sense relieved' that he was stepping down.
However, he said he intended to maintain his 13.6 per cent equity stake in
the group, held with his partner, Mr Nicholas Toms, and was still
considering whether to take up the rights issue.
Mr Biermann, renowned as a shrewd South African deal maker, rose to fame in
the UK after building up the Thomson T-Line mini-conglomerate with Mr Toms,
before selling it to Ladbroke Group for Pounds 186m in 1989.
Early last year the two men created Maddox by reversing two cable
distributors, Cables &amp; Flexibles and US-based Seacoast Electric, into the
quoted Pathfinders Group which was subsequently renamed.
However, the performance of both Cables and Flexibles and Seacoast proved
disappointing and they were both sold to a US group called Lantek
Electronics earlier this year for Pounds 15.1m in Lantek paper.
Yesterday, the Maddox' board said it had decided to provide against the
whole Pounds 15.1m book value of the Lantek paper, although it acknowledged
that the group might eventually receive some cash proceeds as the result of
the recently announced merger of Lantek and VTX Electronics, a US stock
exchange quoted company.
The Pounds 18.9m pre-tax loss for the six months to June 30 was mainly as a
result of the provision, and compared with a Pounds 325,000 profit last
time. Turnover rose to Pounds 12m (Pounds 9.55m) and losses per share were
4.3p (0.21p earnings). Despite the group loss, Wakebourne made pre-tax
profits of Pounds 1.3m.

FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Greycoat proposals sent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREYCOAT, the property company that last week recommended a rescue
refinancing led by the UK Active Value Fund, yesterday posted share and bond
holders a document outlining the proposal.
The document included valuations for the three main Greycoat properties,
Embankment Place, Britannic House and 123 Buckingham Palace Road, that show
slightly higher yields than might be expected for investment quality
properties.
Unlike with the Postel proposal which was rejected by investors in October,
the new deal spells out the individual property values.
Britannic House is valued at Pounds 128.5m, up from Pounds 118.5m in March
or Pounds 105.5m as it was valued on a forced sale basis in July.
This corresponds to a 7.5 per cent yield, only slightly higher than market
rates for investment grade properties.
Embankment House is valued at Pounds 184.25m, up from Pounds 174m in March,
representing a 8.2 per cent yield as the lease is still being ironed out.

FT  12 NOV 93 / BellSouth adds to QVC war chest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELLSOUTH, the US regional telecommunications company, yesterday joined QVC
Network's war party in the Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.8bn) takeover battle for
entertainment group Paramount Communications by agreeing to invest Dollars
1.5bn in QVC if it acquires Paramount.
BellSouth will take the place in the QVC camp of Liberty Media, the cable
television programming group which owns 22 per cent of QVC's stock.
Under an agreement with the staff of the Federal Trade Commission, which
oversees anti-trust matters, Liberty is to divest its interest in QVC within
18 months, provided QVC wins the Paramount battle. Liberty will not go ahead
with a planned injection of a further Dollars 500m into QVC to finance the
bid, through an issue of convertible stock.
The FTC had been concerned about Liberty's existing ties and proposed merger
with Tele-Communications Inc, the largest cable television service company
in the US, which in turn plans to merge with telecommunications group Bell
Atlantic.
The complicated deal gives a double boost to the Dollars 9.5bn hostile bid
for Paramount from QVC, a television shopping channel headed by Mr Barry
Diller, a leading film industry figure.
First, it gives Mr Diller extra financial muscle, enabling him to raise his
bid to compete with an increased Dollars 10.1bn offer unveiled last Sunday
by cable company Viacom, with which Paramount has agreed to merge.
Second, if the full FTC commission approves the deal, the QVC bid will clear
an important and potentially damaging hurdle - the government's anti-trust
investigation of the deal.
As part of yesterday's deal, BellSouth and QVC have also agreed to form a
joint venture to create, develop and offer interactive television services
worldwide.
BellSouth is to buy Dollars 1bn of QVC common stock, or roughly 16.7m
shares, at Dollars 60 a share, and Dollars 500m of QVC 6 per cent
convertible exchangeable preferred stock, convertible into some 7.6m shares.
It will become the company's largest shareholder, with roughly 14 per cent
of the equity, and will get three seats on the board. If the Paramount bid
fails, it will have the option to buy Dollars 500m of stock.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Lonrho to have audit committee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO yesterday took a significant step towards becoming a more transparent
company when its board unanimously voted in favour of establishing an audit
committee to review the group's finances.
The boardroom showdown between Mr Tiny Rowland, who has run Lonrho for the
past 30 years, and Mr Dieter Bock, the German financier appointed last year,
appears to have ended in peace, at least temporarily, as the joint chief
executives vowed to work together.
Mr Bock has made it clear that he intends to press ahead with his plans to
turn Lonrho into a more conventional company.
The group's first non-executive directors for 20 years were welcomed to the
board and will now take an active part in the remuneration committee, to
assess pay in the company.
Two of the new non-executives Mr Bock nominated to the board, Mr Peter
Harper of Hanson, and Mr Stephen Walls of Albert Fisher, are to review the
group's strategy as well as looking at the pay of senior directors.
Mr Bock, who bought 18.8 per cent of Lonrho at the beginning of the year, is
understood to be delighted that the personal acrimony between him and Mr
Rowland now appears to be over.
'Peace has broken out on the Lonrho board,' said one ad-viser.
The board also welcomed as a non-executive Sir John Leahy, former UK
ambassador to South Africa who is close to Mr Rowland, and Mr Terence
Wilkinson, managing director of Lonrho's South African interests who has
been with the group since 1973, as an executive.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Burton shares slip on sales fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in fashion retailer Burton Group slipped 14 per cent in spite of the
group's return to the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 18.5m against a
loss of Pounds 800,000 last year.
Although the group returned profits largely in line with expectations,
analysts were disappointed at a decline in sales from the chain stores
businesses in the second half. The shares were marked down 11p to 66 1/4 p.
Profits were also held back by higher than expected exceptional costs for
restructuring of Pounds 19.6m. This included a Pounds 5m loss on the sale of
the sports chain Champion and a Pounds 14.6m charge for the reshaping.
Mr John Hoerner, chief executive, said any return to Burton's former profit
levels would be slow. 'I have always said it would take time,' he said. The
introduction of a November budget was also less than helpful. 'We do not
think it is a particular inducement to have a budget at this time of year,'
he said. 'Apprehension is not a great emotion when you are trying to get
customers wound up for Christmas.'
Mr Hoerner said current trading was mixed, with the first 10 weeks showing
sales down by 1 per cent. However, since the middle of September sales had
been 1 per cent ahead of last year.
The chief executive insisted that, given the tough trading environment and
the group's determination to control discounting, 'I am not disappointed
with these results.'
Overall, Burton returned a 7 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 1.9bn for
the year to August 28.
Mr Hoerner blamed a second-half decline in the chain store division on
'trying to do something to our business in the worst possible environment'.
There had also been a stronger than expected trend towards price
competitiveness in the fashion market, he said. Gross margins declined for
the year as a whole by 1.2 percentage points.
The best performer was yet again the department store Debenhams, where sales
rose 11 per cent to Pounds 854.4m. Profits were 82 per cent higher at Pounds
57.7m.
Sales in the chain stores division grew more slowly, by 5 per cent to Pounds
1bn, with profits rising 20 per cent to Pounds 7.3m.
The dividend was maintained at 1p, for an unchanged total of 2p. Earnings
rose from 0.8p to 2.3p.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Chemicals hold Shell to 8% increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER restructuring costs in its troubled chemical division marred the
third-quarter performance by Royal Dutch/Shell Group, the Anglo-Dutch oil
group. It reported yesterday profits up 8 per cent to Pounds 861m, helped by
higher marketing margins and beneficial currency swings.
The profits increase - on a current cost of supplies basis, which excludes
after-tax changes in inventory values - was in the middle of analysts'
expectations.
But the share price of Shell Transport and Trading fell 18p to close at 704p
as oil prices tested new post-Gulf war lows. The price of benchmark Brent
Blend for December fell at one stage to Dollars 15.20 a barrel, compared
with an average of Dollars 16.50 during the third quarter.
Shell reported that lower oil prices were offset by special tax credits. It
said a credit of Pounds 205m was mainly due to a release in tax provisions
and a tax-rate change in undisclosed countries. Analysts speculated that tax
changes in Malaysia or Nigeria could account for this.
Shell's cash flow rose to Pounds 5.8bn from Pounds 4.9bn a year ago, but
analysts said there were few signs that cost-cutting was having the dramatic
effects reported by British Petroleum and the US majors. With gearing
standing at 10.2 per cent, Shell is under less pressure than some of the
more indebted majors, say analysts, who also note that it started its
cost-cutting later.
'So far there is little evidence of Shell's cost-cutting coming through in
the upstream sector,' said Mr Fergus MacLeod of NatWest Securities in
Edinburgh, who noted that Shell's earnings per barrel in the third quarter
were Dollars 1.97, from Dollars 2.45 in the previous one.
Chemicals remained a running sore, losing Pounds 168m in the third quarter
and Pounds 341m for the first nine months, compared with losses of Pounds
41m and Pounds 40m in the respective periods last year. Shell reported
special charges of Pounds 171m for the quarter.
The company warned that the outlook for petrochemicals in Europe was poor,
with little improvement until there was a general economic upturn.
In common with most other oil majors, Shell reported improved margins in
refining and marketing, particularly in Europe. Earnings rose to Pounds 412m
in the third quarter compared with Pounds 302m in the same quarter last
year. But margins in Asia, where Shell is particularly strong, weakened in
the quarter.
Earnings per share were 8.6p in the quarter, from 8p, and 24.7p for the nine
months, against 22.7p.

FT  12 NOV 93 / UUP offers Ulster peace hope: Unionist party prepared to
forge close links with Irish Republic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Ulster Unionist party has told the government it is prepared to forge
'close and visible links' with the Irish Republic as part of a Northern
Ireland settlement.
The proposals conflict sharply with a peace plan published yesterday by the
Democratic Unionist party, led by the Rev Ian Paisley, which rules out any
role for Dublin.
However, the UUP's approach bodes well for the peace process launched two
weeks ago by Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, the
Irish premier.
The Major-Reynolds initiative has shown signs of running out of steam as a
result of Unionist fears that Dublin is willing to talk to Sinn Fein, the
political arm of the IRA.
Ministers are understood to see the UUP's proposals as signs of 'positive
thinking' that could contribute to a settlement in proposed round-table
talks between the two governments and Northern Ireland's four non-violent
political parties.
Mr Ken Maginnis, the UUP deputy leader, said the proposals were based on the
party's final presentation to the last round-table talks, which broke down a
year ago.
The UUP blames the failure of the last round on the Irish government's
refusal to cede ground on Unionist demands for the withdrawal of its
constitutional claim to the province.
The Irish government has since said it would be prepared to drop its
territorial claim as part of an overall settlement that would be subject to
majority consent.
The UUP proposals were discussed this week by Mr Major and Mr James
Molyneaux, the UUP leader. They focus on the creation of a Northern Ireland
assembly with an inter-Irish relations committee, which would represent a
'formal link' with the Irish parliament.
The UUP also proposes a bill of rights to allay the fears of the Catholic
minority, and a 'meaningful role' in the administration of the province for
the nationalist SDLP.
The DUP proposals, entitled Breaking the Logjam, call for elections to a
Northern Ireland assembly, which would draw up a new constitution for the
province within the UK.
The document, handed to the government six weeks ago, says that proposals
gaining 60 per cent support within the assembly would be put to parliament.
The final package would be subject to a Northern Ireland referendum.
Mr Paisley said Sinn Fein would be allowed to stand for election to the
assembly, but would be excluded from negotiations on the form of the
government. There would be no role for the Irish government.

FT  12 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Burton Group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market was unsettled by the slippage in Burton's second half sales
following a particularly strong first six months to the year. This sales
pattern is not what is expected of a so-called recovery stock at this stage
of the consumer spending cycle. But there were some special factors at play.
The repositioning of Burton's chains confused shoppers. The ghastly summer
led to Burton being caught with its trousers marked down. Marks and Spencer,
aided by the devaluation gain at its UK supplier base, has also run riot on
the high street.
Yet, Mr John Hoerner has done well to lead Burton out of its trading corner
and deserves the benefit of the doubt for the moment. There remains
considerable scope for recovery in Burton's multiple chains. But the process
may just take longer to realise than first assumed. The bigger long-term
question is whether its multiple structure is appropriate for the 1990s.
Operating so many chains dissipates Burton's economies of scale and
complicates the management task. That perhaps argues for a demerger. The
flotation of Allders revealed a healthy demand for department stores and the
perky Debenhams could expect a still warmer response. Debenhams may have
helped keep Burton afloat during the recession. But if management believes
its restructuring rhetoric, the multiple chains are no longer in need of
such a lifebelt.

FT  12 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Electrical retailing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Offer's conclusion that the regional electricity companies are perfectly at
liberty to lose money in retailing is curious, but wholly sensible. Offer
has no business determining what strategy the Recs pursue in non-regulated
areas - so long as it does not impinge on their core businesses. Despite the
embarrassingly large scale of the Recs' retailing losses, there are few
grounds for such worry at present. Nevertheless, the OFT's encouragement of
greater transparency of accounting and market testing is a welcome attempt
to ensure fair competition. It is a shame some Recs are proving
recalcitrant.
Whether the Recs' shareholders should remain so sanguine is a different
matter. The Pounds 105m of retailing losses they have accumulated is
alarming. Yet, unlike the water companies, the Recs have a partial defence
against the charge of wanton diversification, considering they inherited
most of their retailing interests when privatised. Most are now withdrawing.
Yet Norweb is pressing ahead with an aggressive expansion programme. It will
struggle to generate serious money from it, however. Electrical retailing is
a tricky business, thanks to severe price disinflation for gizmos and fierce
competition. If Dixons can make precious little money out of electrical
retailing - excluding contributions from its highly-profitable warrants - it
seems unlikely Norweb will do much better.

FT  12 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Shell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's results from BP set the market expecting something of a gusher
from Royal Dutch/Shell as well. It should perhaps have known better. Without
BP's gearing, Shell is less well-placed to benefit from economic recovery.
With its strong presence in the Far East it was less affected by the
recession in the first place. But its lack of a recovery story leaves
investors plenty of time to dwell on the impact of weak oil prices,
especially as its high volume winter season looms. Strip out the tax credits
and Shell's earnings from exploration and production actually fell in the
third quarter. Strip out the currency effect and margins look distinctly
weak. Not only is the crude price to blame. There is not much sign of
Shell's much vaunted cost-cutting showing through. The oil price played to
Shell's advantage further downstream in manufacturing and marketing. But it
will be lucky to escape having to pass on some of this benefit soon. While a
large part of the Pounds 171m charged against chemical profits reflects the
environmental clean-up at Rocky Mountain Arsenal, restructuring charges
continue apace, again without much sign of benefit showing through.
Part of Shell's problem may simply be its very strength. With no debt
problem, the need for cost-cutting was less urgent than at BP. At around 10
per cent, its return on capital is already higher. But since Shell Transport
has out-performed Exxon by over 20 per cent this year, the market is looking
for growth which so far seems elusive.

FT  12 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Royal's cycle ride
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The higher insurance premiums foisted on British homeowners and motorists
are bearing fruit. Royal made a third quarter underwriting profit in the UK,
despite more pain from mortgage indemnity policies written in the 1980s.
Without this legacy of mortgage-related business - and another wave of
claims against employers for industrial injury - UK insurance would have
produced a handsome profit. Yet it is doubtful whether such auspicious
circumstances can be maintained for long. The composite insurance sector has
not made aggregate underwriting profits in consecutive years since the early
1970s.
Royal has pledged to maintain insurance rates even if that means
surrendering market share. Not all of its peers will take such a disciplined
attitude. With Direct Line starting to make inroads into household as well
as motor insurance, competitive pressures could quickly force prices down.
Higher profits next year look assured, for Royal as for other composite
insurers, since premium increases take up to 18 months to flow to the bottom
line. Royal should also benefit from reduced mortgage indemnity losses and
improved results in reinsurance. But earnings of perhaps Pounds 300m-Pounds
400m in 1995 will not look an especially generous return on shareholders'
funds - now Pounds 2bn - if the industry subsequently lurches into another
cyclical downturn.
Low interest rates are a reason for optimism that the underwriting cycle
will be less severe this time around. In contrast to the 1980s, premiums
paid by customers can no longer be parked in short-dated gilts to earn
double-digit interest rates. That makes underwriting profits more important.
Still, it takes a giant leap of faith to believe that a 20-year legacy of
bad habits will be easily extinguished.

FT  12 NOV 93 / UK business chiefs want single currency, CBI survey suggests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW row over Britain's position in Europe was brewing last night after an
authoritative business survey suggested many of the country's top
industrialists back sterling's participation in a single European currency.
The survey, which is due to be unveiled this weekend by the Confederation of
British Industry, showed that a large proportion of its senior members
continued to think that Europe would be the focal point of British trade and
investment in the future.
The CBI last night refused to reveal precise details of the survey but its
director-general, Mr Howard Davies, signalled that the results would be a
key topic of debate at the organisation's conference next week by strongly
attacking the attitude of the British government towards the EU.
'We are rather nervous about the way the debate in the Conservative party
has moved, such that it is almost impossible to talk about it,' he said in
an interview with The Guardian newspaper. 'What some of our big members are
anxious about is the notion of a single currency on the other side of the
Channel and Ukrainian coupons over here.'
Mr Davies added that the issue of Europe could not be buried and it would be
a dangerous mistake for the government to close off the option of moving to
a single currency. 'It's all very well to say we've had a competitive
devaluation, we are offshore, we are in the single market and we have
incredibly cheap labour costs,' he said.
'But it doesn't seem like a credible long term strategy. We are not
comfortable about being on the sidelines and ridiculing the whole notion.
You only have to go across the Channel to see they take it rather
seriously.' CBI officials said last night the survey results underlined that
Britain's businesses were clearly at odds with the government on the future
of Europe - and that the demise of the European exchange rate mechanism
should not preclude attempts to move ahead towards European monetary union.
They said the survey had taken the form of telephone interviews with 200
chief executives of leading British firms, and they would be treating its
results as an important contribution to the debate on Europe.
'CBI members favour currency stability and that is why they are in favour of
a single currency,' a CBI spokesman commented last night. 'They would not be
happy for Britain to be an offshore island linked to the community, with
other members participating in a single currency.'

FT  12 NOV 93 / Electricity companies cleared of anti-competitive behaviour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRICITY distributors in England and Wales were cleared of
anti-competitive behaviour in the high street electrical goods market
yesterday.
But the twin rulings by the Office of Fair Trading and Offer, the
electricity regulator, included a disclosure that the 12 regional
electricity companies (Recs) had lost a combined Pounds 105m in that market
over the three years since privatisation.
Dixons, the UK's largest electrical retailer, which brought the complaint
that triggered yesterday's rulings, said it felt its complaint was
vindicated by these figures, even though the charge of anti-competitive
behaviour was not upheld. 'We are very pleased that the facts are now out in
the public domain and that shareholders can see for themselves what is going
on,' said Mr Mark Souhami, Dixons deputy chairman.
Dixons had complained that Recs had maintained lossmaking retail activities
by cross-subsidising them from the electricity supply and distribution
businesses.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, said he accepted
that the activities were lossmaking. 'But I have concluded that no Rec is
significant enough to command market power. It is most unlikely that any Rec
could contemplate a strategy aimed at ousting from the market such
well-established competitors as Dixons and then recouping its losses out of
higher retail prices.'
Professor Stephen Littlechild, director-general of Offer, said that while
the Recs had made losses and earned very low returns on their retail
businesses, this 'does not in itself mean that they are being
cross-subsidised by the regulated businesses. Electricity prices and profits
are not higher as a result of retail losses than they otherwise would have
been.'
He added that the losses would be borne by the shareholders, and it was a
matter for them whether it was commercially sensible to incur them.

Want Wall Street cred? Then leave a copy of Grant's Interest Rate Observer
lying about the office.
Jim Grant's fortnightly newsletter, celebrating its tenth birthday with a
fat tome of past apercus, is required reading for anyone seeking a quirky,
contrarian view of the financial world and those who inhabit it.
Laced, unusually for American writing, with a rich sense of irony, Grant's
is written by the originator of the Current Yield column on Barron's, the US
financial weekly. When Grant went solo, Jim Rogers, George Soros's former
partner, was his first subscriber.
While his wife beavered away at Lehman Kuhn Loeb, Grant got established by
noisily deploring just the sort of deals she was doing. He fingered Olympia
&amp; York early on, rechristening its Canary Wharf site 'London's own North
Dakota'.
But Grant has not always been right. He admits that his greatest predictive
gaff was to fail to see the 'levitation of stocks and bonds in the last
couple of years'. No surprise then that he thinks financial assets are
hopelessly over-priced and commodities dirt cheap. Hence his motto for the
Clinton years: 'Down with paper. Up with things'.

Fisons is used to losing at molecular roulette - its record of developing
new drugs is lamentable. But management must be wondering about the
fickleness of lady luck following the decision of a member of its UK
salesforce to spill the beans to the Sunday Times about some allegedly
dubious promotional practices.
The subsequent article suggested the representative, David Thomas, resigned
from Fisons because of unethical selling tactics. Not mentioned was the fact
that Thomas could only afford to leave the company, and so make the
revelations, because he had just won a six-figure sum on the football pools.

Interesting to see whether the Bank of England breaks with tradition and
advertises for a replacement for Andrew Crockett who has set off for the
Bank for International Settlements. There would be no shortage of
applicants.
Running the international side of the Bank of England is one of the City's
plum jobs. Do it well and you get yourself noticed. Sir John Stevens went on
to be chairman of Morgan Grenfell and ex-Lloyds Bank chairman Sir Jeremy
Morse and Sir Kit McMahon (ex-Midland Bank) both did a stint as the Bank's
international troubleshooter.
The smart money is on the new person being an insider. Bill Allen, head of
foreign exchange operations, is a possibility. Still only 44, he is a member
of Eddie's 'brat pack' - the group the governor has nurtured during his
30-year stint in Threadneedle Street. Other names being banded about are
those of John Townend, 46, in charge of money markets and gilt-edged
trading. Pen Kent is another runner.
But don't bet on an inside job. Anthony Loehnis came from J. Henry Schroder
Wagg and Crockett himself was working at the IMF when he was tapped. Hence
the rumours about bicycle-riding John Odling-Smee, formerly deputy chief
economic adviser at the Treasury who is head of the east European division
at the International Monetary Fund. Another possibility is Goldman Sachs'
economic guru Gavyn Davies. As a Goldman partner he should have stashed away
enough money by now to afford to do a bit of public service.

International accountancy firm Arthur Andersen has been belly-aching
vociferously about the need to protect auditors against unjust and
'crippling' lawsuits from investors and disgruntled customers. But its case
might get a more sympathetic reception if it did not waste so much of its
hard-earned reserves on jetting into London this week 4,000 of its firm's
partners and hangers-on. Twenty London hotels have been needed to
accommodate them all.
The official reason is AA's annual meeting. But judging by the banquet for
the entire group on Tuesday night at Alexandra Palace, complete with string
orchestra, jazz ensemble and a room kitted up as an English pub, there is
still plenty of money left to keep the lawyers happy.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Is it goodbye Shearson? One of the household names in the US stockbroking
industry which has been proudly paired with a Hammill, a Hayden, a Stone, a
Loeb, a Rhoades, an American Express, a Lehman, a Hutton, a Lehman Brothers,
and (finally) a Smith and a Barney, may soon disappear 91 years after it
first surfaced on Wall Street.
It seems likely that the Shearson will be dropped from Smith Barney Shearson
when parent Primerica completes its Dollars 4bn acquisition of the Travelers
Corporation. Although Smith Barney Shearson would only confirm that dropping
the title was under consideration, the betting is that it is a done deal.
The decision would finally kill off a name that first appeared in 1902 when
a Canadian called Ed Shearson set up the firm of Shearson Hammill. Shearson,
however, will not be alone in the dustbin of history - it can take its place
with pride alongside such great names as Hammill, Loeb, Rhoades, Bache,
Hutton, Harris, Upham, Halsey and Kuhn.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Change at the stock exchange
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREE words the new chief executive at the London Stock Exchange said
most frequently yesterday were 'I don't know'.
In part, they reflect Mr Michael Lawrence's prudent desire, given the three
months that will elapse before he takes office, to give no hostages to
fortune. In part, they reflect a genuine lack of knowledge about the inner
mysteries of the stock market from someone who has spent his career as an
accountant and finance director.
But most of all they reflect a determination, it would seem, to hold nothing
sacred - not the tasks of the exchange itself, nor the structure of its
governance, nor whether it has a part to play in providing settlement or any
other particular services. Only the exchange's role as the central
marketplace is not up for discussion.
Such open-mindedness is refreshing: part of the exchange's problem in recent
years has been a partisan enthusiasm, shared by outside observers as much as
by members and officials, to take sides over individual aspects of the
exchange's role.
But it is also potentially destabilising: the exchange has gone through at
least two agonising reappraisals of its future in the last few years, and
the revolving door of senior executives has only recently slowed to a
manageable speed. Few could blame staff and market participants from
groaning at the thought of another 18 months of 'recasting the exchange's
role', as Mr Lawrence put it yesterday, coinciding with the arrival of a new
chairman.
So though Mr Lawrence must certainly help the exchange to establish the
clear vision of its future that has so far escaped it, he must also focus on
the day to day. That means getting closer to achieving the excellent service
that alone can offer a defence against emerging non-exchange trading
systems. It means building the exchange's own new computer trading support
system to replace SEAQ, and making its voice heard more clearly in the
debates over financial services regulation and corporate governance.
Most of all, though, it means holding the ring between the interests of the
exchange's own members - brokers and marketmakers - and those of investors
and quoted companies. Mr Lawrence says he will enjoy this aspect of his job.
Just as well: his predecessor's tenure, cut short by the collapse of the
Taurus project, was in any case threatened by disagreements among the
exchange's constituencies. Mr Lawrence must manage those relationships
better, giving proper weight, despite his time at the top of Britain's
largest institutional investor, to the neglected needs of individual
share-owners.
Without such even-handedness, the new chief executive will be unable to
achieve his aim of re-establishing the exchange's leadership in the City.
Leadership is earned by deeds, as well as words. Initial ignorance, real or
feigned, is no barrier to this - as long as it is accompanied by a
willingness to listen and a refusal to take sides.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Perfume cartel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MONOPOLIES and Mergers Commission investigation into the UK perfume
industry has a rather bad smell about it. The MMC's overall conclusion that
the industry's restrictive practices are not against the public interest
does not flow naturally from its own detailed arguments. The case also
raises concerns that UK competition policy is being hampered by decisions in
Brussels.
The investigation centred on complaints that perfume houses were refusing to
supply Superdrug and Tesco, 'grey market' retailers that sell scent at a
discount to recommended retail prices. The Office of Fair Trading was
worried that such restrictive distribution practices were keeping prices
artificially high.
The MMC went along with much of the OFT's analysis. It argued that the
industry's practice of recommending prices was uncompetitive. It noted that
authorised perfume retailers had discussed in their trade association how to
choke off supplies to the grey market retailers. Its own research showed
that Superdrug's outlets were of a above average quality, undermining a key
industry argument that restrictive distribution was designed to ensure
high-quality sales outlets. The MMC even concluded that the practice was
designed to maintain and exploit a complex monopoly.
But the MMC decided none of this was against the public interest for three
reasons. First, the UK market had become more competitive in recent years.
Second, the industry's restrictive distribution systems had recently been
cleared by the European Commission. Third, there was no clear evidence that
the practice was designed to maintain resale prices.
While it is true that the market has become more competitive, that is in
large part due to the activities of Superdrug whose ability to sustain
vigorous competition will depend on securing ready supplies in future. As
for the lack of clear evidence, that is debatable given much of the detail
in the MMC's own report.
But the wider concern surrounds the MMC's apparent willingness to accept
European Commission rulings in an investigation that related to the UK
market alone. This undermines the principle of subsidiarity, enshrined in
the Maastricht treaty, under which decisions are supposed to be taken at a
national rather than European level wherever practicable. Similarly, it
throws into doubt the European Union competition authorities' stated
intention of transfering responsibilities to national authorities.
It may be that a desire to avoid a conflict with the European Commission was
not decisive in this case and that the MMC would have taken the same view
anyway. But open conflicts between national and European competition
authorities may be harder to side-step in future. A clear division of
responsibilities must therefore be agreed that puts flesh on the
subsidiarity principle.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Personal View: Pensions could unlock Pounds 7bn tax boon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MAPLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An additional Pounds 7bn tax a year could be raised by the UK government
from a simple change to pensions taxation. Only pension fund managers would
notice the difference and the change would not reduce consumer demand or
investment.
Tax incentives for savings take two forms. In the first instance, after tax
income is invested, no tax is payable on income or gains and withdrawals are
tax free. Such is the case with Peps and Tessas. The second form is where
money is invested pre-tax, the roll-up is again tax free and withdrawals are
taxed; pensions fall within this category, the withdrawal being the pension.
In the vast majority of cases these two methods yield the same result, as
the table illustrates. My proposal is that pensions should be taxed on the
Peps/Tessa basis. All pension contributions from Budget day by employers and
employees should be considered taxable income in the employee's hands. The
amount invested after tax will yield the same after-tax pension as before.
Total private pension contributions by employers and employees in the UK
amount to Pounds 28bn a year. Taxing all future contributions at 25 per cent
would yield Pounds 7bn a year. The incomes of both employers and employees
after tax would be unaffected.
The only losers would be pension fund managers with Pounds 7bn a year less
to manage. The new system would be easier for the Inland Revenue to
administer, but the transition is complex.
The tax yield will gradually decline to zero as revenue from taxing pensions
is lost. This will take a generation. For the immediate future the yield
will be Pounds 7bn a year.
The Revenue and pension fund managers will not like running two parallel
schemes, one for contributions made before the change and yielding a taxable
pension, and another for contributions made after the change and yielding a
tax-free pension. Funds could therefore be offered an option: pay (in
instalments), say, 25 per cent of the capital value of the fund in tax now
and immediately go on to a tax free basis.
If all funds did this the government would receive about Pounds 100bn (total
pension fund assets are some Pounds 400bn). The government would immediately
lose tax yield on current pensions - about Pounds 3.5bn, but it would still
be a net Pounds 3.5bn a year ahead, plus the interest saved on Pounds 100bn
of government debt, say, a further Pounds 8bn a year.
Individuals may be obtaining tax relief on contributions at a higher rate
than they would eventually pay on their pension. This would only be true for
a few people and then only for part of their working lives. It could be
compensated for, but this may not be felt necessary.
Some people's private pensions will fall to be taxed in part or whole at the
20 per cent rate (though tax rates can and probably will change). Similarly,
there will be some pensioners who will not fully use their personal
allowances. In either case an annual tax credit could be paid in retirement.
Unfunded schemes. There is no reason to treat these differently. But such
schemes could not go fully onto the new basis as they have no assets with
which to buy the transition. Tax would be charged currently on the notional
cost of contributions but pensions would be tax free.
The tax-free advantage for lump sums is lost. This is an illogical privilege
which would be a minor sacrifice for a significant reform.
Pension funds investment will be reduced by Pounds 7bn a year, but so too
will be the public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 50bn, and the
government's need to sell gilts.
There will be other technical objections but they could all be overcome. The
facts are that the change would have no after-tax effect on employers or
employees contributing to pension schemes and need have no effect on
after-tax pensions in retirement.
The problem is political. Will people believe their pensions will be tax
free in 30 years and that the outcome is exactly the same? Will the media
welcome the change as sensible or mislead the public about its effect? Such
a change needs a first-class salesman: we have one in the chancellor.
The risks and difficulties must be set against raising an additional Pounds
7bn a year of revenue with no macroeconomic effects and no effect on
people's disposable incomes in work or retirement - surely a prize worth
grasping by a bold and imaginative chancellor with a fiscal headache.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Latin autocrats
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST LATIN American governments will welcome President Clinton's revival of
the idea of a western hemisphere free trade area first proposed by his
predecessor, George Bush. Unfortunately, this particular revival will last
barely one week if the US House of Representatives votes down the North
American Free Trade Agreement on Wednesday.
The US Congress is not the only obstacle. The idea assumes the existence of
a community of market-oriented democracies in Latin America. But while most
governments of the region are now elected, the authoritarianism of past
decades has not been buried.
The continued attraction of autocratic or charismatic leaders arises not
least because of the poor performance by many elected governments.
Electorates have been given too many reasons for viewing politics as a stale
confrontation between government institutions remote from them.
This fatigue with the political system is why Peruvians were willing to back
the overturning of constitutional order by President Alberto Fujimori in
April 1992, and to support his new constitution (if in rather a lukewarm
fashion) in last week's referendum. It is also why Venezuelans did not react
more strongly to the threat to democracy posed by two military coup attempts
last year, and why a politician - Rafael Caldera - offering more in the way
of personalismo than policies is leading the field in next month's
elections.
Yet the exercise of personal power damages prospects for what Latin America
really does need: more representative democratic institutions, fair legal
systems and freedom from the uncertainty bred by authoritarianism.
Fortunately, the continued allure of the autocrat is not the only thing
happening in Latin America. In many countries, Venezuela and Brazil being
two, government is being decentralised and people given the right to elect
their local political leaders. Elsewhere, politicians are giving thought to
legal reform.
A legal system subordinate to the executive, along with a corrupt judiciary
offers a poor environment for the development of the market economies most
Latin American governments now say they want. Contracts become impossible to
enforce reliably. Credit becomes hard to get and expensive, because it is
difficult for lenders to pursue claims for collateral.
Without a proper institutional background, the long-term private investment
Latin America desperately needs will, in these days of free global movement
of capital, find another home.
It has often been argued, from both the left and the right in Latin America,
that an authoritarian system is necessary to sustain economic freedom and a
market economy. If it were ever true, it looks a dubious proposition today.
Markets need rules and they need an effective state to enforce them, but
they are endangered by the arbitrary exercise of power.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Perfumes' fate sealed with a sniff: A victory for fine
fragrance houses might not mark the end of the war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's biggest perfume manufacturers are savouring the sweet scent of
victory after the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report yesterday on fine
fragrances; while Superdrug, the discount chain which has been their most
persistent critic, ponders the sour smell of defeat.
By exonerating the manufacturers of using anti-competitive practices to
overcharge consumers, the report has removed the threat of an unseemly price
war which would severely damage the industry's profits, undermine its
distribution methods and cheapen the exclusive image of its brands.
For Superdrug, part of the Kingfisher retailing group, waging a high-profile
campaign to force leading perfume houses to supply it directly, the decision
is a sharp disappointment. 'The MMC report has left us high and dry,' the
company said.
However, though the perfumiers have won the battle, it may not mark the end
of the war. The perfume houses' traditional way of doing business is likely
to remain under continued challenge, both in the courts and as a result of
the changing nature of the industry.
The issues at stake are unusually complex. Not only are the methods used to
market and distribute perfume probably unique in industry, but the legal
picture is confused by the overlap between the European Union and national
competition law.
Indeed, to a far greater degree than any other recent monopolies case, the
perfumes affair underlines the difficulty of applying to competition policy
the European Union's principle of 'subsidiarity', which seeks to leave many
decisions to national authorities.
In weighing its decision, the commission was obliged to recognise that its
scope for action was to some extent limited by the fact that the European
Commission had already exempted the distribution of perfumes from the full
force of competition law.
The exemption has taken the form of approved agreements which permit perfume
houses to restrict supplies to retailers meeting certain standards -
stocking a broad range of products, displaying them in acceptable conditions
and using trained staff to sell them.
Such agreements have also been allowed by Brussels in other industries, such
as cars and consumer electronics. However, in most cases they are permitted
on the grounds that the products are complex and need after-sales service.
In perfumes, however, the justification is that the products are luxury
goods, which depend for their appeal on an aura of exclusivity maintained by
high price, large investments in marketing and a sophisticated sales
environment.
This argument was accepted by the MMC, which acknowledged the importance of
snob value to the success of perfumes, which it termed 'a conceit, a
confection created as much by the copywriter as the parfumeur.' High prices,
the commission agreed, were a vital part of the formula.
That, however, is not a universal view - even inside the European
Commission, where some officials believe the perfume regime owes more to
skilful lobbying by a small band of predominantly French producers than to
the alleged uniqueness of the product.
Some retailers and consumer organisations go further. They insist the
perfume industry's main objective is to keep profits artificially high by
refusing to supply stores which sell at cut prices.
Though the MMC found no evidence to support this accusation, it is at the
heart of a pending European Court case brought by Leclerc, a large French
supermarket chain. Leclerc is challenging Brussels' approval of selective
distribution agreements used by Yves Saint Laurent and Givenchy, two leading
perfume houses.
Should the court find in Leclerc's favour, the whole issue of special
treatment would be reopened and Brussels could be forced to re-examine its
policy of exempting other industries from competition law.
Some similar issues are raised by another legal battle, over the ice cream
market. Mars, the US confectionery company, has brought actions in Brussels
and European capitals challenging the distribution policies of Unilever, the
Anglo-Dutch consumer products manufacturer which is the world's largest ice
cream maker.
Mars claims Unilever is restricting competition by preventing rival brands
from being stocked in the freezer cabinets it supplies to many small
retailers. The case is being investigated by both the European Commission
and the MMC.
The dispute also centres on how far it is legitimate for producers to
control access to distribution channels in which they have invested heavily,
and may pose a further test of the jurisdictional boundaries between
European and national competition authorities.
Whichever way the legal arguments go, the perfume industry faces mounting
pressures on other fronts. Recession has depressed demand, leading to sharp
drops in sales volumes which have only partly been offset by higher prices.
Manufacturers everywhere are being forced to run harder. In an effort to win
back consumers, they have sharply stepped up new product launches. In
Britain, where there are more than 400 perfume brands on sale, there were 92
launches between 1990 and 1992, almost three times the number in the
previous three years.
Though perfumes cost little to develop and produce, the investments needed
to market them can be huge. In Britain, according to the MMC, perfume
manufacturers last year spent on marketing almost half as much as they
earned in sales revenues.
L'Oreal of France, the industry leader, spent more than Pounds 50m three
years ago to launch Dune, now a best-selling fragrance. But Dune's success
is exceptional. Most new perfumes fail, and many do not recoup their launch
costs.
The stakes have been raised further by the consolidation of much of the
industry into the hands of a few big groups with deep pockets, powerful
distribution networks and lavish marketing budgets. As well as L'Oreal, they
include Unilever, the French luxury goods group LVMH, and Elf Sanofi, part
of Elf Aquitaine, the French oil company.
Furthermore, competition is creeping into distribution. The MMC estimates
that a sixth of wholesale domestic perfume sales in the UK, which totalled
Pounds 181m, was supplied from the 'grey' market. This is fed by so-called
parallel imports which bypass manufacturers' authorised channels.
A further Pounds 50m - a third of the value of manufacturers' authorised
sales - was made through duty-free shops, at discounts of as much as 60 per
cent on normal retail prices.
This trend has not gone far enough to satisfy Superdrug and other discount
retailers, which sell perfumes at as much as 30 per cent below retail prices
by buying supplies on the 'grey' market.
Superdrug complained yesterday that the report was internally contradictory.
On the one hand, the MMC had attributed much of the increased competition to
Superdrug and other unauthorised retailers, but on the other hand has
refused to compel the perfumes houses to supply them freely.
Superdrug argues that 'grey' market sources are both expensive and scarce.
It says unless it can obtain new sources of supply, its perfume sales will
remain limited to about 60 stores, where it has spent some Pounds 1.2m on
counters and displays.
Nonetheless, there are signs that harsh commercial realities are forcing
some smaller manufacturers to relax traditional distribution restrictions.
Parfums Worth has agreed to sell through Superdrug, while in France, the
Carrefour supermarket chain has persuaded Pierre Cardin to supply it.
Some observers believe more barriers will crumble. 'The market is going to
change,' says Ms Nina Stimson, managing editor of European Cosmetics
Markets, an industry magazine. 'Throughout Europe, suppliers are starting to
break ranks.'
Just how far and how fast may depend partly on the length of the recession.
Most observers believe it will be a long time, if ever, before top brands
such as Chanel, Dior and Guerlain are affected. But the steadily mounting
pressures on the industry suggest that, whatever competition authorities
say, for some perfume makers at least, life may never be quite the same.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Hutchison digital network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MR HANS ROGER SNOOK.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lex's note on Hutchison and Mercury (October 6) stated that 'the two
digital networks cover complementary geographical areas. . .'. This implies
that the Hutchison PCN network does not cover London or within the M25. In
fact the Hutchison digital PCN network as currently deployed covers not only
London, but offers ubiquitous coverage within and beyond the M25. Our own
tests have indicated that Hutchison coverage in London and within the M25 is
currently better, and offers better in-building penetration than Mercury's
One-2-One network.
Given this fact, speculation that the two networks might be merged is
totally unfounded. Although there would be an obvious benefit to Mercury
One-2-One subscribers to be able to roam on to the Hutchison network, there
would be no benefit whatsoever to Hutchison subscribers to roam on to
One-2-One's network. I would say this puts the odds in Hutchison's favour
for generating subscribers, and also makes us the stronger, not Mercury. I
agree, however, that Mercury presently has the far stronger brand name, but
we do intend to change that over time.
The Hutchison PCN network will, at launch, cover London, everywhere within
the M25, the south east, Bristol, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Edinburgh,
Glasgow, and all main connecting routes and roads (ie 50 per cent of the
population.) By the end of 1994 we will cover fully 70 per cent of the UK
population, and will continue to roll out to 90 per cent. This is not a
'negotiating tactic' or a 'bluff' as the article suggests. More than 1,000
sites have already been acquired, and more than 700 have equipment
installed.

FT  12 NOV 93 / A steely glint in its eye: A look at the revival of a
loss-making Brazilian industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazil's newly privatised steel industry has become a highlight of the
country's inflation-racked economy. After a decade of under-investment,
price controls and mounting losses, the sector is expected to have its most
profitable year since the 1970s.
The costs of this transformation, in terms of job losses and social
disruption, have been heavy. But industry and union leaders now admit that
the changes were needed for the industry to survive. 'Brazilian society was
paying for our losses. Now we employees realise the future is in our hands,'
according to Mr Wilson Brumer, president of specialist steels company
Acesita. The company was privatised last year and returned to profit in the
second quarter of this year. It made profits of USDollars 13.3m in the first
nine months of this year, compared with Dollars 84.8m losses for that period
last year.
'We survived instead of died, partly because of the 8,000 people who lost
their jobs,' says Mr Luiz de Oliveira Rodrigues, president of the
metalworkers union at Companhia Siderurgica Nacional, the country's largest
steel producer. Since 1990, when CSN made a loss of Dollars 729m, it has cut
its workforce by a third, and this year is likely to announce record
production and profits of more than Dollars 50m.
The change in fortunes for the sector, which ranks as one of the top 10 in
the world in terms of crude steel production, started in 1990. The
government, which owned eight steel companies including the country's six
largest, announced that steel was to start off an ambitious privatisation
programme. The process was completed in September with the auction of
Acominas, the last company to be privatised, at a 90 per cent premium to the
government's minimum asking price.
The sector was chosen because, with some exceptions, it was losing the
government millions of dollars each year. This was partly due to poor
management and partly due to political interference, which included price
controls and job security rules. Mr Eduardo Modiano, in charge of the early
stages of privatisation as ex-president of Brazil's development bank, says
that since the industry was set up 50 years ago governments have pumped
USDollars 26.5bn at prices of the day into the companies that have now been
privatised. In the same period, the companies returned dividends of only
Dollars 500m to the government. Persuading managements and unions of the
need for privatisation was difficult. Steel was an important symbol of the
country's industrial emergence after the second world war. The sector also
possessed some of the country's most radical unions. A bomb exploded ahead
of the first privatisation, the 1991 sale of Usiminas, and there were
regular displays of violence at subsequent auctions.
The programme was successful mainly because the early examples were seen to
work. Once freed of price and other government controls, companies were
immediately able to restore margins and profitability. They were also able
to address the inefficiencies which had built up in the public sector.
Mr Roberto Procopio de Lima Netto, president of CSN since 1990, started
paying suppliers on time. This led to immediate savings, as the suppliers
cut their prices. They had previously included a premium when supplying
state companies because of slow or non-payment. CSN's staff cuts, which
saved about Dollars 10m a month, were unpopular. But CSN used some of the
money to pay seven months of salary arrears to its remaining workforce.
Support for Mr Procopio gradually grew.
In all privatisations, shares were reserved for workers. CSN's employees
control one of the company's largest shareholdings, with 22 per cent, of
which half is held through pension funds. Mr de Oliveira Rodrigues has also
become a member of the company's administrative board. 'The new philosophy
is of partnership,' he says.
Usiminas was seen as one of the most efficient companies, partly because of
a long-standing technical relationship with Nippon Steel of Japan, which is
also a 14 per cent shareholder. But according to Mr Rinaldo Campos Soares,
president, the company was immediately able to introduce cost savings of
about Dollars 15 a tonne, or about 5 per cent of total cost, through
renegotiated supply contracts and improved purchasing. Before privatisation,
all purchases had to be auctioned, and the cheapest bids had to be accepted
even if the quality was poor.
'Privatisation allowed the company to be more flexible. The state had become
a burden and the company couldn't grow any more,' he says.
Cost savings and productivity at Acesita, Latin America's only producer of
stainless steel, have been even more sudden. The company had been paying 33
per cent real interest rates on its borrowings. This figure has been reduced
to 12 per cent which, while still burdensome, has already saved Dollars 40m
a year in lower interest charges. Productivity in the first nine months of
the year has increased 50 per cent, of which only half is due to staff cuts.
'With 25 per cent fewer people, we're producing more,' Mr Brumer says.
These improvements in productivity and efficiency helped profitability, even
if some savings were unrepeatable and the improvements were measured against
a low base. More important were the big cost advantages Brazil's steel
industry enjoys, and which were masked by state ownership. As the world's
largest iron ore producer, Brazil's steelmakers pay about half the average
world price because of minimal transport costs. Although levels of labour
productivity are low, so are wages and electricity costs. As a result,
Brazilian exports are increasingly price competitive and increased 10 per
cent to Dollars 1.75bn in the first half of the year.
But the domestic market, still protected by average tariffs of 14 per cent
and high transport costs faced by potential importers, is more attractive,
because it allows high margins. Mr Pacifico Paoli, managing director of Fiat
of Brasil, Usiminas's largest customer, says there has been a 'tremendous'
jump in efficiency since privatisation, although this has not translated
into lower prices. 'They still try to get the advantages of the world market
price.'
Mr Francois Moyen, president of Belgo-Mineira, a private sector steel and
related products group, says the main problem facing the industry is the
country's economy. With per capita steel consumption at less than 10 per
cent of the levels of developed economies such as Japan's, he and other
industry figures talk of the domestic market's 'huge opportunities'. 'But
the potential is linked to growth in GDP and that's the problem: when is the
country going to grow?' he asks, highlighting Brazil's overall economic
uncertainty.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Paying for performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MR PETER M BROWN.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I look forward to your further articles on Performance Related Pay and
would offer the following reasons for the beneficial spread of the concept
even if, to date, many schemes have not achieved all their objectives.
1) We have returned some power from shop stewards to first line foremen and
clerical unit managers. To strengthen their position companies have passed
more discretionary award recommendations to this crucial group.
2) As part of this exercise annual performance appraisals are much more
widespread than in 1980 and appraisals without some potential personal
benefit are like dough without yeast, soggy and often undertaken by both
sides as a perfunctory exercise.
3) The empowerment of remuneration committees has resulted in a spread of
PRP culture. I am willing to bet that 99 per cent of boards with such a
committee use some form of PRP as simply salary vetting reviews, and changes
to pension rules are not a sufficiently 'high fibre diet' for active
non-executive directors.
4) Avoiding the current and future pension costs of higher fixed salaries is
a major issue as companies fight to control their cost base. PRP, which is
often not pensionable and moves with cash flow, gives employees an indirect
stake in decision taking. Its increased use could save some jobs and
companies from being sacrificed through over-pricing. You have only to look
at the inroads PRP-based contractors have made in contracting out services
from rigid salary organisations like councils and the uniformed services to
see that those organisations could have maintained their own staffing if
they had been more willing to establish a flexible structure.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: TV cannot offer depth of written
history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From HILARY PERROTT.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Christopher Dunkley ('A season of excellence from the BBC', November
10) claims that television can be a better medium than the written word for
presenting modern history. There is no doubt that the series upon which he
bases this idea (Thatcher: The Downing Street Years) is a remarkable piece
of television, and, more than that, a devastating expose of the former PM's
style of government.
But surely no television programme, however well-balanced and illuminating,
can ever approach the depth of a written history? A span of time needs to
pass before the Thatcher years can be analysed and their full impact
assessed. In 50 years, when an arm's length survey is written, a historian
will certainly be able to use the material presented in the television
series, and may even draw upon Thatcher's autobiography (though that would
seem to be of limited usefulness), but one hopes that he or she will employ
an equal scepticism in viewing the contributions of all participants in
those tangled times.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Failure of bank argument
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MR CHARLES BURROWS.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan's Economic Viewpoint (November 4) contained an excellent
evaluation of the potential problem of deficient demand and he naturally
followed this with yet another call for (the sensible) targeting of nominal
gross domestic product.
However, he failed to show how his throw-away remarks about the need for an
independent central bank followed in any way from the previous analysis. In
particular, if nominal GDP is to be the target, how is a central bank, which
only has control over monetary policy, supposed to achieve its target?
Surely a pursuit of a nominal GDP target requires both fiscal and monetary
levers?
Furthermore, in continuing his metaphor about the 1930s, Samuel Brittan
fails to explain what happens when it is the independent central bank which
is more worried about communism (read inflation) as in federal Germany
today?

FT  12 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Sugar wrong about Labour in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MR JOHN TOMLINSON MEP.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Is Mr Alan Sugar (Letters, November 10) a politically motivated knave,
a fool, or both? Or is he merely bringing the same level of competence to
his letter writing as he does to his negotiation and management skills of
Tottenham Hotspur FC?
John Smith, leader of the Labour party, was at the same congress of the
party of European Socialists as I, and presumably agreed the same manifesto
as I had in my file: Mr Sugar's view of its commitments is both inaccurate
concerning detail and tendentious concerning meaning.
If he wants to write a more reflective piece on what is a very good common
manifesto based on its real rather than imagined content I will happily
supply him with a copy upon receipt of a stamped addressed envelope.
In the meantime either his company or Spurs needs his care and concern more
than the Labour party. Even if he feels compelled to venture into political
advice, recent opinion polls suggest that the government needs wisdom - his
or anyone else's - rather than other potential beneficiaries of his no doubt
altruistic but nevertheless ill founded letter.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Culture in industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MR PETER WOOD.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Professor Leslie Hannah's reference to 'many decades of domination of
industry by the public school elite' ('Old boy network. . .', November 10)
hardly sounds like an 'anti-industrial culture', while Nigel Rudd's claim
that 'there's certainly an anti-industry culture in the British upper
classes' appears to be a misunderstanding of those 'many decades', inspired
perhaps by easy acceptance of Martin Wiener's thesis about British
industrial decline.
The 1968 Royal Commission on Public Schools showed that more than 70 per
cent of the directors of prominent companies came from the public schools.
The social historian, Harold Perkin, notes that by the late 1960s 'the
public school men were dominating the commanding heights of all the major
professional and managerial hierarchies, and it was no longer true that they
neglected business'.
Dr Perkin also shows (The Rise of the Professional Class) that while British
aristocracy has traditionally been entrepreneurial, the anti-industrialism
detected by Wiener is related to penetration of British business by the
public service ('wet') ideals inculcated by the public schools in their
mainly middle-class intake.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Nails in the cabinet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government op-erates in a 'well nigh permanent atmosphere of
crisis'. I take the phrase from Lord Hailsham, who deployed it in a
celebrated lecture on the cabinet seven years ago this week.
If that was true of the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher's administration, which
rested on a majority of 100-plus, it is doubly so of Mr Major's, which has a
theoretical majority of 17, constantly threatened by around a dozen
potential rebels and usually supported by Ulster Unionists. You would not
get this impression from the son-of-Hailsham lecture given by Lord Wakeham
on Wednesday night. The latter is not only the leader of the House of Lords,
but also 'Lord Privy Seal', which means that he can be deployed as chairman
of many of the committees of the cabinet that the prime minister himself
does not head.
Lord Wakeham paints a picture of a smoothly functioning team, every member
of which is devoted to the doctrine of collective responsibility.
Departmental ministers take the lead in presenting policies, first by
circulating written proposals to other heads of department who may have an
interest and subsequently by appearing before the relevant cabinet
committee. As I read him, ministers are the engines of government. Often,
his own chairmanship oils the wheels. The Treasury is the brake.
The unspoken subtext of the Wakeham address, delivered at Brunel University,
Middlesex, is that while Mrs Thatcher tried to dominate the proceedings, and
resorted to ad hoc committees as a means of avoiding awkward discussions,
nice Mr John Major adopts a more conciliatory, structured approach.
Conciliatory yes; structured maybe. There is no hint of any forum in which
our elected political servants, possessed of sufficient back-up, can enjoy
an open and prolonged discussion on topics of importance. Brainstorming -
just kicking a proposition around - is hardly possible. Nobody has the time.
The civil service, which likes to maximise paperwork, would not permit it.
Departmental boundaries are uncrossable. The atmosphere of panic prevails.
To be fair, the Lord Privy Seal does not pretend that the cabinet runs the
country. It only meets for a few hours on Thurs-day mornings. There would be
no time in which to get much thrashed out even if there was a willingness to
let such a thing happen. Take the 'unified Budget', which has been
introduced this year. A simultaneous announcement of spending and taxing
plans is due at the end of the month. Yet the actual Budget will not be seen
by non-Treasury ministers until the morning of the day of its delivery to
Parliament. In short, the cabinet has a light supervisory role. It can
sometimes be the scene of genuine argument, as may have been the case with
spending this year, but, as Lord Hailsham discerned in 1987, the real work
is done by subcommittees. Cabinet government, he said in his Granada
Guildhall lecture, 'is one of the permanent gifts conferred by British
political genius on the science and art of civilised government'.
You have to be English to appreciate just how the shape of that gift has
evolved. Although nominated by the prime minister, British ministers are
each appointed separately under the royal prerogative. If you follow Lord
Hailsham's account, the office held by Mr Major arose out of an accident of
history. It happened in 1714, when the Elector of Hanover became George I.
Since he could speak no English, and was obliged to converse with Walpole in
dog Latin, the latter presided at ministerial meetings. It took two further
centuries of rolling English constitution-making for the title 'prime
minister' to be given legal recognition. The original honorific, 'first lord
of the treasury', was retained alongside the new one. In the 19th century
Gladstone wondered whether a prime minister - first lord - had the right to
fire ministers he had invited to join his cabinet. Today, as Lady Thatcher
can attest, dismissals are free, but each one creates an enemy on the
backbenches.
All British prime ministers must at one time or another have longed for the
brutal simplicity of the American method. When Mr Richard Nixon was
re-elected in November 1972, a form was handed out stating bluntly that
'every appointee of cabinet rank will be expected to be the president's man
in the department and not the department's advocate to the president'. A box
was provided alongside this and other, similar instructions for newly
appointed ministers to tick. That would show that it had been read,
understood and accepted.
The Nixon method was Mrs Thatcher's aspiration, but in fact British
government works the other way around. Departments capture all but the most
powerful ministers, and send them forth into Whitehall to represent the
interests of their clients. The transport ministry represents road
construction companies; defence, weapons suppliers; agriculture, farmers;
the department of industry - if Mr Michael Heseltine, looking fit and
relaxed, has anything to do with it - British industry.
You could characterise, if not caricature, parts of the current system thus:
lobbies for interested companies and trade associations plant ideas on
officials, who put them up to ministers. When privatisation is involved,
some public servants, and some politicians, eventually make their fortunes
by taking jobs with the newly created companies. Placing lucrative contracts
can also help. Companies that benefit support the governing party. The
balancing factors are, first, strongly motivated ministers who do not need
the money (among whom I would number the president of the board of trade)
and, second, the daily, anxious count of Conservative backbench votes.
The chief whip, Mr Richard Ryder, has more to say about the constant panic
in Whitehall than perhaps any other player. His calculations will determine
whether the post office can be privatised (no), London's buses can be
deregulated (no) or the government can afford to put up an imaginative,
wide-ranging programme in next week's Queen's speech (no). Only Mr Kenneth
Clarke is theoretically beyond this constraint. If the chancellor, backed by
Mr Major, cannot get his Budget, whatever it says, through the house, the
government will surely fall. You can, however, bet that even now he is
counting votes.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Arts: Sergey Leiferku - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although the freedom to travel has encouraged ever more striking young
Russian singers to forge careers in the West, those who managed to establish
themselves in the dying days of the communist era still hold their place
proudly. Among the many baritones, Sergey Leiferkus remains supreme on the
international stage.
It is almost ten years since I first heard Leiferkus in Aida at the
Maryinsky (then Kirov) Theatre in St Petersburg. The voice did not seem
especially large at that time, but it had a flawless focus of sound that
left no doubt as to its quality. His encore from Yevgeny Onegin at his
Wigmore Hall recital on Wednesday told of the same strengths - concentrated
force of tone, ringing top notes, beyond the limits of his younger rivals.
It would be easy to talk about nothing but the basic quality of his voice.
Its brilliance, as though singing with the spotlight turned full on, is
unlike any other baritone in the profession today. But this recital of songs
by Tchaikovsky and Rakhmaninov displayed colourings, variations, shadings of
the voice that are now just as important.
One reason may be that it has become a deeper baritone than it used to be.
The words 'Say, I love' in his second Rakhmaninov song were spoken in a
strangely hollow, husky tone, so as to convey something of the poem's hints
of masochism. The central stanza of 'Fate', when the poet talks of sunset
growing dark behind the wood, became warm, tender, dusky. The scalding
mockery of 'Christ is risen]' was aflame with white-hot vocal intens-ity.
Almost every colour was there - the one exception being a truly hushed,
inward feeling, which Leiferkus uses sparely. Even when he did find it for
Tchaikovsky's desolate 'Again, as before, I am alone', it is worth
remembering what his compatriot Olga Borodina has achieved in the same song.
Where Leiferkus was soft-edged, withdrawn, keeping Tchaikovsky cocooned in
his own private world with eyes closed, Borodina peered openly into the
black depths of despair.
Comparisons, though, rarely go against Leiferkus. Perhaps the programme
included an undue number of songs that ended with a chance to show off those
impressive top F's and G's. Otherwise, this recital, gloriously sung,
tellingly interpreted, and with an able accompanist in Semion Skigin, showed
Russia's leading baritone at the peak of his art. It is excellent news that
he is to record the songs of Musorgsky. The other Russian song composers
should follow soon.

<TEXT>
The scene:
Joe Allen's restaurant near Covent Garden, London, or any place where
theatricals hang out after shows. An obscure and no-longer-young thespian
rushes up to hail the star of the West End's latest opening.
Thespian: Darling] I hear your new show's a wow] And the first night had a
really amazing audience]
Anita Dobson (for it is she): Why, yes] Edwina Currie and Julian Clary, Alan
Whicker and Mike Nolan, Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry, Paul Nicholas and
Victor Spinetti, Esther Rantzen and Ronnie Corbett . . .
Thesp (green with envy, interrupting): Fabulous] Is yours a big role?
Anita (modestly): Well, I'm the star . . .
Thesp (now pea-green): Really? So who do you play?
Anita: Well, I'm an Italian has-been who comperes the EuroVision Song
Contest, and who becomes psychically possessed by the Spirit of Europe, and
I play agony-aunt to two English queens, who are pursued by the ghosts of
the Emperor Hadrian and his lover Antinous . . .
Thesp (who has changed hue to red): Now, when you say queens . . .
Anita: Yes, the show's all about gay men and coming out.
Two of the international singers have an affair, too: the Spanish singer and
the Greek.
Thesp: So it's a really bold show like Bent?
Anita: No, it's more fun . . .
Thesp: What - like Torch Song Trilogy?
Anita: No, no, lighter and happier than that. And I help the gays to love
each other properly.
Thesp: And do you have a love-affair too?
Anita: No, I just play their fairy godmother. Thesp: And there are songs?
Anita: Oh yes, I sing 'Edelweiss' in my Italian accent - 'E-dalla-weiss'.
The rest are funny EuroVision-type songs, written by Jason Carr - who's a
little love. At the end, the Greek singer wins the Contest with
'Bim-Bam-Bom]' On the first night the audience all clapped in time; and they
were all given CDs of the song with their free programme, wasn't that a
marvellous idea?
Thesp: Mmmm. So it's a musical?
Anita: Not really. The two English queens - that's James Dreyfus, who's
tremendous as Gary, you can't believe how camp he is, and Charles Edwards as
Kevin - don't sing, and neither do Hadrian and his boyfriend. Thesp: I don't
understand this thing about being psychically possessed . . .
Anita: Well, you know how Hadrian is a great gay hero, because he had more
works of art made in honour of Antinous than have ever been made of anyone
else in history. So he and Antinous inspire people even now. But, because
not enough gay men love each other properly, the Spirit of Europe suddenly
starts to haunt me, and makes me make them love more.
Thesp (feebly): . . . The Spirit of Europe? Anita: Yes, this being
Maastricht year and all that . . .
Thesp (stunned): But you don't mean that Maastricht will mean more gay love,
do you?
Anita: Absolutely not. In fact, I tell the English boys that they're lucky
not to be Italian. Italian men are too caught up on being macho to know
about love.
Thesp: But the show treats Europe seriously?
Anita: Oooh, no. The Greeks and Spaniards and Italians in it are just jokes.
Thesp: And it's produced by Andrew Lloyd Webber and the Really Useful
Company?
Anita: Yes] And Tim Luscombe not only wrote it all, he directs too. What a
clever sweetheart he is] The beginning's a bit leaden, but it warms up when
I come on.
Thesp: What's your funniest line?
Anita (in low, creamy, Euro-compere voice): 'Grazie, Macedonia.'
Thesp (hopefully): So it's utterly camp?
Anita: Er . . . Yes.
Thesp (with relief): Darling, I can't wait to see it.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Arts: Car designed by nature
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'We say that the world's magnificence has been enriched by a new beauty: the
beauty of speed. A racing car whose hood is adorned with great pipes, like
serpents of explosive breath - a roaring car that seems to ride on grapeshot
 -is far more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace,' Marinetti's
Futurist Manifesto proclaimed in 1909.
Racing cars may have long lost their serpents of explosive breath but, as
Design for Speed: Three Automobiles by Ferrari at the Museum of Modern Art
in New York also illustrates, the pursuit of maximum speed and performance
has forged its own aesthetic.
This is the first automobile show at MOMA for 15 years and the first to
focus on the process of design. Curator Christopher Mount had long nurtured
the idea of staging an exhibition around a Formula 1 racer and his show
considers the evolution of the red Ferrari Formula 1 and its relationship to
the firm's road cars. Enzo Ferrari built his first sports car in 1950 to
finance his racing career. Ferrari remains the only manufacturer to produce
cars for both track and road, and to build both engine and chassis.
MOMA's escalator deposits the visitor before the surprisingly smooth and
sculptural but oddly silent 641 that Ferrari has given to the museum. This
is the 1990 car in which Alain Prost won four Grand Prix titles and Ferrari
claimed its 100th championship. Appropriately for a museum of modern art,
such a Formula 1 racing car is arguably the most triumphant exemplar of the
Modernist ideal of form following function. The beauty it possesses is due
to its purity of purpose: to transport a single human being around a track
as quickly as safely possible. Its shape is determined by the laws of
aerodynamics; it is virtually designed by nature. Every feature is geared
towards holding the road at speeds in excess of 200mph. Nothing is
superfluous.
To emphasise the point, we find a computer-generated profile of the racer -
a minor piece of Op Art in its own right - and a scale model used in the
wind tunnel to work on aerodynamic detail. It seems, most unfairly, that
British designer John Barnard had only to provide a skin with which to cloth
a pre-ordained anatomy of cockpit, gearbox and engine. The latter, with its
matt-black cast-iron and curling pipes of gleaming, patinated aluminium, is
one of the most pleasing objects in the show.
Ferrari's first production car, represented here by a 166MM of 1950 with a
Barchetta or little boat body, was both racer and road car. Its fluid curves
and elegant streamlining speak of the 1950s aesthetic of speed. This is pure
sculpture. Its form is determined not by the effects of wind, drag or
downforce but by the desire to create an object of beauty. Like bronze
sculpture, the steel shell was even hammered into shape by workmen. As a
result, no two cars are the same. As befits this more innocent age, design
drawings are executed in childrens' coloured pencils. Federico Formenti's
design for the spyder version in 1948 endearingly includes a driver drawn to
scale sporting helmet and goggles.
Racing and road car design were soon to take divergent paths. The F40 here
was made to celebrate Ferrari's 40th year, one of a limited edition of
1,000. When the F40 made its debut a year before Enzo Ferrari's death in
1988, it was said to be the fastest road car available. Once again, Ferrari
had brought to the production car a technical standard of performance only
usually found in a racing car. Unsurprisingly, the F40 looks just like one.
Given the dependence of their design on our understanding of physical laws,
Formula 1 racers inevitably look very much alike. There is no comparable
conformity of design for high performance passenger sports cars. Optimal
performance is compromised by considerations of space, comfort and the
ability to travel at low speeds. In this market, styling is crucial.
Virtues are made out of necessities. The F40's most distinctive feature  -
the 13 scooped-out triangular air vents that cool the powerful turbo-charged
engine - are purely functional. In its overall design the F40 bears the
unmistakable imprint of the 1980s with its tight-waisted, lipstick-glossy
body, awkward elbows and aggressive angles. There is no doubt that this is a
flashy and mean machine.
As guests at the private view cooed over the soft curves, leather lining and
glinting marine tints of the Barchetta, the American Modernist architect
Philip Johnson, admiring the F40, assured me that 'in 40 years time, this is
the car that everyone will prefer'.
Designed for Speed, made possible by a grant from Ferrari SpA, continues at
The Museum of Modern Art in New York until March 1 1994.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Arts: American influences - Concerts in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY and MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The billing for Wednesday's concert by Music Projects/London was 'American
Counterpoints', but this really applied only to Steve Reich's ingenious
Vermont Counterpoint for one live flute and ten more on tape; and maybe, to
Colin Matthews' Hidden Variables, which is in part a mischievous send-up
(British) of American minimalism and post-minimalism.
Still, what's in a name? In this case, the official but purely notional
tie-in with the American Art show at the Royal Academy. (There may have been
people there who came expressly to match their impressions of American
abstract painting against aural Reich and John Cage, but how would one
know?) Forget the label: this was a concert full of lively imagination, from
the planning to the execution - bright, inquiring, funny and exhilarating.
Music Projects/London was set up by the conductor Richard Bernas a good
while ago. Their distinguished seniors, the London Sinfonietta, have enjoyed
more continuity of personnel; but the MP/L's track record must by now make
them the leading young challengers. In the Queen Elizabeth Hall on
Wednesday, it seemed to me - I may be wrong - that there were many more
under-25s than the norm for the pricier Sinfonietta concerts.
Yet that was not because the MP/L programme was hot-off-the-stove stuff. On
the contrary, it treated us to ancient, scatty Charles Ives, and John Cage
in his least-known period (a 1947 ballet score for Merce Cunningham, The
Seasons), along with the more recent Reich and Matthews. The ten minutes of
Reich's fresh, extremely clever multi-flute exercise were entirely justified
by Nancy Ruffer's solo playing. The Cage score finds him somewhere between
tranquil, mock-naive formalism and an active urge to scrap Western musical
paraphernalia altogether: fascinatingly dull, not just dull.
MP/L is distinguished above all for its cutting edge and its verve. In
Ives's three 'Theatre Orchestra Sets' - the fullest versions that I've
heard, carefully traced back to the first drafts - everyone in the ensemble
leapt to their opportunities, with full prompting from Bernas. Almost every
piece in these ragbag collections has a different instrumentation, anything
from a woozy wind-band to sighing strings, and each strikes sparks off some
unheard-of idea. That cornucopia of random inspirations, whether radical or
just gleefully silly, was wonderfully bracing to hear. (Some FT readers
might like to know that Ives was all his life a professional insurance man,
apparently with great actuarial breakthroughs to his credit.)
Matthews' beady-eared diatribe, which features scathing parodies of John
Adams in particular and other trendy Americans wholesale, has its own
musical sense and weight too, as the ML/P team made clear. We were hearing
the new 'chamber' version of Hidden Variables, most obviously in its reduced
strings. Aptly tacky, I thought: the budget forces focused the
implausibility of what Adams gets away with on Hollywood-scale strings.
*****
In the Barbican Hall meanwhile, Itzhak Perlman and the London Symphony
Orchestra under Andre Previn were purveying an older, milder brand of
American music: Samuel Barber's Violin Concerto of 1940. This expert piece
of musical craftsmanship, with its curvaceous
Richard-Strauss-goes-to-New-England first movement, gently moody middle and
dashing finale, is today more liable to elicit under-praise than encourage
over-estimation.
It offers no challenge to the listener, no adventure, no threat of uncharted
emotional experience; but within their self-ordained limits its musicianly
qualities remain effortlessly graceful and delightfully fresh. Perhaps a
grander style of musical address, a riper rhetorical character was intended
by Barber than Perlman essayed in the solo-writing, or than Previn charged
from the orchestral accompaniment; but for shining sweetness and purity of
style this violinist has no equals today.
This was altogether a fine, civilised performance, and after the interval
Previn and the LSO matched it with an Elgar Second Symphony of easy flow and
sustainment of symphonic argument. Again, certain Elgarians in the audience
might have found their cravings for passionate engagement with the score's
melodic shapes unsatisfied (from Elgar's own recording of the work with the
LSO we know how high a value he set on full-bodied portamento
string-phrasing). But in its truthful, uninflated authority, Previn's
command of the symphony is now solidly impressive from first note to last.

Not so long ago motor racing was widely seen as a noisy and dangerous
pastime (scarcely a sport) for the sort of overgrown boy who went 'vroom,
vroom' under his breath when a car with a broken silencer went down the
road. Now it is part of the global hype which sells everything from cameras
to condoms. The Team (BBC2, 9.30) is a seven-part series about McLaren and
their efforts to recapture the Formula One World Championship.
In last week's news quiz, Have I Got News For You (BBC2, 10.00), Paul
Merton, the quickest and most dead-pan of the contestants, ridiculed
question master Angus Deayton for the complexity of his carefully prepared
'funny' answers. He has a point. Deayton is becoming more verbose and less
funny as his contributions expand. Time to forego the autocue and push
Deayton back on his own resources.
It is hard to know when the daily 'documentary soap' Sarajevo - A Street
Under Siege will be on air since it lasts only two minutes and is tacked on
the end of programmes, but you should catch it on BBC2 at 10.25.

A world music festival celebrating the capital's abundance of traditional
music is to be held on November 20-21 at the Museum of London. A part of the
museum's new exhibition, The Peopling of London, it includes music from
Irish, Jewish and Somali groups.
On the Saturday Taxi Pata Pata present jazz from Zaire in an evening
concert. On Sunday afternoon, broadcaster Andy Kershaw presents traditional
London music which includes Dishari, an East End ensemble playing Bengali
folk music and Royte Klezmores, an all woman East European trio playing
wedding music. Entry on Sunday is free.
The main exhibition, which runs until May 15 1994, looks at London's current
ethnic and cultural diversity in the historical perspective of 15,000 years
of settlement from overseas.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Technology: Concepts for a fertile market - Many drug
companies have stopped developing contraceptives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Contraceptives have become a Cinderella subject for pharmaceutical research.
No fundamentally new techniques have been developed since the 'pill' 30
years ago, and even the long-term contraceptives recently introduced in the
US and some European countries - Depo-Provera injections and Norplant
implants - originated in the 1960s.
At last month's Population Summit, held in India by the world's scientific
academies, Kerstin Hagenfeldt of Stockholm's Karolinska Hospital estimated
that global funding of contraceptive R&amp;D amounts to just Dollars 57m (Pounds
41m) a year, of which governments and non-profit organisations provide 61
per cent and pharmaceutical companies 39 per cent. This is little more than
2 per cent of worldwide contraceptive sales (worth between Dollars 2.6bn and
Dollars 2.9bn a year).
'Many large pharmaceutical firms that in the 1960s and 1970s played an
active and essential role in developing contraceptive products have stopped
their activities in this area in the last decade,' Hagenfeldt said.
The world contraceptive market is currently dominated by four companies:
Johnson &amp; Johnson and American Home Products of the US, Schering of Germany
and Akzo of the Netherlands.
Reasons put forward for the industry's diminishing research activity include
more stringent regulatory requirements than for any other type of drug, a
risk of expensive product liability lawsuits of the sort that drove the
Dalkon Shield manufacturer A H Robins to bankruptcy in 1986, and opposition
to contraception by the Roman Catholic church and other religious groups.
'Contraceptive development is difficult in the sense that you're dealing
with products that may be used by perfectly healthy people over many years.
They therefore have to be extremely safe and effective,' says Hans Vemer,
international medical director of Organon, Akzo's pharmaceutical subsidiary.
The basic principle of hormonal contraception is to use synthetic sex
hormones (oestrogens and/or progestogens) to suppress ovulation. The
hormones also thicken the cervical mucus, making it more difficult for sperm
to enter the uterus, and thin the endometrium (lining of the womb) so that a
fertilised egg is unlikely to implant and grow.
Although today's contraceptive pills work in fundamentally the same way as
their forerunners 30 years ago, they contain a different balance of hormones
in lower doses. The standard 'combined pill' now has only 30 micrograms of
oestrogen, compared with 150 micrograms in the 1960s. There is also a range
of 'multi-phasic pills' in which the doses change during the month.
Long-term clinical studies sponsored by the World Health Organisation show
that the pill is safe, despite the health scares of the 1980s - so safe
indeed there are moves in the US to permit the dispensing of oral
contraceptives without a prescription. The pill may slightly increase the
risk of developing breast cancer and heart disease, but it has a protective
effect against some cancers of the reproductive system. Long-term use
reduces the chance of developing ovarian cancer by 40 per cent.
Oral contraceptives are highly effective at preventing pregnancy when taken
regularly but they are liable to fail through forgetfulness or gastric
upsets. Therefore, researchers have been working since the pill's
introduction on more reliable ways of administering contraceptive hormones.
The two injectable contraceptives in worldwide use today, Depo-Provera and
Noristerat, were invented in the 1960s. They are prescribed extensively in
some developing countries, but health concerns and political controversy
have kept them off the market in several industrialised countries. The US
finally approved Depo-Provera last year after its manufacturer, Upjohn, won
a 25-year battle to convince the Food and Drug Administration it was safe.
Depo-Provera contains tiny crystals of progestogen suspended in a
water-based solution which is injected every three months into the muscle of
the buttocks or arm. The hormone leaches slowly into the bloodstream from
the crystals. Its failure rate - about two pregnancies per 1,000 women per
year - is considerably lower than the pill.
More recently, WHO has sponsored the development of two monthly injectable
contraceptives, Mesigyna and Cyclofem, which contain a combined low dose of
oestrogen and progestogen. They avoid the main side-effect of Depo-Provera -
irregular menstruation. Both are being manufactured locally in several
developing countries.
Norplant, an implant to prevent pregnancy for up to five years, was designed
in the 1960s by the Population Council, a charity based in New York, and
developed during the 1970s by Leiras, a contraceptive manufacturer in
Finland. They are licensing it for sale by various international drug
companies. It was launched in the US two years ago by American Home Products
and in the UK last month by Roussel of France.
Norplant consists of six flexible rubber rods, each about the size of a
matchstick, which are inserted (under local anaesthetic) beneath the skin of
the upper arm. They release progestogen at a steady rate into the
bloodstream. If the woman wants to conceive, the capsules are removed.
According to Hemant Shah, a US pharmaceutical analyst, Norplant sales shot
up from Dollars 50m in 1991 to Dollars 140m in 1992, but are likely to fall
to about Dollars 110m in 1993. The decline is not a sign of disenchantment
but a result of Norplant's long-term action; the women most enthusiastic
about the implant had it fitted last year. However, some state authorities
have aroused controversy by allegedly putting unfair pressure on teenagers
from deprived and minority backgrounds to accept Norplant.
Several second-generation implants are in clinical trials and are expected
to reach the market before the end of the century. One is Norplant II, which
has two rods rather than six. Another is Implanon, a single rod system
developed by Organon, which provides two to three years of reliable
contraception; it is injected under the skin with a hypodermic syringe.
Vaginal rings are a third type of long-acting contraceptive undergoing
clinical trials. They release hormones slowly through the skin of the
vagina. Candidate rings have been developed by Organon, the Population
Council and WHO. Unlike implants and injections, they can be inserted or
removed by the user without professional help.
Another technique, pioneered by Leiras, is to combine hormonal contraception
with the intra-uterine device. Its Levonova IUD, recently approved for sale
in three Scandinavian countries, releases very low doses of progestogen
directly into the uterus for up to five years.
All today's contraceptive drugs - as opposed to barrier methods such as
condoms which are not covered in this article - are based on hormones. An
entirely different approach is to produce a birth control vaccine, by
inducing the immune system to immobilise either sperm or eggs or one of the
hormones that are essential for human reproduction.
Six contraceptive vaccines with various mechanisms of action are in the
early stages of clinical trials, although the safety and efficacy
requirements are so stringent that none will be available commercially until
the next century.
The immunological approach could produce a safe male contraceptive - and
satisfy complaints that all products so far, apart from the condom, have
been aimed at women.
'Since a man produces millions of spermatozoa at a time, it is far more
difficult to develop an adequate oral or hypodermic contraceptive for men,'
says Willem Bergink, director of Organon's fertility research programme.
'But we know some women are infertile because they produce antibodies
against sperm.' The solution may be to make men produce antibodies against
their own sperm.
The series continues next month with an article on obesity.

the following areas:

Diabetes      17 September

When many burglar alarms ring it is just as likely to be the local cat as a
felon that sets them off. However, the latest camera-on-a-microchip could
help the owners of the premises to verify the presence of the thief before
the police are called.
Once the alarm sounds the mini camera transmits video images of the break-in
(or false alarm) down a telephone line to a control centre. The TVX camera,
developed by Edinburgh University and TVX International, of Hemel Hempstead,
costs a quarter of the price of traditional video surveillance systems and
can be added to existing alarm systems.

With manufacturers gearing up to phase out ozone-depleting cleaning fluids
in 1994, a number of products and processes are appearing to replace
materials which contain chlorofluorocarbons.
In Faulbach, Germany, Grasmann WLS has developed a dry process for cleaning
printed circuit boards in electronics manufacture.
The process involves putting the boards in a plasma chamber where a
high-frequency generator breaks down the normal bond between the electrons
and the atomic nuclei in the offending particles, burning them off the
surface. The Grasmann machines are distributed in the UK by Parkheath of

An increasing number of European consumers are using herbal and homeopathic
remedies rather than conventional drugs, according to the latest report from
management consultants Datamonitor.
Belgians have the highest consumption rate, spending an average of Dollars 8
(Pounds 6) annually per head on homeopathic remedies. But consumption is
growing most quickly in the UK - by more than 15 per cent between 1987 and
1992 - with Nelson and Weleda the market leaders.
The biggest single market in Europe is in Germany, where consumers bought

FT  12 NOV 93 / Management: Advice one can take to heart - A look at a new
guide to executive health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROL COOPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEOPLE with demanding occupations rarely spare a thought for health when
things are going well. Life is busy, health is largely a matter of luck and,
besides, isn't everything bad for you these days? Faced with confusion and
tight schedules, it is little wonder executives are apt to throw their hands
up in self-defeat, go for another three-course lunch and carry on exactly as
before.
The dietary fat theory - that lowering cholesterol levels is associated with
an excess of violent deaths - received a sizeable knock when it was mooted a
few years ago
There are various reasons why results of such studies could be a statistical
quirk. Nonetheless, they gave some people the idea that most health
interventions were in vain, since whatever might be gained on the swings
would be promptly lost on the roundabouts.
This is not so and precise authoritative advice is needed. The 12-Week
Executive Health Plan* by David Ashton concentrates on the prevention of
coronary heart disease and some of the common cancers and gets down to
specifics.
Its approach involves a numerical self-appraisal of health risk, which
executives will find more compelling than vague unquantified exhortations to
lose weight, eat better and take more exercise.
As a cardiologist, Ashton has worked for more than five years with this type
of health risk appraisal (HRA), which incorporates blood pressure, smoking,
drinking, diet, stress and exercise (or lack of it).
Companies which provide medicals are already asking similar questions, so
some staff may be familiar with the concept. However, they are not always
motivated to heed the warnings they receive from employers.
Cholesterol is one of the variables taken into account in the calculation,
since it is an independent risk factor, as was realised about 30 years ago.
Recent studies show that lowering cholesterol can improve blood flow in the
coronary arteries, at least in men. Data on coronary artery disease in women
are scanty, though there is no reason to think that the effects should be
different.
As this book explains, however, it is naive to believe that a raised
cholesterol level is in itself a cause of heart disease. Cholesterol exists
in two forms: LDL which is harmful and HDL which is beneficial. It is a
little-known fact that some cholesterol is essential to life.
There is also a popular misconception about the role of diet. It is
saturated fat rather than cholesterol which raises blood cholesterol, hence
a cholesterol-lowering diet is not the same as a low-cholesterol diet.
It will not always be easy to have business lunches and eat healthily, but
it is feasible to follow most of the advice in the book; despite its title,
this is not a detailed scheme of how to spend the next 12 weeks down to the
last Ryvita, but an explanation of scientific principles which are not,
alas, always obvious from what is reported in the press.
There are plenty of data aimed at intelligent readers who ask questions and
want to be able to act on the answers. The HRA score should change for the
better within a mere 12 weeks of doing the right things. As Ashton puts it:
'You can train for a marathon in 12 weeks.'
The best news of all is that you do not have to. Exercising seven times a
week is not significantly better for the heart than a brisk walk three or
four times a week.
Within the pages of this book, there are more snippets of good news besides.
For example, anti-oxidants, the naturally occuring substances, may help
prevent cancer and heart disease and the fact that giving up smoking
produces benefits for the heart within hours of stopping. To some extent one
can, after all, make one's own luck.
The author is a London general practitioner.

FT  12 NOV 93 / People: New package at Portals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Roy Gardener, the seasoned Portals manager responsible for revamping JR
Crompton, the teabag papermaker acquired from the Bunzl group in 1990, is
stepping aside from the start of January, thus
triggering a management reshuffle.
Gardener, 54, who has spent the past four years as Crompton's managing
director and has overseen a substantial improvement in productivity and
profits, is to undertake a number of special assignments within Portals'
core security and specialist papermaking division.
He will also continue as a member of Portal's papermaking divisional board
and as a Crompton director, but will be succeeded as Crompton managing
director by Nick Acland, 33.
Acland, who has an MBA from Insead, is moving over from Portals (Bathford),
which makes watermarked high security paper for non-currency security
documents including the new DSS high security covers for pension and other
allowance books. Acland has been managing director there for the past four
years.
Keith Brown, 37, will become managing director of Portals (Bathford) which
is a world leader in its market. He will bring to the company broad
strategic skills and papermaking experience, which includes the integration
phase and subsequent growth at Crompton where he has been a director for
three years.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Management: Microsoft's loud mouse - Bill Gates' number two
talks to Alan Cane and Tim Dickson about the future of the computer industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE and TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To comprehend the computer industry, it was once essential to understand
International Business Machines, hardware manufacturer par excellence and
industry leader for three decades.
Today, with IBM fighting red ink and loss of market share, the model is
Microsoft, the aggressive young pretender to IBM's crown. Creator of MS/Dos
and Windows, the operating systems which control more than 90 per cent of
the world's personal computers, the company has begun to influence others in
a way reminiscent of its older rival.
Microsoft, however, is living in a changed world and the management and
strategic challenges are correspondingly different. While IBM wanted total
control of its customer, Microsoft is increasingly focusing on what it
believes it does best, designing and producing quality software. As Steve
Ballmer, responsible for the company's sales and marketing activities,
points out: 'We cannot do everything. As a result, to reach large businesses
we will have to forge relationships with new business partners - not just
the distributors we have always dealt with, but companies developing
specific software solutions to their customers' problems.'
Microsoft's management philosophy, explains Ballmer, is 'ultimately
conservative'. Much of this is rooted in the personality of Bill Gates,
Microsoft's 38-year-old co-founder, chairman and chief executive, whose
parsimony and competitiveness are equally notorious. But Ballmer, a
37-year-old college friend of Gates and effectively Microsoft's joint number
two, is clearly a thoughtful and assertive influence.
'When I started (in 1980), Microsoft had 30 people. When I had been there
two months, I told Bill I thought we ought to hire 17 more people. He said:
'I think we are going to go bankrupt if I keep you here. I'm not sure this
is going to work out'.'
Ballmer stayed and Microsoft did not go bankrupt. The success of its
operating systems on IBM-style PCs, its computer languages and applications
programs turned it into the world's most successful packaged software
supplier. Last year it had sales of Dollars 3.7bn (Pounds 2.6bn), up 36 per
cent on the year before and net income of Dollars 953m.
The changing marketplace will test both its adaptability and technical
expertise. Microsoft has proved itself the king of the electronic desktop,
providing operating systems, word processors and spreadsheets for people
using stand-alone personal computers. But as large companies seek to link
their computers together and establish enterprise-wide information networks,
how will the company react?
Windows NT, Microsoft's latest operating system, is the company's
technological answer, but Microsoft, as Ballmer readily agrees, has less
experience of corporate data processing than, for example, IBM or Unisys.
Ballmer says Microsoft has more experience than many people realise, but
adds: 'I am not convinced that IBM or Unisys - where one company supplied
hardware, software and services - is the model for the 1990s. In our model
we focus on what we do best, which is to build software products. Others
build hardware, deliver services and design custom developments.
'We have to mobilise an infrastructure around our products or people will
not design them into their systems. We have to explain that model to our
corporate customers. We are not going to be a cradle-to-grave supplier. If
people want a company to integrate their hardware or write a custom
application, that company is not going to be us.'
Can Microsoft, however, continue to dominate the software business and avoid
'doing an IBM'?
As Ballmer tells it - his style is engagingly direct, the decibel count
unusually high - the company can hardly be accused of complacency. He
describes a culture which reflects a nervous, almost paranoid concern with
staying ahead. 'We are certainly paranoid enough about the potential to fail
that we are looking very hard for the potholes in the road.'
Having Gates around evidently helps. 'Bill is good at saying: 'I don't care
how good things seem to most people. I see deep problems',' explains
Ballmer.
Conscious of the technological obsolescence pothole into which IBM stumbled,
Microsoft has one senior employee (Nathan Mirvald, vice-president of
advanced technology) constantly scanning the horizon for new business
threats.
Ballmer distinguishes three phases in the company's development. The first
was characterised by a focus on technology and on business ('before you hire
anyone or do anything, get a customer'), but there was little management
vision. 'Bill had all these envelopes with all the contracts written down
and everybody in the company and their salaries and he was doing these
calculations over and over to make sure there was enough of this to cover
that,' Ballmer recalls.
In the second phase, Jon Shirley of Tandy Corporation was hired to inject
some business sense into a technologically aggressive company which was
being strangled by tight purse strings. 'Jon helped us grow the management
structure that enabled us to do the investing that I wanted and that Paul
Allen, Microsoft's co-founder, wanted. It was what Bill wanted to do as well
but he did not have the confidence.'
Shirley has since retired, although he keeps in close contact with the
company. A replacement did not work out and the company established an
'office of the president' last year to support Gates. It comprised Ballmer
as head of sales, Mike Maples, head of the products group, and the late
Frank Gaudette, who had been chief financial officer.
The challenge now, Ballmer says, is how best to present a unified approach
to its customers, while allowing the separate divisions considerable
autonomy. 'We spend a lot of time pushing ourselves. How do we become a
global company? How do we measure the effectiveness of a sales operation
when we are working with partners? If there is a price war you don't want to
be the guy caught with higher overheads and processing costs than others
because you've been sloppy.'
Microsoft's success has made a lot of its employees potentially very rich
through share options and that has helped to maintain the youthful
aggression of the culture: 'Any senior executive at Microsoft can retire if
they want to. The nice thing about having people make money is that they
don't stick around unless they want to,' Ballmer says. 'They stick around
because they want to work hard and are excited about what we are doing. It
is a nice filtering process.'
He and Gates, he says, are good for at least another 10 years. 'We don't
work as hard as we used to, but we still work very hard and we love it.'

FT  12 NOV 93 / Management: Inward focus on total quality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The effect on bottom-line financial performance of total quality programmes
in the UK has been shown to be pretty mixed. Much recent academic research
has therefore been devoted to finding out why.
A survey of TQM in Scotland carried out by Durham University Business
School* has concluded that the focus of quality in companies is too often
inward looking. For example, while 70 per cent of the 650 organisations
which replied have marketing departments, less than a third use them to
develop, implement or assess the effects of their quality programmes.
'Quality without the person who experiences the product, the real customer,
is like a car without a driver - it just won't go', is how Barry Witcher of
the school's Centre for Quality and Organisational Change puts it.
Bradford University Management Centre, meanwhile, has come up with a
different angle by studying the annual reports of the top 100 European
companies and a randomly selected sample of 100 UK businesses.**
It found that very few provide relevant information about their mission
statements, TQM approach, future intentions or true business performance.
Among those to be commended are Cadbury Schweppes, NFC, RTZ, Thorn EMI,
Forte and WH Smith.
The report recommends that companies 'stop believing in the myth that TQM is
only a technique of relevance to the business units and with no corporate
value to it'. Business unit performance will improve with 'visible support
and commitment from the holding or parent company', while better head office

FT  12 NOV 93 / People: Caradon seeks finance director in wake of Pillar
acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Caradon, the building materials group, has moved quickly to reorganise its
management structure following its acquisition of the Pillar group of
businesses from RTZ. The purchase, for Pounds 800m, was announced in August
and completed late last month.
As a result of the changes, the group is looking for a new finance director
who will become the fifth executive director on the board. Peter Jansen,
chief executive, said the group had already started the search.
Caradon had found good operational management in the Pillar businesses, he
says. However, most of Pillar's head office people will stay with RTZ.
Jansen said under the new structure the group's larger businesses would
report directly to one of three main board directors to keep communication
lines short, while smaller companies will be clustered. The three areas will
each have an executive committee chaired by the director in charge.
Daniel Cohen, currently finance director and managing director of bathrooms
and some building products, will be in charge of all the group's European
building products businesses. He will give up the finance function when a
new person is appointed.
Peter Hewett will pass his responsibility for heating products and double
glazing to Cohen, but take charge of all the engineering, automotive and
distribution activities.
Tim Walker, who currently runs the group's US security printing business,
will be responsible for all the group's north American activities.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Lottery licence to run for only 7 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Lottery licence is to run for less than seven years, Mr Peter
Davis, director-general of the National Lottery, said yesterday.
The main licence for the lottery, designed to raise hundreds of millions of
pounds for charity, the arts, sport, heritage and celebrating the
millennium, will expire on March 31 2001.
The successful applicant will not be chosen until March or April next year
and would be unlikely to be up and running before the late autumn, so the
operation will run for no more than 6 1/2 years.
Mr Tim Holly, chief executive of Camelot, one of the declared bidders for
the licence, said yesterday: 'I am marginally disappointed. I would have
preferred it a bit longer. I thought we would get between seven and 10
years.'
Mr Davis made it clear yesterday that there would be a 'very strong
presumption' that there would be another competitive tender when the first
licence ran out.
Lottery operators will have to recoup the cost of an investment likely to
exceed Pounds 200m to set up the national system.
The Great British Lottery Company, a consortium that includes Granada, said
yesterday it accepted the length of the licence.
Mr Davis is insisting that the lottery must be 'tasteful' and avoid games
and advertising likely to lead to addiction. 'What we want is an absolutely
clean, respectable, stable image,' he said.
Mr Davis said his office would investigate the background of all those
applying to run the lottery and would call on information from a wide range
of government departments.
'I will have access to a very wide range of information, but I am not going
to be specific because one could get into sensitive areas,' said Mr Davis.
'We must not have the wrong people running this lottery.'
Mr Davis is insisting that the contents of all bids remain confidential.
The draft invitation to apply and draft licence make it clear that
applicants will have to provide plans for national coverage and a launch
date. The lottery will have to be available in every local authority area
six months after the national launch.
Applicants will be expected to show a decreasing percentage of turnover
spent on administration as turnover increases and return a proportion of
proceeds from television rights and other merchandising to good causes.
Mr Davis also made clear that there would be reserve standards - a maximum
percentage the licensee may retain and a minimum percentage to be paid to
the government for the good causes.
Applicants will have to specify fixed minimum payments to be paid to the
government in each year of the licence and provide a percentage for 'the
target prize total' for the winners.
Apart from Camelot - which includes Cadbury Schweppes and Racal Electronics
 -the Great British Lottery Company, and a consortium of N M Rothschilds and
Tattersalls of Australia, the contenders are likely to include Ladbrokes,
the Rank Organisation, the Tote with partners, and possibly Mr Richard
Branson offering a non-profitmaking option.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Property: Frankfurt in favour - The EMI decision is a boost
for the city
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent decision to locate the European Monetary Institute - forerunner
of the European Central Bank - in Frankfurt is a small victory for the
city's parlous commercial property market. But the greater battle still lies
ahead: how to revive the country's depressed property sector.
The EMI will employ about 250 people and occupy 5,000 square metres of
office space, a fraction of the average 220,000 sq m leased in Frankfurt in
each of the past five years.
Yet, as Mr Robert Orr of surveyors Jones Lang Wootton in Frankfurt says, the
EMI decision should inspire confidence at a time when the market is in the
doldrums and the wider economy endures its worst recession in 50 years.
'The decision confirms Frankfurt's position in the financial world,' he
said. 'Investors will be comforted by the knowledge that its future is
secure. It will not lead to a rapid pick-up in the commercial property
market but it will bring to an end the slide in values we have seen over the
past 18 months.'
Rents for prime properties in central Frankfurt have dropped by 21 per cent
over the past 18 months, from DM95 a sq m to DM75 a sq m. The amount of
commercial space likely to be leased this year will be about 200,000 sq m,
less than the past five-year average but down from the 250,000 sq m leased
last year and the record 320,000 sq m in 1991.
Other commercial centres in Germany's strongly regionalised economy have
suffered similar declines; the sharpest falls have been in Berlin and
Leipzig, where rents shot up on the back of speculative trading in the
aftermath of German reunification in 1990, before dropping back steeply.
In cities such as Dusseldorf, Munich and Stuttgart, rents have also fallen
but not so sharply. These cities will, for the immediate future, continue to
suffer from the combined effects of regional economic weakness and a surplus
of supply, as new buildings, commissioned before the downturn, come onto the
market.
The decision to base the EMI in Frankfurt, the most international of
Germany's business centres, will accelerate the tendency for foreign banks
and other financial institutions to raise their profile in the Finanzplatz.
At the same time, financial houses without a foothold in Frankfurt are
likely to seek one.
This process is already under way: Reuter recently ann-ounced its decision
to take three floors of the Messeturm, while JP Morgan is to take 8,000 sq m
in the former Finanzamt building in the centre of Frankfurt owned by Mr
Dieter Bock, the entrepreneur best known in the UK as a big shareholder in
Lonrho, the international trading group. The securities house SG Warburg,
Moody's, the credit rating agency, and AT Kearney, a US consultancy, have
between them taken the bulk of the former Chase Manhattan building at
Taunusanlage 11.
Domestic groups have also played their part in absorbing some of the
commercial property surplus in Frankfurt. Dresdner Bank has taken the whole
of the 15,000 sq m Furstenhof development; Deutsche Bank recently celebrated
the opening of its third skyscraper in the city, the 60,000 sq m Trianon,
one third of which it will be using for its own purposes while the rest is
to be let to BfG Bank and others.
These lettings have removed some of the 350,000 sq m of complete and vacant
property in Frankfurt city centre and its suburbs. In spite of this Mr Orr
of Jones Lang Wootton still believes the vacancy rate in Frankfurt is likely
to rise from 5 per cent at present to 6 per cent next year. This is low by
international standards - London's West End has a vacancy rate of 9 per cent
while the City suffers from a rate of 16-17 per cent - but is high in
comparison with Frankfurt's historical average of 2-3 per cent.
While this oversupply will continue to dampen the market's prospects in the
short term, there are two factors which are working in favour of property
markets in Frankfurt and in Germany's other leading commercial centres.
First, interest rates. Following the latest of the Bundesbank's interest
rate cuts, long-term rates are now at historical lows. A good quality
borrower could obtain five-year fixed financing at an effective rate of
6.5-7.5 per cent. This compares with a peak of 9.5-10 per cent in 1991 and
means that for the first time since the middle of the 1980s the yield on
certain types of commercial property investments - particularly office
developments in the suburbs of Frankfurt - exceeds the financing costs.
While property yields on prime properties in the centre of Frankfurt remain
at 5-5.5 per cent, an investor can expect yields of 6.75-7.5 per cent on
suburban property, guaranteeing a positive cash flow on investment from the
outset.
Second, is the phenomenon of the German 'open-ended' property funds - an
investment vehicle popular with private investors. The 14 open-ended funds
that exist have provoked huge investor interest. In the first 10 months of
this year investors poured DM11.5bn (Pounds 4.6bn) into the funds, up from
DM6bn last year and DM2bn in 1991. Total assets have doubled to DM39bn in
the past three years.
The reason behind the popularity of open-ended funds, at a time when
investors could have made more money in rising equity and fixed-interest
markets, is perplexing market analysts: one suggestion is that the
volatility of the securities markets has frightened Germany's more
conservative investors into the stable world of property.
The open-ended funds are legally obliged to invest in property: this alone
is likely to provide support for the market. As Mr Michael von Zitzewitz of
CGI, the Commerzbank property fund, explained to investors last week, the
funds have invested nearly DM2bn in six months to July. The 'pressure (on
open-ended funds) to invest' proved difficult to resist, he said, given
sharply improved yields.
The 'pressure to invest' is also making itself felt elsewhere. DGI, Deutsche
Bank's property-fund, this month concluded the biggest property acquisition
in the City of London in two years with the purchase of a long leasehold on
One Exchange Square.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Chinese trainee airline pilots arrive in Oxford
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN MICHAELS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST GROUP of Chinese trainee airline pilots to go abroad has arrived
at the Oxford Air Training School, Adrian Michaels writes.
This follows September's announcement that the Chinese Civil Aviation
Authority had awarded its first overseas civilian cadet training contract to
the school.
The pilots, all of whom are on their first trip outside China, will be put
on a 56-week course costing Pounds 55,000 each which will qualify them for a
full British commercial pilot's licence and instrument rating.
They are then due to return to China for further training.
The school sees their arrival as an acknowledgement by China that it has a
fast-growing civil aviation sector but is short of pilots and lacks access
to the latest technology.
The school said: 'Their English is excellent and so far they have taken to
the change in circumstances very well.'
The trainees will spend their first four weeks in the classroom at the
school, which said it had trained 10,000 from 40 countries since it was
founded in 1962.
They will be living in Oxford with a group of nearly 200 other trainees from
18 countries.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Budget 1993: Clarke faces some hard lobbying at Harrogate -
Howard Davies believes there is still time to influence the chancellor when
he attends the CBI conference next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IT IS never too late to influence a chancellor. The decision to knock 1p
off the standard rate of income tax in the 1986 budget was only taken the
weekend before,' recalls Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the
Confederation of British Industry.
Mr Davies, a Treasury adviser when the former Mr Nigel Lawson was
chancellor, is trying to influence the Budget on behalf of a CBI membership
employing more than half the nation's workforce.
The CBI offered what it regarded as a modest shopping list to Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the present chancellor, in September. Its members will have a final
chance for some hard lobbying when Mr Clarke goes to Harrogate next week to
address the organisation's annual conference, two weeks before his Budget
statement to the Commons.
'It will not be too late for Mr Clarke to consider interest rates, to adjust
his overall tax judgment or to change his views on issues like investment
incentives. We could yet make a difference,' Mr Davies adds.
CBI conferences have long been criticised as cosy, self-congratulatory
affairs more intent on promoting the commercial interests of delegates than
stirring the national policy debate.
But the CBI chief hopes changes in the format of this year's meeting will
make it more valuable. Debates will centre on CBI position papers and at the
end of the three-day meeting Mr Davies will summarise conference opinions
and present a statement setting out CBI priorities for the year ahead.
A succession of high-profile speakers will listen to and respond to debates.
Several ministers and M Jacques Delors, president of the EC Commission, will
be there and Mr John Smith will be the first Labour leader to address a CBI
conference.
The CBI wants to see investment incentives as the main Budget theme, as
investment in manufacturing has continued to be poor. The organisation was
once sceptical about the value of investment allowances but now believes the
temporary boost given to them in the last autumn statement has helped
stimulate business investment. Even so, it remains at its lowest level for
34 years as a proportion of gross domestic product.
The CBI believes removal of allowances now would be damaging and wants help
tilted further towards smaller businesses, which can do most to help create
jobs. The Treasury remains unconvinced.
Mr Davies said: 'There must be no significant tax increases beyond those
announced by Mr Norman Lamont. We might not have chosen VAT on domestic fuel
but the present chancellor has to get it through. There is a real danger
that if he fails, confidence in his ability to deliver on anything will be
seriously undermined. It could have a damaging impact on the gilt and
foreign exchange markets.'
Also on the list is the CBI's wish, given the demise of the business
expansion scheme, to see the establishment of a 'business angel' financing
system designed to unlock available wealth by offering tax incentives,
preferably involving capital gains rather than income tax.
The CBI wants to see another 1 percentage point reduction in interest rates
by the end of the year, but Mr Davies does not expect any announcement to
form part of the Budget package.
The CBI is demanding that the government should set out clearer policies on
which to base a successful partnership with industry and hopes the Budget
will show the message is getting across.
Mr Davies added: 'If the spending programme, for example, demonstrates that
ministers are ready to see the pain taken other than in areas like training
and transport infrastructure, we will be able to detect a more strategic
approach.'
No one at Harrogate will expect Mr Clarke to give much away on the day.
Neither will they expect his Budget to have them applauding.
Mr Davies said: 'If he does nothing for small businesses or investment and
raises taxes further, he can expect a great big raspberry.'

FT  12 NOV 93 / Rule clash may force tendering change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CLASH between two European directives could force a revision of government
policy on compulsory competitive tendering by councils.
Many authorities now advertise contracts on the basis that Transfer of
Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations of 1981, known as Tupe,
will apply. In effect these require any bidder to maintain the same
workforce on the same wages and conditions of service.
The European Commission believes, however, that this might clash with the
procurement directive, which forbids authorities from forcing bidders to use
local labour forces.
According to today's Local Government Chronicle the commission raised the
issue after it saw an advertisement in the Official Journal of the European
Communities tendering Croydon borough council's financial services work.
The advertisement stated that the council's existing staff must be
transferred to the bidder. Croydon confirmed that the commission had queried
the advertisement.
Mr Cliff Davis-Coleman, of Clause 26, a lobby group for contractors, said
the commission's stance could sweep away the serious obstacle Tupe poses to
private contractors. He said: 'If the commission insists that this is indeed
a local labour clause then the environment department will have to amend its
advice for the Next Steps initiative and for compulsory competitive
tendering.'
Separately, Britain's biggest local authority is facing a claim that it
awarded contracts worth Pounds 22m uncompetitively.
Strathclyde Regional Council, centred on Glasgow, told potential bidders for
its cleaning contracts that Tupe applied. The contracts were won by the
in-house teams.
But the Business Services Association, another lobby group of contractors,
branded the policy anti-competitive in a letter to Mr Allan Stewart, the
Scottish office minister.

THE anti-federalists who laid treason charges against Mr Douglas Hurd, the

treaty have vowed to fight on, in spite of a Crown Prosecution Service
ruling against further action.
Mr Rodney Atkinson, a business executive and brother of the comedian Rowan

Association, had written to the CPS challenging its interpretation of the
law.
If this does not force a rethink, said Mr Atkinson, he and Mr McWhirter

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN BROWN Engineering yesterday announced contracts totalling Pounds 150m
for power station equipment in Oman and Britain, James Buxton writes.
The Trafalgar House subsidiary is to extend and modify a power station and
water distilling plant at Ghubrah in Oman by adding a 250MW gas turbine
generation plant.
The company, which is based at Clydebank near Glasgow, said it won the
contract against strong international competition because it was able to
complete the order before the heavy summer demand for electricity in 1995.
The Omani order accounts for about two-thirds of the Pounds 150m total.
John Brown also won an order for the design and full turnkey construction of
a combined heat and power plant for Grovehurst Energy, a company jointly
owned by UK Paper and St Regis Paper, for the supply of power to three paper
mills in Kent.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Sinn Fein leader is barred from US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has barred the latest attempt by Mr Gerry Adams, the
Sinn Fein leader, to enter the US. The exclusion was made because of Mr
Adams' alleged involvement with the IRA.
The White House yesterday confirmed the decision had been taken even though
Mr Adams' declared reason for his trip was to explain his peace initiative
with Mr John Hume, the leader of Northern Ireland's Social Democratic and
Labour Party.
In a letter to New York's departing Democrat mayor Mr David Dinkins, which
was published in yesterday's Irish Times, Mr Clinton said: 'Credible
evidence exists that Adams remains involved at the highest level devising
IRA strategy. . . (he) has still not publicly renounced terrorism.'
A US official said Mr Clinton had pledged during his election campaign to
consider granting Mr Adams a visa. He added: 'We did consider it, and we
decided against it.'
Mr Dinkins' office said it believed a visit by Mr Adams would help the peace
process.
Mr Adams yesterday said the remarks by Mr Clinton were 'black propaganda'
based on 'lies concocted by the British'.
He insisted he had no involvement in terrorism and added: 'This type of
unfounded allegation is used by the British government as a cover for its
real intention, which is to prevent any informed debate about its
involvement in Irish affairs.'

FT  12 NOV 93 / Carey warns on Church finances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHURCH of England faces 'serious but not disastrous' financial problems
as a result of an alarming decline in its assets, Dr George Carey,
Archbishop of Canterbury, told its General Synod yesterday.
'We have been living beyond our means for many years,' the archbishop told a
debate on a report into the conduct of the Church commissioners, who are
responsible for the Church's investments. He said action had to be taken to
ensure that the problems did not become unmanageable.
The total value of the commissioners' income-producing assets declined from
nearly Pounds 3bn in 1989 to Pounds 2.16bn last year, largely due to falls
in the property market. In August a report from the accountants Coopers &amp;
Lybrand commissioned by Dr Carey criticised the commissioners' heavy
speculation in property.
The Rt Rev John Wayne, Bishop of Chelmsford, who chaired the Lambeth Group -
a committee set up to consider the report - told the Synod he did not seek
to 'minimise the seriousness of the situation or to make light of the errors
of judgment, or the instances of organisational weakness' which
investigations had revealed. The Church commissioners, he said, saw
yesterday's debate as an occasion for them to offer a public apology for
what had happened.
There had, said the bishop, been three principal problems:
The commissioners increased an already large exposure to property, and
compounded the problem by borrowing to finance speculative property
investments.
Their assets committee failed to receive regular and accurate reports from
executive management.
The commissioners took on commitments to finance clergy benefits in excess
of their financial capacity.
As a result of the fall in investment income parishes will have to meet more
of their costs - a 15 per cent rise in local financial support is being
sought - and the Church is examining ways of simplifying its organisational
structure.
Canon John Stanley, a member of the Lambeth Group, said he found it
difficult to believe that Pounds 380m had been borrowed without reference to
the commissioners' board of governors.
The General Synod also attacked the government's policy of pit closures
yesterday. The Bishop of Sheffield, the Rt Rev David Lunn, said: 'It seems
to me quite amazing that ruthless treatment of the environment and
communities can take place without proper consultation. This is an act of
vandalism.'

FT  12 NOV 93 / Forest sell-offs plan attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIVATISATION of the Forestry Commission's properties, which is being
studied by the government, would produce a meagre sum for the Treasury and
lead to greater recurrent expenditure on forestry and reduced income for the
state.
This is the view of three former top executives of the Forestry Commission
who issued a public statement yesterday to say that privatisation is
'against the interests of the taxpayer, the private forest owner, the timber
industry, the conservation interest and the public who enjoy access to the
forest'.
Mr Gwyn Francis and Mr George Holmes, both former directors-general of the
commission, and Mr Toby Seal, a former chief research officer, say that the
commission's 1.1m hectares of forest might only raise Pounds 500m in a
'forced sale'. This contrasts with its 1992 book value of Pounds 1.7bn.
They say that if the forests were sold the government would have to hand out
more money in grants to the new owners for planting and restocking, as well
as providing more management grants and other items whose additional costs
in 2000 would total Pounds 44m.
Taking into account the annual loss of Pounds 20m in timber sales, the total
additional cost to the exchequer would be Pounds 64m. By 2010 this would
have risen to Pounds 83m because of increased planting and restocking, and
lost timber sales.
Ministers reviewing the future of the commission and the incentives for tree
planting are due to report next year.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Electric sector in a new light: A retailing probe revealed
big losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF IT achieved nothing else, yesterday's report from Professor Stephen
Littlechild, the electricity regulator, highlighted the huge size of the
electricity companies' losses on their high-street retailing operations - a
total of Pounds 105m over the last three years.
But what effect will it have on the intensely competitive electrical and
electronic goods market?
Neither the electricity regulator nor the Office of Fair Trading - which
also looked into Dixons' allegations - found any evidence to support its
claim that the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales had
engaged in unfair cross-subsidisation of their retail businesses, or in
anti-competitive practices.
Dixons had charged that regional electricity companies helped their
electrical goods retailers in a variety of ways, for example, by bearing
part of their advertising and marketing costs, providing cheap
accommodation, providing capital at no charge, and joint billing services.
This help enabled them to increase market share by 2 percentage points to
about 13 per cent, Dixons said.
Prof Littlechild points out that the losses the companies are making in this
business are at the expense of the shareholder, not the electricity
consumer, who is protected by the official price tariff. 'Whether it is
commercially sensible to incur such losses is a matter for shareholders,' he
says.
Most of Prof Littlechild's recommendations for clearer and more consistent
accounting treatment of retail-ing operations have already been adopted by
several companies.
There is little more that he can do. These are non-core businesses which lie
outside his direct control.
But if yesterday's reports do not raise wider issues, they could have an
impact by turning the spotlight on the companies' difficulties in the high
street.
This might hasten the retreat many are already beating from the retailing
market. For example, Prof Littlechild's report looks beyond the
profit-and-loss account to comment that the companies' returns on capital
employed have been, on average, negative and in all cases low by the
standards proposed by Dixons.
Only one company, Norweb, could be described as on a strongly expansionary
course in retailing. London Electricity and Swalec in south Wales have
pulled out of the business, while others have decided to join forces. For
example, Eastern, Southern and Midlands have formed E&amp;S Retail.
A small number are still operating on their own, for example Seeboard, which
has opted for building superstores. Mr John Weight, the director responsible
for retailing, stressed yesterday, however, that expansion was 'measured and
controlled'.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE 'BRAIN DRAIN' of qualified scientists and engineers from the UK is
slowing down, but migration is concentrated on the highest quality staff 'to
the detriment of the UK', the Royal Society says today.
Between 1984 and last year, 13.5 per cent of recently qualified British PhDs
chose to leave the country - almost identical to the size of the migration
between 1975 and 1985. There were small falls in the numbers of more senior
staff leaving.
European Union countries have gained in popularity compared with the US,
suggesting closer integration of UK and Continental research.
Immigration to UK research groups increased from 2.9 per cent to 4.0 per
cent. The Royal Society, which produced the report jointly with the Royal
Academy of Engineering, urged caution because academics leaving tended to be
of the highest quality. Those leaving did so for professional reasons to
take up long-term posts, while those arriving in the UK tended to be taking
short-term posts.
Returning British emigrants 'overwhelmingly' did so for personal rather than
professional reasons.
Chemistry has suffered the greatest increase in migration, with 16.2 per
cent of recently qualified chemists leaving the UK between 1984 and last
year, compared with 12 per cent between 1975 and 1985.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Watchdog fails to bite: Electrical goods retailing falls
outside his power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF IT achieved nothing else, yesterday's report from Professor Stephen
Littlechild, the electricity regulator, highlighted the huge size of the
electricity companies' losses on their high-street retailing operations - a
total of Pounds 105m over the last three years.
But will it do anything to shake up the intensely competitive electrical and
electronic goods market?
Neither the electricity regulator nor the Office of Fair Trading - which
also looked into Dixons' allegations - found any evidence to support its
claim that the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales had
engaged in unfair cross-subsidisation of their retail businesses, or in
anti-competitive practices.
Dixons had charged that regional electricity companies helped their
electrical goods retailers in a variety of ways, for example, by bearing
part of their advertising and marketing costs, providing cheap
accommodation, providing capital at no charge, and joint billing services.
This help enabled them to increase market share by 2 percentage points to
around 13 per cent, Dixons said.
Most of Prof Littlechild's recommendations for clearer and more consistent
accounting treatment of retailing operations have already been adopted by
several companies. And there is little more that he can do. These are
non-core businesses outside his direct control.
He can only ensure that these losses do not harm the regulated side of the
business, which delivers electricity to people's homes, and that the
companies comply with the law, for example by not using a householder's
bill-paying record to make decisions on advancing credit on purchases from
showrooms.
But if yesterday's reports do not raise wider issues, they could have an
impact by turning the spotlight on the companies difficulties in the high
street.
This might hasten the retreat many are already beating from the retailing
market. For example, Prof Littlechild's report looks beyond the
profit-and-loss account to comment that the companies' returns on capital
employed have been, on average, negative, and in all cases low by the
standards proposed by Dixons.
But he also points out that the losses the companies are making in this
business are at the expense of the shareholder, not the electricity
consumer, who is protected by the official price tariff. 'Whether it is
commercially sensible to incur such losses is a matter for shareholders,' he
says.
Only one company, Norweb, could be described as on a strongly expansionary
course in retailing. London Electricity and Swalec in south Wales, have
pulled out of the business, and others have decided to join forces rather
than continue on their own. For example, Eastern, Southern and Midlands have
formed E&amp;S Retail.
A small number are still operating on their own, for example Seeboard, which
has opted for building superstores.
However, Mr John Weight, the director responsible for retailing, stressed
yesterday that expansion was 'measured and controlled'.
Some companies have also indicated that they are only prepared to remain in
the business for a limited period because of the intensity of competition,
and the difficulty of getting costs down. Mr Nick Pink, an analyst who
follows the electricity companies at Warburg Securities, said yesterday:
'They've put the baby in the deep end to see if it can swim, and if it can't
they'll have to let it drown.'
Part of the difficulty the companies face in deciding what to do about
lossmaking retail activities is that shutting down such a labour-intensive
operation leads to a huge redundancy bill. When London Electricity sold out
earlier this year, it took a Pounds 20m charge to cover this expense.
Shareholders will also be able to make more informed judgments about the
retailing activities because more of them will be publishing detailed
results. This is not because of an agreement with the regulator, but because
more of the companies now have these operations in separate subsidiaries or
in jointly owned companies which produce their own sets of accounts.
The presence of the electricity distributors in the retail market is a
British phenomenon. French and German power companies, for example, do not
have a high-street presence.
But the UK regulatory framework gives electricity companies an incentive to
sell as much electricity as possible, and they therefore see appliance sales
as a useful way of boosting revenues.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Power companies cautious on VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S electricity companies have warned ministers that the imposition of
value added tax on domestic fuel bills will lead to a sharp rise in
disconnections. They are pressing for 'further' financial help for customers
with low incomes.
They have also advised the government that the VAT changes, due to be
implemented in April, will increase bills by more than the tax element
because of costs associated with a significant increase in bad debts.
The industry's concerns are expressed in a private letter to Mr Kenneth
Clarke, chancellor, and other ministers by the Electricity Association,
which represents the UK's 20 largest power companies.
The letter is an unusual foray into the political arena and reflects
industry fears that the consequences of VAT will be far more severe than
ministers acknowledge.
Electricity company anxieties have increased following speculation that the
chancellor will impose the full 17.5 per cent tax in April, rather than 8
per cent then and the rest the following year as previously announced.
The association's letter will add weight to the campaign by some Tory
backbenchers for the VAT plans be scrapped or for relief for less well-off
consumers to be increased.
In the letter, Mr Roger Young, the association president, warns that the
imposition of VAT will reverse the trend of falling prices and
disconnections set in motion by privatisation three years ago.
The letter says 'One possible complication will be refusal by some customers
to pay the specific VAT elements of their bills. After the normal
counselling process, this will lead to our member companies using their
powers to disconnect supply to obtain full payments from customers.'
Mr Young, chief executive of Scottish Hydro-Electric, says companies are
also concerned about additional account collection workload and costs 'which
will flow through to all our customers'.
Yorkshire Electricity estimates at Pounds 6m the cost of installing token
meters likely to be needed to help customers with difficulties paying
VAT-inflated bills, says Mr Young.
The company estimates that an additional 75,000 will experience
difficulties, around 80 per cent of whom will need a token meter at a cost
to the company of Pounds 100 each. 'Against this background the steps the
government takes to protect the position of customers on low incomes are of
key importance and we would urge you to provide further help to them in the
best way you can.'
If the estimates of Yorkshire, one of 15 regional distribution companies,
are typical and correct, more than 1m power consumers would experience
payment difficulties and the cost of metering would be more than Pounds 90m.
The letter says that since privatisation three years ago the number of
disconnections for non-payment of bills has fallen by 84 per cent. Domestic
electricity bills have fallen 4 per cent in real terms between 1985 and
1993.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Water group refuses to recognise union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH WEST WATER, one of the 10 privatised water services companies, has
refused to recognise Unison, Britain's biggest union created this year by
the merger of three public services unions.
The decision not to recog-nise Unison is the second in the water industry -
Wessex took similar action earlier this year.
The move affects nearly 800 of the company's 2,200 employees and is in part
a consequence of the unions' merger.
South West Water said the merger meant that Unison had moved more firmly
into the public sector and this was no longer appropriate for the company.
The company continues to recognise the TGWU and GMB general unions for craft
and industrial workers but proposed a new staff council for white-collar
workers.

NUM members have not had a pay increase for more than two years. Mr Arthur

a pay rise of 1.5 per cent from British Coal.
The ballot plan was agreed at a meeting of union delegates in Sheffield

THE European Commission yesterday acknowledged that the UK cannot introduce
tighter seatbelt laws for coaches and buses in the wake of Wednesday's coach
accident in Kent in which 10 people died, David Gardner writes.
Under European legislation a coach or bus can get a 'single passport' for
the whole of the European Union. The UK or any other member state can
introduce more stringent rules but only enforce them against operators and
manufacturers which seek approval at national rather than European level.
The commission has been trying to amend the legislation and has the support
of the UK, Germany, Ireland and Denmark, but has so far failed to secure a
qualified majority among the 12 member states.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Exchange head considers overhaul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY OF the London Stock Exchange's functions may be modified or abandoned
after Mr Michael Lawrence, the newly-named chief executive of the stock
exchange, takes up his duties next February.
'I don't see that there is anything that is fixed in stone. There are no
no-go areas,' Mr Lawrence, said yesterday.
Mr Lawrence, finance director at Prudential, the UK's largest life insurance
company, and a former partner at accountancy firm Price Waterhouse, who is
to review the exchange's activities once in place, said he had been
attracted to his new job because of the widespread view that the role of the
exchange needed to change.
He refused to offer a view about some of the most difficult issues facing
the exchange, such as whether it should own and operate its own settlement
system, such as the proposed Pounds 57m successor to its SEAQ price display
mechanism. 'I want to start with a white sheet,' he said.
The only criterion, he said, was that the exchange should remain the central
market in the UK for equity trading.
Mr Lawrence spelled out what he sees as the role for the new chairman who
will succeed Sir Andrew Hugh Smith next November. The new chairman - whose
identity is known to Mr Lawrence but not yet announced - will be a part-time
employee who will act largely as ambassador for the exchange in the City and
in foreign markets.
'I see a major role in recasting the vision for the exchange and carrying
that vision to the City at large,' he said. He and other exchange officials
would influence the development of that vision although his own duties would
focus on operational matters.
As finance director for a large company and chairman of the 100 Group of
Finance Directors Mr Lawrence is thought to be much closer to the interests
of the companies whose shares are traded on the exchange than his
predecessor, Mr Peter Rawlins. Also, he is thought likely to be more
sensitive to the interests of investors than the present senior management
of the exchange.
Mr Lawrence does not consider himself a City outsider but concedes that he

FT  12 NOV 93 / Minister defends truancy tables
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERFORMANCE tables of school truancy rates are essential to the government's
'back to basics' campaign, Baroness Blatch, the education minister, said
yesterday.
She said high truancy rates had contributed to the rising crime rate.
'Not every truant is a potential criminal. Some may be at home watching
television,' she said. 'But where teenagers or even very young children are
wandering the streets - as many do - they are all too vulnerable to criminal
or anti-social influences.'
She told a conference on truancy, organised by the University of North
London, that the Department for Education, which will next week publish the
first truancy tables, had received responses from 95 per cent of schools in
England and Wales in spite of an attempt to boycott them by the National
Association of Head Teachers.
The government plans to extend the tables to include authorised as well as
unauthorised absences, following complaints that some schools are less
stringent than others.
Dr Dennis O'Keeffe, director of the university's truancy unit, told the
conference he was sceptical about a direct link between truancy and crime.
But a survey by the university had suggested that 30.5 per cent of pupils in
their last two years of compulsory schooling played truant at least once.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Union leaders recommend Ford 6% offer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of 23,000 Ford car workers last night decided to 'strongly
recommend' acceptance of a pay offer worth 6 per cent over two years.
Ford of Britain offered unions an increase of 2.5 per cent now and 3.5 per
cent or inflation, whichever is greater, from next November.
The offer, although higher than the inflation rate of 1.8 per cent, is the
lowest proposed settlement in percentage terms at Ford for more than 20
years.
The company increased its original offer of 1.8 per cent this year and 2.5
per cent next year during 10 hours of talks in London yesterday.
The company reaffirmed its intention not to make any compulsory redundancies
and promised to maintain lay-off pay at 100 per cent after earlier proposing
a reduction to 80 per cent. Ford also agreed to appoint union trustees to
its pension fund.
Mr Tony Woodley, national secretary of the TGWU general union, said he was
'very pleased' with the offer which will be put to Ford workers at a series
of factory meetings next week.
He said: 'I am not shouting around the houses about this deal but there is
no doubt that with an above-inflation settlement this year and keeping pace
with inflation next year, we are more than pleased.'
Mr Jimmy Airlie, chief Ford negotiator for the AEEU engineering and
electrical union, said unions would be strongly recommending the offer.
Unions said the offer was worth about Pounds 17.50 a week.
Some of Ford's plants are on short-time working and the company has
announced a series of non-production days into the new year because of
recession in the European market.
The company turned down the unions' claim of a shorter working week.
Earlier this week Vauxhall workers at Ellesmere Port, near Liverpool, voted
narrowly in favour for a strike over pay. But it is unlikely to go ahead
without support from other plants.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Perfume outcome surprises observers: A look at the reasons
behind the MMC's decision on a sector with a 'complex monopoly'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MONOPOLIES and Mergers Commission surprised many observers yesterday
with its conclusion that while a 'complex monopoly' situation existed in
favour of a number of perfume houses, this was not against the public
interest.
The commission accepted that 'fine fragrances are marketed as luxury
products and suppliers need to be able to control their distribution in
order to protect the brand images which consumers evidently value'.
It concluded the market was competitive and the system whereby manufacturers
were allowed to choose which retailers they supplied did not operate against
the public interest.
Its first task had been to decide whether a so-called 'scale monopoly'
existed - under which a quarter of a particular type of goods are supplied
by or to the same person, or members of the same group or corporate body.
It found that no perfume house had a market share approaching 25 per cent,
and Boots, the largest buyer and retailer, had only 17 per cent of the
market, including duty-free and unofficial - or 'grey-market' - supplies. No
scale monopoly therefore existed.
It next had to establish whether a 'complex monopoly' existed, under which
at least a quarter of all goods were supplied by or to a group which
conducted its affairs in a way that restricted or distorted competition.
The commission concluded such a situation did exist, since perfume houses
refused to supply retailers they did not authorise themselves, and because
they recommended re-sale prices to those retailers.
The final stage was to decide whether this complex monopoly situation
operated against the public interest. The commission concluded,
contro-versially, that it did not.
It took account of the fact that the European Commission had exempted two
leading perfume manufacturers, Yves Saint Laurent and Givenchy, from an
article of the Treaty of Rome prohibiting anti-competitive agreements.
The MMC decided the way the fragrance houses operated in the UK generally
accorded with the EC's requirements.
Moreover, it found that while perfume prices in the UK had been higher than
in continental Europe until about three years ago, suppliers had since
adopted a policy of harmonising wholesale prices in the European Union.
That, together with the devaluation of sterling last year, had resulted in
UK wholesale prices dropping below those in continental Europe.
The commission said that while retailers had tended to compete on factors
apart from price - such as service and shopping ambience - the situation was
changing. This was due partly to the arrival in the market of large
retailers obtaining their supplies from the grey market, and the increasing
size of the grey market following the European Commission's efforts to
ensure free trade across borders.
Some observers suggested, however, that this argument was circular, as it
was allegations that suppliers were trying to restrict the development of
the grey market and of price competition which led to the referral in the
first place.
The commission had also been asked to examine claims by Superdrug that some
magazines refused to carry advertising for its perfume sales after pressure
from perfume houses. It found only one example of such a case, which
occurred before the period specified by Superdrug.
It was understandable that upmarket magazines might refuse advertising from
the more downmarket Superdrug. Moreover, the commission said it was a matter
of 'normal commercial judgment' that publishers should consider the possible
reaction of other fragrance houses, whose advertising was vital to the
existence of their magazines, if they accepted Superdrug's adverts.
However, the commission made three specific proposals:
Perfume houses should set up a system of independent arbitration of disputes
over the authorisation of retailers.
The Office of Fair Trading should monitor the effect of range-stocking and
turnover requirements to ensure they did not exclude retailers unnecessarily
and impair competition and choice.
The OFT should also monitor retailers' complaints about perfume houses'
selective distribution policies to enable the UK to make 'informed comments'
in a review due to be carried out by the European Commission in May 1997.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Savile Row broadens horizons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENTLEMEN need no longer go to London's Savile Row to buy a Pounds 2,000
suit. Savile Row will go to them.
Britain's top gentlemen's outfitters are travelling the world to find
customers. Sales by Savile Row tailors on trips overseas account for about
70 per cent of turnover - two years ago they were less than half, according
to the Federation of Merchant Tailors.
The itinerants have been trying to shake off the fall in the number of
international aircraft passengers after the Gulf war and the recession.
'I used to spend six weeks a year overseas. Now it is more like three
months,' said Mr Peter Ferguson-Smith, the federation's president and
managing director of tailors Kilgour, French and Stanbury.
He flies between Abu Dhabi, Frankfurt and Beverley Hills to drum up sales.
Prices start at Pounds 1,490 and options include a special cut to disguise
the bulge of a revolver.
The phenomenon of the travelling Savile Row tailor is not new. In 1851,
Henry Poole went to Paris to measure Napoleon III for a suit. Until 1940 the
company had branches in Vienna and Berlin and the post-war years saw the
popularity of Savile Row grow among rich Americans.
All that has changed. 'Fewer businessmen are coming to London,' Mr Cundey
said. 'French businessmen are coming far less frequently. That goes for all
the Europeans. They fly in and fly out and they don't have time to see their
tailor.'
Fortunately for Savile Row, the slimline 'British look' is almost
fashionable for the first time in more than a decade.
Even so, it may be tricky to spot the man in the Savile Row suit by the cut
of his cloth. 'An American will not want too much padding in the shoulders,'
said Mr Ferguson-Smith. 'A Frenchman or an Italian might want something more
closely fitted, while the Germans still want the big-shoulder look.'

FT  12 NOV 93 / Names under pressure to accept settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S OF London may attempt to 'bounce' loss-making Names into accepting
an out-of-court settlement to legal disputes at the insurance market, the
chairman of the biggest action group of loss makers warned yesterday.
Mr Michael Deeny told the annual meeting of the Gooda Walker Action
Groupthat Names would soon 'receive a barrage of mail warning you that this
is the last offer.'
The warning comes amid indications that some Lloyd's agents - who handle the
affairs of the Names that support the market - may also oppose Lloyd's plans
to ask them to make voluntary contributions to help fund a settlement.
The agents, who are targetted in more than two dozen legal actions, will
learn today how their contributions are to be calculated.
More than 100 agencies could be asked to donate, but the losses of Lloyd's
in recent years have stretched available resources of some smaller
companies.
The managing director of another agency said: 'Many agents will not be in a
position to find that sort of money.'
At the Gooda meeting Mr Deeny said the 3,000 Gooda Names should press ahead
with their legal action rather than accept an inadequate deal. Offers of
compensation in the region of 30p in the pound, a figure widely rumoured at
the Lloyd's market, were way below levels that 'the committee of this action
group could recommend to its membership.'
Mr Deeny said: 'Multilateral negotiations of a most complex and demanding
nature' were taking place between the leaders of loss making Names, Lloyd's,
agents and their insurers but no 'concrete or detailed offer' was on the
table.
Lloyd's wants to finance a deal through contributions from errors and
omissions insurers, which cover Lloyd's agents against awards for
negligence, and the Lloyd's central fund. It is understood that E&amp;O insurers
might provide Pounds 300m towards a settlement. Lloyd's said two months ago
that it would also seek contributions from agents, brokers and accountants.
It is understood that the formula on which agents' contributions will be
based takes into account three factors: the deductibles (the amount of an
insurance claim paid by the buyer) on the agents' errors and omissions
insurance policies; the amounts of exposure not insured by these policies;
and the exposure of each agent to potential claims.
Agency boards will meet next week to examine the implications of the scheme.
Annual deductibles are typically between Pounds 300,000 and Pounds 500,000
for bigger agents.
One agent estimated that between Pounds 25m and Pounds 75m could be raised
through such contributions but that the cost might push many smaller agents
into insolvency.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Polly Peck administrators quizzed over bribes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN

<DATELINE>
   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL JORDAN, ad-ministrator to Polly Peck International, the collapsed
fruit to electronics group, yesterday appeared before the Istanbul public
prosecutor's office to answer questions relating to allegations made by Mr
Asil Nadir that administrators considered bribing customs officials.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the UK auditors, last night claimed that the move was 'a
minor attempt to put a spanner in the works in an effort to forcibly
postpone Mr Jordan's visit to Cyprus'.
Mr Jordan and Mr David Kidd of Coopers were visited by police in their hotel
room late on Wednesday night. Police took their passports and they were
requested to appear the following morning, when they were questioned for
three hours. Their passports were later returned. British consular officials
were last night trying to establish on what grounds the request had been
made.
The prosecutor's move follows a complaint lodged by Mr Nadir's lawyer
connected with the continuing dispute over ownership of AN Graphics, an
Istanbul printing concern claimed by the administrators. Sources confirm
that the company was transferred to Mr Nadir for 'nil consideration', just
three days before the courts appointed the administrators in October 1990.
The bribery allegations relate to an internal memo, a copy of which Mr Nadir
released yesterday.
The administrators concede that the memo deployed what one official called
'loose wording', including reference to the need for bribes to Turkish
customs to release a disputed piece of printing equipment belonging to AN
Graphics.
On Wednesday Mr Ali Riza Gorgun, Mr Nadir's lawyer in North Cyprus, said the
Turkish prosecutor had issued a warrant for the arrest of all three
administrators - Mr Jordan, Mr Richard Stone and Mr Christopher Morris.
Mr Jordan was due back in London last night and Mr Gorgun was uncontactable.
The incident forced Mr Jordan to cancel a trip to northern Cyprus to attend
court hearings in Nicosia today on the injunctions over the various PPI
companies on the island.
It marks the latest tactic by Mr Nadir to block the administrators access to
the Polly Peck companies. Mr Nadir jumped bail in May fleeing the UK where
he faces charges of theft and false accounting relating to Polly Peck.

PERFORMANCE tables of school truancy rates are essential to the government's
'back to basics' campaign, Baroness Blatch, the education minister, said
yesterday.
She said high truancy rates had contributed to the rising crime rate. 'Not
every truant is a potential criminal. Some may be at home watching

'But where teenagers or even very young children are wandering the streets -
as many do - they are all too vulnerable to criminal or anti-social

She told a conference on truancy, organised by the University of North
London, that the Department for Education, which will next week publish the
first truancy tables, had received responses from 95 per cent of schools in
England and Wales in spite of an attempt to boycott them by the National
Association of Head Teachers.
The government plans to extend the tables to include authorised as well as
unauthorised absences, following complaints that some schools are less
stringent than others. She said parentally-condoned truancy was a particular
problem for some schools.
Baroness Blatch added that information technology and monitoring systems
might have a role to play for schools combating the problem.
Dr Dennis O'Keeffe, director of the university's truancy unit, told the
conference he was sceptical about a direct link between truancy and crime.
He said, however, that a survey by the university had suggested that 30.5
per cent of pupils in their last two years of compulsory schooling played
truant at least once.
He found that the largest cause was dissatisfaction with lessons, cited by
two-thirds of truants.
Fear of disapproval by parents and teachers was the most powerful control on
truants, suggesting that 'school ethos is the critical variable' in fighting
truancy.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Troubled Ford picks new sales director
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD of Britain, which has suffered three years of heavy losses and a steady
erosion of its share of the UK new car market, yesterday appointed Mr Paddy
Byrne as sales director.
The reshuffling of its top management follows the appointment of Mr Ernie
Thompson, its long-serving sales director, as chief executive of the Society
of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
Mr Byrne, who has been Ford of Europe's director of East European sales and
export operations for the past two years, was previously chief executive of
the troubled Waterford Wedgwood glassware and china group.
The appointment of Mr Thompson as SMMT chief executive marks a sharp change
of direction by the association. He succeeds Sir Hal Miller, former
Conservative MP and joint chairman of the House of Commons all-party motor
industry group.
Mr Thompson's Ford background could prove divisive. Ford has voiced loud
criticism of the growing Japanese presence in the industry, which it says is
posing a direct threat to the existing motor industry technology base.
Nissan, the Japanese carmaker, is now a full member of the SMMT, however,
and other Japanese carmakers, Toyota and Honda, are expected to play a
growing role.

Mr Angus Cundey of tailor Henry Poole said: 'On Monday I am piling my cloth
samples into the Volvo and driving to Paris. I'll be seeing Mr Balladur (the
French prime minister) and about 60 other people next week.'
If the trip is too far for his car, Mr Cundey will have a trunk of samples
delivered to his hotel room, which becomes a shop for the duration of his

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROY ASHMAN, the former chairman of Harland Simons, the electronics
company, was acquitted yesterday at Aylesbury Crown Court of making
misleading statements to two investors shortly before a reduced profits
forecast caused the company's share price to fall.
The jury's verdict after the five-day trial represents a disappointment for
the Department of Trade and Industry which brought the prosecution under
Section 47 of the Financial Services Act, which outlaws the making of
misleading statements.
The case was the fourth to be brought under Section 47 since the passing of
the legislation. Section 47 has been under close scrutiny by lawyers and
regulators since its introduction. Of the four prosecutions to date two have
succeeded and two have failed.
Mr Ashman had been accused of misleading two fund managers from Govett
Strategic Investments by telling them, at a meeting last February, that he
was comfortable with the company's initial forecast of profits of about
Pounds 13m to Pounds 14m.
The two fund managers, Mr Nigel Savage and Mr Marc Gordon, then bought
155,000 shares worth almost Pounds 1m in the group. Just hours later the
profits forecast was reduced to Pounds 4m and the share price fell from 585p
to 270p.
The company eventually reported a pre-tax loss of more than Pounds 6m.
Mr Ashman denied knowing at the time of the meeting that the profit forecast
was about to be reduced.
He also told the court that Mr Savage had been 'getting around to questions
he should not have been asking' about anticipated year-end returns.
Mr Ashman refused to comment after the verdict. His solicitor, Mr Graham
Huntley said: 'We are very happy with the result and it is unfortunate that
this prosecution was brought in the first place.'

FT  12 NOV 93 / Building societies want broader lending rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING SOCIETIES are urging their regulator to soften the force of planned
guidance on lending policy, saying that it is too detailed and prescriptive
in its present form.
They have warned that the draft prudential note put forward by the Building
Societies Commission could inhibit their ability to compete in mortgage
lending unless it is changed. The 40-page draft sets out guidance covering
the whole range of a society's lending, including issues such as assessing
risks, limiting exposure to fixed rate and capped lending, and dealing with
arrears.
Prudential notes have a particular status in the way that building societies
are regulated. Any society which does not comply with such a note normally
has to explain itself to the commission and might also find its credit
rating affected.
Several of the larger societies have already expressed their concerns to the
commission, and these are reflected in a response from the Building
Societies Association, the industry's trade body. The unease is felt
particularly strongly as lending is one of societies' core activities.
Issues of contention include the ways of assessing a borrower's ability to
repay a mortgage and a society's exposure to fixed-rate mortgages.
Societies have recently been losing their share of the mortgage lending
market to banks, whose fixed-rate mortgages have proved particularly
popular.
In the face of the industry pressure the commission is likely to back down
and agree to issue the guidance in a different form, which carries less
weight.
The association suggested that only broad guidance should be contained in a
prudential note, and that more detailed advice about what is 'best practice'
could be issued separately, perhaps by the association rather than by the
commission.
Societies are also concerned that parts of the guidance are not suited to
the whole of the industry from Halifax, the UK's largest society, to the
smallest operators in the sector.
Some of the largest societies believe that in certain lending issues the
commission should seek to reach agreements with individual societies instead
of trying to set blanket limits for the industry as a whole.
Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the UK's
sixth largest society, said the draft guidance was part of a trend which
could see the commission moving increasingly into societies' operational
matters.
He said: 'A common view in the industry is that the commission is getting
into realms that could be commercial rather than prudential.'

FT  12 NOV 93 / Levitt Group was 'riddled with fraud': Deception of Fimbra
alleged at first day of trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEVITT GROUP, the failed financial services company, was 'riddled with
fraud, forgery, deception and downright dishonesty' in the 18 months before
its collapse in December 1990, it was alleged at the Old Bailey yesterday.
Mr David Cocks QC, prosecuting for the Serious Fraud Office, said Mr Roger
Levitt, the company's chairman, illegally injected funds, forged accounts
and misled Fimbra, the Levitt Group's regulator, to conceal its massive
losses and continue trading.
Mr Cocks was opening the prosecution's case against Mr Levitt and three
other former executives of the company, Mr Mark Reed, Mr Alan McNamara and
Mr Robert Price.
All four deny a charge of fraudulent trading that alleges the production of
false accounts, the fraudulent injection of almost Pounds 21m into the
company and the misleading of Fimbra about the state of Levitt Group
finances.
Mr Cocks told the jury the Levitt Group had grown from humble beginnings in
the middle 1970s, when it sold only pensions, to a concern recording profits
of Pounds 8m in 1988.
By then it was providing a range of investment, tax and financial services
to wealthy clients. Mr Roger Levitt, the driving force behind the company,
was a 'past master as a salesman', he said.
By early 1989, however, the company was in desperate financial trouble and
heading for collapse. Between January 1989 and June 1990 the group made
losses of Pounds 13m.
'In 1989 the decline and fall of the empire was well on the way. Bankers and
others dealing with the Levitt Group thought it was a thriving concern. It
fact it was an empty shell making huge losses,' Mr Cocks said. He added that
the company could be kept afloat only by fraud and dishonesty on a massive
scale.
'Money had to be pumped into that leaky vessel to keep it afloat at all,' Mr
Cocks said.
He alleged that between April 1989 and December 1990 Mr Levitt illegally
injected almost Pounds 21m into his ailing company. The money came from
personal loans, share sales and other sources, including Pounds 400,000
invested by Mr Frederick Forsyth, the author, who thought the money would be
placed in bonds.
Mr Cocks said the company's books then had to be 'cooked' to present this
money as genuine income. Fee notes and invoices were forged to show that the
Pounds 21m had come from Mr Levitt's provision of 'personal services' to
clients.
The book-cooking exercise proved so rigorous and thorough that the group's
Pounds 13m loss was turned into a stated profit of almost the same amount.
Assets were also manipulated so that the company accounts recorded a healthy
surplus rather than a 'thumping loss', Mr Cocks said.
Without these stated figures, giving the impression of a successful company,
nobody would have dealt with the Levitt Group and it would have collapsed,
he said.
The fraud also depended on the misleading of Fimbra to ensure that the
regulator maintained its authorisation of the group, he added. Although Stoy
Hayward, the company's auditors, had been 'taken in' by the false accounts,
Fimbra was not satisfied. Helped by the accounting firm, it started an
investigation.
This led to the group's suspension from Fimbra membership and liquidation in
December 1990 with debts of Pounds 34m.
Mr Levitt was the 'architect' of the fraud, with Mr Mark Reed, his
'right-hand man' since 1976, the other main protagonist, Mr Cocks said.
The prosecution said that although Mr Price left the company in mid-1990, he
had been involved in the fraud as finance director and Mr McNamara, a former
commercial director, was also involved. Mr Cocks told the jury that Mr
McNamara had told police: 'When Levitt said jump, I jumped.'
The trial continues today.

FT  12 NOV 93 / '80% of workers' take early retirement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST WORKERS start drawing pension benefits well before they reach their
official retirement ages of 60 or 65, a survey of leading UK pension schemes
shows.
The survey, by Incomes Data Services, the pay analysts, found that more than
eight out of 10 employees retired before reaching the 'normal' pension age
as defined by their scheme rules. Two-thirds of recently retiring members
went before the age of 60.
The findings have significance for the government's policy on state pensions
because it is considering raising the age at which women may start receiving
state pensions from 60 to 65.
The survey noted that for schemes which allowed men to retire at 60 there
was a higher degree of 'late' retirement since men had an incentive to keep
working until their state pensions became available for income as well.
The analysis covered 32,000 individual retirements in 15 large occupational
schemes including Barclays Bank, the occupational fund for teachers, British
Petroleum and Unilever. Six schemes were for large private-sector employers
and eight for smaller employers.
IDS said: 'The analysis found that the term 'normal pension age' is
increasingly a misnomer, with few members waiting until the age of 60 or 65
to draw pensions.'
The survey also found that late retirement - retirement after normal pension
age - was relatively insignificant.
The survey found that in four of the schemes more than 40 per cent of
retirements took place before the member reached the age of 55, with 59.6
per cent of Barclay's members retiring before that time.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Man suspended as too fat to fit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 22-STONE Liverpudlian fitter has been suspended from his job for being
obese. The fitter, employed by NEI Clark Chapman in the Liverpool docks, has
been sent home on full pay and told he can resume work when he loses two
stone.
The company believes the fitter is a potential danger to himself and to
others because he has to climb cranes and work in an area with moving
machinery. The fitter, in his early 30s, was originally suspended after he
tried to sue the company for negligence after a fall which injured his back.
The company claimed the fall was due to his weight.
Mr Dave Gough, an official of the AEEU engineering and electrical union who
represented the skilled fitter, said the company had subsequently treated
the man well and had even paid for him to go on a weight-watchers course.
But he added: 'I am worried about setting precedents and about who should
decide when someone is too fat. After all, if it was just a question of
being overweight then three-quarters of British industry, and almost all the
managers, would qualify for dismissal.'
Mr Gough said stories had circulated in the company about the large number
of Mars bars the fitter would eat during the breaks. 'I told him that if he
was responsible for his own size he probably deserved the sack, but if it
was a question of some sort of metabolic illness then he deserved the full
support of the union.'
The company said yesterday the fitter was now officially on sick leave
rather than suspended. Mr Gough said he did not know how much progress he
was making in losing weight.
Cases of being sacked for being too fat are not unknown. Last year Mr Gary
Cannon, a sewer worker, was sacked because he was too fat to fit through a
manhole.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Hairstyle 'unprofessional' tribunal hears
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A SALES manager for a gaming machine company was told to change her
'unprofessional' hairstyle because it made her look as if she was going to a
disco, an industrial tribunal was told yesterday.
Miss Tracey Gatehouse left her Pounds 9,000-a-year job with Stretton Leisure
after being told she should tie her hair back because it gave the wrong
corporate image. She has said she was also warned that her good looks might
make pub landlords' wives jealous.
Miss Gatehouse, of Warrington, Cheshire, is claiming constructive dismissal,
sex discrimination and compensation for unequal pay at the Liverpool
tribunal.
Miss Valerie Crook, the company's personnel manager, said she had been told
that the managing director did not feel Miss Gatehouse's hair was
professional enough or business-like enough for her job.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Odd man out spurns 'invite' to Apec's US party: Malaysia's
Dr Mahathir plans to stay away from Seattle next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DR Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, is not afraid to be odd man
out.
Next week, representatives of 15 nations meet in Seattle under the auspices
of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum (Apec). After a preliminary
ministerial meeting, President Bill Clinton is due to hold an informal
summit. With several prime ministers and presidents in attendance, plus
2,000 of the world's media, the get-together will be the highest-level
'confab' ever held in the region. But Dr Mahathir will not be there.
The US, he says, is trying to hijack Apec and set an agenda for the less
powerful nations of east Asia to follow. 'I would have been happy to go to
the summit if the proposal had come from Apec and had been debated and
approved, but this is undemocratic. One nation has decided to have a summit
and everyone is supposed to go along.'
Apec was formed in 1989. Initially, membership comprised the six countries
of Asean (the US, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand). In
1991, the 'three Chinas' joined - China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
Dr Mahathir says Apec should remain a loose grouping mainly concerned with
helping development of Asia-Pacific's weaker economies. Dr Mahathir, who has
increasingly taken on the role of spokesman of the world's smaller nations,
says Apec should include all countries on the Pacific rim, including Chile,
Ecuador and Peru.
Apec, he adds should not be turned into a trade bloc, a free trade area or
an economic community, serving the interests of the economically strong
countries involved. Yet, according to Malaysia, this is precisely what is
happening.
'Apec looks like some kind of a foreign guided jamboree with an
imperialistic odour which may be politically exclusive,' says Mr Ghazali
Shafie, a former Malaysian foreign minister. There is some support for
Malaysia's views. The Asean countries do not want their organisation to be
overwhelmed by any new Apec structure, though some are fervent Apec
supporters.
Washington has denied any plan to turn Apec into a formal trade group, but
Asean and other countries in the region are concerned the US might try to
use the threat of more concerted Apec action to force the pace of Gatt talks
and win trade concessions from Europe.
The US has stressed the growth in trade taking place in the Asia-Pacific
region. 'In 1991, our two-way trade across the Pacific exceeded Dollars
310bn (Pounds 205bn),' says Mr Paul Wolfowitz, a former US under-secretary
of defence. 'That's one third larger than our trade with Europe. The US
exports more to Malaysia than to the countries of the former Soviet Union:
more to Indonesia than to eastern Europe and more to Singapore than to Spain
or Italy.'
While east Asia has benefitted from this growth in trade, it does not want
Apec to be seen as any sort of alternative to Gatt. 'The last thing we want
is to become a bargaining chip between the US and Europe,' one Asean
official said.
Malaysia has been pushing for the formation of an East Asian Economic Caucus
(EAEC) to counter what it sees as the emergence of trade blocs such as the
EU and Nafta. This, in many ways, would run counter to Apec, grouping Asean
countries and the economies of north-east Asia including Japan and China,
but excluding the US and Canada, a grouping one commentator referred to as a
'caucus without the Caucasians'.
The EAEC was first suggested by Dr Mahathir in mid-1991 and has since become
a central part of Malaysia's foreign and trade policy. Dr Mahathir was
personally offended when Mr James Baker, the former US secretary of state,
dismissed the idea of an EAEC, saying it would 'draw a line down the
Pacific' with the US on one side, and Japan and the other Asian economies on
the other.
While Malaysia has succeeded in placing the EAEC on the Asean agenda, the
idea has only so far had a lukewarm response from countries in the region.
Apec is still considering whether the EAEC should form an integral part of
the organisation.
Japan has so far been non-committal: Tokyo wants to safeguard its estimated
Dollars 33bn investments in the Asean economies, while not wanting to upset
its already delicate trading relations with the US.
Mrs Rafidah Aziz, Malaysia's fiery trade minister, will be in Seattle
pushing Dr Mahathir's views. He has made it clear he will continue with his
rival scheme for a grouping of east Asia's dynamic economies.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Japanese paper magnate held in corruption probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR RYOEI SAITO, the magnate who led the Japanese charge into world art
markets and jokingly said that he wanted to be buried with his Van Gogh and
his Renoir, was keeping less salubrious company last night after his arrest
as part of a crackdown on political corruption.
The arrest of Mr Saito, 77, honorary chairman of Daishowa Paper, the
country's second largest paper manufacturer, follows allegations that he
authorised a Y100m (Pounds 630,000) payment to a provincial governor who
approved the development of a Daishowa-linked golf course and housing
complex.
During 1990, Mr Saito boosted art prices by paying Dollars 160.6m for a
Renoir cafe scene and Van Gogh's Portrait of Dr Gachet. He then bought a
version of Rodin's The Thinker statue for Y1.5bn.
His family has links far beyond the paper industry. His brother Shigeyoshi,
former governor of Shizuoka, south of Tokyo, is married to a Toyoda, of
Toyota Motor fame, while a son, Toshitsugu, is an MP for the opposition
Liberal Democratic party.
But Ryoei Saito is lord of the clan, and his detention, along with that of
Daishowa's vice chairman, Mr Taira Kiyosawa, raises doubt about the future
of the company and has stirred fears over who will be the next to fall in
the public prosecutors' drive against corruption.
Until now, executives at five large construction companies have been
arrested, along with a few local politicians. Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the former
LDP powerbroker at the centre of the governing coalition, is under pressure
to give evidence in parliament about a Y5m donation from a contractor.
The allegations against Mr Saito involve Y100m paid to Mr Shuntaro Honma,
the former governor of Miyagi, north of Tokyo, who in 1991 said exceptions
should be made to planning regulations blocking the construction of the
Natori Greenport golf course and housing complex.
Mr Saito has come back from the brink in the past, having been forced to
relinquish control of his company in 1982 to Sumitomo Bank, after
accumulating an unsustainable Y500bn in debt. Four years later, he Mr Saito,
bitter that the restructuring included the sale of cherished paintings,
severed links with Sumitomo and returned to the helm.
He has insisted that the recent art acquisitions will not be sold, even
though Daishowa is again being restructured and expects to lose Y21.8bn this
year. The company's health has been undermined by Mr Saito's ambitious
expansion of paper production capacity and by the wayward diversification
into golf course development.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Protests in Lagos at 7-fold petrol price rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of demonstrators took to the streets of Lagos and halted traffic
on the city's main road in protest against a seven-fold rise in petrol
prices, introduced on Monday by the country's military-backed interim
government.
The decision is likely to prove a critical test of the authority of Chief
Ernest Shonekan, Nigeria's civilian head of state. Removing the petrol
subsidy is an essential part of government efforts to revive a lapsed
structural adjustment programme, and pave the way to an accord with the
International Monetary Fund and rescheduling of external debt of over
Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20.3bn).
But the highly unpopular move could well upset Nigeria's fragile stability
and lead to an upsurge in opposition, particularly in Lagos and the
south-west, stronghold of Chief Moshood Abiola, winner of last June's
aborted presidential poll.
The government on Monday increased the price of petrol from N0.7 (2p) a
litre to N5 (15p), N4.75 for diesel and N4.5 for kerosene.
Speaking in the capital Abuja yesterday, Mr Shonekan made clear his
determination to press ahead with economic reforms, and stressed the need to
cut government spending and reduce the budget deficit.
'Despite political and legal obstacles, we will still go along to carry out
our mandate,' he said. 'The interim government may be a child of
circumstance, but it is high time we came to terms with the reality of our
circumstances.'
However the fuel price increase looks likely to provoke a further damaging
confrontation with the trade unions, which brought Lagos to a halt earlier
this year in protest at the cancellation of the presidential poll and the
extension of military rule until fresh elections promised for February next
year.
Demonstrators were also celebrating a ruling on Wednesday by the Lagos High
Court that the former military leader, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, had appointed
Mr Shonekan as head of state hours after the general had himself resigned,
making the appointment technically illegal.

FT  12 NOV 93 / UN tightens Lockerbie sanctions on Libya
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   ByMICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS AT THE UN and MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UN Security Council last night voted to tighten sanctions against Libya
in a new effort to bring the two men accused of the Lockerbie airliner
bombing to trial in Scotland or the US.
The measures include freezing Libyan financial assets abroad, strengthening
an existing ban on international air links by closing all foreign offices of
the Libyan airline, and halting exports to Libya of oil refining and
pipeline equipment.
In addition, funds derived from Libya's oil and natural gas sales and from
agricultural products must be paid into separate and exclusive bank
accounts.
Eleven member nations of the Security Council voted for the resolution.
There were no votes against it but China, Pakistan, Morocco and Djibouti
abstained.
Libya so far has refused to hand over the two men accused of blowing up the
Pan American airliner which disintegrated over Lockerbie in Scotland in 1988
with the loss of 270 lives.
The latest measures will not go into effect until December 1, giving Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, extra time to try to
negotiate a solution.
The new sanctions are likely to have a psychological rather than an
immediate economic impact on Libya, particularly as they leave untouched its
hydrocarbon export revenues, which amounted to Dollars 9.5bn last year -
some 95 per cent of hard currency earnings.
Closure of the state airline offices merely tightens an existing ban on air
travel, an inconvenience Libyans have got used to since April 1992. Most of
Libya's imports arrive by sea or road.
The ban on parts and spares for the country's oil transport and export
facilities is designed to erode its export capacity.
There were hints last month that Libya might surrender the accused men for
trial in Scotland but this came to nothing, ostensibly because their lawyers
objected.
An offer to hold the proceedings in Switzerland, which Mr Ali Ahmed
Elhouderi, the Libyan delegate, repeated at the UN yesterday, has been
rejected by Britain. The Libyan delegate insisted that only the venue was in
dispute, not the question of holding a trial.
The resolution was carefully drafted to cause as little interference as
possible with western Europe's economic relations with Libya or with
exploration contracts signed recently by Total of France, Eni-Agip of Italy
and Petrofina of Belgium.
In a bid to protect its own economic interests, including Libya's Dollars
4bn debt-for-arms purchases, Russia at first threatened to block the
resolution. President Boris Yeltsin relented in response to personal appeals
by President Bill Clinton and Mr John Major, the British prime minister.
Russia voted for the resolution, which at its insistence included an
affirmation of 'Libya's duty scrupulously to adhere to all of its
obligations concerning servicing and repayment of its foreign debt'.
Delaying imposition of the new measures until next month was also a Russian
proposal.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Jordan and Israel iron out accord

A SEVEN-MAN Jordanian economic delegation is reportedly holding talks in
Jerusalem with government officials and businessmen to iron out details of a
secret Israeli-Jordanian peace agreement which focuses on economic
co-operation.
According to the newspaper Maariv, the delegation is led by the businessman
who has the concession to operate Jordan's Aqaba port and includes
representatives of Jordan's two leading banks, financial advisers and
experts on sea and land transport. The delegation, which crossed the Allenby
bridge into Israel on Wednesday, will also visit Israel's port at Eilat.
The delegation's arrival follows statements by Israeli government ministers
and officials that an agreement has already been negotiated and initialled
during secret talks between Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister, and
King Hussein and Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan in Amman last week.
Foreign ministry officials have refused to confirm the meetings, saying only
they expect the agreement to be signed early next year.
In return for signing, Jordan will apparently get relief from the US on its
Dollars 6.5bn (Pounds 4.3bn) external debt, beginning with Dollars 360m of
military debt.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, who is visiting Washington for
talks with President Bill Clinton and congressmen, will press the US to help
with Jordan's indebtedness and to arrange a signing ceremony in Washington.
King Hussein is expected to visit Washington within weeks.
Under the agreement, Israel and Jordan will open their borders, establish
full diplomatic relations and start joint projects in tourism, transport and
energy. Disputed Israeli-held land around the Dead Sea and Arava desert will
be formally handed to Jordan but leased back to Israel for a long term at a
nominal price.
In anticipation of a signing, Israel disclosed yesterday it was already
planning air and road links to Jordan.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Tense debate on austerity grips Beijing
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S tense debate over curbs on an overheating economy surfaced in the
official press yesterday with a spirited defence of the austerity-reform
programme of Senior Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji.
Chinese newspapers featured prominently remarks by a deputy governor of the
People's Bank claiming success in the austerity campaign as the Central
Committee of the ruling Communist Party was due to begin discussions in
Beijing of a new reform programme.
Mr Dai Xianlong, the central bank official, said bluntly: 'In recent months
China's financial departments have been blocking evil ways while opening
correct roads.' Mr Zhu and his team at the central bank, who have been
presiding over a squeeze on credit in an effort to combat inflation, have
been accused of stifling state enterprises, some of which are having
difficulty paying workers.
Reports circulated in Beijing that Mr Zhu is in trouble politically for
having pushed too hard with his economic stabilisation programme. But while
there is no doubt he has offended powerful officials in the state sector and
the provinces, there appears no alternative to his prescription for the
economy.
This combines a squeezing of credit to 'hot money' areas such as real estate
with a re-direction of funds to infrastructure, combined with determined
efforts to reform China's inefficient financial system.
Mr Dai's remarks seem designed to claim victory for bringing the economy
under control (inflationary pressures eased slightly in September), and to
offer reassurance that the central bank is sensitive to the plight of state
industry.
He said that, starting in August, the central bank had eased credit
restrictions. In the first 10 months of the year banks had provided Yuan
30bn (Pounds 3.4bn) more in loans than in the same period last year.
Mr Zhu, who also doubles as central bank governor, is certain to face sharp
questioning at the Central Committee meeting over hardship caused to the
state sector. The session is expected to last until the weekend, although
true to tradition no details of when it would actually meet or how long it
would sit have been released officially in advance.
The plenum will approve sweeping reforms in finance, taxation, trade and
investment. Among important reforms is a new federal tax system designed to
improve sharing of revenues between the centre and the provinces.
Mr Dai blamed lax policies earlier in the year for allowing an explosion in
credit which had helped to fuel inflation. Money in circulation in June on
an annualised basis had grown 54 per cent, the highest monthly rise ever. Mr
Li Guixian, the previous central bank governor, was sacked in June and
replaced by Mr Zhu Rongji. Among Mr Li's patrons was Premier Li Peng, who
suffered a heart attack in April, and is undergoing a long convalescence.
The unusual public criticism of the previous regime at the central bank
indicates that below the surface the leadership has been engaged in some
stirring argument about implementing Mr Zhu's austerity package. He
announced a 16-point plan in July to combat inflation and bring order to
China's chaotic finances. Pressure was exerted on faltering state industries
by squeezing credit.

THE Australian jobless rate jumped to 11.2 per cent last month despite a
strong rise in total employment, official figures released yesterday show,
Nikki Tait reports from Sydney. This is highest level since December 1992
and the jump is certain to propel the federal government into addressing
Australia's long-term unemployment problem.
Seasonally-adjusted, the jobless rate rose from 10.9 per cent in September,
to stand at 982,000. Only Western Australia posted a fall in unemployment to
9 per cent.

MR YASSIR Arafat, chairman of the PLO, cut short a visit to Portugal
yesterday and flew to Tunis for emergency meetings, amid mounting criticism
of his management of political and economic talks with Israel and
international donors.
Mr Nabil Amr, an adviser to Mr Arafat, said a group of PLO officials had
drafted a document criticising the chairman's political and negotiating
performance.
Israel's Finance Ministry said it had still not got a message from Mr Arafat
confirming the start of critical economic talks due to open in Paris on
Monday. The talks will set the agenda for future economic relations and
decide whether there will be a customs union.
Palestinians and international donors have voiced strong criticism of lack
of leadership on economic policy as the date for Palestinian self-government
in the occupied territories draws near. A World Bank official said this week
the PLO had to move swiftly to appoint professional personnel for the
recently announced Economic Council for Development and Construction.

EGYPT believes an outline peace agreement between Israel and Syria is
achievable by the end of this year.
President Hosni Mubarak, Mr Amr Moussa, foreign minister, and Dr Osama el
Baz, the president's top political adviser, have been encouraged by recent
meetings with Syrian and Israel leaders and now hope their unofficial date
for a breakthrough can be met.
Mr Moussa said in an interview with the Financial Times that the progress in
the negotiations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation
meant the issues separating Israel and Syria could be addressed with more
urgency.
'We are making progress although I would not yet say that a deal is close.
We have set a target date for the end of this year for the signing of a
document on which both sides can agree,' Mr Moussa said. He rejected the
contention by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel that more time was
needed for Israeli public opinion to take in the contents of the deal with
the PLO. 'We believe a good deal between Israel and Syria could be absorbed
and would be digestible. Our task is to get a good deal acceptable to public
opinion on both sides. We are talking about a matter of months before all
tracks are on the road to agreement.'
He stressed it was critical for Israel and the PLO to meet the December 13
target date for the start of an Israeli troop withdrawal from the Gaza strip
and the West Bank town of Jericho; he believed they would meet the deadline.
Mr Moussa, who helped broker the resumption of these talks in Cairo last
week, said they are now proceeding 'in a fine way, in a good way'. The
PLO-Israeli discussions continue in the Egyptian town of Taba on Monday.
The essence of an Israeli-Syria deal was clear. 'It has to be a full and
total Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights and a full peace.' The
Israeli withdrawal could be phased, but 'the phasing should be reasonable;
we can't talk about five years or so, it must be a matter of months.'

FT  12 NOV 93 / Double economic boost for South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA yesterday received a double economic boost with the release of
third-quarter GDP figures showing quarter-on-quarter growth of 8.2 per cent
and the production price index for September falling to 5.5 per cent, the
lowest level since January 1972.
Economists said yesterday that the country's four-year recession had
probably ended in the middle of the year with the third-quarter GDP figures
following growth rates of 1.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively in the
previous two quarters.
Mr Dave Mohr, chief economist at the Old Mutual, South Africa's largest life
office, joked: 'We're combining Asian growth rates with G-7 inflation]'
The GDP figures were better than expected, though recent figures on retail
sales, manufacturing production and car sales had hinted at an upturn. Most
companies that have reported recently say they expect little meaningful
growth before the second half of next year.
As with the previous two quarters, most growth sprang from an improvement in
agricultural production which grew at an annualised rate of 196 per cent.
One feature was the 2 per cent annualised increase in non-farm GDP. Mr Mohr
said it was the first time since 1988 that the economy had gone for three
quarters without substantial negative growth on the non-farm side.
Manufacturing growth was 5.5 per cent.
The recovery remains fragile, with the Central Statistical Service (CSS)
pointing out yesterday that the average level of the total seasonally
adjusted real GDP for the first nine months of 1993 was 0.4 per cent below
the equivalent figure a year ago, an indication of the low base from which
these quarterly growth rates were achieved.
Mr Mohr said the inflation figure confirmed inflation was probably lower
than originally thought and economists were revising their forecasts
downward. Consumer inflation was likely to average about 9.5 per cent in
1993 and would be lower in 1994.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Australian jobless rate jumped to 11.2 per cent last month despite a
strong rise in total employment, official figures released yesterday show.
This is highest level since Dec-ember 1992 and the jump is certain to step
up pressure on the federal government to address Australia's long-term
unemployment problem.
The figures showed that the seasonally-adjusted jobless rate had risen from
10.9 per cent in September. This increase came despite a strong rise in
total employment in October, which most analysts interpreted as a sign the
economy is strengthening. Some 32,200 jobs were added.
However, job-seekers entered or returned to the labour force in even greater
numbers, and the total number of unemployed people rose to 982,000. On a
regional basis, unemployment rates were either steady or higher in most
states. Western Australia was the one exception, posting a decline to 9 per
cent.
'It's about time the prime minister made unemployment his number one
priority,' Mr Michael Woolridge, Liberal deputy leader, said.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Leading Indian industrialists call for reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING Indian industrialists have appealed to the government for measures
to help them raise capital for their listed companies without over-diluting
the founding families' shareholdings.
Eight entrepreneurs, the heads of some of India's largest companies,
presented their demands on Wednesday in a report to Mr Manmohan Singh, the
finance minister. Their proposals include permission for companies to issue
non-voting shares and to buy stock at large discounts to stock market prices
as well as changes in tax laws.
The appeal follows a month of meetings of conservatively-inclined
industrialists at which concerns were raised about parts of the government's
economic liberalisation programme. The businessmen, dubbed the Bombay Club
after their first meeting in Bombay, have been accused of wanting a slowdown
in reform and protection against foreign competition.
The entrepreneurs themselves deny this and say they support the pace and
direction of liberalisation. The members of the Bombay Club include Mr Hari
Shankar Singhania, chairman of the Delhi-based JK Organisation, and Mr LM
Thapar, chairman of Ballarpur Industries, a top papermaker.
Their chief concern is that the state-owned financial institutions which
dominate the Indian stock market have permitted multinationals to raise
their stakes in Indian affiliates from 40 per cent to 51 per cent by issuing
stock at discounts of up to 90 per cent. Institutions have indicated they
would not permit Indian companies to make similar cut-price issues.
The report to the finance minister also proposes permission for shareholders
to pledge stock as security for bank loans, easing limits on corporate
borrowing and permission to issue non-voting stock.
Foreign companies have secured government approval for direct investments
worth Rs61.1bn (Pounds 1.3bn) in the first nine months of 1993, compared
with Rs5.3bn in 1991 and Rs38.9bn last year.
The government said this was an unprecedented response to the new industrial
policy from foreign investors, who had now pledged Rs104.1bn since reforms
started in mid-1991. More than 90 per cent of the capital was intended for
priority sectors such as power and oil refining or high-technology projects.

THE Pakistan government said yesterday it had finalised agreements to secure
new loans worth Dollars 1.55bn (Pounds 1.02bn) from the IMF and the World
Bank over the next three years. The boards of both institutions and the
Pakistani cabinet still need formally to ratify the deals but the formal
announcement is expected early next year.
Mr V A Jaffery, the prime minister's adviser on finance and de facto finance
minister, told journalists, an agreement had been reached to provide
'assistance under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and the
Extended Finance Facility (EFF) from the IMF, and PSAL (Public Sector
Adjustment Loan) from the Bank'.
He said that the government expecved to achieve a gross domestic product
growth rate of at least 6.5 per cent a year, reduce inflation to 5 per cent
and strengthen its international reserves significantly over the next three
years.
It must also reduce the burden of domestic and foreign debt. Foreign debt
rose to Dollars 23bn - Dollars 18.5bn long term and Dollars 4.5bn short term
 -at the end of June 1993.
The announcement provided fresh signs that many reforms introduced by Mr
Moeen Qureshi, the former prime minister, will remain on track. Mr Jaffery
said the government had committed itself to continue with measures to
improve tax collection, reduce tariffs, privatise state enterprises and
deregulate the economy.
In response to questions on whether the inflation reduction target was a
realistic one, Mr Jaffery said: 'It is not an impossible target to achieve',
adding that the government had three years to do so.
However, some officials privately expressed concern over the viability of
such a commitment.

agreement.' He expressed confidence in the 'tactical prowess' of Mr Yassir
Arafat, the PLO leader, even if it only appeared 'at the eleventh hour. This
man understands the meaning of the documents that have been signed. He
understands very well the requirements of the moment.'
The essence of an Israeli-Syria deal was clear. 'It has to be a full and

party would accept less than is in the Israel-Egypt agreement'. The Israeli
withdrawal could be phased, but 'the phasing should be reasonable; we can't
talk about five years or so, it must be a matter of months.'
He also warned Israel against attempting to exercise any form of economic
domination over the West Bank and Gaza.

FT  12 NOV 93 / US growth is back but doubts remain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE QUESTION exercising the minds of US forecasters is not whether the pace
of economic growth has accelerated - it undoubtedly has - but whether faster
expansion will prove sustainable and whether it will put upward pressure on
inflation and short-term interest rates.
The mood in the US bond market and, to a lesser extent, stock market last
week was grim. The sudden wave of bond sales reflected investors' concern
that faster growth would inevitably put upward pressure on prices, bringing
forward the timing of a long-feared tightening of US monetary policy. But
this negative reaction to recent statistics may have been hasty.
There are good reasons to believe that the pace of growth will taper off
somewhat early next year and that inflation will remain subdued for at least
another year.
'The market's pessimism about the inflation outlook is hard to understand,'
muses Mr Jack Beebe, director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of San
Francisco. He says inflationary pressures have been gradually squeezed out
of the economy in the past four or five years and predicts consumer prices
will rise less than 3 per cent this year and by only about 2.5 per cent next
year. Barring 1986, when the collapse of oil prices temporarily depressed
inflation, this would be the best outturn since the mid-1960s.
Figures out this week threw frustratingly little light on underlying trends.
The producer price index fell more sharply than expected last month but
consumer prices registered their biggest gain for six months - and the
increase could not be entirely explained by higher petrol taxes. However, if
Mr Beebe's optimistic forecast does prove correct, bond prices are likely to
rally again, pushing yields back below 6 per cent.
Meanwhile, a short-term acceleration of economic growth is unquestionably
under way. Gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 2.8 per cent in
the third quarter; excluding the negative effect of flooding in the midwest,
growth would have been about 3.5 per cent. This compares with disappointing
annual rates of expansion of 0.8 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively in
the first and second quarters.
Economic statistics released recently suggest the economy will be stronger
still in the current quarter: the annual rate of growth could easily exceed
4 per cent. The sharp fall in long-term interest rates in the first half of
the year appears to have given interest-rate sensitive sectors of the
economy a powerful stimulus.
New home sales, for example, rose to a seven-year high last month. More new
and existing homes are being sold than at any point in the Reagan boom of
the 1980s, despite adverse demographic trends. Surprisingly, there are even
signs of a recovery in non-residential construction.
A 20 per cent vacancy rate is still holding back new office construction but
supermarkets are again being built as are industrial structures.
Led by heavy purchases of computers, real business equipment investment grew
at an annual rate of 9 per cent in the third quarter after double-digit
rises in preceding periods. After allowing for inflation, consumers'
purchases of durable goods grew at an annual 7.5 per cent. Vehicle sales
soared to a four-year high last month.
Other reliable barometers of economic health are also flashing green. The
Purchasing Managers' Index - a guide to the fortunes of manufacturing
industry - rose more than four points last month to 53.8 per cent, the
highest level since February. Payroll employment rose 177,000 in October,
more than analysts expected; factory overtime hours are at an all-time high
while the average length of the working week is higher than at any point
since the second world war. The slight rise in unemployment - from 6.7 per
cent to 6.8 per cent - was, paradoxically, also a sign of strength because
it reflected a big increase in the number of people actively seeking work.
The big question is whether the more rapid growth can be sustained. The
recovery of the past two years has been saw-toothed with periods of robust
growth followed by near stagnation, as occurred at the start of this year.
Nearly all forecasters agree that the economy cannot sustain growth at an
annual rate of above 4 per cent. The consensus view is that growth will fall
back to an annual rate of about 3 per cent next year. But some analysts are
more pessimistic.
'I'm sceptical that a faster recovery has really taken hold,' says Mr Bob
Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs in New York. He predicts growth
will fall to an annual rate of about 2 per cent in the first half of next
year.
He points out growth is currently being boosted by temporary factors such as
a run-down in personal savings and warns that the neutral fiscal stance of
the past two years will turn contractionary in the new year as tax rises in
the Clinton budget begin to bite on higher-income households.
Defence cuts, corporate restructuring and weak overseas economies,
meanwhile, will continue to exert a negative pull on US growth.
Optimists will reply that US productivity trends are surprisingly strong.
Productivity rose at an annual rate of 3.9 per cent in the third quarter and
has grown at an average annual rate of 2.3 per cent since the end of the
recession, considerably faster than in the upturn of the 1980s.
This suggests the gap between actual and potential long-run growth may be
smaller than many analysts suspect. It also lends credence to projections by
Mr Beebe and others that the cycle of disinflation is not yet complete.

<TEXT>
THE LEADING candidate in next month's presidential elections in Venezuela,
Mr Rafael Caldera, announced a policy platform yesterday that rejected
market reforms introduced in Venezuela since 1989.
He also called for talks to ease the terms of the country's 'oppressive and
unjust' public sector foreign debt.
Mr Caldera, 77, said his 'first step' as president would be to address the
fiscal deficit by reducing spending in the 1994 government budget. However,
this would not be achieved by firing public employees or cutting wages, he
added.
The candidate, president from 1969-74, said he would raise government
revenues by improved tax collection. In addition, 'Those who earn more and
have more will pay more taxes'. A recently-introduced value added tax, which
the candidate called 'unfair' to consumers, would be repealed, he said.
Referring to business appeals for reforms in rules governing employees'
accumulated severance pay benefits, Mr Caldera said any changes accepted by
the workers would be approved by his government.
Venezuelans are scheduled to vote for a new president, National Congress and
state legislatures on December 5. Mr Caldera, running as an independent with
the support of 16 small political parties, has been in the lead over the
last few months in most published public opinion polls.
However, political analysts say a large number of voters are still
undecided, and that these votes could change the election's outcome.
In other policy areas, Mr Caldera said he would:
Call for reforms of the constitution, including the establishment of
referendums to approve leading policies and remove public officials
(including the president) from office.
Reform government, including public administration, the justice system,
education, health and agriculture.
Continue the process of decentralisation, but only if it produces greater
efficiency in government.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Deregulation helps farmers and industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S industry and farmers emerge as the main beneficiaries of the
sweeping deregulation programme the government started four years ago, says
a recently-published study, writes John Barham.
The report found that the elimination of taxes, fees and red tape has saved
the traded goods sector, principally industry and agriculture, some Dollars
495m (Pounds 335).
Far from suffering from the elimination of taxes, government revenues should
rise slightly, by about Dollars 322m over the next three years, due to
increased economic activity.
The study, by Mr Eduardo Sguiglia of the Economy Ministry, and Mr Ricardo
Delgado, an economic journalist, is the first attempt to quantify the impact
of deregulation.
Deregulation began with the first emergency measures taken to halt
hyperinflation in 1989, shortly after President Carlos Menem took office.
The programme took on greater impetus following Mr Domingo Cavallo's
appointment as economy minister in January 1991.
It is one of the main features of Mr Cavallo's policies, which include
privatisation of all state companies, trade liberalisation and tax reform.
Mr Cavallo scrapped dozens of rules, regulations and statutory bodies that
had grown up over the past 60 years. Excessive bureaucracy was one of the
causes of Argentina's economic decline and had led to widespread corruption.
Deregulation benefited exporters, struggling with an overvalued fixed
exchange rate, with a 3 per cent improvement in competitiveness.
Charges at the port of Buenos Aires, once among the most expensive and least
efficient in the world, have fallen by up to by one-quarter. Farmers,
combatting low commodity prices as well as the exchange rate, saw a 5-8 per
cent increase in income.
Deregulation is attracting investment to industries such as mining and
fishing that were once off-limits to foreign capital.
Financial markets boomed as tax and regulatory burdens were removed. Last
year, corporate bond issues hit almost Dollars 2bn - about 16 times more
than in 1990, before deregulation. The insurance industry grew by half in
1991-92.
The authors recognise it is hard to tell exactly how much of this growth is
due specifically to deregulation and how much is to wider economic
liberalisation.
The macroeconomic impact of deregulation measured by the study appears
relatively slight, in spite of its big impact on individual sectors. The
Dollars 495m transfer to the traded goods sector is equivalent to just 0.2
per cent of gross domestic product.
However, Mr Sguiglia says the effects of deregulation are only just
beginning to be felt. Experience in other countries indicates it takes about
six years to take full effect.
The authors warn the deregulation process is still far from complete.
Argentina's competition, bankruptcy and consumer protection laws are
archaic. Remaining regulatory bodies must be strengthened. Informal
oligopolies are successfully resisting competition.
The report criticises the often improvised nature of the deregulation plan
and poor sequencing. This forced the government to retreat in some cases,
such as its attempt to limit the privileges of the pharmaceutical industry.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA's congress has finally ratified the 1967 Tlatelolco Treaty banning
nuclear weapons from Latin America, breaking with its previous conviction
that the treaty discriminated against developing countries' nuclear
programmes.
The ratification, on Wednesday night, is part of Argentina's wider,
pro-western foreign policy strategy. At US insistence, it scrapped its
Condor II missile project in 1991, considered a proliferation threat, and
has applied to join the Missile Technology Control Regime.
Argentina and Brazil had attempted to develop independent nuclear weapon
capabilities in the 1960s and 1970s, when both countries were ruled by
military governments. However, technical and financial limitations aborted
the programmes. They were formally scrapped with the return to civilian rule
in the early 1980s.
In November 1990 Argentina and Brazil agreed to bilateral procedures for
accounting for nuclear materials and inspections of each other's
installations, in addition to safeguards by the Vienna-based International
Atomic Energy Agency. They agreed to ratify Tlatelolco after its inspection
clauses were modified to protect industrial secrets.
The Foreign Ministry says Argentina also plans to sign the Nuclear
non-Proliferation Treaty, which controls nuclear materials at world levels.
Like Tlatelolco, successive civilian and military governments once
considered the NPT a discriminatory imposition of rich countries.
Argentina has two small nuclear power stations and a struggling civilian
nuclear industry. The government plans to privatise the Atucha I and Embalse
power stations as well as the Atucha II unit once construction is complete.

FT  12 NOV 93 / US public opinion swings behind Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIGHT over the North American Free Trade Agreement yesterday shifted
outside Washington to the Congressional districts of members, sampling
public opinion at home during this Veterans' Day holiday weekend.
The pro-Nafta forces, exulting over the debate victory of Vice President Al
Gore over Texan billionaire Ross Perot, hoped they had finally captured the
elusive momentum necessary to carry them to victory in the House vote next
Wednesday. A USA Today/CNN poll of debate watchers found support for the
trade pact between the US, Canada and Mexico had shot up from 34 per cent
before the debate to 57 per cent after it.
Arthur Andersen &amp; Company yesterday released a survey, by its tax and
business advisory service, which found that large majorities of executives
of medium-sized companies in Canada, Mexico and the US strongly support
Nafta.
Meanwhile in Mexico the country's Congress launched a fierce attack on Mr
Perot and other critics of its political system yesterday, in a furious
response to Mr Perot's comments in the debate.
Mr Perot claimed Mexicans were treated worse than animals and livestock in
the US, were oppressed by the government, and enjoyed few if any labour and
democratic rights. He said just 34 families owned half the country, and some
85m others lived in poverty.
The Mexican Congress issued a statement, supported by most political
parties, which said: 'We cannot ignore however, that certain judgments
expressed, apart from showing a serious ignorance for our country, attack
and offend Mexicans. We condemn them as inadmissible and without
foundation.'
US opponents of Nafta believe that fear of job and investment losses to
Mexico will outweigh any new-found enthusiasm for the pact.
'The only thing that matters is the economy,' said Mr Christopher Whalen, a
Washington trade consultant.
'The political equation still is going to be that congressmen who vote for
Nafta will have to look for other employment next year.'
Trying to blunt any momentum for the administration, Congressman David
Bonior, an anti-Nafta whip, on Wednesday announced that he had 219 of 434
members pledged to vote against the pact. However, he needs at least 10-12
votes more than the majority to prevent last-minute switches, as the
Administration increases its pressure.
The Administration this week has picked up 10 public endorsement votes, and
claims to have a total of 192. It is publishing a free 800 telephone number
with the offer to voters to send, free of charge, pro-Nafta telegrams to
their congressman.
Around the country, the opposition troops are planning rallies, marches,
town hall meetings and 'accountability meetings' with congressmen. Ms Lori
Wallach, an anti-Nafta leader, said Nafta would be won or lost in the
congressmen's home districts.
Washington will not be bereft of activity over the long weekend. The
anti-Nafta Citizens' Trade Campaign is bringing 'Nafta Claus' to the Capitol
to distribute gifts in a parody of the president's effort to sell Nafta to a
reluctant Congress.

FT  12 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Germany bids for DM3bn China deals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GERMAN industrialists are hoping to sign contracts worth up to DM3bn (Pounds
1.2bn) in China next week, when Chancellor Helmut Kohl leads a top-level
delegation for talks in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
Among the deals expected to be finalised are the purchase of six Airbus A340
aircraft, worth some DM500m, and the DM700m contract for an 18km stretch of
underground railway in Canton, to be built by a consortium headed by Siemens
and AEG.
Around half the cost of the underground railway is intended to be financed
with soft loans from the German development ministry, on the grounds that it
is not a commercial project.
A further contract, also part financed with development loans, is for DM165m
worth of railway wagons for the Chinese railway system, to be provided by
Deutsche Waggonbau, one of the biggest east German enterprises still to be
successfully privatised.
Some 40 chief executives of German companies are expected to travel with the
Chancellor on his week-long trip, including Mr Edzard Reuter, the head of
Daimler-Benz, Mr Heinrich von Pierer of Siemens, and Mr Ferdinand Piech of
Volkswagen.
Daimler-Benz' troubled Deutsche Aerospace subsidiary has been negotiating on
possible collaboration deals in satellite technology, solar collectors, and
other electronic components. Siemens, apart from its involvement in the
underground project at Guangzhou, is also hoping for major
telecommunications contracts in transmission systems, and digital mobile
telephones.
Siemens Transportation Systems will also be making a proposal to the Chinese
government to supply its ICE high-speed train system.
The German delegation is also hoping to sign new contracts for container
ships which might be built at east German shipyards, on top of an existing
contract for eight ships already signed.
Mr Kohl is to visit the VW plant in Shanghai, where the annual capacity of
100,000 Santana cars is to be increased to 150,000.
More than 100 potential new projects are under negotiation, according to the
German economics ministry, including power stations and engineering plants.
German exports to China soared by more than 85 per cent in the first half of
1993, to reach almost DM5.6bn, while Chinese exports to Germany increased by
a more modest 12 per cent to DM7.57bn, according to German figures.
The Chancellor's visit is seen as a big effort by the German government to
support German industry in a new drive for Asian markets, which officials
admit have been neglected in the past.
On departure from China, he will visit Hong Kong for talks with Mr Chris
Patten, the British governor, underlining Germany's commitment to a
'harmonious solution' between Beijing and London on the future of the
colony, according to officials in Bonn.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Aerospace is negotiating to become a partner in Sweden's latest jet
fighter, the JAS-39 Gripen, David White, Defence Correspondent, reports.
The British company has confirmed it is in discussions with Saab-Scania,
part of the Swedish consortium building the lightweight fighter, which is
already in production. A deal may involve component supplies and marketing
support. BAe was already associated in development of the Gripen, and
provided the first sets of wings.
The Gripen, described by its manufacturers as the world's first lightweight
multi-role combat aircraft, was set back by accidents involving a test
aircraft in 1989 and then the first production aircraft, which crashed in
August because of problems with its sophisticated electronic flight control
system.
Saab is a partner in the venture along with Volvo Flygmotor, Ericsson and
FFV. The consortium has firm orders for 140 of the aircraft for the Swedish
air force, for delivery between this year and 2001.
BAe, which has a strong foothold in the Middle East and Asia, would seek to
market the Gripen beyond the traditional group of Swedish military aircraft
clients, which has been restricted to other Scandinavian countries and
Austria.

talks

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SAUDI ARAMCO, the state oil producer and refiner, is negotiating with two
South East Asian oil refining groups over a potential multi-billion-dollar
joint-venture refining agreement.
The negotiations show Aramco is determined to continue its long-standing
policy of guaranteeing supplies of crude to its major markets through joint
refining deals, despite this week's cancellation of a Pounds 6.27bn project
with Japan's three leading oil refiners.
The Saudis did not reveal the names of the two South East Asian companies,
but oil officials said the talks were towards a deal of similar scale to
that which broke down this week. Saudi Aramaco is discussing the possibility
of buying into and upgrading existing refineries in the region as well as
building new plants.
The talks are understood to be well advanced.
Nippon Oil, Nikko Kyodo and Arabian Oil announced on Monday they were
pulling out of the proposed deal with Saudi Aramco and Caltex Petroleum of
the US due to the slump in demand for petroleum products resulting from
Japan's economic slowdown.
The joint venture would have purchased two existing refineries from Nippon
Oil and Nikko Kyodo, while building a third in southern Japan.
Mr Yasushi Ebihara, managing director of Nippon Oil, said his group was keen
to proceed with the project and build the new refinery 'as soon as
possible,' but Nikko Kyodo had wanted, for economic reasons, to postpone the
project.
The Saudis said the deal had fallen through over disagreements between the
Japanese partners. They denied they had welcomed its cancellation for
reasons of Saudi Arabia's own persistent budget deficits, or because Saudi
Aramco is undergoing the considerable task of merging with Samarec, the

FT  12 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Scepticism grows over access to Japan's
markets

THE Japanese government's deregulation programme has been billed as an
initiative that will add trillions of yen to domestic demand and create a
million jobs, but many foreign companies in Japan are sceptical that
tinkering with a few rules and regulations will actually open Japan's doors
to more foreign imports, writes Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo.
A group of foreign-affiliated companies' managers in Japan has launched a
scathing attack on the government's efforts to enhance access to Japan's
markets and has called on the government to take concrete measures such as
setting targets for foreign market share in specific products and
industries, in order to realise the full benefits of deregulation.
In a report published this week, the Foreign-Affiliated Companies Management
Association notes that no matter how many laws are changed, the bureaucratic
red tape that hampers foreign penetration of Japanese markets is unlikely to
change without a fundamental change in the way government offices are run
and in the attitude of public officials.
The FAMA report cites cases in which foreign companies' efforts to market
products in Japan have been thwarted by the action and attitude of
government ministries rather than by official regulations.
For example, a German-affiliated company attempting to import a new kind of
health drink to Japan was required to submit confidential product data to
Japanese customs only to be kept waiting for one year before official
approval was given. Meanwhile, a Japanese company began marketing a similar
product and the German company was forced to give up plans to sell the
product in Japan, the report states.
In another case, a European company had its application for a foreign
executive's visa held up for nearly a year because he had not gone to
university, prompting the justice ministry to view his academic background
as that of foreign blue collar workers, against whom Japan has a closed
labour policy.

FT  12 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Turks see twin danger for textiles in EU
link - John Murray Brown reports on nervousness over the shape of a customs
union planned to start in 1995
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS TURKEY and the European Union this week opened the final round of
negotiations to achieve a customs union in 1995, a potential flashpoint is
emerging in the sensitive area of textiles.
With many Turkish industries now urging the government to provide protection
beyond the deadline, clothes and cloth manufacturers are worried that
Brussels may use this as a pretext to retain quotas on textiles.
Theoretically, a customs union requires both sides to remove tariff and
non-tariff barriers to trade, which would mean the reduction of Turkish
import duties to zero and the lifting of EC textile quotas. Turkey would
also have to adopt the Union's common external tariff (CET) for third
countries and fall into line with EU trade policies.
But textiles could suffer doubly if they remained restrained from expanding
export markets in the EU, while also facing renewed competition at home from
EU imports as barriers came down. Mr Okan Oguz, chairman of the Garment
Exporters' Association says this could 'kill off large parts of our
industry'.
The issue is clearly vital for the industry, Turkey's largest foreign
exchange earner, with exports worth Dollars 5.3bn in 1992.
When first imposed in 1982, quotas only affected cotton yarn, but as Turkish
industry has matured, an increasing range of products have faced volume
curbs. The EU now places quotas on six textile and 10 apparel categories,
from cotton yarn, knitted fabric, T-shirts and knitted outwear.
The importance of textiles for Turkey's economy can hardly be overstated.
Textiles and apparel production accounts for 14 per cent of Turkey's gross
domestic product, over a fifth of manufacturing employment, and 37 per cent
of Turkey's export earnings.
Equally vital is the role of EU markets. Turkey is the largest supplier to
the Union, accounting for 10 per cent of the EU's supplies; conversely, the
EU buys 72 per cent of Turkey's total textile exports.
Commission officials say they have not received a formal request from Ankara
to reschedule the tariff cuts for any of Turkey's so-called vulnerable
sectors, although the car industry, consumer electronics and packaged foods
have been mustering support in Ankara for a reprieve.
Structurally, the textile industry appears ill-suited to mount its own
campaign. For one thing, the interests of the two branches of the industry -
the textile and apparel manufacturers - are frequently in conflict over
customs union.
Textile or fabric producers could well benefit from the adoption of the
Union's protectionist policies towards third countries. For example, last
year, Turkey took action against Pakistan over cotton yarn imports in what
was the first known case of an anti-dumping action by one developing country
against another. With a customs union, Turkish producers will have the full
EU negotiating muscle behind them. As one textile manufacturer saw the
prospect, 'this is a gift from God'.
However, for the apparel sector, restrictions on Pakistani or other cheap
imported cotton will merely add to garment producers' costs. Officials point
out that Pakistan last year shipped 8,500 tonnes of cotton yarn to Turkey,
while Pakistan's current quota into the EU as a whole is only 9,000 tonnes.
Another concern of the apparel producers, is that, while they account for
the lion's share of textile exports - apparels were worth more than Dollars
4bn in 1992 - they have little political clout, comprising as they do some
10,000 small and medium size businesses.
And yet it is the apparel companies which will be most vulnerable to
increased import competition once a customs union is in place. With Turkish
import levies at around 40 per cent, few EU fashion houses have penetrated
the Turkish market. The value of EU garment sales to Turkey last year was
worth a mere Dollars 36m, according to the Garment Exporters' Association.
But with a customs union, EU products will be able to enter Turkey duty
free.
Marks and Spencer, the UK stores group, last month announced it was looking
for a franchise partner to market clothes imported from the UK. And Turkey's
youthful and increasingly brand-conscious population is likely to attract
other international names.
Turkey's own branded products such as Vakko and Beymen could find themselves
under severe pressure.
Mrs Christiane Scrivener, the European commissioner in charge of customs, in
a speech in Istanbul last month, was careful not to commit herself on
quotas. The issue will ultimately be decided by the member states, not the
Commission. But it is no secret that Portugal, and to a lesser extent Spain,
would be only too happy to see restrictions retained on Turkish imports.

A LEADING Christian Democrat implicated in Italy's corruption scandals is
refusing to accept financial responsibility for funds collected illicitly on
behalf of the party.
The outcome will determine whether individuals or parties are liable to
repay illegally collected funds.
Mr Maurizio Prada, long-time administrator for the Christian Democrats in
Milan, is being asked by magistrates to hand back L16.9bn (Pounds 7m) which
he admits illicitly collecting from local businessmen. c
Mr Prada was arrested last year and has accepted the legal consequences for
his actions, but is refusing to accept financial liability. He has
threatened to sue the Christian Democrats if they fail to return the funds
he collected for the party.
He has detailed six sums of money, from L840m to L5.3bn, which he collected
between 1984 and 1989 on behalf of the Milan party, the regional office or
the national Christian Democrat treasury. He further alleges the party knew
that declared contributions were tiny in relation to the expense of running
a large party apparatus.
The party itself, now under new administrative control, is expected to deny
liability for past actions. At the same time the party's finances are so
depleted it would have difficulty repaying Mr Prada.
The problems of Mr Prada pall beside those of Mr Severino Citaristi, the
Christian Democrat party treasurer, who faces more than 20 charges of
receiving illicit funds totalling L100bn.
Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the head of Olivetti, was yesterday released from
house arrest. Last week Rome magistrates created a sensation by insisting on
Mr De Benedetti's formal arrest and brief entry into prison before being
interrogated for allegedly paying L10bn to obtain post office contracts for
Olivetti teleprinters and telex machines.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Italian Municipal Elections: Fear defines poll in Italy's
steel city - Jobs are Taranto's only election issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The smoke from the blast furnaces of Europe's largest steel complex always
colours a part of the sky over Taranto.
But the city's 250,000 inhabitants care little about the pollution. For
them, the sound of the blast furnaces echoing across the harbour and the
pall of foul air above their homes is a guarantee of jobs and wage packets.
Begun in 1960, the state-owned steelworks converted Taranto, in the heel of
Italy, into one of the rare zones of prosperity and job security in an
otherwise depressed mezzogiorno. It offset the declining fortunes of the
naval dockyards, falling profits from fishing, and cuts in the defence
budget, which lessened the importance of Taranto as the base for the Italian
home fleet.
Now Taranto has become one of the casualties of Europe's over-production of
steel.
Ilva, the state steel company, is being forced to rationalise and privatise
by the EU Commission in Brussels, putting a quarter of the jobs at risk -
perhaps even more if the Italian government fails in its efforts to
implement its latest privatisation plan.
'The effect is always worse when a town is based round a mono-culture,'
observes, Mr Francisco De Ponzio, head of the local branch of the
engineering workers union. He has seen jobs at the steel complex fall from a
high of 22,000 to 13,000. 'The restructuring of Ilva means 4,500 jobs will
go over the next three years in a city which already has 25 per cent
unemployment.'
The issue is dominating the forthcoming municipal elections of November 21,
forcing all the political parties to make brave talk of job protection and
special deals on new industries. The elections will take place in some 450
municipalities throughout Italy, involving a quarter of the electorate. At
stake in Taranto is whether any party can prevent the city sinking into
urban decay and the organised crime which characterises so much of southern
Italy.
'Of all the municipal elections on November 21, Taranto is the only instance
of all the force of the left uniting behind a single mayoral candidate,'
observes Mr Luciano Mineo, who is organising the campaign for the former
communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) in Taranto.
The coalition, dominated by the PDS, consists of the Greens, Radicals, the
Democratic Alliance movement, elements of the Socialist party and
Reconstructed Communism - the latter being hardline marxists that refused to
join the PDS when the Communist party broke up in 1991.
The joint left mayoral candidate is Mr Gaetano Minervini, a former
magistrate without previous political affiliations, although he is believed
to be close to the PDS.
Against him is Mr Alfengo Carlucci, a Christian Democrat former mayor backed
by Liberals, Social Democrats, Social Democrats, some Socialists and
Republicans. This represents the coalition that ruled Taranto during the
1980s, but which has been riven by divisions and corruption scandals,
forcing the administration to be disbanded 18 months ago.
The wild card is an unorthodox figure, Mr Giancarlo Cito, who owns a small
local television station. Promising a people's government, he enjoys a
degree of popularity, but has yet to overcome a whispering campaign against
the mysterious source of funds for his television station.
Meanwhile, traders in Taranto are sceptical that any city hall
administration can affect the economy since so many decisions are outside
local hands. 'Look, the decision to privatise Ilva and cut production at
Taranto wasn't even taken by an Italian government, but by Brussels,' said
one bookshop owner.
Mr Mineo, however, sees the chance to create a flagship administration in
the south. 'The nature of the governing town council is important in at
least two ways. First, it determines how Taranto's case is represented both
in Bari (the regional capital) and in Rome. Second, it determines the extent
to which the municipality is run efficiently, transparently and honestly.'
Like almost every Italian city, Taranto's finances are in a mess. The
previous administration ran up off balance sheet expenditure to the tune of
L80bn. The municipally owned transport is deficit-ridden, and incapable of
providing a competitive service. And the crumbling city looks as though it
has yet to come to terms with the Allied bombardment during the second world
war.
Whoever rules in city hall will preside over a Taranto traumatised by the
fear of a descent into joblessness. Two months ago 170 workers for
sub-contractors at the steel-works chained themselves to the production
lines in protest over job losses, and nearly brought the entire complex to a
standstill for five days. At Taranto's demonstration to mark the October 28
nationwide general strike a record 20,000 took part. 'There was only one cry
 -jobs, jobs, jobs,' said Mr De Ponzio.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE swoop by French police on suspected lslamic fundamentalists this week
was more a warning against possible future trouble than a response to any
actual terrorist threat.
Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister who gives the Balladur government
its hardline conservative edge, told parliament that the dawn arrests on
Tuesday of 88 suspected fundamentalists, mainly of Algerian origin, had
uncovered 'a number of arms, important sums of money and false identity
papers'. But the arms haul amounted to two guns and a few electronic
components that allegedly could be used in bomb-making.
Most of the 88 were released as swiftly as they had been arrested. By
yesterday, police held only three men, had confined six others to their
homes and had returned one imam (Moslem priest) to Turkey for recently
telling Le Figaro newspaper that Islamic law should take precedence over
that of France.
Police did find quantities of tracts sympathetic to the Islamic Salvation
Front (FIS) banned in Algeria. More sinister was the apparent discovery of a
copy of the same message warning French expatriates to leave Algeria which
was given to three kidnapped French consular officials on their recent
release by an FIS sister organisation, and a note of the London telex number
through which responsibility was claimed for the killing of two French
geologists in Algeria.
But the evidence is that the French government was more interested in
scaring the handful of FIS activists in France, than scared by them. Paris
does not seem to have been pushed into overt action by Algiers; the Algerian
government was apparently quite happy with the close but passive French
police surveillance of suspected FIS members over the past months.
The French authorities are very nervous at any signs of fundamentalism
spreading among France's 3m Moslems, the country's second largest religious
group, way ahead of Protestants or Jews. France weathered the 1991 Gulf war,
with its large population of Maghreb origin showing none of the objection to
French involvement which was displayed back in north Africa.
But there are home-grown reasons for the spread of Moslem fundamentalism in
France, particularly in deprived, drug-ridden suburbs where unemployed young
'Beurs' (as French-born Arabs are known) often find solace in Islam. In such
areas traditional social and political forces like the Catholic church and
the Communist party are giving way to imams and mosques. France has some 100
mosques capable of taking more than 100 worshippers, but a far larger number
 -an estimated 900 - which are simply converted suburban basements or flats.
Yet, there are very few home-trained imams - only 4 per cent of the 500 in
France, according to one estimate. At the recent opening of a Moslem
seminary, Mr Pasqua himself said he hoped more imams would be trained in
France. In the town of Nantua in south-east France from which the Turkish
imam was expelled this week, two Turkish and two Moroccan girls have been
suspended from their school for wearing 'tchadors' or head scarves. Such
girls face a cruel dilemma: ostracism at school if they wear scarves, or
ostracism at home if they do not.
Serious though these long-term integration problems are, the French
government faces a more immediate diplomatic challenge with Algeria itself.
Paris has found itself pushed from denouncing the cancellation of elections
in January 1992 to reluctantly backing the same government.
'Our interest is stability in Algeria, in democracy if possible, but not in
the arrival of fundamentalists in power there,' says one official. This
support, bolstered by a FFr1bn (Pounds 110m) credit earlier this year, is
tempered by warnings to the Algiers authorities that they must lose no more
time in embarking on political and economic reform. But the longer the
Algiers authorities drag their feet, the more France become a target of
their opponents.

A reshuffle of domestic shareholdings in French television is expected to
result from this week's bill allowing single investors to increase their
stakes from 25 to 49 per cent in a TV station, David Buchan reports from
Paris.
When TF1, France's leading TV station, was privatised, and newer private
channels such as M6 and Canal Plus were set up, the 25 per cent limit was
considered necessary to prevent a concentration of media power. But many
large investors have complained that the limit gives them financial
liability, without management control.
The bill is unlikely to change the fact that French TV is considered off
limits to foreigners.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLLAPSE of the rouble zone could save Russia more than Dollars 15bn
(Pounds 10bn) a year - but push many of the other ex-Soviet republics deeper
into economic crisis, possibly provoking political unrest, experts in the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank said yesterday.
The comments mark the first acknowledgement that the Russian rouble zone has
all but collapsed over the last two weeks, with seven republics now having
left, or announced their intention to leave.
Their moves are partly a result of the tough new conditions which Russia is
imposing on its former CIS partners, demanding that the republics should be
subservient to Russia's central bank rules, and deposit gold and hard
currency reserves with it, to end the subsidies which the republics have
been receiving.
Experts in the IMF and World Bank calculate the loss of cheap credits and
subsidised energy will cost the republics involved - Ukraine, Moldova,
Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and
Uzbekistan - Dollars 15.5bn a year. Given that many are already in economic
crisis, the moves could trigger unrest which could affect the 25m ethnic
Russians living in these republics, officials added.
Russia tightened its conditions for membership in the rouble zone in
September, immediately after the banning of the Russian parliament.
The savings in credits to Russia in the coming year will mean that almost 15
per cent of its estimated gross national product will be available for its
own use - though at the cost of deepening crises on its borders.
The republics which will be most affected include:
Ukraine, the focus of the most international concern and where inflation is
estimated to be about 70 per cent a month, has repeatedly devalued its
temporary karbovanets currency. Efforts at reforms in the country have been
put aside in favour of so far unsuccessful policies of state regulation.
Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, are formerly loyal members of the rouble zone. On
Wednesday President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan and President Islam
Karimov of Uzbekistan announced they would jointly issue their own
currencies, the Kazakh tenge and Uzbek coupons, a decision which has caused
a crash in the old (pre-1993) Russian roubles they were using.
Armenia, the most desperate of all ex-Soviet republics, says it cannot meet
the Russian conditions because it has almost no hard currency or gold
reserves, and has no means to stop the economy's slide into chaos. Few
industries are working and with minimal energy supplies another freezing
winter is approaching.
Georgia and Azerbaijan are hard hit by internal conflicts and the cost of
looking after hundreds of thousands of refugees. They have their own
currency coupons, but they are highly inflationary, especially Georgia's.

SERB forces yesterday released two Bosnian government bodyguards, who were
abducted from a UN armoured car, prompting Sarajevo authorities to resume
the evacuation of Serb civilians from the besieged capital.
UN officials said the two guards from the Bosnian interior ministry, who had
been escorting the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Sarajevo but were seized by
Serb gunmen and held for three days, were handed over to UN mediators at
Lukavica, the Serbian garrison on the outskirts of Sarajevo.
But while Serb commanders appeared to cave in to UN pressure to free the two
men, UN officials yesterday said they continued to block the passage of
humanitarian aid to Moslem enclaves designated as UN 'safe areas'.
Belgrade economists say inflation is running at 0.5 per cent an hour,
spurning claims by the government of brighter economic prospects.

FT  12 NOV 93 / UK bucks trend of plunging sales of new cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent

<TEXT>
WEST European new car sales fell by an estimated 15.1 per cent in October to
902,000.
Demand has dropped sharply for 10 months in succession, as the European
motor industry suffers its steepest sales decline of the post-war period.
New car sales in the first 10 months of the year declined by 15.3 per cent
to 9.8m, according to industry estimates, with 1.76m fewer cars sold so far
this year than in the corresponding period of 1992.
Much of the industry is operating at a loss as carmakers take drastic action
to reduce production and cut jobs.
New car sales in October were lower than a year ago in 13 of 17 markets
across western Europe, with demand growing only in the UK and in
Scandinavia.
In the first 10 months of the year sales were lower than a year ago in 15 of
17 markets across west Europe, with demand growing only in the UK and
marginally in Norway.
There was little sign of the recession easing in any of the large volume
markets with the exception of the UK.
New car sales in Germany fell by an estimated 18.7 per cent in October
compared with the decline of 18.6 per cent in the first 10 months.
In Italy sales fell by 19.7 per cent in October compared with a decline of
22.1 per cent in the first 10 months of the year, while in Spain a decline
of 22.8 per cent in October compared with a drop of 25.1 per cent in the
first 10 months. The pace of decline in France was little changed, with a
drop of 17.6 per cent year-on-year in October and of 17.3 per cent in the
first 10 months.
The UK remains the only significant market in west Europe, where new car
sales are rising - albeit from a depressed level - with an increase
year-on-year of 15.5 per cent in October and of 12.1 per cent in the first
10 months.
Sales in the UK are being boosted by the most aggressive marketing campaigns
ever mounted, as carmakers seek to gain a larger share of the only growth
market.
Among the volume carmakers, the Volkswagen group of Germany and the Fiat
group of Italy have lost most ground this year, with sales plunging by
around 21 per cent in the first 10 months.
Rover group, the vehicles subsidiary of British Aerospace, is the only
significant carmaker in Europe to have increased its sales volume. It has
been helped by the increase in the UK market and a strong performance -
albeit from a small base - in the contracting markets of Germany, Italy and
France.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Philips leads call for more EU innovation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   EINDHOVEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EXECUTIVES from some of Europe's leading industrial groups yesterday called
for more intensive co-operation between governments, the European
Commission, scientists and industry to fight technological competition from
Japan and the US.
'We are pleading with Europe to help us succeed,' Mr Jan Timmer, Philips
president, told industrialists at a symposium in Eindhoven. 'We will play
our part and do our duty, but we can't sit still.'
Philips called for round-table discussions between government, universities
and industry to identify the key technologies Europe will need to compete in
the growing 'multimedia' sector, which will bring together computer,
telecoms, consumer electronics and media groups.
'These are areas that can only be tackled when several companies and
governments get together,' said Mr Timmer. He criticised European
governments for 'not getting their act together' over European
high-definition television. Ambitious plans for HDTV, in which Philips has
invested heavily, were shelved in favour of a diluted project this summer.
Executives from SGS-Thomson Micro Electronics, the Italian-French
state-owned semiconductor producer, and Renault-Volvo, the Franco-Swedish
car manufacturer, supported Philips' call for support from public
authorities, in the form of intensified research programmes aimed at key
technologies and backing for strategic alliances.
Mr Pasquale Pistorio, president and chief executive of SGS-Thomson, said
advanced industrial societies 'cannot exist without controlled access to an
advanced electronics industry, which in turn cannot exist without controlled
access to an advanced semiconductor industry'.
Public authorities, semiconductor users and manufacturers had to work
together to achieve such a goal, he said. Mr Pistorio said national and
European authorities should promote tax incentives for research and
development, and concentrate R&amp;D funding on large companies, 'the existence
of which is an indispensable pre-condition for the viability of smaller
ones'.
Mr Martin Bangemann, European industry commissioner, said the European Union
could play a role in helping to change the structure of traditional European
industry - for example, by liberalising the telecommunications sector.
Philips had invited industrialists, government and European Commission
officials to celebrate the opening of a new exhibition of the company's
technology near the group's headquarters in Eindhoven.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Superdrug may take scent battle to Brussels: MMC says
'complex monopoly' is not against the public interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPERDRUG, the UK discount drugstore chain, threatened yesterday to take its
campaign to sell cut-price fragrances to Brussels, after UK competition
authorities rejected the com-pany's complaint that perfume manufacturers
were unfairly refusing to supply it.
A Monopolies and Mergers Commission report said although a 'complex
monopoly' existed among the perfume houses, it did not operate against the
public interest. The report said only small changes were needed to ensure
free competition in the UK market, worth Pounds 230m at wholesale prices
last year.
The report was welcomed by perfume manufacturers and some retailers,
including Boots, the biggest outlet for perfumes in the UK. However, the
decision was criticised by one perfume house, consumer organisations,
Superdrug and other retailers.
'The MMC has swallowed the perfume companies' arguments hook, line and
sinker,' the Consumers' Association said. Asda, the supermarket chain which
also sells cut-price fragrances, expressed 'amazement and anger' and accused
the commission of yielding to special pleading by perfume houses.
Worth Fragrances, a small perfume manufacturer which recently agreed to
supply Superdrug, said it was unhappy with the decision. It said consumers
should not be made to pay inflated prices, which could only damage the
perfume industry.
Superdrug, part of the Kingfisher retail group, said the report failed to
address its central objections to the perfume houses' marketing methods.
The company said it was considering renewing its complaints with the
European Commission, which has recently approved arrangements which allow
perfume manufacturers to sell their products only through designated
wholesalers and retailers.
Although the MMC concluded that manufacturers had not used these
arrangements to keep prices artificially high, Superdrug said stronger
policing was needed to ensure that the rules were applied fairly.
Superdrug sells a limited range of fragrances at discounts of about 30 per
cent in 60 of its stores. Because leading manufacturers have refused to
supply it directly, the company has been forced to buy all its products from
unauthorised sources on the 'grey' market.
It said yesterday that it would continue discount sales, but the MMC's
decision meant it could not obtain enough supplies to sell perfumes at all
its stores. The MMC report said the perfume industry was a 'complex
monopoly' because all the leading manufacturers restricted supplies to
authorised retailers and recommended resale prices. However, it found no
evidence that these arrangements operated against the public interest.
The MMC accepted manufacturers' arguments that the commercial success of
perfumes depended on heavy marketing investments and high prices to create
an aura of exclusivity and snob value.
It suggested the perfume houses should establish an independent arbitration
scheme to deal with complaints from retailers.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Opening of tunnel rail link may be delayed until 2002
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pounds 2.6bn Channel tunnel rail link is to suffer a further delay as a
result of the public spending squeeze and a decision announced yesterday to
involve private sector companies from the outset.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, announced plans to bring the private
sector into the project before legislation goes through parliament despite
fears that this would delay completion by up to 12 months until at least
2002.
Involvement of private sector companies at a very early stage will allow
them to influence the design of the project. But it goes against advice from
Union Railways, the company which has been developing the link, which wanted
political uncertainties out of the way before involving the private sector.
Trafalgar House, the construction group, said it welcomed the chance to
become involved in the project at an early stage, although the way in which
risk was shared between the public and private sectors would determine
private sector interest. The company has revived its Eurorail subsidiary, a
joint venture with BICC and General Electric Company, to look at this and
other rail projects.
In an attempt to improve the appeal of the project, the government said it
would include European Passenger Services, the company that will operate
international trains between London Waterloo, Paris and Brussels, in the
project. This would give it a stream of revenue during construction.
Companies which want to join a consortium to build the link will be invited
in January to pre-qualify, and the tender documents will be sent out in the
spring. Hill Samuel, the merchant bank which is advising the government, had
met 'a great deal of interest', Mr MacGregor said.
The timetable announced by him yesterday indicates a further slippage in the
legislative and construction programme. A final decision on the route will
not be taken until early next year - December had earlier been suggested as
the deadline - and work preparing a hybrid bill will take at least until the
autumn of 1994, and possibly into 1995.
Getting the bill through parliament is expected to take 18 months and
construction work is then expected to take another five years.
Sir Keith Speed, a former minister whose Ashford constituency is affected by
the rail link, said: 'I am frankly appalled. The last think we want after
six years of bumbling from the Department of Transport is further delay.'
Private companies will be asked to bid for the amount of government money
they require, although the government is limited by the Channel tunnel
legislation to helping to finance parts of the project which contribute to
domestic rail services.

FT  12 NOV 93 / Euro Disney shares fall further 15%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING, MARTIN DICKSON and OUR FINANCIAL STAFF

SHARES IN Euro Disney plunged further yesterday, losing more than 15 per
cent of their value on the London stock market as investors displayed
increasing anxiety about the crisis at the theme-park operator.
Yesterday's falls followed a similar decline on Wednesday when the company
announced it had lost FFr5.3bn (Pounds 610m) in its first full year of
operation.
The losses, largely the result of exceptional charges, raised fears that the
EuroDisneyland theme park in the eastern outskirts of Paris would be unable
to survive without a refinancing deal with its shareholders and banks.
The continued decline in the share price, which closed yesterday down 68p at
368p, will complicate plans for a rights issue, regarded as one of the most
plausible options in a capital restructuring. 'At the current share price
they would need something like a one-for-one issue to raise the necessary
funds,' said Mrs Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, hotels and leisure analyst at
Morgan Stanley.
Moody's Investors Service, the credit information agency, said it had placed
the long-term debt ratings of Walt Disney, the US entertainment group which
owns 49 per cent of the European leisure company, under review for a
possible downgrade.
It said this was prompted by concern that the acceleration of losses at Euro
Disney could result in deterioration of debt protection measurements for
Walt Disney bondholders. Moody's currently rates Disney's senior unsecured
notes at Aa3.
Moody's said Walt Disney might inject significant extra funds into Euro
Disney to preserve its image and trademark, which could result in an
increase in the company's overall risk profile.
Financial restructuring talks are under way between Euro Disney, its
bankers, and Walt Disney. The talks may be a test of nerve as Euro Disney's
bankers press Walt Disney to inject fresh capital into Euro Disney in return
for subscribing to a share issue or renegotiating the terms of their loans.
About 60 banks are owed some FFr21bn by Euro Disney. The biggest lenders are
French, including the Caisse des Depots, the state investment institution,
Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque Indosuez.
Also involved in arranging Euro Disney's syndicated loans are Citibank,
Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and LTCB of Japan. Three UK banks, National
Westminster, Barclays and Midland, also participated in loans. Bankers are
expected to press for a reduction in royalty and management fees paid to
Walt Disney by Euro Disney, as well as a reduction in interest payments on
the FFr4.8bn loan extended by the Caisse des Depots. The banks are likely to
prefer an injection of new equity next spring - by which time the
restructuring is due to be complete - rather than a debt for equity swap.
Despite their concern that Walt Disney should play a significant part in the
capital restructuring, the French banks will face political pressure to
ensure that EuroDisneyland remains open.
Walt Disney has agreed to provide funds for Euro Disney until next spring.
It is reluctant to bail out its associate, but is concerned to avoid the
damage to its image that would result from failure. Industry observers doubt
that the theme park will close. 'The negotiations will go to the wire, but

FT  12 NOV 93 / Treasury set to force severe cuts in sick pay subsidy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY is set to force through draconian cuts in the government's
contribution to statutory sick pay, raising the prospect of a significant
increase in employers' labour costs.
In recent weeks, the Treasury has been pressing Mr Peter Lilley, the social
security secretary, to abolish entirely the Pounds 710m state subsidy to
employers when staff go on sick leave.
Whitehall officials believe Mr Lilley has managed to resist complete
abolition of the subsidy, arguing that the government is publicly committed
to containing industry's costs.
But they think the Treasury has forced him to slash the subsidy from 80 per
cent of an employer's total costs to 'well below' 60 per cent in the run-up
to the Budget, to be delivered by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, in less
than three weeks.
The change, which will be fiercely opposed by industry, will require
legislation in the forthcoming session of parliament, risking renewed unrest
on Tory backbenches.
In recent weeks, the Treasury has pressed for abolition of the sick pay
subsidy altogether in an attempt to limit the outgoings of the Department of
Social Security, Whitehall's biggest spending ministry.
In the longer term, ministers also want to shift the cost of sick pay from
the government to employers, and to encourage employees to take out private
insurance policies.
However, cuts in the subsidy will trigger increased costs for industry at
the same time as many businesses are trying to emerge from the recession.
The Confederation of British Industry, which has not been consulted by
ministers on this issue, says it would be extremely concerned if the
government went ahead with the cuts. The issue is certain to be raised at
next week's CBI conference in Harrogate. Employers were able to claim the
entire cost of sick pay from the state until 1991, when the subsidy was cut
to 80 per cent. But in March the government admitted that it was considering
further reforms.
Whitehall officials have acknowledged that they would need to limit some of
the extra costs to industry by combining a reduction in the sick pay subsidy
with tax breaks for business. 'If you are going ahead with big cuts, you
would have to find some other way to compensate employers,' said one
official yesterday.
However, officials also said that ministers were leaning away from
legislation which would provide different levels of subsidy for certain
employers, on the grounds that such a system would be too complex and
expensive to administer.

FT  11 NOV 93 / (CORRECTED) International Bonds: Dealers criticise pricing
of Hydro-Quebec Pounds 200m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 12th November 1993) appended to this article.
DESPITE a heavy flow of deals across a wide range of currencies yesterday,
dealers said supply was likely to start abating soon.
Among a variety of small- to medium-sized deals, Hydro-Quebec launched a
Pounds 200m five-year issue via SG Warburg.
Dealers said there was still appetite for sterling paper among overseas and
domestic investors, particularly at the shorter end of the market.
There has been a lack of supply in the five-year area, due to unattractive
swap conditions, and the only issues on offer have generally provided only a
small yield spread over the gilts market.
However, the Hydro-Quebec deal was criticised for its aggressive pricing.
The launch spread of 60 basis points over the 7 1/4 per cent gilt due 1998
was described as several basis points too tight. Although political worries
about Quebec have eased, Hydro-Quebec's credit rating has slipped to A1 from
Moody's and to A- from Standard and Poor's.
At the end of trading, the deal was being offered at a yield spread of 62
basis points over the curve.
In the Canadian dollar sector, the spate of longer-dated deals continued,
with a CDollars 250m 10-year deal for Credit Local de France via IBJ
International, and a 15-year deal for the European Investment Bank via Wood
Gundy. Investors have been searching further along the steep Canadian bond
yield curve for higher returns.
Although the Credit Local deal was launched at a spread of 18 basis points
over the 10-year government bond, the spread over the interpolated yield
curve between 10 and 30 years was only about three basis points.
Consequently, the deal was more attractive to retail investors, who like the
7 per cent coupon, than to institutional buyers.
IN the Yankee bond market, Zeneca Group, the bioscience business demerged
from ICI, launched its second bond issue on Tuesday. It was a Dollars 300m
offering of 30-year bonds, arranged by Goldman Sachs. A Dollars 300m 10-year
Yankee bond deal was completed in June.
The proceeds of both deals will be used to repay the bulk of Zeneca's
Dollars 850m debt to ICI, which falls due in January. The balance will be
drawn from existing funds.
Deutsche Bundespost, the German post office, has established a DM2bn
medium-term note programme, arranged by Deutsche bank.
CORRECTION
HYDRO-Quebec's debt is rated A+ by Standard &amp; Poor's, not A- as stated in
Thursday's paper.

FT  11 NOV 93 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Family agrees SR6bn
aid package for Saudi bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 12th November 1993) appended to this article.
THE FAMILY shareholders of National Commercial Bank, the biggest bank in
Saudi Arabia in terms of assets, have agreed to inject SR6bn (Dollars 1.6bn)
in a rescue package that has enabled the bank to publish its first accounts
for four years.
The accounts, published yesterday, reflect a victory for the Bin Mahfouz
family and majority shareholders who want to restore the bank's reputation
after a series of damaging court actions.
The family is also anxious to draw a veil over the connections of its former
chief operating officer, Sheikh Kahlid Bin Mahfouz with the collapsed Bank
of Credit and Commerce International.
NCB, the kingdom's only private bank and which holds all the Saudi royal
family accounts, produced an operating income in 1992 of SR3.48bn, 41 per
cent down on 1991's SR5.87bn.
The accounts show that total assets dipped from SR78bn in 1991 to SR26bn in
1992, attributable mainly to the closure of NCB branches in London, New York
and Grand Cayman.
The injection of the fresh capital, however, has enabled the capital
adequacy to be raised to 14 per cent, compared to an 8 per cent level set
for commercial banks by the Bank for International Settlements.
Mr Omar Bajamal, chairman of the credit policy committee said earnings,
which had been hit by loan write-offs, would 'improve substantially'.
The accounts note that lawsuits have been filed against the bank outside the
kingdom. One of the lawsuits has been launched by Touche Ross on behalf of
BCCI creditors.
Separately, Sheikh Kahlid has been indicted in the US on fraud charges in
connection with BCCI where he was a former shareholder. The indictment was
issued by Mr Robert Morgantheau, the New York District attorney.
CORRECTION
TOTAL assets of Saudi Arabia's National Commercial Bank stood at SR63.7bn in
1992, and not SR26bn as stated in some editions yesterday.

SHARES in Charles Sidney, the Yorkshire-based Mercedes-Benz commercial
vehicle and passenger car dealer spun off by Albert Fisher, ended the first
day of trading at their offer price of 210p yesterday.
Trading in the stock was described as 'turbulent' with about 6.8m
transactions and the price ranging between a low of 85p and a high of 210p
towards the close.
The group came to the market through a full placing and public offer.
Over 13.6m shares were placed with institutional and other investors by
Panmure Gordon and the public offer of a further 10m shares was 2.7 times
subscribed.
Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution group, has divested
Charles Sidney as part of a strategy to refocus the group on its core
activities.
CORRECTION
Shares in Charles Sidney, the Yorkshire-based Mercedes-Benz commercial

FT  11 NOV 93 / US agrees next stage of Concorde project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBAI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US has given the go-ahead to the next stage of the programme to build a
supersonic airliner to replace the ageing Anglo-French Concorde.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration will start work next year
on the second phase to develop the airframe, propulsion and systems
technologies over seven years at an expected cost of Dollars 1.2bn, Mr Lewis
Williams, Nasa's director of high speed research, said yesterday at the
Dubai Air Show.
The aircraft, planned to enter service early in the next century, will have
twice Concorde's 3,000 nautical mile range, carry 300 passengers - three
times Concorde's capacity - and operate at close to standard subsonic air
fares.
Nasa began research in 1990, evaluating environmental considerations,
including atmospheric effects, nitrogen oxide engine emissions, noise and
sonic boom. That first phase, costing about Dollars 400m, has shown the
aircraft to be 'environmentally compatible', said Mr Williams.
'We had to ensure that the environmental issues could be resolved before
embarking on the second stage of research,' he added.
Although other government agencies, aircraft manufacturers and engine-makers
elsewhere are collaborating on the supersonic aircraft study, the US appears
to be taking a far more active role in research. Nasa's annual high-speed
research budget has just been increased from Dollars 117m this year to
Dollars 197m in 1994, although the agency had asked for Dollars 187m for
next year.
The US is keen to catch up with the European aerospace industry's expertise
and experience in supersonic airliner development through Concorde. However,
any future aircraft is expected to involve broad international co-operation
because it is widely accepted that the market will bear only one programme.
Mr Williams argued that a 300-seat supersonic aircraft offering passengers
fares similar or slightly higher than for subsonic travel would compete
effectively against the new 600-seat subsonic super jumbo conventional
airliners which the aerospace industry is now studying.

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, yesterday set out his game-plan for completing the Uruguay Round
of global trade talks by the agreed deadline of December 15.
He told a meeting of the overseer Trade Negotiations Committee that 'all
negotiations on substance' would have to be concluded by that date, which
marks the expiry of US negotiating authority.
Mr Sutherland rebuked negotiators for wasting time 'on arcane technical
points of doubtful importance' and warned against the temptation to leave
important concessions until the last possible moment.
He said yesterday the TNC would meet at least once a week under his
chairmanship to steer the talks. He will chair 'very frequent informal
open-ended meetings' of top negotiators to tackle outstanding issues and
blockages.
He urged greater efforts to achieve 'substantial results' by November 15.
Final country schedules setting out market-opening measures for services are
due by November 26.
Mr Sutherland said revised texts on creation of a Multilateral Trade
Organisation and improved dispute settlement procedures would be ready by
next Monday.

THE government of Macedonia yesterday arrested several ethnic Albanians,
including two deputy ministers in the coalition government, on charges of
preparing an armed rebellion.
Macedonian police yesterday renewed their clampdown on Gostivar and Tetovo,
mostly ethnic Albanian towns.
The move could shatter the fragile ethnic co-existence between Albanians and
Macedonians in the former Yugoslav republic, where Albanians comprise at
least 20 per cent of the 2m population.
Mr Hisen Haskaj, the deputy defence minister, and Mr Imer Imeri, the deputy
health minister, were arrested and charged with organising a paramilitary
unit and preparing an armed rebellion, said Macedonian radio.
The radio said 300 automatic rifles were discovered in a police raid, and
claimed the rebellion had been planned by a political party with close ties
with ethnic Albanians in the neighbouring province of Kosovo, southern
Serbia.
Meanwhile in Sarajevo, three children were killed and about 15 were
critically wounded in a mortar bomb attack in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital.
Sarajevo radio said two adults were killed and 30 wounded by shelling in
another mortar attack in the city besieged by Serbs since April 1992. The
assault comes just one day after nine people, including four children and
their teacher, were killed by mortar bombs.
Bosnian Croats and Moslems have asked Turkey to help end fierce fighting
between their forces, the Turkish foreign ministry said yesterday. Reuter
reports from Ankara. The ministry said Mr Hikmet Cetin, the foreign
minister, was preparing to fly to Sarajevo.

   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW coalition government has been formed in Slovakia between prime
minister Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and the
Slovak National Party (SNS) led by Mr Ludovit Cernak, a former economy
minister.
The agreement follows months of wrangling between the two parties after
their earlier coalition collapsed last spring. It will end a period of
growing political uncertainty overshadowed by calls from the left wing
opposition for early elections to resolve the crisis.
New ministers were sworn in yesterday by president Michal Kovac, including
Mr Jan Ducky, a former president of the Slovak Industry Confederation, as
economy minister.
Mr Ducky worked in the industry ministry under the former regime, then
became industry minister for nine months after the 1989 revolution that
ended communist rule.
Mr Julius Toth, a close ally of Mr Meciar, remains as finance minister. Mr
Meciar will retain control of the privatisation ministry.
The combined representation of the HZDS with 66 seats in the 150-seat
parliament, and the SNS with 14 seats, will give the new coalition a clear
majority. Few policy changes are expected.

FT  11 NOV 93 / IMF 'is missing its big chance'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund has been accused of 'missing the
opportunity' to assist Russian reform.
Prof Jeffrey Sachs, an adviser to the Russian government and a long-time foe
of IMF policy towards Russia, said in Moscow: 'The IMF should now be
negotiating with the Russians on a plan to go into effect at the beginning
of next year to make the rouble convertible and to stabilise the economy.
The time has never been better - but there are no preparations.'
Professor Sachs, who has been close to Russian reform for the past two
years, said that the political position had fundamentally altered since the
banning of the Russian parliaments. The reformists were now being backed by
presidential decrees, and a reformist government was likely to follow next
month's parliamentary elections.
'The IMF was told this year to spend Dollars 13bn on Russian reform: it has
so far spent Dollars 1.5bn. Its mandate is to help reform. They must not let
this chance slip away.'

European Union membership on January 1 1995 for Austria, Finland, Norway and
Sweden, is 'an ambitious but feasible' target, provided all parties are
fully committed to the negotiations, Mr Wolfgang Schussel, Austria's economy
minister, said in Vienna yesterday, writes Patrick Blum in Vienna.
This will require completing EU entry negotiations by March 1, to allow
enough time for the European parliament to approve the four countries'
membership before European elections due in June. For Austria, keeping to
the timetable is especially important because the country must hold a
referendum on membership in July at the latest. This is to avoid a clash
with the general election scheduled in October.

A controversial proposal to extend full voting rights and special
parliamentary representation to Italians living outside Italy has failed to
pass through the senate, writes Robert Graham in Rome.
The draft law required a two-thirds majority since it involved altering the
constitution. But yesterday those in favour of the proposal only mustered
148 votes against the 163 votes necessary. The proposal will now be put on
ice for three months, then it will be up to President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro
to decide whether to call a national referendum on the issue.

FT  11 NOV 93 / 'Hans van den Brittan' ends the Brussels feud
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR HANS van den Broek, the European commissioner responsible for external
political affairs, yesterday dropped his resignation threats and agreed to a
truce in his long-running power struggle with Sir Leon Brittan, the
Commission's chief trade negotiator, writes Lionel Barber.
Mr van den Broek, the former Dutch foreign minister, was on the brink of
quitting until a last-minute compromise brokered by Mr Jacques Delors, the
Commission president. Under the deal, Mr van den Broek will take over
management responsibility for the European Union's overseas delegations and
will have a share in appointing Brussels civil servants to the 110 offices
abroad.
Mr Delors is said to be upset by the bickering between Sir Leon and Mr van
den Broek who are both political heavyweights.
Other commissioners have found the feuding a source of amusement - one
insider's joke is that the only satisfactory way to separate the foreign
affairs portfolio is to create a new commissioner called 'Mr Hans van den
Brittan'. However, the Dutchman has failed in his wider gambit to put all
overseas staff under the umbrella of DG1 A, his own Brussels directorate.
Sir Leon and Mr van den Broek have been battling over the division of their
responsibilities ever since they took up their posts 10 months ago. During
the latest row, Sir Leon argued that it would be illogical to make all
overseas personnel responsible to Mr van den Broek since 80 per cent of the
EU's work deals with trade and commerce.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Pohl sees jobs crisis as main European task
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'THE REAL issue' facing Europe is the task of reducing unemployment,
combined with the challenge of opening the west of the continent to the
former eastern bloc, Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the former Bundesbank president,
said last night.
The objective of the Maastricht Treaty for establishing fixed exchange rates
and a common monetary policy in Europe was no longer the main priority. 'The
question of whether the Maastricht Treaty will ever be implemented is open,
to say the least.' But conditions for economic and monetary union were 'much
less favourable' than in the 1980s.
Mr Pohl voiced doubts over whether the anti-inflation consensus espoused by
the treaty would prove durable in view of the 'tremendous problems' facing
Europe.
These included the consequences of German unification, where he pointed to
errors over the introduction of the D-Mark into east Germany in 1990 and a
wrong mixture of budgetary and monetary policies as contributing to high
German interest rates after unity.
German unemployment, now officially 3.5m, was the highest since the great
depression of the 1930s. But German unemployment was nearer 5m-6m if hidden
joblessness were included. 'It's obvious this is the real issue; it's the
same problem in Spain or France.'
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will deliver a government statement on Europe
today in the wake of a controversy triggered by sceptical comments on
European union from a key conservative ally, Reuter reports from Bonn.
Mr Kohl has so far not reacted directly to remarks by Bavaria's state
premier Edmund Stoiber that his vision of Europe is outdated, and that the
goal of a federal Europe, almost holy writ in post-war German foreign
policy, should be abandoned.
But Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said in an interview in yesterday Express
newspaper that Mr Stoiber's comments 'did us damage, and not just a little.
My colleagues ..are worried Germany could be departing from the common goals
of the Community.'

FT  11 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Euro Disney shock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The announcement of colossal losses at Euro Disney triggered a wave of
selling in both the UK and French markets. Such was the rush to offload the
shares that they were momentarily suspended in Paris. In London, share
prices on trading screens were marked indicative only - where marketmakers
are not obliged to trade at displayed prices.
At their worst the shares were off more than Pounds 1, although they later
improved to finish at 436p, down 72 on the day.
The excitement followed the revelation of around Pounds 620m losses and the
prospect of a large restructuring. Euro Disney has begun discussions with
Walt Disney, its parent company, over a financial rescue package.
However, Mr Nigel Reed at Paribas, an arch bear of the stock, believes the
shares should still be sold with shareholders facing heavy dilution given
the probability of a rights issue. 'We believe that after the write-offs
today, the net asset value per share is now so low that shareholders are not
in a strong position in any eventual restructuring,' he said.
Hambros, the merchant bank, suffered the same fate as SG Warburg, the
sector's leading stock, as the bank's shares tumbled in the face of a steep
rise in profits and a good increase in the interim dividend. 'The figures
were below the very best expectations and that is why the shares are down,'
said one analyst.
Market forecasts for Hambros' profits had topped the Pounds 45m mark and
dividend expectations had ranged up to around the 4.6p level. In the event,
the bank produced profits of Pounds 41.1m and a dividend of 4.5p.
At the close, Hambros shares were 24 lower at 344p on good turnover of 1.8m.
SG Warburg, the UK's premier merchant bank, and which produced scintillating
interim figures on Tuesday, continued to run into bouts of profit-taking,
ending 9 cheaper at 848p.
Dealers said Warburg Securities was largely responsible for big gains in the
banking issues and a bullish note on the sector was thought to be imminent.
Barclays was the best performer in the leaders, closing 11 higher at 573p on
good turnover of 5.4m shares, while National Westminster added 6 at 553p on
5.8m.
Royal Insurance was the outstanding composite insurer, advancing 9 to 314p
ahead of today's third-quarter numbers, which are forecast to show profits
in excess of Pounds 115m against a loss of Pounds 83m during the same period
last year. Commercial Union, aggressively bought by Hoare Govett, ran up 12
to 612p, while Sun Alliance, where Morgan Stanley was said to have been a
substantial buyer of stock, firmed 4 to 370p.
British Steel improved 1 3/4 to 123 1/2 p with turnover reaching 14m after a
big bullish trade, said to have been executed by SG Warburg, in traded
options. Meanwhile, the Bank of New York announced that the holding of
British Steel shares in the US had reached 14.84 per cent.
ICI retreated 12 to 698p after weakness in New York on Tuesday night. The
company's ADR shares had fallen Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 41 5/8 on Wall
Street.
Amersham International, the health and scientific equipment group, slipped
11 to 927p in spite of a seemingly dramatic profits rise. Headline half-year
profits increased by 71 per cent but were skewed by a Pounds 5.6m currency
gain. Mr Paul Woodhouse of Smith New Court said: 'Growth is solid but I am
not sure it supports a p/e of 17 times.' Hoare Govett remains a buyer,
arguing that Amersham is an 'outstanding growth stock and still
inexpensive'.
Suggestions that one of the market's leading agency brokers had attempted
and failed to place a large block of Burmah Castrol shares in the market
late on Tuesday triggered a sharp marking down of the company's stock price
at the outset of trading. It failed to stage any recovery thereafter,
finishing 14 down at 753p after unremarkable turnover of 536,000 shares.
'With a supposed overhang of around Pounds 20m of stock, it is not
surprising the shares have come under pressure,' said an oils specialist.
Burmah shares have come under downside pressure since Nomura, the
stockbroker, published a bearish note on the stock last week.
Mirror Group Newspapers shrugged off concern over its publication of photos
of Princess Diana and the shares recovered 3 to 154p. It was announced that
Mr David Montgomery, MGN's chief executive, had bought an extra 25,000
shares in the company, taking his holding to 100,333. The company said he
paid 151.5p a share.
There was another upward move by Forte, dealers attributing the rise to a
buyer of around 2m shares leaving the market short. The stock advanced 5 to
229p. Granada Group was lifted by News Corporation's figures on BSkyB, the
shares climbing 6 to 473p.
Among food issues, Cadbury-Schweppes was helped by a buy note from Smith New
Court, one of the broker's few recommendations in a friendless sector. The
shares added 8 1/2 at 465 1/2 p.
Northern Foods was said to have suffered a downgrade at the hands of Hoare
Govett. The shares came off 6 to 222p. Elsewhere, Unilever appreciated 3 to
1130p ahead of results due tomorrow.
Food retailers were again under duress, dealers reporting no let-up in the
downward buying pressure. Argyll Group lost 6 to 251p, Kwik Save 8 to 599p
and Tesco 5 to 179p.
Stores group Allders gained 14 on its debut, closing at 184p.
Traffic figures from BAA saw the shares advance 10 to 899p. The airport
operator reported a 7.9 per cent jump from its three London airports for
October, well ahead of the forecast industry rate.
This was said to have had some effect on the rise in Owners Abroad, 4 higher
at 82p. However, the shares continued to be plagued yester-day with rumours
of a rights issue and problems at its airline division.

FT  11 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Unigate brightens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Half-year profits from Unigate provided the only bright spot in a food
manufacturing sector undermined by a broker's gloomy forecasts.
Smith New Court predicted a further deterioration in trading conditions in
reiterating its 'underweight' stance. Unigate's figures were at the top end
of market forecasts, although there were some one-off benefits and
specialists said underlying growth levels reflected the increasingly
difficult environment. The shares, however, responded positively, advancing
6 to 371p. Analysts left their full-year forecasts largely unchanged.
In its latest note, Smith attributes its negative stance to pricing
pressures from powerful supermarket chains and the disappearance of food
price inflation. It said its earnings growth forecast for the sector of
around 8 per cent was likely to be dramatically reduced if supermarket price
discounting became a permanent fixture. On Tuesday, the broker's food retail
research team slashed its sector forecast to virtually nil for the 1994-95
period.

FT  11 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: NatPower sees heavy selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MARKET registered its disappointment with interim results from National
Power by marking the shares sharply lower in the face of some aggressive
selling pressure.
NatPower's half-time profits came in at Pounds 250m, including an
exceptional gain of Pounds 45m, but in 'clean' form were at the bottom of
market expectations which were mostly in the region of Pounds 210m to Pounds
220m.
Dealers said the profits were below consensus and therefore always liable to
trigger selling pressure. They added that the market was also upset by a
slightly disappointing dividend payment. 'The market was going for a
dividend increase of up to 18 per cent and got 14 per cent, which means the
shares go down,' said one trader.
Energy specialists were not too concerned at what was viewed as a below par
earnings and dividend performance and said the market was more worried as to
whether the regulatory authorities would refer the generators to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The stock dropped to 397p immediately the figures were published, but
quickly stabilised and eventually stood a net 9 1/2 lower at 402 1/2 p.
Turnover of 15m was easily the highest in a single trading session for more
than two years.

FT  11 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK index futures broke through a significant barrier yesterday, but the
effort proved too great and the December Footsie contract ended below the
day's best, writes Peter John.
A desultory performance was contrasted by continuing high turnover, with
more than 14,000 contracts transacted in the lot for December expiry.
That issue began the day very weakly and hit parity with the cash market at
one stage, touching 3,081 at its lowest ebb. This compares with an estimated
fair value premium of about 10 points.
In the afternoon it raced through 3,105, a level challenged earlier in the
week. Once above that it moved ahead to 3,130, but the buying proved
overdone and it settled back to close just above 3,100.
Traders said that in spite of heavy selling last week as US money was
repatriated on expectations of rising inflation there, open interest
remained high at around 60,000 contracts in December.
It was suggested that UK arbitrageurs bought lots sold by US investment
funds.
In traded options, volume was up to just under 40,000 contracts with British
Steel topping the list of equity options. Steel's turnover of 3,181 lots was
however the result of one deal to buy 3,000 out-of-the-money, January 140
calls at 3p each. Dealers said that, at expiry, the shares must be above
143p for the trade to be profitable.

FT  11 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early advance lost in sharp sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MILDLY disappointing October consumer price statistics from the US abruptly
wiped out early share gains on the London stock market yesterday, although
the final picture was better than on some other European bourses. The FT-SE
100 Index lost the 3,100 benchmark under the influence of a sell-off in
stock index futures, but was rallying in the closing minutes of the session.
The final reading put the Footsie at 3,098.5 for a gain of 2.5 on the day.
Equities had opened uncertainly following the faltering trend at the
overnight close of the US bond market, but then turned smartly higher to
reach a mid-session peak of 3,115 on the Footsie, 19 points ahead.
The reaction to the announcement that the US consumer price index had
contradicted analysts by gaining 0.4 per cent in October was slow at first.
Although nervous ahead of the outcome of the day's auction of 10 year US
Federal bonds increased , London was heartened by relatively bullish
comments from Washington, where Mr Robert Reich, the US Labour Secretary,
said that inflation was 'not starting to accelerate.'
But in its currently nervous state, the UK equity market was taking no risks
and early gains in shares quickly began to evaporate in fairly active
trading. With Wall Street also in cautious mode, and the Dow Jones
Industrial Average turning off slightly in UK hours, the Footsie was barely
able to hold in positive territory in late afternoon.
However, traders stressed that the stock market was not under serious
strain. Much of the pressure came from marketmaking firms which were, in
turn, responding to rapid changes in the futures market. The big
institutions appeared to have resumed their policy of waiting for the Budget
speech due at the end of the month from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the British
chancellor of the exchequer.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index remained uncertain, slipping down by 0.6 for a
closing reading of 3,440.4. Activity focused around the blue chip stocks,
which are more closely futures-related than the second liners. Seaq volume
remained good at 778.1m shares compared with 772.2m on Tuesday when retail
business was worth Pounds 1.5bn, at the top end of the daily averages for
the year.
UK strategists pointed out that the more extreme reaction on continental
European markets reflected both trading news from leading companies and also
the prospect of today's Armistice Day closure of some trading centres.
Falling share prices in the second half of the session provided the
backcloth for a raft of unsubstantiated rumours, chiefly focused around
newsagency reports of military clashes on the Kuwait-Iraq border. The stock
market closed on a calm note although some traders claimed to have scented a
weak opening this morning.
Transatlantic concerns showed themselves in a weak pharmaceutical sector and
oil shares also closed a few pence easier. But the broad range of UK store
and consumer stocks, still buoyed by optimism for a base rate cut at Budget
time, performed well even where share prices ended below the day's best. The
shock of the day came in Euro Disney shares, which traded throughout the
session in London but fell heavily in the wake of the dismal trading
statement.

FT  11 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow climbs despite rising
bond yields

Wall Street
AIDED BY heavy program trading, US share prices posted solid gains yesterday
as investors shrugged off rising bond yields and disappointing inflation and
employment news, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 23.48 ahead at 3,663.55 and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 3.39 at 463.72, while the Nasdaq composite
advanced 6.66 to 776.50. NYSE volume was 283.4m shares.
Equity prices struggled from the opening as rising bond yields unsettled
market sentiment. The bond market was reacting to strengthening commodities
prices and the latest news on inflation - a 0.4 per cent rise in the October
consumer price index. Although the increase was broadly in line with
analysts' forecasts, after Tuesday's much better than expected producer
prices data, the stock and bond markets had been hoping that the consumer
prices figures would be equally encouraging.
The increase in bond yields immediately fed through into lower equities, and
investors were also troubled by a jump in weekly unemployment insurance
claims. The early losses, however, were not substantial, and smaller-company
stocks actually started the day with solid gains. By midday the markets had
recovered their poise, and by the afternoon a series of buy programs had
pushed stocks further into positive territory.
Semiconductor issues were bought on reports of strong demand for the
companies' products. Only last week the sector was hit by selling on concern
about sales. Texas Instruments forged ahead Dollars 4 to Dollars 63 1/8 ,
Motorola Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 102 7/8 , National Semiconductor Dollars 1
3/4 to Dollars 17 7/8 and Storage Technology Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 29 1/2
.
Paramount Communications fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 80 5/8 in busy
trading after administrators handling the disposal of the business empire of
Mr Robert Maxwell announced that his Macmillan publishing group would be
sold to Paramount for just over Dollars 1bn.
Telefonos de Mexico rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 52 3/8 as investors
suggested that the chances of the Nafta pact passing congress in a crucial
vote next week had been boosted by Tuesday night's televised debate between
US Vice-president Al Gore and Nafta opponent Mr Ross Perot.
Walt Disney lost Dollars 1 to Dollars 40 1/4 in early trading before
recovering to end unchanged at Dollars 41 1/4 in volume of 3.4m shares after
announcing that it would help fund its Euro Disney subsidiary while
exploring a possible financial restructuring of the troubled theme park.
Canada
TORONTO hit a record peak in the second-busiest day of trading ever on the
exchange. The TSE 300 index ended 18.1 higher at 4,269.5, with advances
outpacing declines by 443 to 340 after volume of 99.3m shares valued at
CDollars 698m.

MEXICO finished 4.2 per cent stronger on optimism over the progress of

launch anti-inflationary measures before the year-end. The Bovespa index
rose 1,485 to 22,829.

FT  11 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei edges ahead as
pressure on JR East subsides

<TEXT>
AFTER AN early plunge through the 18,000 level, the Nikkei average finally
closed marginally higher after a day of fluctuations, writes Emiko Terazono
in Tokyo.
Share prices moved on arbitrage activity, margin selling and index-linked
buying by financial institutions before the 225-issue average ended 4.00
better at 18,121.71.
The Nikkei saw a low of 17,818.28 in early trading on selling by
arbitrageurs and margin liquidation and a high of 18,227.92 later as a rise
in the futures market triggered index-linked buying; but in the end, most of
the gains were eroded by further selling.
Volume rose to 395.1m shares from 315m. Declines led advances by 751 to 290,
with 117 issues unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks shed
9.98 to 1,534.78 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 0.93 to
1,235.29.
Fears of a further plunge subsided as selling pressure on East Japan Railway
receded. Traders said the stock has become an important benchmark for the
market, and many investors still fear that a further fall could drag down
other leading shares.
Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister, blamed the decline of equity prices
on the recent spate of sluggish corporate results. He said the government
was not considering injecting more public funds into the stock market to
stimulate prices.
JR East closed unchanged at Y451,000 after initially falling to Y444,000.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained Y1,000 at Y756,000. Banks tumbled on
index-linked selling: Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y30 to Y3,190 and
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y60 to Y2,200.
Margin selling depressed Fujitsu by Y8 to Y801 and NEC by Y10 to Y893.
However, Sumitomo Metal Mining, which had recently lost ground on
margin-linked selling, rallied Y10 to Y839 on bargain hunting.
Housing issues were higher on firm condominium sales. Daiwa House Industry
moved ahead Y30 to Y1,570 and Daikyo Y10 to Y1,060.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 137.21 to 20,164.03 in volume of 22.1m
shares. The index declined on margin liquidation.
Roundup
THE FIRMER tone was mirrored in many of the region's markets.
HONG KONG surged 2.6 per cent on a late round of overseas demand aimed at
blue chips as the market refocused its attention on political developments.
The Hang Seng index moved forward 236.97 to 9,325.44 in turnover that
reached HKDollars 5.8bn, compared with HKDollars 5.7bn on Tuesday.
The late demand was attributed to expectations of positive news from last
night's meeting in London between Governor Chris Patten and a British
cabinet committee to map out a strategy for future Sino-British talks on
Hong Kong's political reforms.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index advanced 27.71, or 1.35 per cent,
to 2,081.01 as institutional buyers and bargain hunters concentrated their
attention on index-linked stocks.
KARACHI was spurred higher by overseas demand on the view that Ms Benazir
Bhutto, the prime minister, will maintain economic reforms begun by Mr Moeen
Qureshi, her predecessor, writes Farhan Bokhari.
The KSE index rose 41.00, or 2.5 per cent, to 1,655.47, its highest level
for 22 months.
BANGKOK moved ahead 2.45 per cent on heavy demand for financial and property
issues. The market index closed at the day's high, up 32.29 at 1,347.62.
TAIWAN finished firmer across the board on a technical rebound after five
consecutive days of falls, and the weighted index recovered 18.97 to
4,191.41.
A decline in turnover to a moderate TDollars 23.49bn from the previous day's
TDollars 27.78bn was attributed to growing caution ahead of local government
elections on November 27.
MANILA rallied after a four-day correction, the composite index adding 27.8
at 2,367.87.
KUALA LUMPUR was firm after its recent volatility and the composite index
appreciated 13.23 to 950.89.
NEW ZEALAND continued to be weighed down by post election uncertainty and
the NZSE-40 capital index dropped 76.82, or 3.7 per cent, to 2,013.76.
AUSTRALIA drifted lower for the seventh consecutive day in the absence of
foreign buyers. The All Ordinaries index fell to 2,034.6 before closing a
net 7.9 off at 2,042.9. Turnover totalled ADollars 382.9m.
SEOUL was easier after a volatile day, the composite index dipping 2.31 to
777.89.
A Finance Ministry plan to allow some financial companies to raise capital
in the stock market sparked early strong demand for financial issues, but
the activity came to an abrupt halt when investors discovered that the plan
excluded banking institutions.

FT  11 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Sri Lanka soars on strong foreign
buying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT and MERVYN DE SILVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Sri Lankan equity market has showed an impressive rise over the last
week as foreign investors have become even more active.
The market's rally began in May, coincidentally around the time of the
assassination of the president, Mr Ranasinghe Premadasa, and as neighbouring
markets, such as Pakistan, were also showing signs of coming out of the
doldrums.
Since then the Colombo all-share index has climbed by more than 60 per cent
and, as measured by the IFC, the market has gained nearly the same amount in
dollar terms over the year to date.
Foreign investors dominate equity trading, accounting for between 40 and 60
per cent of daily average turnover, and renewed interest in the country has
been sparked in the last week following a conference of overseas
insti-tutions held on the island.
According to Susan Murphy, a member of Smith New Court's emerging markets
team based in London, confidence in the market was helped by the peaceful
transition of political power following the president's assassination.
However, she comments, the flow of funds from overseas was beginning to
increase around this period in any case.

FT  11 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Hoechst loses premium after
third quarter slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INFLATION figures in the US cut less ice than they did on Tuesday, writes
Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT lost Tuesday afternoon's gains, the DAX index closing 1.10 higher
on the session at 2,023.84, and the Ibis-indicated DAX falling from 2,040.74
to 2,020.11 at the post-bourse close. Turnover rose from DM7.8bn to DM8.4bn.
Company results news was uninspiring or worse. Mr John Blackley of James
Capel chose the first adjective to describe flat profits and dividend from
Siemens, which ended the post-bourse with its shares in similar condition at
DM715.
Capel reckoned that heavy provisioning hit Hoechst, with the chemical
company's pre-tax profits down by 40 per cent after nine months and worse in
the September quarter. The shares fell DM5.50 to DM268.70, 60pfg higher than
BASF - to which they stood at a DM41, or 20 per cent premium at the
beginning of this year.
Meanwhile, Asko's sensitivity to upcoming news was reflected in a new 1993
high on the sale of its stake in Adia, the Swiss employment agency group.
The shares rose DM33 to DM991; the sale was predicted in March of this year,
but the actuality meant that, for the German retailer, a potential liability
was at an end.
PARIS lost virtually all of Tuesday's gains. It was influenced by a number
of factors, including a 13 per cent fall in Euro Disney. The CAC-40 index
ended down 25.56 or 1.2 per cent at 2,087.33. Turnover was FFr3.6bn. The
market will be closed today.
Euro Disney was twice suspended, once before the announcement of its
FFr5.3bn loss for the year ended September, and then when, on resumption, it
went limit down at FFr37.40. The shares eventually closed off FFr5.70 at
FFr38.00.
Mr Michael Woodcock, French analyst at Nikko Europe, commented that the
problem with the theme park had more to do with poor turnover of paying
customers than expenses. 'The group has done all it can to reduce expenses,
but it has failed so far to attract sufficient quality visitors who will
spend,' he said. 'The park has also proved to be far more seasonal that
Disney ever thought, and compared with other theme parks it still remains
expensive.'
The operation was faced with huge gearing and a need for massive
restructuring, added Mr Woodcock, and it was going to be a long time before
the shares attracted investment support.
AMSTERDAM weakened, largely on technically inspired trading related to
selling of futures and options. The CBS Tendency index eased 1.8 or 1.3 per
cent to 134.2.
Further negative reports regarding Alcazar, which involves negotiations
between four European airlines on forming an alliance, left KLM down Fl 1.20
to Fl 38.10.
Royal Dutch closed off Fl 2.40 to Fl 201.60 ahead of results which are
expected to be released today; Unilever went against the trend with a gain
of 60 cents to Fl 216.60.
MILAN derived little benefit from Senate approval of key parts of the budget
late on Tuesday. Shares were dragged lower again by further sharp falls in
telecoms stocks.
The Comit index gave up 12.93 or 2.4 per cent to 533.45.
Sip shed L100 or 3.2 per cent to L3,004 in volume of 27.7m shares while Stet
fell L192 or 5.2 per cent to L3,507 in volume of 21.9m shares.
Analysts noted that the very high volume of trading in the shares indicated
profit-taking by US investors, already unnerved by the country's fragile
political situation. The sell-off was sparked on Tuesday by the exclusion of
Italian companies from a possible link between AT &amp; T and the German and
French state telephone companies, a development which, yesterday, many
analysts doubted would have any negative impact in the medium term on Stet
and Sip.
Fiat, cutting December car output, shed L77 to L3,345 in volume of 9.4m
shares following comments by Mr Giovanni Agnelli that recovery in European
car demand could be delayed until the end of 1994.
ZURICH continued higher although shares ended off their best levels with the
market unable to maintain the momentum seen on Tuesday. The SMI index, 30
points ahead during the morning, finished 15.0 higher at 2,742.1.
Bearer shares in Adia, the temporary employment group, shed SFr1 to SFr173
as the company announced that Mr Klaus Jacobs was buying the Adia stake held
by Asko, the German retailer. However, the participation certificates surged
SFr40 to SFr168 in response to news that they will be converted into bearers
as part of a share simplification plan.
Sulzer, the engineering group, eased SFr5 to SFr770 after a day's low of
SFr764 in response to its forecast of steady profits but a fall in new
orders. SMH dipped SFr6 to SFr224 as the watchmaker said it had chosen an as
yet unnamed car producer as a partner to build its environmentally friendly
Swatchmobile city car.
MADRID's general index closed 1.12 higher at 300.66 in turnover of some
Pta23bn. Trading was edgy, but Cepsa, the oils group, rose Pta25 to Pta2,410
on a 56 per cent rise in nine-month profits and Fecsa, the Catalan utility,
put on Pta7 to Pta793 on Iberdrola's sale of a 4 per cent stake to Endesa.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: Dollar features in subdued day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVITY in the foreign exchange market was relatively subdued as traders
squared positions ahead of today's holidays in many important markets,
writes Conner Middelmann.
However, the US dollar had another volatile day and weakened significantly
against the yen and the D-Mark in late London trading. It closed at
DM1.6920, down from DM1.6950 the previous day, and fell as low as DM1.6870
in London after-hours' trading. Against the Japanese unit, it ended at
Y107.20, down from Tuesday's close of Y108.25. New York trading finished
with the dollar at DM1.6875 and Y107.08.
Throughout the morning, most currencies languished in narrow ranges as
traders awaited the release of the October US consumer price index.
Following the publication of much lower than expected producer prices on
Tuesday, traders were looking to the latest CPI data for a clarification of
the inflation outlook in the US.
In the event, the 0.4 per cent month-on-month increase in the overall
inflation rate was broadly in line with market forecasts, although some who
had hoped for a lower number after Tuesday's weak PPI data were
disappointed.
'The CPI numbers indicate that we do not have to revise our inflation
picture, despite Tuesday's PPI,' said Mr Rainer Marian, senior market
analyst at Landesbank Hessen-Thuringen in Frankfurt.
He expects the dollar to continue trading in a DM1.68 to DM1.71 range in the
near term and the dollar/D-Mark rate to continue tracking the yield spread
between German 10-year bonds, or bunds, and 10-year US Treasury notes.
The benchmark bund currently yields 5.88 per cent, some 12 basis points
above its US counterpart, and as that gap narrows, the dollar is likely to
appreciate further against the D-Mark, Mr Marian added. However, he warned
that the next leg of the rally could be preceded by a correction back to
around DM1.67.
The D-Mark gained some support yesterday after comments by Mr Alexandre
Lamfalussy, the future president of the European Monetary Institute. He said
the date of 1997 for creation of a single EC currency was 'improbable',
which was seen as an indication that the D-Mark would remain the strongest
currency in Europe.
Sterling made up most of the losses suffered on Tuesday and posted solid
gains on largely technical trading. It ended at DM2.4975, up from a previous
DM2.4900, and against the dollar it rose to Dollars 1.4760 from Dollars
1.4685.
The Belgian franc weakened further as market participants focused on the
spectre of widespread strikes over controversial plans for a social pact.
The currency finished at BFr21.42 to the D-Mark, compared with Tuesday's
BFr21.35. Belgium and France will be closed today for a national holiday.
After stabilising during early London trading, the Canadian dollar later
came under further selling pressure.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Money Markets: Bundesbank cautious
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONEY market rates across Europe remained stable after the Deutsche
Bundesbank's latest round of securities repurchase agreements reaffirmed its
return to a more cautious approach to interest rate easing, writes Conner
Middelmann.
The lowest accepted rate on the 14-day repo tranche slipped one basis point
to 6.38 per cent and the minimum 28-day rate declined by two basis points,
also to 6.38 per cent. The bulk of two-week bids was accepted at an
unchanged 6.39 per cent, while the bulk of four-week bids was taken at 6.39
per cent to 6.40 per cent.
The allocation resulted in a modest DM1.3bn liquidity injection and left
German overnight money trading little changed around 6.45 per cent.
'After their surprise rate cuts on October 21, they have slammed on the
brakes again,' said a Frankfurt money market trader. Nevertheless, most
traders are expecting another cut in the Bundesbank's leading interest rates
in December.
German short-term interest rate futures eased back slightly following the
repo, with the December three-month Euro-mark contract down 0.03 point at
93.84 and the March contract off 0.04 at 94.54 in late trading.
The sterling money market had another lacklustre day which left the short
sterling futures contract drifting on moderate volume in a rela-tively
narrow range. The December contract eased 0.03 point to 94.46. That
indicates that the market is still discounting a  1/2 percentage point
reduction in the base rate by December, with most traders betting on a cut
accompanying the November 30 Budget.
The Bank of England forecast a Pounds 1.25bn shortage in the morning which
was later revised to Pounds 1.3bn. It did not operate in the money market in
the morning, but purchased bills totalling Pounds 779m in the afternoon,
followed by Pounds 420m of late assistance.
The Bank's operations had little effect on money market rates, traders said.
'The Bank's stance is broadly neutral right now and trying to glean monetary
policy indica-tions from their day-to-day operations is mostly a pointless
exercise,' commented a money trader, who added that this neutral strategy is
likely to continue until closer to Budget Day. However, 'the Bank may get
more aggressive if speculation becomes more feverish', he said.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Survey of Korean Financial Markets (9): Committed to
relaxing the rules of the game - Foreign Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE introduction of new foreign-exchange regulations on October 1 will
represent one of first steps taken by the new administration of President
Kim Young-sam towards financial liberalisation.
The deregulation measures are seen as a clear indication that the government
is committed to introducing a free-floating foreign exchange rate system in
1997 by preparing the establishment of a sophisticated foreign exchange
market.
The recent easing of the strict rules on foreign exchange transactions is
also closely connected to the opening up of capital markets to foreigners.
The entry of foreign investors into the Korean stock market last year, for
example, has increased the volume of foreign exchange trades as the inflow
of capital from abroad grows.
Domestic companies and banks welcome the relaxation of the rules. Companies
have complained of difficulty in hedging against foreign exchange losses
because of close government supervision of foreign exchange deals.
Korean banks - seeking new sources of revenue in an increasingly competitive
financial sector - see the prospect of growing earnings from hedging and
speculation in the foreign exchange market.
The government has heavily policed the foreign exchange market because it
feared that currency speculation would cause volatility in the exchange rate
and disrupt the country's export-dependent economy.
Under the guidelines, companies will no longer be required to submit
original supporting trade documents to banks for most forward foreign
exchange transactions in order to prove they are hedging currency risks
rather than speculating. Documentation will be exempt for all forward
contracts between currencies other than the Korean won and be limited to
deals of above Dollars 3m involving the won and other foreign currencies.
Companies will also be allowed to settle trade transactions of Dollars
100,000 or less in won-denominated letter of credits instead of foreign
currency.
The abolition of documentation for most forward foreign-exchange contracts,
the most common form of currency hedging, removes an obstacle that hindered
corporate access to the foreign-exchange market and hampered their defence
against currency losses.
The central bank estimated that Korean companies suffered Won350bn in
foreign-exchange losses last year. Losses are expected to more than double
this year primarily due to the Korean won's 20 per cent fall against the
Japanese yen.
'These measures will not bring about drastic changes to the foreign exchange
market in the short-term,' says Kim Young-min of the Lucky-Goldstar Economic
Research Institute.
One reason is that the government retains effective control over the won's
value against other currencies. Although the government has widened the
daily interbank foreign exchange rate trading ban to 1 per cent from 0.8 per
cent, Mr Kim says: 'We know from past experience that an expansion of the
allowed range of fluctuation does not immediately cause a proportionate
expansion of the actual range of daily fluctuations.'
This is because the government dominates the foreign exchange market through
the central bank.
Nonetheless, the foreign exchange market in Korea has grown sharply in the
past few years, although it remains small compared to those existing in the
advanced industrialised countries.
The average daily trading volume of foreign-exchange transactions has
increased from Dollars 230m in 1990 to Dollars 1.2bn this year, with spot
transactions accounting for Dollars 550m and forward transactions for
Dollars 470m.
Analysts believe that the foreign exchange market will grow significantly
once the government implements additional financial liberalisation measures.
Demand on the foreign exchange market will increase as the government raises
the foreign ownership ceiling on domestic stocks and opens the bond market
to foreigners by 1995 and the deregulation of overseas direct investments by
Korean companies will bolster demand.
The government has also announced that the exchange rate trading ban will be
widened, forward contract documentation requirements will be further relaxed
and the ceiling on the won-denominated settlement of trade transactions will
be raised within two years.
This should prepare the way for internationalisation of the Korean won and
its widespread use in the settlement of visible and invisible trade deals
after 1997.
Although the government has emphasised that the principle of real demand
should guide the foreign exchange market, it is considered inevitable that
speculation and the increased flow of capital into the country will exert a
stronger influence on the exchange rate. This will increase uncertainties
and risks in the foreign exchange market, although it will give Korean
companies greater autonomy in managing their forex portfolios.
The government's willingness to accept greater fluctuations in the exchange
rate will be a test of its determination to internationalise its capital
markets and open up the economy to global influences.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Survey of Korean Financial Markets (8): Raising global
profiles - Korean companies are limited when it comes to securing cash
overseas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY of Korea's largest companies are competing for business on a global
basis, but their ability to raise funds in overseas markets is restricted.
Since domestic interest rates can be as much as 10 percentage points higher
than rates in international markets, this puts them at a competitive
disadvantage.
It is no surprise, therefore, to find that Korean companies have taken full
advantage of the gradual liberalisation of these restrictions and have
worked hard to raise their profiles with foreign investors.
'In our case, our capital expenses are so big that we have to secure funding
from overseas,' said Jang Yeul Koo, general manager, international finance
department at Samsung Electronics. 'The domestic market is not sufficient to
meet our requirements.'
However, the Korean government continues to exercise strict control over
bond issuance and occasionally delays or reduces the size of issues.
'Many companies are interested in raising money overseas,' said Chan-Yull
Lim, assistant minister at the Korean ministry of finance. Because of the
large interest rate difference, if permitted 'everyone will go abroad', says
Mr Lim.
'Usually we allow companies to raise money overseas when they will use that
money to import from overseas,' he says.
The authorities are concerned that excessive overseas borrowing will affect
the growth of money supply and cause the level of inflation to rise. For
this reason, Korean companies are not permitted, for example, to refinance
domestic debt in the international market.
However, the government has raised the limit on overseas borrowing from
Dollars 1.5bn-Dollars 2bn for this year and the level is likely to be the
same next year. Firms have to gain approval for each offering and approval
is based on the purpose of the financing. Reasons other than capital
expenditure, preferably on equipment from abroad, are frowned upon.
'Korean companies would like to be able to be more opportunistic in the
market,' said one banker.
In spite of restrictions, companies are sometimes able to take advantage of
opportunities in the swap market to reduce funding costs. Last year, Pohang
Iron and Steel (Posco), needed to borrow yen in order to repay some yen
syndicated loans. It proved cheaper to issue debt in dollars and swap into
yen. Yon Woon Kim, senior managing director of Posco, estimates that the
swap saved the company Dollars 14m.
Korean companies have approached the international market gradually. 'Korean
companies used to be financed by syndicated loans in the 1970s and 1980s,'
said Edward Kim, general manager, international finance at Korea Development
Securities, a wholly owned subsidiary fo the Korean Development Bank.
'In the mid-1980s, they started issuing convertible bonds then as credit
perception improved, they were able to issue straight debt,' Mr Kim said. As
well as offering lower interest rates, the international markets offer more
scope for companies to issue longer term debt.
Korean borrowers are reaching an increasingly broad range of investors.
Having started by issuing in the Eurobond market, some have now tapped both
the US Yankee bond market and the Japanese Samurai bond market.
Some companies have moved into more esoteric markets. Samsung Electronics,
for example, is one of the first borrowers ever to set up a programme in the
Hungarian Forints Commercial paper market which it will use to finance its
plant there.
In order to reach a broader audience of international investors, an
increasing number of Korean borrowers are seeking ratings from the leading
international credit rating agencies, Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's. Ratings
are considered more necessary for companies that want to issue straight
bonds than for those issuing equity-linked bonds.
Since the Republic of Korea was rated A+ by Standard &amp; Poor's in 1988, a
number of wholly or partly government-owned entities have achieved the same
rating, including the Korean Development Bank (KDB), Korea Electric Power
(Kepco) and Korea Telecom.
Moody's does not rate the Republic, but the government-guaranteed KDB and
Export-Import Bank of Korea are rated A1 by Moody's.
David Levey, head of sovereign ratings at Moody's said that the much lower
level of debt that Korea has achieved and its continued strong economic
performance, in spite of some slowdown, had to be balanced against the
uncertainty over potential reunification with North Korea.
So far, few industrial companies have gained ratings. Posco is rated A2 by
Moody's and A+ by Standard &amp; Poor's, while Samsung Electronics is rated Baa2
by Moody's and A- by Standard &amp; Poor's. However, more companies are likely
to seek ratings in the future, although there is a tendency for companies to
want ratings only if they will be in the single-A category.
Companies have also made efforts to explain their credits directly to
investors. Samsung Electronics, for example, has hosted regular roadshows to
coincide with new issues.
Posco, the world's third largest steel producer, was 'well known in Asia but
not in the west', according to Posco's Mr Kim. In its efforts to develop its
investor base, the company holds one-to-one meetings with investors rather
than road shows.
Traders in London say that demand for Korean companies' issues is strong,
providing issues are correctly priced. Investors generally require a slight
premium over similar European or US credits.
Samsung has been active in a wide range of markets and has issued commercial
paper as well as long-term debt. So far this year, the company has tapped
the US and D-mark CP markets. It is also considering setting up a sterling
CP programme, if its sterling requirement proves sufficiently large. The
company has a colour television factory in Billingham.
'In the future we will need to diversify our exposure. Our overseas
activities are increasing and we need to meet those needs,' said Mr Koo,
adding that dollars, D-marks and sterling were of particular interest.
Posco, too, has made a 'strategic decision to diversify funding sources and
investor groups' so that it can continue to finance new projects worldwide,
says Mr Kim.
Korean companies have also been active in issuing depository receipts or
global depositary receipts. 'If we offer equity in the Korean market, it has
be at a discounted price. In the foreign markets we can issue at a premium,'
said Mr Koo of Samsung.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Survey of Korean Financial Markets (7): Barriers to foreign
investors still in place - The Bond Market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE liberalisation of Korea's financial markets is taking a long time to
reach the domestic bond market.
Under the blue-print for economic reform published in June, foreigners will
be granted partial access to the bond market from next year. But they will
not be able to invest directly in most domestic corporate bonds until after
the current five-year plan. Even then, a limit is likely to be set on the
total amount of bonds available to foreigners.
However, Korea's high interest rates mean foreign investors are likely to be
keen to take advantage of the limited access they will be granted,
particularly if real interest rates in the US, Europe and Japan remain
meagre.
Under the second stage of the current plan, foreigners will be allowed to
invest directly in equity-linked bonds issued by small and medium-sized
companies next year. In 1995 they will be able to buy domestic bonds through
investment trust-type vehicles. Under the third stage, they will be
authorised to invest directly in bonds issued by small and medium-sized
companies in 1997.
However, some analysts are cynical about how much foreign interest will be
generated in smaller companies, which are unfamiliar and weaker credits. It
is the large Korean companies, many of which are now seeking credit ratings
from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, which are likely to be in strong demand.
One reason the government been slow in opening the corporate bond market,
says Buhmsoo Choi, a fellow of the Korea Development Institute, which
advises the government, is that 'we don't need a big amount of foreign
capital . . . Our savings ratio and investment rates are very high'. Korean
companies themselves are more interested in borrowing abroad, where rates
are much lower, than in the development of the domestic market, where
corporate rates are currently about 13 per cent.
There are also those opposed to liberalisation of domestic interest rates -
some companies pay favourable regulated rates. However, the admission of
foreign investors and the creation of a more liquid market, including some
longer-dated bonds, would be likely eventually to reduce the rates.
The government is held back by macro-economic concerns. 'There is a 10 per
cent differential between domestic and foreign rates,' says Mr Choi. The big
fear is that a large inflow of money into the Korean economy could fan
inflation, currently at 5 to 6 per cent. With inflation at this level, real
interest rates, at about 7 per cent, are high and would therefore be
extremely attractive to foreign investors.
'If we just opened up the market, it would cause a lot of disturbance,' said
Chang-Yull Lim, assistant minister of the ministry of finance. 'The first
job is to narrow the interest rate differential'. He believes this will
happen as domestic interest rates are liberalised. Moreover, if the world
economy picks up, interest rates elsewhere could start to edge up again.
Korea has a history of chronic inflation, fuelled by monetary expansion in
the 1980s, when the government provided low-cost funds to parts of domestic
industry. The fear of inflation is the main reason behind the government's
so-called 'step-by-step' approach. In fact, Mr Choi says the plan is to have
raised the limit on foreign ownership of stocks to 25 per cent before
opening the bond market further.
Further ahead are plans to develop the government bond market. 'We are
thinking of developing long-term bonds,' said Mr Lim.
The Won35,000bn government bond market is highly illiquid. Much of the paper
was issued at below market rates and so is not traded. Most of the paper has
a one-year maturity, with some three-year bonds and some illiquid 10-year
paper. But the government plans to create a liquid yield curve, with bonds
at five, seven and 10 years. 'In order to issue more bonds, the government
will have to respect market rates,' said Mr Choi.
Korea already has an active domestic corporate bond market, but most of the
bonds are issued with a three-year maturity. Here too, the plan is to
develop a yield curve.
In spite of being held back by restrictions, the Korean debt market has
grown rapidly, with corporate bond issuance reaching Won11,155bn in 1992,
from just Won963bn in 1980. The proportion of debt (including government,
municipal and corporate bonds) relative to gross national product has risen
to nearly 20 per cent, compared with 6.9 per cent in 1980, according to the
Securities Supervisory Board.
As the amount of outstanding listed bonds has grown (from Won2,500bn in 1980
to Won65,000bn in 1992), turnover in the secondary market has also
increased, from Won2,400bn in 1980 to Won45,800bn in 1992. While bonds are
listed on the Korea Stock Exchange, most trading takes place in the
over-the-counter market. This has been a progressive trend - OTC trading
accounted for over 98 per cent of total trading volume in 1992 compared with
only 46.3 per cent in 1987, according to Lucky Securities.
In spite of the growth of the market, it remains illiquid and bound by
regulations. Nevertheless, foreign investors hungry for yield, would jump at
the chance to buy top Korean corporate bonds paying 13 per cent which, with
relatively low inflation, would compensate them for any foreign exchange
risk. But the government is loathe to open the market until the differential
with other markets - the source of attraction for foreign investors - has
been reduced.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Survey of Korean Financial Markets (6): Light at the end of
the tunnel - The government says it will raise the ceiling on Korean stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LESS THAN two years after the Korean stock market was partially opened to
foreign investors, the investment limits on most prime Korean stocks have
already been reached.
Since January 1992, up to 10 per cent of Korean stocks has been available
for foreign investment. According to In-Kie Hong, chairman of the Korea
Stock Exchange, 25 per cent of companies have reached their 10 per cent
ceiling, with about 200 shares at more than 9 per cent.
'That's most of the big shares,' said Sean Goldrick, chief representative of
James Capel's Seoul office. The rest of the market consists of shares in
companies which are not large enough to interest foreign investors.
While this is proving frustrating for brokers and investors, hope is in
sight. According to the Korean government's five-year economic plan, the
ceiling on Korean companies will be raised some time between 1994 and 1995
and again between 1996 and 1997.
However, Chang-Yull Lim, assistant minister at the ministry of finance, says
he expects the ceiling on foreign investment to be raised in the first half
of next year.
Mr Lim said he could not predict by how much the ceiling would be raised.
Most market participants are looking for a further 5 per cent, bringing the
ceiling to 15 per cent.
The government's gradual approach to liberalisation is dictated primarily by
fears that a rapid inflow of foreign investment could fuel inflation. Even
with the current limits, the inflow of foreign investment has been
substantial: a net Dollars 2.6bn in 1992 and a net Dollars 3.32bn for the
first three quarters of 1993, according to the ministry of finance. This
means that 6.2 per cent of the market is owned by foreigners.
'The most important factor is the potential impact of foreign capital on
monetary stability,' said Mr Lim. For example the Dollars 3bn of net inflow
this year accounted for 21 per cent of total money supply.
However, there are ways around the 10 per cent limit. One is to buy
convertible bonds, or bonds with equity warrants issued in the Eurobond
market. Another is to buy stocks which have already reached their ceiling
from another foreign investor. An over-the-counter market has developed in
foreign-owned stocks, which are bought and sold at a premium. There are 30
to 40 stocks traded in this way, usually at a premium of 3 to 4 per cent,
but sometimes at a premium of as much as 50 per cent, as in the case of
Korea Mobile Telecom.
But, according to Philip Smiley, branch manager and director of Jardine
Fleming Securities, it is 'terribly difficult to find a company (stock) in
sufficient size to interest a foreign institution'. Foreign investors are
often loathe to sell, because they are afraid that they will not be able to
get back into the market.
In any case, the performance of the Korean stock market has been
disappointing, particularly when compared to other Asian markets such as
Hong Kong and Thailand.
Korea's relative economic slowdown and declining profitability have weighed
down the stock market's performance this year. But expectations of stronger
growth next year had buoyed hopes of an improvement.
The introduction of real-name trading in August proved a setback for the
market. In an effort to stamp out corruption, the government banned the use
of false or borrowed names. False names had been frequently used to avoid
tax, or to hide the origin of illegal earnings. About Won3,000bn was held in
false-name accounts, estimated to account for 7 per cent of stock investor
accounts.
'The market is coming out of a dip,' said Mr Smiley. 'We felt that there
would be a genuine recovery in the last quarter (of 1993), but the
(introduction of) the real-name system has knocked that back.'
However, the real-name system has been broadly welcomed, particularly as it
became clear that the set-back to the market was temporary.
'It is not such a cataclysm as it was first thought,' said William Daniel,
branch manager of Baring Securities. This was partly because the government
had proved flexible in its interpretation of the rules, he said, adding that
it was expected eventually to help the market. 'It's a positive move and in
the long term will bring greater probity,' said one broker.
In the longer term, the prospects for the market's development remain
attractive, not least because of Korea's strong industrial base - the second
largest in Asia after Japan.
Already, the foreign investor base in the market has broadened from
specialist regional and country funds to mainstream institutional investors,
including a surge of interest from US institutions earlier this year.
However, the 10 per cent ceiling has 'put an artificial brake on our
activity', said Mr Daniel at Baring Securities.
'We've made a substantial investment here. If they don't raise the limit,
we'll be hurting,' said Mr Smiley.
The planned introduction of stock index futures at the beginning of 1996 is
likely to attract foreign investors. A study is under way to devise the form
of the contract, as well as a new index.
The current Korean stockmarket index, known as Kospi, covers too many small
stocks to be viable as the basis for a futures contract. The new index is
likely to include 100 to 300 companies, according to Mr Hong of the stock
exchange. He added that the futures market would be introduced first, to be
followed by options. Interest rate derivatives will be introduced later.

KOREA FIRST BANK, the country's second largest commercial bank, has gained a
reputation for being the most aggressive among the older banks in preparing
for a deregulated financial market.
The efforts it has made to rationalise operations, such as reducing staff
levels and introducing automation, are already bearing fruit.
It reported the largest profits among Korean commercial banks last year,
with a 53 per cent climb in net earnings to Won147bn. Net profits rose by 77
per cent to Won81bn during the first half of 1993 and analysts expect
earnings to reach Won150bn for the full year.
Its operating income grew by an impressive 88 per cent in 1992, although
this will slow to only 9 per cent growth this year because of the economic
slowdown and weaker demand for credit.
The Office of Bank Supervision rated KFB as the best managed bank in 1992.
The rationalisation programme was launched by Park Ki-jin, who became the
bank's president in 1991. It was thus ironic that Mr Park was forced to
resign this spring when it was alleged that he had provided questionable
loans to a failed property company run by his brother. He was the third bank
president forced from office this year as a result of a government
investigation into corrupt practices in the banking industry.
Mr Park's departure, however, has not slowed down the reforms at KFB, which
was established in 1929 as the Savings Bank of Korea.
The main emphasis remains on improving efficiency. An elimination of 300
jobs over the past two years has reduced the staff level to 8,900, around
600 fewer employees than at the other main banks. It already has the lowest
ratio of overhead costs per unit of operating income at 44.7 per cent
against an industry average of 48.2 per cent.
The bank plans further job cuts through natural attrition that will reduce
its staff to 8,360 by 1995, even as it increases its domestic network - the
smallest among the big city banks - to 305 branches from the current 276.
KFB is depending on the installation of automatic cash-point machines, which
have only been recently introduced to Korea, and upgrading computer systems
to compensate for the personnel cuts.
It is also promoting a progressive personnel management policy in an attempt
to improve customer service. Last year, it became the first Korean bank to
guarantee equal career advancement opportunities for employees.
Profits have been improved by deft financial management. It relies less than
other banks on holding certificates of deposits, the costliest source of
funds. It has become an aggressive trader in the stock market and reported
the industry's biggest gains from securities last year. It also recorded the
second-best performance in the industry for managing trust assets after the
Bank of Seoul, which specialises in the trust business.
KFB must still contend with the critical problems that are also affecting
the other older banks. It has a high percentage of non-performing loans,
amounting to Won11,855bn or 6.9 per cent of total credits, although its
provisions for doubtful accounts has reached 2.1 per cent of loans, above
the central bank's 2 per cent guideline.
It may also need to raise new equity to meet the Bank of International
Settlements' capital adequacy ratio of 8 per cent by 1995. The bank claims
that its equity/assets ratio is 10 per cent, but independent analysts
estimate that the ratio is closer to 7 per cent.
Nonetheless, its capital base remains strong. Total assets amounted to
Won27,498 at the end of 1992. It accounts for 14 per cent of loans and 17
per cent of deposits among the commercial banks. Its business is heavily
oriented toward the corporate sector, accounting for 90 per cent of loans
which are almost evenly divided between large and small companies.
KFB, which is already one of the most active Korean banks overseas, is now
concentrating on expanding international activities.
It has developed its foreign exchange business by taking the unusual step
for a Korean bank of hiring outside dealers. It is taking a lead in
international financial trading, including floating bonds overseas and
managing international syndicated loans.
But net profits from its overseas branches fell by 25 per cent last year to
Dollars 9.7m because of large loan loss reserves following a sharp rise in
non-performing loans. Loan loss provisions are expected to rise further this
year.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Survey of Korean Financial Markets (2): Over the first
hurdle - The nation's banks must adapt or face extinction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEXT five years promise to be a period of upheaval for South Korea's
highly-protected and regulated banking industry as it becomes buffetted by
the winds of financial liberalisation.
Inefficiently overmanned and saddled with a large amount of non-performing
loans, some of the nation's 23 city and regional commercial banks are
threatened with extinction unless they adapt swiftly to the demands of a
deregulated market.
Bu confidence, has risen that the banks may prove equal to the task after
they successfully passed the first test of financial liberalisation: a ban
on anonymous bank accounts ordered by President Kim Young-sam in August.
Despite widespread predictions that tax dodgers would withdraw large amounts
of funds and deplete the banks' deposit base, the reform barely caused a
ripple.
A requirement that false-name account holders show identification before
withdrawing their funds robbed them of their anonymity and discouraged them
from emptying their accounts. Another advantage was that funds held in
fictitious-name accounts represented only 1.9 per cent of the Won154,100bn
deposited in banks.
But the banks are still worried about a bigger potential problem resulting
from the real-name financial system. The government wants nominee accounts,
which use borrowed names, to be registered under their owners' true identity
by 1996, when a comprehensive tax system is to be introduced.
At least Won30,000bn, or a fifth of bank deposits, are estimated to be in
borrowed-name accounts. Banks fear a steady outflow of deposits over the
next two years as account owners try to beat the tax man. Moreover, the
identification process that halted withdrawals from false-name accounts is
useless in the case of nominee accounts.
The threat of an erosion of the banks' deposit base may force the government
to accelerate the deregulation of interest rates and improve the banks'
ability to gain new funds.
Regulated interest rates have proved to be both a blessing and curse for
Korean banks. The healthy interest rate spread guaranteed under the system
contributed to the 28.4 per cent rise in the 1992 operating profit for
commercial banks, which amounted to Won2,596bn, although operating income
growth slowed to 12.3 per cent in the first half of 1993 as bad economic
conditions depressed credit demand.
The bank deposit rates set by the government, however, also represent a
problem since they are lower than those offered by short-term finance
companies, making it difficult for banks to attract funds. Banks account for
45 per cent of all funds deposited in financial institutions. Moreover,
asset formation is slowing down as the economy stumbles.
The liberalisation of both lending and deposit rates, which is now scheduled
to be completed by 1996, could enable banks to retain their deposit base and
sustain their margin spreads through higher loan rates.
The government freed almost all lending rates at the beginning of this month
and it has hinted that it will complete the liberalisation of deposit rates,
40 per cent of which are now unrestricted, ahead of its 1996 deadline. The
ministry of finance also says it will phase out the credit allocation
policies that have burdened the banks with a large amount of non-performing
loans, totalling Won10,200bn or almost 7 per cent of all bank credits.
The bad loan problem is particularly acute for some of the older banks,
which have been regulated the longest. Non-performing loans held by the
Commercial Bank of Korea, the country's largest bank, amount to 13.2 per
cent of total loans.
The government has required banks to provide as much as half of their loans
at below market rates to designated strategic industries. In addition, the
banks have also been forced to set aside 45 per cent of their loans for
small and medium-sized businesses.
These credit control policies have severely limited the banks' autonomy and
prevented them from operating efficiently.
'Interest rate deregulation and the abolition of credit controls will allow
the banks to operate in a regular manner instead as a financial tool of the
government,' said John Wadle, an banking analyst for BZW in Seoul.
But not all of the Korean banks are likely to survive in a deregulated
market and the industry is expected to witness an extensive restructuring.
The government may encourage bank mergers by easing ownership rules that
limit shareholding stakes. The result could be the emergence of two or three
Korean mega-banks by the end of the decade. The merger of strong banks with
weaker ones would help solve the bad loan problem and encourage
rationalisation of operations.
Banks might also be permitted to engage in other financial sectors, such as
brokerage and investment consultation, to increase turnover and profits.
However, these proposals alone may not be able to remove the serious threat
posed by the large amount of non-performing loans. Instead of the government
bailing out the troubled banks, there are suggestions that so-called 'bad
banks' should be created to manage dodgy assets or that banks should be
permitted to transform bad loans into equity stakes in creditor companies.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Survey of Korean Financial Markets (5): Profitability
strained - The problems faced by foreign bankers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE foreign brokers moan about the ceiling on foreign share ownership,
foreign bankers in Korea have their own gripes.
The controlled interest rate environment makes it hard for them to compete
for business. Wage costs have spiralled in recent years and labour relations
are worsening. The government requires bank branches to put up substantial
capital, which reduces their profitability. And the economic slowdown has
led to greater credit problems.
Most foreign banks in Korea are involved primarily in the corporate banking
sector. According to official figures, the total assets of foreign banks
accounted for 10 per cent of the market, or Won16,914bn last year. However,
their market share in deposit-taking is minuscule - around 1.4 per cent of
the total, or Won869bn.
Most of the foreign banks' business is with Korean companies, and consists
of short-term credits, often related to trade finance. There is also
relatively limited foreign exchange business. However, these markets should
grow as the interest rate environment is deregulated over the next few
years.
Because of the current lack of a liberalised lending market, the bank market
is supplemented by a so-called 'kerb' market. The kerb market is a source of
funds lent often by wealthy individuals to small-size businesses which find
it difficult to borrow from banks.
The reason it is so hard for them to persuade the banks to lend is that
banks are only allowed to charge rates within a restricted range, which
discourages banks from lending to weaker credits.
'There is not a free market,' said one banker. 'Banks are given 'guidance'
not to charge above a certain rate. Foreign banks are profitable but it is
by using up capital from head office, because branches have to be heavily
capitalised. The Bank of Korea assumes capital is free but it's not.'
In fact, the profitability of foreign banks is difficult to assess because
some banks are charged by their head office for the cost of capital, while
others are not.
'A lot of the profitability of banks is just the differential between Libor
 -the assumed funding cost for the capital - and returns on assets,' said
one banker.
In addition, banks have experienced an increase in bad debt over the past
two years, as a growing number of Korean businesses have failed.
The strains on profitability have brought to a halt the flow of arrivals of
foreign banks into the country. Foreign banks currently number 52.
'With labour costs and other aspects of the operating environment,
commercial bank entry will be very slow,' said Paul Muther, general manager
of the First National Bank of Chicago and head of the Foreign Bankers Group.
He said this year was an important one for the bank. 'We have reached a
crossroads in the profit dynamics'.
Higher wage costs and flat revenues mean that profits are falling. 'Broadly
speaking, a typical foreign bank branch in 1992-3 is generating
approximately the same revenue as five-years ago - but the cost of unionised
staff has gone up roughly 100 per cent,' Mr Muther said.
Bankers believe a spate of labour problems that have taken place this year
is something which could pose a threat to their future.
Disputes at ABN Amro and the Bank of Boston have been settled but a strike
at Citibank continues and trouble is brewing at Bank of America, Banque
Nationale de Paris, Banque Paribas and Standard Chartered. With the
exception of Citibank, where the dispute concerns an employee welfare fund,
the other strikes are all based on pay claims. These claims often run into
double figures.
Foreign bankers argue that their industry cannot sustain these types of pay
increases, and that the net result of the high pay claims is that those
foreign banks already in the market have stopped expanding their operations
and other banks have been discouraged from entering the market at all.
'Unless we can get employee compensation under control, there is no future
to the business,' Mr Muther said.
Most foreign banks are involved only in corporate banking, and eschew the
even more difficult retail market. The exception is Citibank, which has 11
branches in Korea. According to John Beeman, country corporate officer of
Citibank, the retail banking strategy for Citibank in Asia is 'sharply
focused. The nationwide banks have several hundred branches, so it doesn't
cost them that much to set up a new branch. It costs us a lot of money'.
The strategy therefore is to concentrate on products which do not require
frequent visits to the bank by customers, such as credit cards and telephone
banking, and to target upper-income customers. The bank has a policy of
'locating branches in upper-income residential neighbourhoods,' he said.
Because most Korean housing is high-rise, the population tends to be highly
concentrated and one branch can serve a far higher number of people that it
would do elsewhere. For example, within one kilometre of Citibank's branch
south of the River Han in Seoul are some 200,000 households.
Citibank does not target expatriate clients. In fact, the branch in Seoul's
expatriate district was closed, as expatriates do not tend to keep
substantial sums of money in the country.
Other foreign banks are not considering entering the retail market. Most of
them are preoccupied by the necessity of maintaining their fragile
profitability in the corporate sector.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Survey of Korean Financial Markets (3): Youth and modesty
contributing factors - Profile, Shinhan Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEDIUM-SIZED Shinhan Bank has emerged as one of the best performers in South
Korea's troubled banking sector.
Shinhan, founded in 1982 by a group of Korean businessmen living in Japan,
was the first of seven commercial banks created over the past decade as part
of a government policy to foster competition against the country's six main
city banks. It now ranks as the country's sixth largest bank with 126 branch
offices and total assets of Won15,630bn last year, having doubled in size
since 1989.
Analysts predict that its rapid growth will continue. After posting a 23 per
cent growth rate in total assets last year, assets are likely to increase by
16 per cent in 1993 and 21 per cent in 1994, according to one estimate by
BZW in Seoul.
Although net earnings grew by a meagre 8.3 per cent to Won125.2bn in 1992
and are expected to decline by 4.2 per cent to Won120bn this year due to
increased taxation, it still has the third largest bank profits in Korea
after the much bigger Korea First and Hanil banks. Operating income,
however, is expected to jump by 27 per cent in 1993 and 1994, after growing
by 8 per cent last year.
Shinhan's relative youth and modest branch network are two reasons it is
able to maintain high profit margins and one of the strongest capital bases
among Korean banks.
The fairly recent establishment of Shinhan has meant that it has not been
forced by the government to provide a large amount of the low-interest
industrial policy loans that have caused bad debt problems for older banks.
Its non-performing loans at the end of 1992 amounted to Won210bn, or 2 per
cent of total loans. In contrast, the ratio of non-performing loans for the
six main city banks was 8.8 per cent of total credits. This has meant that
Shinhan has been able to maintain a strong balance sheet in terms of capital
and assets.
Most Korean banks will be forced to boost their equity base or keep lending
growth in check to fulfil the Bank of International Settlements' global
capital adequacy ratio of 8 per cent by 1995. Shinhan, however, already has
the highest BIS ratio among commercial banks at 13 per cent.
The size of Shinhan's branch network has meant it has so far avoided the
overstaffing problems that are reducing profits at other Korean banks.
Although wage levels at Shinhan are higher than average for a Korean bank,
so is the level of employee productivity. The profit-per-employee ratio is
four times the average for the commercial banks.
Operational efficiency has contributed to Shinhan's ability to maintain the
highest return-on-assets among Korean commercial banks during the past four
years.
Shinhan also enjoys the highest lending margins among the main commercial
banks, with an estimated interest rate spread of 3.5 per cent last year.
This reflects its strategy of focusing on lending to small and medium-sized
companies. The growth of these businesses is favoured by the government and
the central bank is giving cheaper funds to banks willing to lend to them.
Shinhan has taken advantage of this policy to increase its lending margins,
with its exposure to the small business sector accounting for an estimated
65 per cent of its loan portfolio against 45 per cent for most other banks.
'Shinhan is concentrating on a market niche avoided by most banks which
believe that lending to small companies is too risky. But Shinhan is
developing a skill in credit analysis that is often lacking in other banks
which have relied too much on lending to big corporate customers,' said John
Wadle, a banking analyst at BZW.
Nonetheless, Shinhan was forced to more than double its loan loss provisions
last year when the small business sector suffered a record number of
bankruptcies as the government squeezed credit to reduce inflation.
Bankruptcies are expected to decline this year and Shinhan is considered
fully provisioned for loan losses.
The bank is now concentrating on selectively expanding its retail network
into rapidly growing urban neighbourhoods, with at least 20 branches being
opened a year. It has also recently focused on developing business abroad,
particularly in south-east Asia, which is a favoured site for Korean foreign
investment.

INITIAL scepticism about President Kim Young-sam's commitment to financial
liberalisation has been replaced by growing optimism that the new South
Korean leader is serious about deregulating one of Asia's most protected
capital markets.
Liberalisation hopes were given a boost in mid-August when Mr Kim announced
a ban on the tax dodge of using false names in financial transactions, which
will increase transparency in the banking industry and money markets.
But perhaps the most significant result of the ban on anonymous accounts
will be that it may accelerate implementation of the government's five-year
(1993-1997) financial reform plan, which was announced at the beginning of
July.
Requiring the use of real names in financial dealings has increased pressure
on the government to introduce other changes to counter the threat of
untaxed money flowing out of banks and into the large underground economy -
estimated to be equal to 20 per cent of gross national product - over the
next several years.
Deregulation of all interest rates - a crucial component of the reform
package - is considered instrumental in preventing a liquidity drain because
it would give banks the freedom to offer higher deposit rates and by doing
so improve their ability to attract funds.
The government has freed most lending rates earlier this month and it has
been suggested that deposit rates will be deregulated completely ahead of
the current 1996 deadline.
The financial stability of the banks will also be improved as the government
gradually reduces its interference in the allocation of credit. The state's
past policy of forcing banks to give low-interest loans to strategic
industries has burdened them with a large share of non-performing assets.
Meanwhile, barriers to the free flow of capital into and out of the country
are also set to be dismantled. Foreigners will gain wider access to the
stock and bond markets. Restrictions are being eased on Korean corporate
borrowing abroad. The exchange rate system will be liberalised.
These changes are taking place as Korean officials acknowledge that the
current financial system has outlived its usefulness.
The present financial structure was shaped by the critical role it played in
the country's centralised economy during the past three decades. The state,
for example, used the banking system to funnel scarce capital to the heavy
industries that led Korea's export drive. Interest rates were kept under
control to ensure that strategic companies were provided with cheap funds.
But the past few years have provided a wealth of evidence that the
state-controlled financial system is now hindering industrial performance
and hampering economic development.
Credit allocation has become increasingly inefficient and this has created
distortions in the industrial structure. Money has been poured into favoured
industries that are no longer competitive.
The government's credit policy also promoted the economic dominance of the
nation's large conglomerates, or chaebol, while hindering the growth of
small and medium-sized businesses. The widely-diversified chaebol have grown
too unwieldly and need to concentrate on a few core industries. The lack of
funds for the small business sector has meant that the country's
subcontracting network remains underdeveloped, while entrepreneurial
ventures have been stifled.
COMPANIES that are competing for funds on the open financial markets must
pay high interest rates. Deregulation would eliminate the two-tier financial
system of cheap state-directed industrial loans and expensive open-market
funds, thereby creating a more rational distribution of credit governed by
market forces.
A deregulated financial market and the increased inflow of foreign
investment would eventually lower the nation's high capital cost structure
and improve corporate balance sheets, which are highly-leveraged.
This would allow companies to spend more money on such long-term goals as
research and development instead of devoting considerable financial
resources to servicing their debts. Increased R&amp;D spending is vital since
Korea lacks strength in advanced manufacturing industries that offer export
potential.
While economic arguments alone provide a compelling reason for Korea to
adopt financial liberalisation, it is also facing foreign pressure to relax
restrictions.
The conclusion of the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade negotiations would push the move toward free trade in financial
services.
Korea must also internationalise its financial market if it wants to achieve
its goal of joining the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development by 1996.
The US has been a persistent critic of Korea's closed financial market.
Washington claims that the financial restrictions not only hamper the
operation of foreign banks in Korea, but also represent a barrier to foreign
investment in the country.
Foreign companies, for example, have difficulties in raising sufficient
funds to expand activities. That argument has proved persuasive since Korean
officials are worried about declining foreign investments and a growing
number of disinvestments.
Although momentum appears to be increasing in favour of financial
liberalisation, some foreign financial representatives in Seoul remain
cautious about the scope and timing of the deregulation measures.
'It all looks fine on paper, but we still have yet to see most of the steps
being taken,' said the head of a western brokerage firm. Indeed, some of the
most important liberalisation measures are not scheduled to be introduced
until 1996.
This has raised concerns that the Korean government may revert to its past
record of announcing reforms and then delaying them. The current five-year
liberalisation plan, for example, is only the latest of several similar
programmes that have been offered over the past few years, but which have
failed to be implemented.
Ministry of finance officials argue that this time things will be different.
They point out that the government is showing greater commitment to
liberalisation by offering a precise timetable for the reforms.
Their introduction will also no longer be dependent on the achievement of
macro-economic preconditions, a feature of previous plans that critics
charged would delay the reform process. Moreover, a few reforms, such as the
easing of controls on foreign exchange transactions have been introduced
ahead of schedule.
But the most significant factor that could guarantee successful
implementation of the plan this time is Mr Kim's anti-corruption campaign,
which is weakening bureaucratic resistance to change.
The bureaucracy opposed liberalisation because state control of the economy
provided officials with the opportunity to accept bribes in return for
granting favours to business.
However, the ban on anonymous accounts, which were used to hide pay-offs,
has deprived officials of the possibility to keep their ill-gotten money out
of sight. The result is that bureaucrats may have less incentive to maintain
financial controls.
Moreover, Mr Kim has installed a new generation of reform-minded technocrats
who argued that financial liberalisation is necessary to achieve 'economic
democracy' in what the president has proclaimed as the 'New Korea'.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK launches campaign to market
quality goat milk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW nationwide marketing scheme for goat milk will be launched today to
ensure high-quality supply to a Pounds 16m UK market that is growing at the
rate of 15-20 per cent a year.
The new private company, which includes 12 farmers on its board, is being
set up by Mr Jim Barnard, who runs Barnard and Gooding Dairies in Somerset.
The Ministry of Agriculture's Food from Britain initiative has provided a
Pounds 90,000 grant for the scheme.
'Very few people have any idea of what goat milk is or what it tastes like,
and generally it has a pretty bad image,' Mr Barnard said. It is also more
expensive to produce than cow's milk and can suffer from quality problems.
The new venture will monitor production standards to ensure the milk is of a
uniform quality, as well as act as a central marketing agency - goat milk is
now carried by all the main supermarket chains. The company will also run a
processing arm for goat milk products such as cheese.
Mr Barnard said there was no plan to compete with the main cow's milk
market, but demand for goat milk was growing from consumers who suffered
allergic reactions to other dairy products.
Interest in speciality cheeses is also on the upturn, which has led to
increasing demand from the gourmet sector of the market.
Goat milk accounts for around 1.75 per cent of the dairy products market in
France, while in the UK it is less than 0.1 per cent.
'It is a very fragmented and dispirited industry with three-quarters of all
goats kept in herds of less than eight - that would be the equivalent of two
cows,' Mr Barnard said.
He believes UK demand could increase to a level similar to consumption on
the continent. But he cautions farmers against rushing into goat milk
production, saying that the market expansion must be handled in an orderly
manner if the quality of the product is to be maintained.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Maize prices reach limit as
crop estimate slashed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MAIZE PRICES in Chicago's futures pit soared to the limit of 12 cents a
bushel yesterday, and trade was halted after the market digested figures
from the US Department of Agriculture that slashed the estimated size of
this year's maize harvest to 6.5bn.
Traders expect prices to go higher today, when limits are raised to 18 cents
per bushel.
The USDA's new harvest estimate, released Tuesday, is 30 per cent below last
year's record harvest, and nearly 50bn bushels lower than the government's
estimate only a month ago.
With production estimates for other coarse grains such as oats, sorghum and
barley also near historic lows, livestock farmers and food processors are
already wondering where they will find sufficient supplies to meet their
needs until next year's harvest.
Last year, the US consumed 6.4bn bushels of maize and exported another
1.67bn.
A 2bn-bushel carryover from last year's harvest had been widely expected to
cushion the effects of this year's short harvest. However, Tuesday's revised
production estimates have left analysts estimating how high grain prices
must go to ration demand.
The USDA trimmed its estimate of US maize use and exports, but the supply
situation is still tight.
'We're estimating only 881m bushels in ending stocks this year,' said Mr
Dick Lowey, president of AgResources, a Chicago consulting firm. 'That's the
lowest since 1976, and lower than any drought year we've seen.'
Mr Joel Karlin, analyst with Kemper Securities, agreed. 'There is no room
for error,' he said, 'There just aren't a lot of reserves.'
Soyabean prices also rallied to their allowable limits yesterday, and
livestock futures prices at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange plunged as
traders calculated that farmers would liquidate herds as feed costs
escalate.
The USDA estimated that US soyabean production at 1.83bn bushels, also a
sharp drop from the previous year. Unlike maize, US soyabean stocks were
already thin before this year's harvest.
Analysts said a worldwide shortage of feed grains will have political
repercussions in the US, and would encourage plantings overseas.
Although the USDA has already announced a 5 per cent acreage set-aside
program for farmers next spring, analysts say the agency will be forced to
repeal that directive, and encourage massive plantings to rebuild stocks.
Replacing the shortfall in the coarse grains sector will be more difficult,
as maize, while the largest crop in the US, is only grown in small amounts
in other regions of the world.
Analysts said they expected Chicago maize futures prices for December and
March delivery to rise above Dollars 3.00 per bushel, which should encourage
farmers to sell stocks out of subsidised storage. Soyabean futures prices,
currently well below their July highs, would rally above Dollars 7 per
bushel, analysts said.

White SUGAR futures had another active day after Tuesday's dramatic slump
and steadied. By late afternoon in London the near December price had edged
up Dollars 0.80 to Dollars 280 a tonne. However, dealers were still
unconvinced about a sharp recovery being on the way. 'People will want to
wait a while and lick their wounds before coming back in. The market really
needs the power of the funds to pick it back up again and for that we need a
strong technical signal,' one dealer said. The London Metal Exchange
formally put an end to the recent COPPER squeeze controversy by rescinding
the Dollars 5 a day limit on the backwardation (premium over the future
price for metal for immediate delivery). Traders said the move had no impact
in the market yesterday. 'The LME wanted to make sure the long had
liquidated his position,' one said. 'Over the last few days the position has
been further wound down to a level that causes no concern now,' he added.
ALUMINIUM was firmer, helped by a 9,000-tonne fall in September
International Primary Aluminium Institute producer stocks, and three-month
prices closed at Dollars 1,062.50 a tonne, up Dollars 10.75.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China reduces tariffs on wool
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA has agreed to reduce tariffs on wool tops to 15 per cent, following
strong representation by Australian officials, including the Prime Minister
Paul Keating.
Agreement on the 5 per cent tariff reduction emerged from a meeting in
Beijing this week between Australian and Chinese trade officials. They were
reviewing ways in which the two countries could harmonise their trading
relationship.
Officials were unable to give an estimate of the value to the Australian
wool industry of the tariff reduction, but they said the decision marked a
step towards a further lowering of import duties on textiles fibres, yarns
and fabrics.
Australian wool exports to China in 1991-92, predominantly greasy wool, were
worth ADollars 429m (Dollars 276.7m). Sales have slumped in the past 6
months partly because of a credit squeeze imposed by the Chinese government,
and also because of a sharp depreciation of the local currency.
China's decision to begin modest steps towards lowering tariffs on wool
followed discussions in Beijing in June between Mr Keating and China's
powerful vice-premier in charge of the economy, Mr Zhu Rongji. Mr Keating
said Mr Zhu had assured him that China was prepared to take a serious look
at removing tariffs and quotas on wool with a view to assisting the wool
industry in both countries.
Chinese tariffs on Australian wool are among the highest in Asia.

Prices paid in Australia were steadier this week, with only a few small
rises and some types unchanged or barely maintained. Clearances were still
good at most of the sales held, however, with Japan and Western Europe
buying strongly. In wool using markets some of the recent pressures and
sentiment associated with wool's clear reversal in trend have subsided, and
price resistance is being mentioned as a feature, but there is no question
of weakness replacing strength. The AWC market indicator stood at 504 cents
on November 10, compared with 499 a week before.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UN warns of threat to tungsten
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LOW PRICES threaten the survival of the tungsten industry in many countries
and the security of tungsten supply, Mr Carlos Fortin, deputy
secretary-general of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development,
said yesterday.
Mine operations have fallen to just six small mines in industrialised
countries and 25 in developing countries, compared with 60 and 74
respectively in 1980, Mr Fortin said. Even those were operating at below 60
per cent of capacity.
Tungsten ores and concentrates, which fetched as much as Dollars 170 a tonne
in the late 1970s, were now trading as low as Dollars 20 a tonne, he said.
Tungsten producing and consuming countries have been meeting this week in
Geneva against the background of 'unprecedented distress' in the industry,
which has seen tungsten demand, prices and mine production plunge to their
lowest levels since the mid-1960s.
The 15 countries attending the three-day annual market review, which ended
yesterday, account for about 90 per cent of world trade in tungsten
products. They include China, the biggest producer, which represents over 60
per cent of world trade; Russia, which ranks second in production; and the
three biggest importers, the US, Germany and Japan.
The slide in tungsten prices is largely the result of weak activity in the
main tungsten consuming industries, especially toolmaking, car production
and defence, according to Unctad.
However, structural changes in the tungsten industry, including substitution
by new products, 'do not allow for optimism for the tungsten market even in
the longer term, unless new end-use applications are found', the group said.
During the Geneva meeting, China reported falling exports of tungsten ores
and concentrates in the first nine months of 1993, while the US expected a 9
per cent drop in consumption this year after a 25 per cent fall in 1992.
Unctad's latest estimates show a 17 per cent drop in world consumption last
year to 30,499 tonnes, and a 19 per cent slide in production to 28,864
tonnes. Exports of ores and concentrates slipped by 41 per cent to 7,057
tonnes, reflecting higher consumption of imported intermediate products by
the main consuming countries.
The share of tungsten ores and concentrates in world trade has more than
halved over the past decade, from nearly 70 per cent in 1983 to 30.6 per
cent in 1992.

CYPRUS MINERALS, the US mining group, yesterday became the owner of the
Peruvian copper mine Cerro Verde. In the only bid at the public auction held
in Lima, Cyprus offered Dollars 37m cash and an investment commitment
totalling Dollars 480m over five years.
The offer was well in excess of the base price, set by Minero Peru's
privatisation committee at Dollars 30m cash with a Dollars 160m investment
commitment. Cyprus will develop the mine in association with Buena Ventura,
one Peru's leading mining groups.
Cerro Verde is one of Peru's most attractive copper deposits both for its
location - 30km from the southern city of Arequipa - and its rich reserves,
enough for nearly 50 years.
The mine has been state-owned since its inauguration in 1977. The bulk of
Cerro Verde's copper is produced by pad leaching and
solvent-extraction-electro-winning.
Until 1984, the plant produced 33,000 tonnes a year copper cathodes but when
the oxide ore ran out there was no money for a concentrator plant to treat
the sulphide ore. Output last year was only 18,000 tonnes of cathodes plus
9,000 tonnes of concentrate.
Minero Peru will now stage auctions - for its copper refinery at Ilo and the
zinc refinery of Cajamarquilla.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Closure plan for lead smelter -
European companies to share cost of eliminating overcapacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN LEAD producers are preparing a scheme to eliminate overcapacity in
the region by the permanent closure of a smelter. The cost would be shared
between all the producers.
The scheme is nearly identical to the so-called 'shut down' agreement
European zinc producers are pressing ahead with and hope to complete within
a few months.
Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, chairman of Metallgesellschaft of Germany, said the
lead shut-down scheme was being considered because there was a crisis in the
European lead-zinc industry, caused mainly by a flood of exports to Europe
from the former eastern bloc countries but also by a fundamental structural
imbalance between supply and demand. 'There is over-production of zinc and,
to some extent, of lead,' he said.
He was 'cautiously optimistic' that producers would soon reach agreement on
a zinc smelter shut-down 'and I hope there will be one for lead later'.
The zinc shut-down arrangement must receive approval from the European
Commission. Mr Schimmelbusch said: 'We have a good case because there is a
structural crisis in the industry. But we cannot take approval for granted.'
Mr Schimmelbusch also insisted that the European industry could not ignore
the equally pressing import problem. 'The flood of metal from the east must
be addressed,' he said.
He said MG was working on some ideas to alleviate the problem. He would not
be drawn into giving details but admitted his group was talking to
government representatives and individual smelters in the former eastern
bloc.
'We know the main locations because MG has worked in the region for many,
many years.
'We hope that in the medium term we can come to some sensible arrangements.
They (the former eastern bloc producers) must understand it is wasteful to
pour metals at below cost into a region that already is over-supplied.'
Mr Schimmelbusch acknowledged that the import problems were easing because
ore grades were falling at mines in the former eastern bloc and,
consequently, smelters there were finding it difficult to maintain output at
previous levels.
Mine output has also been falling steeply in western countries, leaving lead
smelters in particular short of essential raw material. For this reason
analysts suggest that the outlook for lead is better than that for any other
metal traded on the London Metal Exchange.
Mine output in the west is forecast by the International Lead &amp; Zinc Study
Group to fall this year by 14 per cent to 1.98m tonnes while metal
production is predicted to fall by 3 per cent to 4.31m tonnes. A small
decline in consumption, from 4.46m tonnes to 4.42m, is also expected.
According the ILZSG, lead imports from the former eastern bloc to the west
last year jumped by nearly 110,000 tonnes to 173,000 tonnes.
The Brook Hunt consultancy is among those making lead the 'star' metal for
1994 and it forecasts an average price of 23 cents a lb (Dollars 507 a
tonne) for next year. Most forecasts are clustering around that price: Ord
Minnett, Lehman Brothers and Rudolf Wolff have predicted that 23 cents would
be the 1994 average. The Economist Intelligence Unit predicts lead will
start 1994 at 23 cents and reach 26 cents by December to give an annual
average of 24.3 cents.
Last night three-month lead closed in London at 19 cents.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee producers to discuss
retention scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE PRODUCERS meet in New York today to discuss modifications to the
producers' retention scheme that came into effect at the beginning of
October. The producers plan to discuss changes to the amount of robusta
coffee held back from the market and a way of checking stock levels.
Brazil made its first purchases as part of the retention scheme last week,
but dealers were surprised at the small amounts bought.
The producers need to buy around 180,000 bags of coffee before next Monday
as part of October's retention plans, but so far, Brazil, which has agreed
to act as a purchasing agent on behalf of producers, has bought only 11,750
bags. Buyers will be back in the market today after having lowered the
quality of coffees they can purchase and raised prices. However, market
traders were sceptical they could meet their obligations.
Talks today and tomorrow are unlikely to have much effect on coffee prices
which have weakened this week, but prices could be boosted if Brazil is
successful in buying most of its commitments.
Producers said they agreed to meet at regular intervals to monitor the
operation of the retention scheme.
The retention scheme aims to keep 20 per cent of their exports off the
market in order to encourage consumers to draw down stocks.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: Prices data dismay spurs long-dated
Treasuries fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LONGER-DATED US Treasury prices fell sharply yesterday in the wake of a
consumer prices report that failed to live up to the bond market's most
optimistic expectations. A disappointing 10-year auction also affected the
market.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  13/16 at
100 9/16 , yielding 6.203 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was down  1/16 at 99 15/32 , to yield 4.142 per cent.
After Tuesday's surprisingly weak producer prices figures, traders and
investors had hoped the October consumer prices data would prove equally
bullish for fixed-income securities. In the event, however, the government
reported that the consumer prices index rose by 0.4 per cent last month.
Although this was broadly in line with most analysts' forecasts,
disappointment that the PPI number was not as encouraging as the CPI figure
sparked early selling by dealers.
The declines at the long end worsened later when commodities prices began to
rise. The seal was finally set on a depressing day when the afternoon
auction of Dollars 11bn of 10-year notes passed with weaker-than-expected
demand for the new securities from retail investors.
EUROPEAN markets again took their cue from the US in the absence of striking
domestic news, and the release of a disappointing CPI figure for October
dragged the main fixed-income markets down in afternoon trading.
GERMAN paper dropped on the combination of the US CPI news and further
supply in the form of 10-year Treuhand bonds. The Bundesbank's decision to
shave one basis point off its repo rate - from 6.39 per cent to 6.38 per
cent - barely caused a ripple as it was roughly in line with the market's
expectations.
The bund futures contract opened at 99.77 and traded in a range of 99.43 to
99.78, with the US news taking the futures down to the low of the day. By
late afternoon, the contract was trading at 99.50.
Dealers reported little outright buying of the new Treuhand bond, saying
that investors continued to switch out of existing Treuhand issues into the
new bond instead.
HIGH-YIELDING European bond markets opened on a strong note, but slipped
back on the US figures.
The Italian market was given an initial boost by the the previous night's
progress on the 1994 budget. The senate passed a key part of the budget on
Tuesday night, and dealers said it was widely expected now that the full
budget - which aims to cut L31,000bn from next year's deficit - will be
approved by the end of the week.
Traders noted two-way movement in Italian bonds, with some participants
worried about the general political background and prospect of new supply
over the next few days. Others, meanwhile, were more optimistic in view of
the progress made on the budget.
The BTP futures contract, which closed at 114.90 on Tuesday, jumped to a
high of 115.27 early in the day, but slipped back to 114.84 by late
afternoon.
LONG-DATED UK government bonds slipped back a quarter of a point, while
short-dated issues lost about  3/32 , with the US inflation news providing
the highlight of the day. 'We try to be independent until lunchtime, and
after that we're slaves to the US,' said one dealer.
Traders expect the gilt market to go through something of a lull ahead of
the November 30 Budget. The Liffe gilt future, which closed at 114.06 on
Tuesday, was trading at 113.29 by late afternoon.
Index-linked gilts saw some of the biggest losses on the day, falling up to
half a point.
JAPANESE government bond futures rallied strongly again and closed at a new
six-year high. The December futures contract opened at 115.28, peaked at
115.44, and closed at 115.36, its highest level since June 12, 1987.
The finance ministry held an auction of Y500bn of 2.4 per cent four-year
paper, the first such sale of four-year debt since 1988. It sold the bonds
at an average yield of 2.308 per cent.

FT  11 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: BAA secures rail finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAA, formerly known as the British Airports Authority, has secured the first
round of bank financing for its proposed rail link between Heathrow airport,
which it operates, and Paddington station in central London.
Japan's Export Import Bank (Exim) has agreed a loan facility of up to Pounds
135m towards the Pounds 300m cost of the project. BAA said it would use
Pounds 30m of the facility early next year, with the balance to be drawn 'if
required'. The terms of the loan were undisclosed.
BAA is in talks with about another 30 banks over short- and long-term loans,
and is likely to announce a deal soon with the European Investment Bank.
About two-thirds of the financing will be fixed-term over at least 15 years.
The rail link project, called Heathrow Express, is a joint venture between
BAA and state-owned British Rail.

FT  11 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Liffe and OMLX to compete for
Mid 250 volume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe) and
OMLX, the London Securities and Derivatives Exchange, will compete
head-to-head for volume on futures and options on the FT-SE Mid 250 index,
it was announced yesterday.
The London Stock Exchange yesterday made a surprise decision to award
licences to introduce derivatives on the index of medium-sized UK companies
to both exchanges. No launch date has yet been set by either exchange.
The confrontation is particularly significant because Liffe products are
traded in futures pits, using the traditional open-outcry method, while OMLX
is an electronic trading system. The battle will therefore be viewed by
proponents of each trading method as a vital test case.
Mr Mark Makepiece, head of indices at the stock exchange, said that to award
an exclusive licence to one exchange would have meant 'denying the market
the right to choose'.
The decision was welcomed by some traders as 'a courageous step', but others
feared that the creation of two rival contracts would split the liquidity of
the market.
'I think its a disappointing decision because dual listing is unlikely to be
a successful formula,' said Mr Michael Heath, a director of Smith New Court,
a leading UK equities marketmaker.
It is possible that the contracts will co-exist, but most traders think it
more likely that one will gain the upper hand. Liffe has several advantages:
it already trades FT-SE 100 futures and options; many houses already have
teams on the Liffe floor; and it is generally better-known.
But OMLX also has its supporters. It is cheaper, requiring no additional
deployment of staff, and some dealers believe that the electronic exchange
is ideally suited to trading low volume contracts - they cite Liffe's poor
record in equity options to date.
The success of any contract will depend on the level of interest among fund
managers, who are expected to use the new contracts for asset allocation and
for hedging.
The FT-SE 100 has underperformed the 250 by 11 per cent so far this year,
underlining the lack of correlation between the two markets.
The FT-SE Mid 250 index is becoming more widely used by UK fund managers,
some of whom now track the FT-SE 350 index (FT-SE 100 and 250) rather than
the FT-A All-Share Index.
However, the success of one exchange's contract over another's will
ultimately be decided by traders, since fund managers are unlikely to
specify which exchange's contracts should be used.

<TEXT>
MITSUBISHI Estate, the Japanese property developer and agent, reported a 5.3
per cent fall in first-half pre-tax profit to Y30.98bn (Dollars 286m)
despite a 43 per cent gain in sales following the recovery of domestic
demand for apartments.
Sales for the period were Y204.3bn, up from Y142.5bn in the corresponding
six months last year.
Apart from an increase in demand for standard apartments, rent income was
boosted by the completion of two large complexes, though profits were eroded
by the resulting increase in depreciation charges.
For the full year to March, Mitsubishi Estate is forecasting sales of
Y430bn, against Y349bn last year, and a pre-tax profit of Y50bn, compared
with Y70.6bn.
Net profit is expected to be unchanged at Y37bn.

FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Western Mining warns of flat
results
</HEADLINE>

   MELBOURNE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN Mining Corporation, the large Australian minerals and metals group
dogged by recent controversy, told shareholders yesterday it expected flat
first-half profits.
'We expect that the financial result for the first half of 1993-94 will be
comparable to the first of last year,' Sir Arvi Parbo, chairman, said at the
annual meeting in Melbourne. He said it was not possible to predict the
full-year result yet, and declined to forecast when metal prices might show
any significant turnround.
Last year, WMC saw pre-tax operating profit fall 23.8 per cent, to ADollars
156.6m (USDollars 105.1m). Profit after tax and abnormals was ADollars 64m.
At a packed meeting, the chairman faced a barrage of critical questioning
from representatives of the Australian Shareholders' Association. Topics
included the presentation of the company's results, disclosure of accounting
principles, and the cost and current valuation of the group's investments in
North America.
One shareholder also wanted to know why 'heads had not rolled' over the
Ernest Henry deposit debacle earlier this year, which led to WMC losing
control of the rich copper-gold deposit in northern Queensland, and paying
out ADollars 20m in legal settlement expenses.
The problem arose when it emerged that WMC employees had trespassed on a
lease held by another mining company to gather data, and then withheld the
result while arranging an option deal over the area.
'The reason why heads didn't roll was that there wasn't any intent to
deceive, any dishonesty,' said the chairman. He added that it would have
been 'against the interests of the company to lose people with high levels
of expertise'.
WMC also told shareholders the WMC Finance arm had raised USDollars 400m
through the issue of two tranches of debt securities in New York. The
capital-raising involved Dollars 250m of notes due 2003.

FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Takeda ahead at halfway stage -
Pharmaceuticals
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN's leading drug companies managed to sustain earnings for the first
half to September, due to firm sales of drugs with wide profit margins and
aggressive cost-cutting efforts.
Takeda Chemical Industries, the industry leader, said its profits grew on
brisk sales of new drugs, although pharmaceutical sales remained almost
flat.
Healthcare items, including its wide variety of 'pep' drinks, fell 10.2 per
cent due to the cold summer, while sales at its chemicals division were hit
by a fall in demand from the electronics and car industries, declining 4.5
per cent.
For the full year to March, Takeda expects unconsolidated sales to remain
flat at Y565bn (Dollars 5bn), and pre-tax profits to fall 3.2 per cent to
Y75bn.
Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical said pre-tax profits for the first half fell due
to the fall in interest income as interest rates declined. However,
operating profits were up 4.5 per cent to Y26.7bn due to brisk sales of its
ulcer drug and a new diuretic compound.
The company expects full year non-consolidated pre-tax profits to rise 0.6
per cent to Y57.5bn on a 6.7 per cent increase in sales to Y260bn.
Fujisawa Pharmaceutical posted firm non-consolidated pre-tax profits, but on
an after-tax level saw a 44.9 per cent plunge to Y1.8bn due to an
extraordinary loss on shareholdings of its unprofitable US subsidiary.
However, the company said firm sales of antibiotics helped overall sales.
For the year to March, Fujisawa expects parent company pre-tax profits to
rise 1.1 per cent to Y236bn and sales to remain flat at Y236bn. After-tax
profits are expected to increase by 2.2 times to Y3bn.
The company revised up its consolidated forecast for the year, due to a
pickup in earnings at Fujisawa USA. The company expects a 28.5 per cent rise
in consolidated pre-tax profits to Y18bn instead of an initial forecast of a
7.1 per cent fall to Y13bn.
Shionogi said its cost-cutting efforts lifted unconsolidated operating
profits by 23.7 per cent to Y9.2bn.
Although it saw increased sales of its allergy formula, overall sales
remained flat due to sluggish revenue of its antibiotics. For the full year,
it expects a 11.1 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y24bn on a 0.4 per
cent increase in sales to Y239bn.
Eizai saw a 4.2 per cent rise in its pharmaceutical division thanks to firm
sales of its ulcer drug.
Full year pre-tax profits for the parent company are expected to rise 2 per
cent to Y32bn on a 2.4 per cent increase in sales to Y224bn.
Daiichi Pharmaceutical said it will raise its interim dividend by Y1 per
share to Y7 and annual dividend by Y2 to Y14 as it pledged to raise its
payout ratio on its bond issuance last April.
The company saw a jump in sales of its antibacterial drug and
antihypertensive compound. However, the yen's appreciation caused a foreign
exchange loss of Y900m. For the year to March, Daiichi sees unconsolidated
pre-tax profits rising 1.8 per cent to Y38.5bn on a 4.3 per cent sales
increase to Y210bn.

per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y30.98bn (Dollars 286m). This was despite
a 43 per cent increase in first-half sales following the recovery of
domestic demand for apartments.
Japanese property companies have been forced to discount rents and selling
prices on new buildings, as a surge in construction during the past four
years has left larger cities with a glut of commercial and luxury
residential properties.
Mitsubishi is fortunate in having large holdings in the Otemachi business
district of Tokyo. However, more recently, it has ventured into new areas,
including Yokohama, where prices and rents have fallen sharply.
Sales for the period were Y204.3bn, up from Y142.5bn in the first half last
year. Apart from an increase in demand for standard apartments, rent income
was boosted by the completion of two large complexes, though profits were

FORESTRY group Carter Holt Harvey yesterday announced a 'significant
improvement' of 47.1 per cent in net profit to NZDollars 165.3m (USDollars
90m) in the six months to September 30.
The company is controlled by a joint venture between International Paper of
New York and Brierley Investments, with 65 per cent of its shares held
publicly.
Directors said that the forestry and wood products sector achieved earnings
before interest and tax of NZDollars 145.6m, a rise of 146 per cent over the
same period of last year.
Sales grew 36.9 per cent to NZDollars 536.5m.
Record high prices for export logs to Asia led to substantially higher
profits in forestry. The group also benefited from increased construction
which meant adjusting local prices for panels and building supplies to
reflect export values.

FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: OK Bazaars to be delisted after
poor six months
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OK BAZAARS, once South Africa's leading discount department store, is to be
delisted after more than 60 years on the Johannesburg stock exchange. The
decision by the company's owner, South African Breweries, follows a poor
half-year in which OK Bazaars ran up a bottom line loss of R40m (Dollars
12m).
The move was revealed yesterday as South African Breweries, the country's
largest consumer company, announced its interim results. The group overcame
a difficult operating climate to record a 12 per cent increase in
attributable profit to R283m in the six months to September from R252m a
year ago.
Mr Meyer Kahn, chairman, said that although South Africa's protracted
recession appeared to have levelled out, it had seriously weakened private
consumption expenditure. The group did, however, manage to increase turnover
by 10 per cent to R11.3bn.
Pressure on margins, however, saw trading profit rise by only 8 per cent to
R971m, but lower rates of interest and taxation helped boost attributable
earnings.
Earnings per share rose by 11 per cent to 103 cents from 93 cents and the
dividend was increased by a similar amount to 39 cents from 35 cents.
Mr Kahn said the short-term prospects for the economy remained highly
uncertain, with progress towards elections next April sure to be accompanied
by disruption. Although not predicting growth 'of any consequence' until
late-1994, the group is seeking to maintain the current level of performance
for the remainder of the financial year.
An indication of the severity of the recession is the fact that beer volumes
fell slightly compared to the same period in 1992, a rare occurrence in the
industry. Beer division profits, however, rose by 12 per cent to R207m.
The group's other interests - ranging from furniture and clothing to hotels
and glass - also increased their contribution by 12 per cent, to R76m
(R68m). This figure, however, disguises some uneven performances.
Earnings per share at Plate Glass rose by 74 per cent, while furniture
company Afcol, appliances group Lion Match and clothing retailer Edgars all
performed well. Furniture, footwear and clothing group Amrel, however, made
increased losses.

FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Tiger Oats increases net income
by 7%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LOWER tax bill helped Tiger Oats, South Africa's largest food group,
record a 7 per cent increase in attributable income to R357m (Dollars 106m)
in the year to September, up from R335m last time.
Low levels of consumer spending continued to place pressure on margins.
Turnover grew by 9 per cent to R10bn, but operating income fell by 3 per
cent to R659m. Earnings per share rose by 3 per cent to 237 cents and the
dividend was increased to 82 cents (79 cents).
The management is not expecting improvements in its markets in the year
ahead, but expects to post better results on the basis of improved operating
efficiencies. Mr Robbie Williams, executive chairman, forecast 'reasonable
earnings' for 1994. Although still regarded as a blue chip stock, the share
has fallen out of favour recently, falling to a current level of R41.50 from
a high earlier this year of R50.
Mr Williams said Tiger Foods had suffered from recession with both sales
volumes and prices under pressure.

<TEXT>
INDIA'S main financial institutions have opposed a move by some Indian
companies to consolidate their holdings through preferential share
allotments at prices lower than those prevailing in the stock market.
The heads of India's largest financial institutions met officials from the
finance ministry and the central bank this week to stress the need for a
rational policy on preferential share pricing.
Financial institutions have agreed that neither Indian promoters keen to
strengthen control of their companies nor multinationals seeking enhanced
equity should be allowed differential share-pricing to the extent that other
shareholders are heavily disadvantaged.
The meeting follows the decision last month not to allow the founding family
of Mahindra and Mahindra, a Bombay-based vehicle and heavy engineering goods
manufacturer, to buy stock at less than one-third the market price. The
institutions were not averse to preference allotments at reasonable
discounts.

FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Swedish steel group moves back
to profit
</HEADLINE>

FIRMER prices and lower processing costs helped SSAB, the Swedish steel
group, swing to a pre-tax profit of SKr355m (Dollars 43m) in the first nine
months from a SKr123m loss in the same period last year.
The company said it expected a full-year profit of around SKr600m, a
dramatic rebound from losses last year of SKr165m.
SSAB, which was privatised last year, said it had benefited from the price
rise in Europe after European steelmakers cut production in response to a 10
per cent fall in consumption.
The price effect was enhanced for SSAB by the devaluation of the Swedish
krona, which left prices for the group's products 5 per cent higher in krona
terms in the first nine months than in the same period last year.
Higher steel prices were the main factor behind a 6 per cent rise in sales
to SKr9.38bn. At the same time SSAB said it achieved a 4 per cent cut in
processing costs through improved productivity and capacity adjustments and
a 5 per cent cut in employee numbers to 9,500.
SSAB said demand for steel in western Europe would remain weak for the rest
of the year and price trends would depend on levels of output.
But it made its full-year forecast based on the group's improved
efficiencies and the lower krona.
The biggest division, Tunnplat steel plate, fell from a loss of SKr113m in
the first nine months of 1992 to a profit of SKr27m this year, on sales up
10 per cent to SKr4.56bn. Group net cash flow improved from SKr70m to
SKr188m.
One-off charges of SKr60m to cover a blast furnace breakdown and the
reinstatement of 200 workers ordered by the Swedish labour court were in
large part offset by a capital gain of SKr40m from sales of shares in Volvo
and Sydkraft.

PROPERTY companies run by Mr George Soros and Mr Paul Reichmann have
confirmed their intention to go-ahead with Dollars 1.05bn in real estate
developments in Mexico City, city officials said yesterday.
They said they expected construction to start immediately and take four to
five years to complete. The three projects involved - developments in Santa
Fe, Alameda and twin tower blocks on the city's main avenue, Paseo de la
Reforma - include office, housing, and hotel developments.
Details of the exact participations would be settled in December, but city
officials said more than 50 per cent of the investment was expected to come
from foreign sources.
The announcement was made yesterday with Mexican financial markets highly
nervous over the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is expected to
be voted on by the US House of Representatives next Wednesday.
Mexico's stock market surged 4.2 per cent yesterday, after the perceived
victory of US vice-president Al Gore over Texan billionaire Ross Perot in
Tuesday night's debate on the North American Free Trade Agreement.

FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: BellSouth provides Dollars 1.2bn
for shake-up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BELLSOUTH, the largest Baby Bell regional telephone company, announced
yesterday that it is to take a Dollars 1.2bn restructuring charge in the
fourth quarter for modernising its network and cutting its workforce by
10,200 over the next three years.
The move comes as the company is weighing whether to join the takeover
battle for entertainment group Paramount Communications by making an
investment in QVC Network, the home shopping channel making a Dollars 9.7bn
hostile bid for the company. Paramount has agreed to a Dollars 10bn takeover
proposal from cable group Viacom.
BellSouth, which provides the local telephone service in the south-eastern
US, is the latest of several regional telecommunications groups taking large
charges to slim down and modernise their operations to cope with growing
competition in the previously monopolistic market.
The company said that the charge, which would reduce net income by Dollars
760m, or Dollars 1.53 a share, was to cover re-engineering of its local
exchange network which would be completed by the end of 1996.
It was 'dramatically changing the way it works with customers, redesigning
its fundamental processes and streamlining systems for handling customer
service'.
Some Dollars 550m of the charge relates to the introduction of new systems,
while Dollars 310m covers consolidating and eliminating certain operations
and Dollars 380m is for job losses.

<TEXT>
ADIA, the Swiss temporary employment agency group, reported deepened losses
in the first nine months of the year. It blamed high interest charges but
said its equity would be boosted by SFr200m (Dollars 24m)in its second
capital restructuring in less than a year.
The group also revealed that German retailer Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus had
agreed to sell its Adia stake to Mr Klaus Jacobs, giving Mr Jacobs a
controlling 56.2 per cent holding.
Adia's operating profits in the first nine months were SFr33.4m, compared
with a loss of SFr83m in the same period of last year. Net loss jumped to
SFr112.2m from a loss of SFr70m, but the group forecast it would break even
in the fourth quarter.
It said the increase in operating profits reflected rising demand in the US,
Britain and Australia, and cost-saving measures in Europe and Japan.
The capital restructuring plan raises SFr100m through a rights issue
underwritten by Mr Jacobs. An additional SFr100m would be created by the
conversion of loans held by a banking consortium led by Credit Suisse. A
representative of the banking group would take a seat on Adia's board of
directors.
Adia would also propose at an annual meeting on December 2 that holders of
its participation certificates swap them into bearer shares.
Sulzer, the Swiss engineering and medical equipment group, said its order
intake of SFr4.4bn in the first nine months of 1993 was 3.3 per cent lower
than in the same period of last year. It expected full-year net profit to be
similar to last year's SFr168m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO LEADING US retailers yesterday said their third-quarter performances had
suffered as a result of special charges against earnings. Woolworth and
Federated Department Stores revealed disappointing sales figures, in
contrast with a batch of retailers reporting a day earlier.
Woolworth, which recently announced plans to close or re-position 970 of its
general merchandise and specialty stores in North America, said a Dollars
480m provision relating to the restructuring programme contributed to a
third-quarter loss of Dollars 452m, or Dollars 3.43 a share.
A year earlier, it posted net income of Dollars 65m, or 50 cents.
Federated Department Stores posted net income of Dollars 20.3m, or 16 cents,
after taking a one-time charge of Dollars 15m for federal tax changes.
If the provision were excluded, earnings would have increased 11.7 per cent
to Dollars 35.3m, or 28 cents, against Dollars 31.6m, or 25 cents, in the
corresponding period of 1992.
For Woolworth, sales declined 4.6 per cent to Dollars 2.38bn. However, the
decline largely stemmed from the poor performance of its general merchandise
stores, which recorded a 10 per cent sales slump. By contrast, specialty
shops showed a modest 1.8 per cent improvement.
Sales at Federated were virtually flat at Dollars 1.78bn. The company, which
operates Bloomingdale's, Jordan Marsh, Lazarus and other full-line
department stories, said the performance was weaker than expected and blamed
it on unusually warm weather this autumn, which depressed apparel sales.
Mr Allen Questrom, Federated's chairman and chief executive, said reductions
in operating expenses had enabled it to counter the effect of weak sales and
higher price markdowns.
On an operating level, earnings were up 3.6 per cent at Dollars 103m,
compared with Dollars 99.5m a year earlier.
The announcements by Woolworth as well as Federated were in line with Wall
Street's expectations and both stocks advanced modestly in morning trade. By
mid-day, Woolworth was up Dollars 1/4 at Dollars 21 and Federated added
Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 20 1/2.

charge for French park

WALT Disney, the US entertainment group, yesterday reported a fourth-quarter
net loss of Dollars 77.8m after taking a Dollars 350m charge associated with
Euro Disney, the troubled French theme park in which it holds a 49 per cent
stake.
The company reported a 10 per cent drop in operating income, from Dollars
395.8m to Dollars 356.7m, on revenues which rose 5 per cent to Dollars
2.2bn, while the net loss worked through at 15 cents a share. In the fourth
quarter of last year Disney made Dollars 224m, or 42 cents a share.
Wall Street analysts were generally sanguine about the lower-than-expected
operating results, pointing to special factors, but some trimmed their 1994
earnings forecasts because of the large losses at Euro Disney. Salomon
Brothers, for example, cut its projection from Dollars 2.05 a share to
Dollars 1.85.
Walt Disney's investment in Euro Disney produced a loss of Dollars 414.5m
for the quarter - including the Dollars 350m charge - and a loss of Dollars
514m for the full year.
Walt Disney said the need for a financial restructuring at Euro Disney had
created uncertainty about the American company's ability to collect its
current receivables from Euro Disney and about its provision of temporary
funding to the associate. Its Dollars 350m charge would fully reserve it
against both, with roughly 50 per cent of the sum accounted for by the
funding.
Walt Disney's theme parks and resorts saw operating income fall 11 per cent
in the quarter to Dollars 190.4m on revenues down 6 per cent at Dollars
933.7m.
Filmed entertainment saw operating income down 22 per cent at Dollars 94.9m
on revenues up 12 per cent to Dollars 879.8m. The company attributed the
drop to an unusually strong 1992 fourth quarter.
For the full year, Disney reported net income of Dollars 299m, or 55 cents a
share, down from Dollars 816m, or Dollars 1.52 a share, after accounting
changes and Euro Disney charges. Its operating income rose 20 per cent to
Dollars 1.72bn on revenues 14 per cent higher at Dollars 8.5bn.

But Mr Derrick Tay, who represents an informal committee of debenture

Trizec's debts total CDollars 5.4bn. The plan is to relieve a heavy

LINDE, the German engineering group, warned yesterday that group profits for

other materials handling machines.
For the nine-months group sales dropped to DM5.17bn (Dollars 3.07m), 4.1 per
cent down on the previous year, while order intake fell 2.7 per cent to
DM5.26bn. For the whole year group sales would be around DM7.2bn, 5 per cent
down from last year, Linde said.
Turnover in the materials handling division fell 17 per cent and orders 16.8
per cent in the nine months, after stripping out the effect of last year's

The company said yesterday that meetings to approve the plan, which were

Trizec initially hoped, when it published its proposals in August, to

But Mr Derrick Tay, a lawyer who represents an informal committee of
debenture holders, said yesterday: 'We cannot be rushed.'
The seven-member committee includes representatives of Union Bank of
Switzerland, Commerzbank, Westdeutsche Landesbank and Canadian institutions.
Many of the debentures, however, are in bearer form, and their holders
cannot be easily traced.
Trizec has debts totalling CDollars 5.4bn. The plan is designed to relieve a

senior and junior debentures as well as preferred shares into common equity.

TURNER Broadcasting System, which owns the CNN television news service,
yesterday reported net income of Dollars 1m in the third quarter, down from
Dollars 12.5m in the same period of last year.
The fall was due to the costs of overseas expansion and a Dollars 6m
extraordinary charge for early termination of debt.
Mr Ted Turner, the chairman, said the company's core business performed
relatively well, with advertising revenue up 11 per cent.
'The decrease in profitability is primarily related to investment in new
businesses, particularly overseas.
'The impact of this sort of investment is consistent with our past
philosophy of sustaining operating losses in the near-term in order to
create a valued asset in the long-term.'
The company's operating profit dipped from Dollars 64.1m to Dollars 59.9m on
revenues of Dollars 501m, up from Dollars 456.4m, while earnings per share
worked through at zero, compared with 5 cents. Turner's interest burden rose
from Dollars 46.9m to Dollars 48.2m.
Operating profit at the entertainment segment rose 6 per cent to Dollars
46m, while the news business was up 22 per cent at Dollars 8m, and
syndication lost Dollars 10m, Dollars 6m more than last year.
For the nine months the group reported a Dollars 254m net loss after a
Dollars 306m charge for accounting changes, compared with a profit of
Dollars 48m.

FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Novell gains OS market foothold

<TEXT>
NOVELL, the US software company, and Zenith Data Systems, the personal
computer subsidiary of Groupe Bull of France, have reached an agreement
which should give Novell a toe-hold in the market for personal computer
operating software.
The operating system (OS) is the software program that controls the basic
functions of a computer. The OS market is dominated by Microsoft of the US,
which charges manufacturers a licence fee for each computer sold with its
MS/DOS system. Most of the world's 90m personal computers run MS/DOS. Apple
personal computers are the major exception.
In January, however, Zenith is set to launch a line of personal computers,
called Personal Servers, pre-loaded with Novell's DOS software, a program
that directly competes with Microsoft's MS-DOS.
Analysts said the move would represent a significant breach of Microsoft's
control over the PC operating system software market.
A broader deal, being evaluated by Groupe Bull's Zenith as well as
Packard-Bell, the US PC manufacturer in which Bull last year acquired a 19.9
per cent stake, could enable Novell to encroach still further into
Microsoft's territory.
ZDS is considering pre-loading Novell's latest version of DOS on its desktop
PC products; PC buyers would be given a choice of using the Microsoft or
Novell operating systems.
No PC maker has yet pre-loaded its machines with Novell DOS. Computer
companies say that is because they are already locked into contracts with
Microsoft that require them to pay a royalty fee on every machine they ship.
Microsoft, however, asserts that its licensing policies apply to particular
PC models, rather than to the full range of a PC manufacturer's products. A
spokesman also noted that computer makers can opt to license Microsoft
software on a per copy basis, if they choose.
With Novell apparently offering more favourable terms than Microsoft for DOS
programs, other PC manufacturers are expected to watch Zenith's moves
closely.
Mr Raymond Noorda, Novell chief executive said: 'These manufacturers are in
a low margin business. They want to get computers out the door and make a
penny on every one of them.
'They cannot fool around with large dollar issues on the costs of what they
ship. Paying Microsoft a royalty is a significant part of the total cost.'
Zenith is understood to have spent months searching for a loophole in its
Microsoft DOS licensing contract to ensure it would not owe royalties to
Microsoft for its new Personal Servers. The contract stated that royalties
would not be owed on machines that could not run Microsoft DOS. Zenith
engineers made sure this would be the case for the new computers.
While allowing computers on a local area network to run existing software,
the Personal Server, which controls the network, will be driven by Novell
DOS. PC users on the network need not know nor care which operating system
is running on the Personal Server, experts say.

<TEXT>
BF GOODRICH, the Ohio-based specialty chemical and aerospace company, is to
acquire Rosemount Aerospace from the Emerson Electric Company for Dollars
300m in cash, pending regulatory approval.
The acquisition is the largest in Goodrich's history, and strengthens the
company's position as a producer of intelligent aircraft monitoring systems.
Analysts said the sale by Emerson reflected continuing consolidation in the
US aerospace industry.
Rosemount Aerospace, based in Burnsville, Minnesota, posted fiscal 1993
sales of Dollars 130m and has 1,200 employees, with manufacturing facilities
in Minnesota and Bognor Regis, UK.
Mr David Burner, president of BF Goodrich Aerospace said: 'This acquisition
is a significant step in our planned growth as a developer and integrator of
aircraft systems.'
Goodrich employs 12,000 and had sales of Dollars 1.6bn in 1992. Its
aerospace division reported operating income of Dollars 27.4m in the third
quarter, on sales of Dollars 243.2m.
Huntsman, the US's largest privately-owned chemicals group, yesterday
continued its acquisition campaign with the purchase of two American
businesses of Monsanto. The transaction price was not disclosed, writes Paul
Abrahams.
The operations, with a combined annual turnover of Dollars 200m, manufacture
linear alkyl benzene, used in detergents, and maleic anhydride, a chemical
contained in bathroom fixtures, mouthwash and artificial sweeteners.

FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Arthur Andersen posts 8% climb
in fee income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARTHUR Andersen, the accountancy firm, yesterday announced fee income up 8
per cent to Dollars 6bn in the year to August 31.
The figures relate to the global results for Arthur Andersen &amp; Co, the
Swiss-based organisation. They included a 6.6 per cent rise to Dollars 3.2bn
from Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm, and a 10 per cent rise to
Dollars 2.8bn for Andersen Consulting.
Mr Lawrence Weinbach, managing partner-chief executive of the firm, who was
in London for its annual partners' meeting, said the results reflected the
firm's focus on 'consistent high quality client service'.
He said that revenues would have been up by 11 per cent at 1992 exchange
rates, but that the increase was less marked because of a strengthened US
dollar during the year.
In line with its normal practice, the firm refused to provide any
information on its profits. It argues that it is under no obligation to
issue this information, has no outside investors and that the figures would
be misinterpreted.
The firm increased staff during the year to 65,591 from 59,680 and partners
to 2,487 from 2,454. It increased the number of offices to 350 in 72
countries from 318.
The global results included a 12 per cent rise in revenues from the UK firm,
up to Pounds 407m. It would not split the figures between Arthur Andersen
and Andersen Consulting. Revenue was Dollars 3.3bn in the Americas, Dollars
2.2bn in Europe, Middle East, India and Africa, and Dollars 531m in
Asia/Pacific.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Gota Bank posts modest improvement

<TEXT>
GOTA Bank, the state-owned Swedish bank due to be privatised by the end of
this year, yesterday reported an operating loss of SKr8.48bn (Dollars
1.05bn) for the first nine months of 1993, a modest improvement on the
SKr9.43bn loss sustained in the same period last year.
The bank said its credit losses had shrunk to SKr7.8bn in the nine months
from SKr9.39bn.
Gota's operating loss after the inclusion of financial insurance and
SKr7.61bn in drawn-down state guarantees was SKr785m, compared with a loss
of SKr1.56bn the year before.
Gota said it had by September utilised SKr13.8bn in state guarantees out of
a total of SKr15bn pledged by the government to rescue the bank from the
loan loss crisis which crippled the Swedish banking sector last year.
The government, which was forced to take over Gota during the crisis, is to
strip out SKr43bn of the bank's bad assets into a so-called bad bank, called
Retriva, which will stay in state hands when Gota is sold.
The state is considering bids from Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken,
Handelsbanken and Nordbanken of Sweden. The single foreign bidder is
understood to be General Electric of the US.

FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Hoechst may cut dividend again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in Hoechst, one of Germany's big-three chemicals groups, may
face a further dividend cut this year following a 40 per cent earnings
decline in the first nine months to DM924m (Dollars 543m), chairman Mr
Wolfgang Hilger hinted yesterday.
The company was likely to withdraw from unprofitable businesses if
conditions did not improve, he said.
Although he gave no further details, he said he was particularly unhappy
about the European fibres business and polypropylene manufacture.
The size of the 1993 dividend would depend on developments in the final
quarter and the early part of the new year, he added.
However, October had not lived up to expectations, prices were still
unsatisfactory and there had been no change in incoming orders. The payout
last year was cut to DM9 from DM12 a share.
The group said the domestic business was not expected to deteriorate
further, and seasonal improvements were likely to bolster pharmaceuticals
operations in north America.
In a gloomy review of the year to the end of September, Mr Hilger
highlighted the poor performance at the German parent, Hoechst AG, where
operating results were deep in the red. Its pre-tax profits of DM367m, down
55 per cent on 1992, stemmed entirely from investment income, he said.
While group turnover was more or less stable at DM34bn, and volume sales
were hardly changed and prices were down 1 per cent, nine-month sales at
Hoechst AG had dropped 10 per cent. Volumes were 6 per cent lower and prices
had dropped 4 per cent.
Turnover in the healthcare businesses contributed the largest proportion to
group sales for the first time, relegating chemicals and dyes to second
place.
Worldwide operating profits from pharmaceuticals were DM200m down on the
comparable part of 1992.

FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: VW reduces loss in first nine
months to DM1.5bn
</HEADLINE>

VOLKSWAGEN whittled losses for the first nine months of this year to
DM1.53bn (Dollars 900m), helped by group net profits of DM70m in the third
quarter, the troubled German-based motor group announced yesterday.
Earnings of DM177m at the Volkswagen AG parent company in the three months
to the end of September reduced the deficit there to DM768m, compared with
DM946m at the half-way mark and a profit of DM289 in the comparable part of
1992, when group earnings were DM549m.
Although the improvement had long been signalled through informal monthly
reports from Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman, the news was well received on the
Frankfurt stock exchange.
VW shares rose by sharply in early trading, leading a short-lived surge in
the DAX index of leading stocks, and slipped later to close DM3.30 higher at
DM395.
A suggestion from a member of the supervisory board that the group should
pay no dividend, compared with DM2 last year, came after the market closed.
In a letter to shareholders, the company attributed most of the group loss
to difficulties in the Spanish market, and 'the high investment costs and
advance payments for new models' which had led to profit problems at Seat,
its Spanish subsidiary.
The letter gave no further details, although VW had earlier forecast a
DM1.25bn deficit at Seat for the full year. Executives at Audi, the quality
car subsidiary, last week forecast heavy losses for 1993 after a half-way
deficit of almost DM200m.
Group production worldwide had fallen 16.3 per cent in the first nine months
to 2.19m vehicles; deliveries to dealers were down 15.4 per cent at 2.16m
and deliveries to customers were 12.5 per cent lower at 2.33m. Turnover was
11.4 per cent lower at DM56.4bn compared with DM63.6bn in 1992.
Only Skoda, the Czech brand, managed to increase unit sales, showing a 13
per cent improvement to 158,000. Volkswagen marque deliveries were 11 per
cent lower, Audi slumped 26 per cent while Seat slid 16.5 per cent.
The group maintained its leading market share in western Europe in spite of
a slip to 16.4 per cent from 17.5 per cent a year earlier, and a 19.4 per
cent slump in deliveries to customers.
Its share of the German market, where sales slid 22 per cent, declined 0.7
percentage points to 28.5 per cent.

FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Siemens earnings steady at
DM1.98bn
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIEMENS, one of Germany's most recession-proof industrial concerns, improved
net earnings by 1 per cent to DM1.98bn (Dollars 1.2bn) in the year to the
end of September, and will pay an unchanged dividend of DM13.
Incoming orders fell by 2 per cent, the first fall for seven years, but
deliveries of outstanding orders helped Siemens increase global sales by 4
per cent to DM81.7bn.
Falling demand in Germany led to a drop of 6 per cent in domestic orders.
Turnover in Germany rose 2 per cent to DM37.3bn. Foreign demand rose 2 per
cent, while sales climbed 6 per cent to DM44.4bn. The effects of recession
were felt most strongly in automation, drives, switching technology, and
medical electronics, the company said.
The results were adversely affected by heavy losses at the computer
business, Siemens Nixdorf Informationssyteme (SNI). However, the deficit
shrank to DM419m, from DM513m in 1992, on turnover down 9 per cent at
DM11.9bn.
No earnings details were available on semiconductors, although incoming
orders rose 33 per cent during the year and sales increased 14 per cent to
DM2.1bn.
Telecommunications, the largest group of businesses within the group,
recorded sales increases of 3 per cent in the public sector and 16 per cent
in private networks.
However, public orders dropped 7 per cent, reflecting the international
squeeze on government spending, while the turnover from private
telecommunications was bolstered by the first-time consolidation of the US
Rolms business.
Sales by the KWU power generation subsidiary jumped 32 per cent, although
new orders rose by only 1 per cent.
Siemens Verkehrstechnik, the railways arm, increased turnover 32 per cent to
DM3.6bn and booked 33 per cent more new orders than in 1991-92. This was the
only operating division not to reduce its workforce during the year.

PROCORDIA, the Swedish pharmaceuticals and consumer products group,
yesterday announced a SKr1.47bn (Dollars 181m) pre-tax profit for the three
months ended September, up 42 per cent from the same 1992 period.
The company, which is controlled by the state and the Volvo motor group, is
in the process of being split into two separate companies. The drugs side is
likely to be privatised next year. Volvo is bidding for the consumer
products operations.
The first-quarter results show that it was Pharmacia, as the pharmaceutical
and biotechnology operations will be known, that was the main contributor to
the performance with a pre-tax profit of SKr911m.
Branded Consumer Products (BCP), which Volvo is seeking to acquire as part
of a trade-off with the Swedish government, made a SKr563m profit.
Analysts said the figures were unlikely to affect the terms of Volvo's bid
for the outstanding 26.3 per cent of BCP which it doesn't own. A stronger
performance at BCP might have forced Volvo to improve its offer. The terms
value BCP at SKr11.9bn.
Revenues at Pharmacia soared 88 per cent to SKr6.55bn thanks to currency
factors and the inclusion of the newly-acquired Italian pharmaceuticals
group Farmitalia Carlo Erba (FICE). The unit more than doubled income from
ongoing operations to SKr996m from SKr408m, after FICE made a first time
contribution of SKr203m.
Revenues at BCP fell 8 per cent to SKr5.47bn and income from ongoing
operations was 2 per cent lower at SKr565m.

<TEXT>
NORSK HYDRO, Norway's biggest stock market listed company, and EniChem
Agricoltura, part of Italy's Eni group, are to merge their southern European
fertiliser activities into a joint venture.
The deal, subject to regulatory approval, should be ready by the first
quarter of 1994. First-year sales for the new company, which will have some
800 employees, should reach about L800bn (Dollars 487m).
The venture will comprise EniChem Agricoltura's two most efficient plants at
Ferrara and Ravenna and Hydro's fertiliser unit in Ambes, France, as well as
both groups' fertiliser marketing organisations in Italy, southern France,
Spain, Greece and Portugal.
The merger has been triggered by difficulties in Europe's fertiliser
business caused by gross overcapacity and severe price competition. Matters
have been exacerbated by lower demand from farmers and a sharp rise in
imports, especially from eastern Europe.
'This has led to a substantial over-capacity in the European fertiliser
industry, making structural changes necessary,' said Norsk Hydro. It
estimates about 4m tonnes of European fertiliser production will be shut
down throughout the continent by 1994.
Both companies have experienced difficulties with their fertiliser
activities. Hydro suffered operating losses of NKr237m (Dollars 32m) on
fertiliser sales of NKr16bn in 1992. The previous year, it took a NKr1.5bn
restructuring charge for its fertiliser activities. The group has shut down
about 2.5m tonnes of fertiliser production capacity.
EniChem has been restructuring, although its efforts have been hampered by
political difficulties and Italy's tough job protection laws.
Its Gela plant in Sicily has been sold, while a unit in Liguria is up for
sale.
Although the fate of its other facilities is unclear, observers say the two
plants being contributed to the joint venture may represent EniChem
Agricoltura's only capacity in the fertilisers field.

FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: SAS plunges to SKr1.75bn deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System (SAS) has plunged into a SKr1.75bn (Dollars
216m) loss after financial items for the first nine months, sharply
reversing the SKr592m profit it made in the same 1992 period.
The deterioration underlines the urgency of the group's efforts to merge
with three other European airlines - KLM Royal Dutch, Swissair and Austrian
Airlines - in the Alcazar project.
It has led the airline to promise 'an intensive result improvement
programme' to help it get back into profit. The measures being considered
include job losses, route closures, and the sale and leaseback of aircraft.
SAS blamed its deficit on the weakening of the Swedish krona, which produced
unrealised exchange losses of SKr1.15bn.
A 2 per cent drop in passenger yields and losses on hotel and leisure
operations aggravated its position.
Operating revenues climbed 15 per cent to SKr29.2bn, but this was
outstripped by a 21 per cent rise in expenses to SKr27.4bn.
The airline admits it has fallen behind schedule on a targeted 8 per cent
cut in costs this year, and is promising to beef up the efficiency drive in
1994.
Pre-tax losses were held to SKr1.13bn after a SKr500m gain from the sale of
part of SAS Service Partner, the airline's catering unit.
The airline benefited from a 2 per cent increase in passengers to 14.1m,
while traffic in revenue passenger kilometres was up 7 per cent from last
year.
The most difficult market has been Sweden, where deregulation has brought a
14 per cent decline in traffic.
Compensating for this was favourable growth on European, Intercontinental
and domestic Norwegian routes.
SAS expects its full-year figures to show a slight improvement over the
nine-month results, helped by a stronger Swedish krona.
Mr Jan Carlzon, who stepped down as chief executive of SAS in September to
add impetus to the Alcazar talks, yesterday warned that the merger project
would collapse if the European carriers could not agree on the choice of a
US partner before the end of this month.
His remarks were quoted in the Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet, which said
SAS was planning to cut 3,000 out of 39,000 jobs.

EUROPEAN Colour, the Stockport-based chemical colour manufacturer, reported
pre-tax profits almost doubled at Pounds 521,000 for the six months to
September 30, against Pounds 265,000.
Sales advanced 11 per cent from Pounds 6.98m to Pounds 7.75m with a 23 per
cent rise in Europe. Earnings per share were 1.16p (0.59p) and the interim
dividend is being raised to 0.35p (0.275p).
Mr Henry Finchett, chairman, said the improving profit trend, which had
started to emerge at the interim stage last year, had continued.
Sales growth was the result of its product development programme. Profit
growth had been helped by further improvements in production efficiencies.
On prospects, Mr Finchett said demand had declined, particularly in Europe
over the last six months, but the company had been able to make up for that
by increasing the number of European customers.

FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Acquisition behind 21% rise at ACT to
Pounds 11.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACT, the Birmingham-based computer services company, saw steady progress in
the half year to September 30 with the figures boosted substantially by the
acquisition of the BIS Group in June.
Pre-tax profits rose 21 per cent from Pounds 9.54m to Pounds 11.5m. Turnover
advanced 49 per cent to Pounds 107.6m (Pounds 72.1m), of which Pounds 24.4m
related to the acquisition. Operating profits were Pounds 11.5m (Pounds
8.76m) helped by a Pounds 2.59m contribution from BIS.
Turnover from continuing operations rose 15 per cent while pre-tax profits
on continuing operations were flat.
The acquisition of BIS cost Pounds 93.5m. There was a net interest charge
this time of Pounds 9,000, compared with interest received of Pounds
788,000. However, the company retains positive net cash balances.
Mr Roger Foster, chairman, said he was satisfied with progress in a
difficult six months. Profits from continuing operations had been held back
by some reduction at ACT Kindle, part of the banking software activities.
Kindle's orders during the half year had grown 18 per cent, but the order
backlog was up 69 per cent costing the company sales and profits.
The banking side of BIS continued to show growth year on year of about 20
per cent, chiefly through the continued success of Midas, its branch banking
package, and DR1, an electronic dealing system.
The information systems side of BIS had underperformed, Mr Foster said, as
orders had slackened during the summer months. A new ACT Business Systems
company had been created from Logsys, ACT's systems company and the IS
division of BIS.
Mr Foster said he was confident about the second half, traditionally the
company's better six months, as activity in the banking sector intensified.
Earnings per share rose to 5.24p (5.01p). The interim dividend remains
unchanged at 1.75p.

<TEXT>
John Wood Group and Foster Wheeler have acquired from the JP Kenny group its
worldwide engineering companies other than those in the former Soviet Union.
The deal is worth about Pounds 5m, including a capital injection by the
purchasers.
A new company, JP Kenny Engineering, has been formed to take over all the
specialist pipeline and undersea engineering services. It has an estimated
turnover of Pounds 14m for the first nine months of this year, and about 320
full-time employees worldwide.
John Wood, based in Aberdeen, is the UK's largest indigenous oil services
company, and Foster Wheeler is the UK subsidiary of Foster Wheeler
Corporation, the US engineering company. The two companies, which already
have joint ventures together, said that JP Kenny's expertise would expand
their services to the oil and gas industries.

FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Chamberlin &amp; Hill up to Pounds 787,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN IMPROVEMENT in its light engineering companies enabled Chamberlin &amp; Hill,
maker of iron castings, electrical conduit fittings and switchgear, to raise
pre-tax profits by 8 per cent from Pounds 728,000 to Pounds 787,000 in the
six months to September 30.
Mr John Eccles, chairman, predicted that given order books were somewhat
stronger than at the same time last year, the company expected to make
further progress in the second half.
The shares responded with a 7p rise to 185p yesterday.
Trading conditions generally showed a modest improvement during the period,
Mr Eccles said. Although inflation at the consumer price level remained low,
raw material and electricity prices continued to rise sharply and this was
putting increased pressure on foundry margins.
First-half turnover advanced from Pounds 9.95m to Pounds 10.4m, while
interest charges were lower at Pounds 70,000 (Pounds 96,000). Earnings per
share increased from 6.82p to 7.35p and the interim dividend has been
stepped up to 2p (1.75p).

FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Reorganised Ingham at Pounds 1.5m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INGHAM, the worsted spinner and car parts distributor, returned profits of
Pounds 1.47m pre-tax for the half year ended September 30.
The car parts division, Transtar International and Moss Europe, acquired in
September 1992 and May 1993 respectively, contributed Pounds 1.23m.
The comparative figure given of Pounds 135,000 stemmed from the spinning and
property trading activities.
Group turnover totalled Pounds 13.55m (Pounds 2.98m), of which car parts
contributed Pounds 10.26m - the division mainly retails parts for British
classic sports cars.
Moss Europe performed well, but Transtar continued to suffer from the
recession and the sale of its direct business in the US to Milard which had
the effect of reducting its turnover and profits.
Profits of George Ingham, the worsted spinning activity, rose to Pounds
115,000 (Pounds 85,000) and the company still has a 'strong order book'.
Exceptional credits of Pounds 256,000 (nil) mainly reflected the disposal of
Transtar's direct US business.
Earnings emerged at 7.1p (3.1p). An interim dividend of 1.75p (1.5p) is
being paid - the directors have already announced their intention to
recommend a total of not less than 4.75p.

FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Analysts peer into the crystal ball -
Pearson's demerger of Royal Doulton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOBER-suited men and women have been caught peering under the edges of their
lunch-laden china plates in recent weeks. As analysts and fund managers,
they have been researching the demerger of Royal Doulton from its media
parent Pearson, which also owns the Financial Times.
It is expected that their remaining questions will be answered today when
the listing particulars are published. These are widely expected to offer
investors one Royal Doulton share for every 10 of Pearson's, and are likely
to include a Royal Doulton dividend payment to sweeten the deal in addition
to Pearson's forecast of a maintained 12p for the year.
The City is awaiting the other details, having so far lacked information in
a poorly researched sector. Brokers are expecting heavy trading in the stock
immediately after demerger.
Shareholders who bought Pearson for its media potential may not want to hold
stock in a much smaller company operating in what is perceived to be a slow
moving, luxury goods market. The question is, just how anxious will they be
to sell?
Such decisions are likely to hinge in part on whether Pearson and Royal
Doulton are able to answer questions over the decision to demerge. 'If it
was such a good company, it would have been floated, or the management would
have got together to do a management buy-out,' said one analyst.
Pearson would argue that it is giving the benefits of Royal Doulton to
shareholders who will have the choice of staying with a recovery stock or
selling it to realise the value.
Analysts are also questioning the timing of the demerger. Pearson says the
demerger is part of its decision to focus on media, and any postponement
would mean at least a four-month delay.
Although less than two months away from Doulton's year-end, the particulars
will not include a profits forecast, partly due to the importance and
uncertainty of the Christmas trading period. The offer document, however, is
likely to include details of a notional full-year dividend pay-out, which
will make the shares attractive on a yield basis.
That attraction will be crucial in light of the group's three-year trading
record. Since 1990, operating profits have halved to Pounds 10.9m last year,
on virtually steady turnover of Pounds 201m, while pre-tax profits have
collapsed from Pounds 17.6m to Pounds 3.9m. For the six months to June 30,
Doulton incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.9m, after Pounds 3.2m of
exceptional charges, against a Pounds 1.1m loss last year.
Royal Doulton's rivals have suffered similar fates. The global fine china
market - of which Royal Doulton claims 10 per cent - is estimated to have
declined by 20 per cent in the last three years, as both recession and a
shift in consumer tastes towards more informal dinnerware take their toll.
This decline has left the other six global players - Wedgwood of the UK,
Villeroy &amp; Boch, Rosenthal and Hutschenreuther of Germany, Noritake of
Japan, and Lenox of the US, fighting for ever shrinking shares.
However, Mr Stuart Lyons, Royal Doulton's chief executive, is optimistic
about the group's quoted future. 'We will have the flexibility to determine
our own strategy,' he says.
Until now, Royal Doulton's strategy has been heavily backed by investment
from Pearson. Over the last three years, Pearson has invested significantly
more than the Pounds 15.3m depreciation charges. The result has been great
strides in automating what has always been a labour intensive industry.
This has allowed Royal Doulton to decrease its dependence on the more
expensive, traditional china sector and expand into new markets such as
selling less expensive bone china to chain stores such as Marks and Spencer
and Safeway.
Technology is even being applied to the traditional figurine business. The
time to produce a figurine has fallen from 18 days to 12. Royal Doulton has
also carved itself a niche in supplying china to the airline and hotel
market.
But perhaps the best guide to Royal Doulton's future strategy is the
development of its crystal business. Since the 1980s Royal Doulton has
formed partnerships with crystal manufacturers abroad who make products
according to its specifications. Now more than half of Royal Doulton's
crystal is supplied from outside the group.
The implications are obvious for the china business, although it will have
the tricky task of balancing some external sourcing with upholding its
premium brands.
Observers also speculate that Royal Doulton will find growth by exploiting
its brand in the wider home furnishings market.
Other china manufacturers such as Wedgwood have begun to introduce products
such as tablecloths and napkins co-ordinated with their china patterns.
There is a danger, however, that such moves could take the shine off what is
considered a premium brand. 'Royal Doulton will have to be careful they do
not bite the hand that feeds them,' one analyst says.
Even though many of the questions over Royal Doulton's financial structure
should be answered today, analysts are expecting heavy initial selling as
media investors reshape portfolios.
Thus, says one, logic dictates that to sell immediately would be
ill-advised: 'It may be worth taking the final dividend and then having
another look.'

FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Three investment trusts are ready for
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE new investment trusts are coming to the market as the industry
continues to take advantage of the low discount on which its shares trade,
and private investor enthusiasm for equities.
Govett High Income Investment Trust is attempting to raise Pounds 50m via a
placing and offer-for-subscription. The new trust will invest in a
combination of UK shares, international high yield bonds and emerging
markets to offer investors an initial gross yield of 7 per cent.
The trust is issuing up to 50m ordinary shares at 100p each, with warrants
attached on a 1-for-5 basis. Some 34m shares are being placed, with the
balance of 16m on offer to the public.
The aim of the trust will be to provide a high and steadily rising income,
with the potential for long-term capital growth. More than 50 per cent of
the portfolio will be kept in UK equities to ensure the trust qualifies for
Personal Equity Plan status; income and capital gains from a Pep are
tax-free. Dividends will be paid quarterly.
The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000 and dealings in the shares are
expected to start on December 3.
Kleinwort Second Endowment Policy Trust will invest in second-hand
with-profits endowment policies. It is usually more profitable for
policyholders to sell their unwanted policies than to surrender them to the
insurance company; the attraction for those who buy the policies is the
relatively stable and tax-efficient returns on offer.
Kleinwort is placing 15m shares and is offering a further 5m shares to the
public. The issue price is 100p, with 50p payable on application and a
further 50p payable in six months' time. The minimum subscription is for
1,000 shares.
Last year, Kleinwort Endowment Policy Trust was launched with a similar
investment strategy. Its shares are trading at 114.5p, com-pared with a
launch price of 100p.
The new trust will primarily be buying policies which mature between 2005
and 2006, coinciding with the planned wind-up of the trust.
The Friends Provident Ethical Investment Trust is seeking to raise over
Pounds 30m. The trust will have a split capital structure, with zero
dividend and ordinary shares. The zeros will pay no income but will have the
first claim on the assets, and will offer a growth rate of about 8 per cent.
The ordinary shares will receive all the dividend income of the trust and
will pay an initial gross yield of 8 per cent. The shares will qualify for
inclusion in a Personal Equity Plan. However, the ordinary shares will only
be entitled to the assets of the trust when it is wound up in eight years,
after the zeros have been repaid.
Shares will be selected for the fund on both positive (eg backing companies
which benefit the community) and negative (eg avoiding companies which deal
in tobacco or arms) criteria.
The shares will be payable in two instalments: 60p on application and a
further 40p (for the ordinaries) and 43p (for the zeros) in February 1994.
The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000.

FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Etam calls truce with Oceana
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ETAM, the fashion retailer, yesterday declared a truce with its erstwhile
foe and largest shareholder, Oceana Investment, by appointing to its board
two directors from the South African held group.
Mr Keith Miles, finance director, said the appointment of Mr Stanley Lewis
and his son Michael as non-executive directors would give Etam the stability
it needed to concentrate on its business. 'It allows us to focus on the
bottom line and not be looking over our shoulders,' Mr Miles said.
Oceana is the vehicle for the South African Lewis family, which owns a 50
per cent share in one of the country's leading fashion retailers, Foschini,
and 36.25 per cent of Etam. Oceana failed in its hostile Pounds 121m bid to
take over Etam two years ago and in efforts to get board representation.
Mr Miles said Etam had dropped its resistance to board appointments after it
became clear that Oceana backed the current strategy. 'It was a realisation
that they are not short-term players and that they have decided to support
the management,' Mr Miles said.
The new directors will form part of the 14-strong Etam board. Oceana intends
to continue adding 1 per cent a year to its Etam holding, as allowed by
takeover rules.

FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: US acquisition helps Amersham to 71%
advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXCHANGE rate movements, a US acquisition and underlying business growth
helped Amersham International, the health science group, to increase pre-tax
profit by 71 per cent from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds 17.4m in the six months to
September 30.
The advance was achieved on turnover, which rose by 23 per cent to Pounds
153.7m (Pounds 124.8m). The increase included a Pounds 15.8m first time
contribution from US Biochemical, acquired in April, partly offset by a
Pounds 13.3m reduction from the Clinical Reagents business which has been
sold.
Mr Kirk Stephenson, finance director, said that like-for-like sales
increased by 9 per cent.
Trading profits increased by 54 per cent to Pounds 26.6m (Pounds 17.3m) with
US Biochemical accounting for Pounds 2.1m of the increase.
After increased research and development spending of Pounds 9.2m (Pounds
7.6m), operating profits were up 79 per cent to Pounds 17.4m (Pounds 9.7m)
including a Pounds 5.6m benefit from exchange rate movements and Pounds 1.3m
from US Biochemical. Underlying growth was 10 per cent.
Net interest costs of Pounds 200,000 this time compared with net receipts of
Pounds 400,000. At the end of September the group had net borrowings of
Pounds 100,000 compared with net cash of Pounds 2.6m six months before. The
turnround was after a Pounds 8m outflow in connection with the US
acquisition.
Life sciences, the largest division, which sells reagents to medical and
pharmaceutical research establishments, was boosted by the US acquisition
and posted operating profits of Pounds 15.6m (Pounds 9.8m) on turnover of
Pounds 72.4m (Pounds 46.9m).
Healthcare operations showed improved operating profits of Pounds 1.5m
(Pounds 200,000) on turnover at Pounds 54.7m (Pounds 42.3m).
Earnings per share rose to 18.6p (11.4p) and the interim dividend is being
increased by 10 per cent to 4.4p.
COMMENT
Amersham's management should be congratulated for its success in capturing
all of last year's exchange rate movement gain. However, future performance
gains will come from Amersham's new and more dynamic strategy built around
closer customer focus and higher margin, branded products. Its three new
proprietary healthcare products could generate sales of about Pounds 100m
within five years. In the short term, pre-tax profits should reach Pounds
41m this year producing earnings of 44.5p. The stock shed 11p to 927p
yesterday following a recent run-up and is now trading on a prospective p/e
of 20.8.

FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: UK side behind 22% rise at
Electrocomponents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTROCOMPONENTS, the electronic, electrical and mechanical components
distribution group, yesterday posted a 22 per cent increase in interim
pre-tax profits boosted by a steady improvement in the UK operations.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to September 30 increased from Pounds
25.4m to Pounds 31.1m. Earnings per share grew by 29 per cent to 9.8p (7.6p)
and the interim dividend is being lifted to 2.5p (2p).
Turnover from continuing operations increased from Pounds 161.4m to Pounds
183.1m, helped in particular by growing sales from the group's new
operations in continental Europe. Operating profits from continuing
operations increased to Pounds 29.7m, against Pounds 26.1m last time when
the group also recorded a Pounds 2.6m operating loss on its now discontinued
Misco computer supply businesses.
Sales in the group's core UK-based RS Components business increased by 11
per cent, while productivity gains and lower bad debt costs resulted in
modestly improved net margins. RS International sales increased by 40 per
cent, underlining the progress made by the group's continental European
operations, particularly Radiospares Composants in France, which continued
to show strong growth despite the recession.
Mr Robert Lawson, group chief executive, said the performance of the new
operations in Europe 'vindicated' the group's overseas expansion strategy.
Meanwhile, Electrocomponents ended the period with Pounds 51.9m (Pounds
36.8m at year-end) in net cash.
Over the next three years it plans to invest Pounds 35m to support growth.
COMMENT
The underlying growth in the UK business was ahead of expectations and the
push into overseas markets is gaining momentum even though the new European
operations are still losing money. Group strategy is to deliver high margin,
low volume products to engineers anywhere in the world and the next step may
well be a joint venture in India. Cash balances continue to strengthen and
will be used to support organic growth in the UK and overseas. This year
pre-tax profits should reach Pounds 71m generating 22p of earnings and
putting the shares on a deserved forward multiple of 20.7. Buy.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
UNIGATE raised pre-tax profits by 19.8 per cent in the half year to
September 30, to Pounds 50.3m, on sales up 2.5 per cent to Pounds 1bn. This
beat market expectations and the shares rose 6p to 371p.
Operating profits were ahead 27.7 per cent to Pounds 49.8m, including Pounds
3.8m from acquisitions and Pounds 2.4m (Pounds 2.2m) from businesses sold.
The dairies division raised profits by 50 per cent to Pounds 18.6m, with
margins rising from 6.9 per cent to 8.2 per cent, though most of the rise
came from integration benefits from acquisitions. Fresh foods profits rose
19.2 per cent to Pounds 8.7m, despite retailers' price cuts. Margins were
3.3 per cent (3.2 per cent).
Profits from farm foods, such as bacon and turkeys, rose from Pounds 100,000
to Pounds 1.2m helped by lower pig prices and the sale of half the pig herd.
Higher feed costs had cut margins there. Margins were still low at 0.9 per
cent.
Distribution profits rose 47.3 per cent to Pounds 10.9m, largely because of
the Glass Glover acquisition, although margins fell from 8.5 to 7.5 per
cent. The US restaurants suffered a fall in profits from Pounds 8.4m to
Pounds 7.7m, despite a rise in sales, with the fall in dollar terms near 20
per cent. Other activities made Pounds 300,000 (Pounds 1.2m) including a
loss from the US exhibitions business.
Associates, the Dutch Nutricia baby food business, contributed Pounds 8.3m
(Pounds 7.7m) with the rise due to translating profits at a lower sterling
rate.
Exceptional costs totalled Pounds 700,000. However, this included a Pounds
5.9m gain from the release of a provision made in 1991 which was surplus to
needs. The fall in sterling added Pounds 1.5m to profits.
Earnings per share, excluding exceptionals, rose 23 per cent to 15.5p.
The interim dividend is raised from 5.7p to 6p.

FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: IDV buys 21%of champagne producer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Distillers and Vintners, Grand Metropolitan's drinks
subsidiary, is to take its first stake in champagne production by acquiring
21 per cent of Champagne Laurent-Perrier and 1 per cent of Veuve
Laurent-Perrier, its parent company.
Laurent-Perrier, which is privately owned, is the fifth largest champagne
brand with about 5 per cent of the world market and sales last year of
FFr570m (Pounds 66m), 60 per cent of them outside France. The value of the
deal was not disclosed.
IDV, which already distributes Laurent-Perrier in the US, Japan, Italy and
the Netherlands, will progressively take over distribution of the champagne
in some of the roughly 120 other countries in which it is sold.
However, Laurent-Perrier will continue to handle its own distribution in
France, Britain and Switzerland.
Mr Bernard de Nonancourt is president of Laurent-Perrier. His family owns 70
per cent of the parent company.

FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Scottish Value assets rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Value Trust, an investment trust which takes substantial stakes in
other trusts in order to provoke restructurings, announced a 62 per cent
increase in net asset value per share over the year to September 30.
The trust has more than doubled its share price and net asset value since
launch in July 1991. Over the past year there were restructurings at four of
its largest 10 holdings, in particular at Drayton Consolidated and the
Independent Investment Company, which became Second Consolidated and Ivory &amp;
Sime Enterprise Capital respectively.
Mr Bob Borthwick, chairman, said 'despite a narrowing of discounts, the
company's investment portfolio as a whole still represents an above average
discount to the underlying asset values. I am confident there remains within
the sector considerable opportunity for Scottish Value Trust.'
Net assets per share at end-September were 97.34p (60.08p). The final
dividend is 0.95p for an unchanged total of 1.8p. Earnings were 1.76p
(1.78p).

FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Henderson Admin 40% ahead after TR buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LOSS OF pension fund clients failed to stop Henderson Administration
Group, the fund management group, from enjoying a 40 per cent jump in
interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.55m to Pounds 9.17m in the six months
to September 30.
The company said client withdrawals lost it about Pounds 500m of pension
fund money. This was 'partly due to the expected withdrawals following the
Touche Remnant acquisition, partly due to a move to indexation by some
clients but also to the residual effects of our previous period of
underperformance'.
However, funds under management at September 30 were Pounds 12.2bn, compared
with Pounds 7.3bn at the interim stage last year. An important factor in the
increase was the acquisition of Touche Remnant, which brought in Pounds
2.2bn of funds. Strong stock markets and inflows in the non-pension fund
side also helped.
At end-September the company had Pounds 4.4bn of pension funds under
management, Pounds 3.2bn of investment trusts and about Pounds 2bn of unit
trusts. After the end of the half, the group launched its first investment
trust under the combined Henderson TR banner and raised Pounds 100m for a
Japanese smaller companies fund.
Total revenues for the first half were Pounds 30.3m, against Pounds 20.5m,
which did not include a full contribution from TR. Operating expenses were
Pounds 22.2m (Pounds 16.7m) but the company said the best comparison was
with last year's second half figure of Pounds 21.3m, which it cited as
evidence that it was controlling costs.
Net interest receivable slumped to Pounds 944,000 (Pounds 2.46m) because of
lower interest rates and the cost of the TR acquisition. After tax of Pounds
3.1m (Pounds 2.82m), earnings per share were 28.23p (21.38p). The interim
dividend is being maintained at 12.5p.

FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Hozelock valuation Pounds 60m with pricing
at 250p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOZELOCK, the garden equipment manufacturer, yesterday finalised its
flotation, pricing the shares at 250p to give the company a
higher-than-expected market capitalisation of Pounds 59.5m.
Last month, when the company announced record operating profits of Pounds
5.1m on turnover of Pounds 32.3m for the year to September 30, the
capitalisation was expected to be Pounds 50m.
Mr David Codling, chief executive, said the company had been 'very
encouraged by the level of interest from investors'.
Hozelock is placing 11.2m ordinary shares with institutions, of which half
will be subject to a clawback to meet retail demand through intermediaries.
At the offer price pro forma earnings per share were 14.1p for the year
ended September, giving a p/e of 17.8. The notional dividend of 6p gives a
gross yield of 3 per cent, and is covered 2.3 times.
The flotation will raise Pounds 18m net, of which Pounds 5.4m will be used
to redeem existing preference shares and Pounds 8.5m to repay bank and
shareholder loans. The remainder will be added to working capital.
The company underwent a Pounds 24m management buy-out from Ropner in 1990.
It has more than 300 products, and accounts for two-thirds of the UK
watering and spraying market.
The group is now owned 14 per cent by its management, with the rest in the
hands of institutions. After the flotation the management and institutions
will hold 53 per cent.
Mr Codling said the company saw plenty of potential to expand in Europe,
where it had built its market share to 2 per cent.
COMMENT
As with many companies in the recent wave of flotations, Hozelock stands
alone in its market sector, making a judgment of its performance difficult.
It is dominant in the UK, with 66 per cent of the watering equipment market.
While there is probably room for organic growth and broadening of its
markets at home it will have to look increasingly towards Europe. In those
markets it will be faced with stiff competition from Gardena, the private
company that dominates the German market and has annual sales of more than
DM300m (Pounds 122m). While a strong brand name and sound management since
the buy-out are likely to prove attractive to many investors, at a p/e of
17.8 the shares are fully priced.

FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Litho Supplies gets Pounds 50m tag with
190p issue price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PRICE of 190p a share was fixed yesterday for the flotation of Litho
Supplies valuing the company, which claims to be the UK's largest
independent distributor of printing products, at Pounds 50.2m.
Litho, a Pounds 20.7m management buy-out from Pembridge Investments of DRG's
Litho supplies business in 1990, is coming to the market by way of a placing
and intermediaries offer which will raise Pounds 14.2m net of expenses.
The company supplies products ranging from high-technology electronic
equipment to conventional consumables to about 10,000 small and medium-sized
companies.
About 14m shares are being placed with institutions, with up to 6.18m
subject to clawback for the intermediaries offer. The funds will redeem
Pounds 7.3m in preference shares and repay Pounds 4m in mezzanine debt. The
balance will reduce other borrowings of Pounds 5.5m in secured-term loans.
On forecast pro forma pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.17m (Pounds 3.4m) for the
year to end-December, the issue price gives a pro forma p/e of 14.6 times.
'This is a reasonable price for someone who wants to come into the printing
sector. If you look at other prices in the sector such as St Ives, for
example, we are coming in at not an unreasonable price,' said Mr John
Byford, joint managing director.
The total dividend of 6.5p the directors would have recommended for the full
year would have given a gross yield of 4.28 per cent. The dividend would
have been 2 times covered by earnings per share of 12.97p. A final dividend
of 0.7p will be paid for the period to end-December from date of listing. In
future Litho intends to pay interim and finals approximately in the
proportion of 40 per cent: 60 per cent.
The intermediaries offer closes on November 16 and it is expected that
dealings will start on November 22.
COMMENT
Litho likes to compare itself with the giants of the printing industry which
would make its rating cheap. True, the new flexible, computer-led technology
on which Litho is pinning its hopes of growth is likely to find favour with
the kinds of small businesses which already patronise the company and in
which the large manufacturers have little interest. However, with the new
market crowded with computer suppliers Litho will depend more than ever on
its established trading relationships.

Dealings began in shares of Allders, the department store and duty free

price.
This was regarded as a good premium given the sharp fall in the stock market

FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Boustead sells Singapore subsidiary for
Pounds 12.8m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BOUSTEAD, the manufacturing group, is selling its 65.4 per cent holding in
Bousteadco, its Singapore-based subsidiary, to Jack Chia-MPH, for Pounds
12.8m.
The reasons for the disposal are threefold: to eliminate a position where a
substantial proportion of assets are tied up overseas which are difficult to
control from London; a chance to refocus operations geographically and
financially; and to use the proceeds to pursue acquisitions in the group's
core business in the UK and Europe.
In 1992 Bousteadco had sales of Pounds 39.3m and pre-tax profits of Pounds
900,000. At December 31 the group's shareholding in the company equated to a
net asset value of Pounds 6.8m.

FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Badgerline float price set at 115p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BADGERLINE Group, the Avon-based bus company which is coming to the market
this month, yesterday fixed its flotation price at 115p a share - valuing
the group at Pounds 99.3m.
The group is forecasting earnings of 8.4p per share for the year to December
31, giving a prospective multiple of 13.7.
The board is also indicating a notional dividend of 4.1p, for a gross yield
of 4.5 per cent.
A total of Pounds 47m is being raised, including Pounds 9m for the benefit
of certain existing shareholders, of which Pounds 31m is being placed with
institutions and Pounds 16m being offered to the public.
Badgerline has grown into one of the biggest providers of local bus
services. The company began as a Pounds 3m buy-out from the National Bus
Company in 1986, and now operates 2,300 buses and coaches in the Midlands,
South Wales and the south of England.
The flotation is sponsored by Lazard Brothers, with Cazenove as brokers. The
offer will close on November 19 and dealings are expected to begin on
November 26.
COMMENT
This pricing offers a yield premium to the market and is pitched at a
discount to Stagecoach, the Perth-based bus operator which came to the
market in April. Badgerline has taken over seven other former NBC operations
and will look to further acquisitions to maintain earnings growth. The group
is well organised and there remains considerable scope for consolidation of
the many remaining privately-owned and municipal bus companies. To analysts
who question whether Badgerline can continue to defy the long-term decline
in bus usage, the group points both to its increasing efficiency and the
future of environmentally friendly park-and-ride schemes, such as it has
organised in Bristol. In the short term, the price seems to have been set at
a level which should ensure a comfortable, but not excessive, premium.

FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Estate agency recovery helps Hambros to
Pounds 41m - Countrywide back in black as house sales pick up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAMBROS, the merchant bank and financial services group, yesterday disclosed
a 53 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits, helped by a return to the
black by its Hambro Countrywide estate agency chain.
The group, which disclosed its balance sheet for the first time at this
stage, made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 41.1m (Pounds 26.9m) in the six
months to September 30. Its undiluted earnings per share rose by 56 per cent
to 12.6p (8.1p).
The retail financial services division including Hambro Countrywide made a
trading profit of Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 4.9m loss restated). The group said
Countrywide had returned to profitability in June as house sales picked up.
Profits from banking activities rose to Pounds 40.3m (Pounds 37.3m),
although the contribution from treasury and capital markets fell slightly.
There was a 'marked increase' in corporate finance, and loan provisions fell
by a third to Pounds 6m.
Sir Chips Keswick, chairman of Hambros Bank, said treasury and capital
markets activity was slightly down on the levels of last year because
currency markets were not so volatile. 'I would have said that was a
windfall period,' he said.
Sir Chips estimated that some 20 per cent of profits in derivatives were
from proprietory trading. He said that over time treasury profits would face
declining margins, but that it would continue to produce good returns this
year.
Direct investment activities traded at a profit of Pounds 4.1m (Pounds
100,000 loss restated following the listing of Hambro Insurance Services
Group).
A profit of Pounds 9m from the disposal of a holding in Telematics will be
included in the second half.
Mr Christopher Sporborg, chairman of Hambro Group Investments, said the
housing recovery had been weaker than hoped, but Hambro Countrywide expected
to sell up to 50,000 properties this year, compared with 39,000 last year.
The balance sheet footings increased by Pounds 742m from the year end to
Pounds 6.59bn. This was mainly due to a rise in acceptances, and increased
activity in equity clearing on behalf of regional stockbrokers.
The interim dividend on 20p ordinary shares was raised to 4.5p (4.2p).
COMMENT
Shares fell 24p to 344p amid disappointment at Hambros' failure to benefit
as much as others from buoyant trading conditions. Full-year undiluted
earnings per share of 30p would give a prospective multiple of about 12.
Together with a gross dividend yield of 5.4 per cent, this hardly makes a
risky investment. But with weak loan demand, a shaky housing market, and the
best of trading profits past, it is hard to discern the source of strong
earnings growth.

FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Independent Insurance given Pounds 98.5m
tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT Insurance, the first insurer to obtain a listing since the
second world war, yesterday announced an issue price of 225p per share,
valuing the group at Pounds 98.5m, writes Richard Lapper.
A placing and intermediaries offer by Lazard Brothers and Noble &amp; Co will
raise about Pounds 25.1m net to fund growth.
The group issued 11.8m new ordinary shares and 400,600 ordinary shares were
sold by existing institutional shareholders. Some 6.67m ordinaries are being
placed firm and 5.53m are being placed subject to recall to satisfy valid
applications received under the intermediaries offer.
COMMENT
Independent looks to be an attractive addition to the composite insurance
sector where it can be compared against larger rivals. The company is
tightly managed and tends to focus on specialised areas of the market. Its
exclusive focus on the UK might be viewed as a drawback by some investors,
especially amid indications that rate competition is returning to the motor
market. However, Independent has placed emphasis on underwriting discipline
in the past, which ensured it remained in the black between 1990 and 1992.
Earnings per share in 1992 amounted to 10.9p putting the shares on an
historic p/e of 20.6. A forecast net dividend of 8.25p puts the shares on a
prospective gross yield of 4.6 per cent. Overall, the company looks good
value against the composites. The shares can be expected to trade to a
premium when dealings begin on November 22.

FT  11 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Bibby dives to Pounds 7m and omits final
dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J BIBBY &amp; Sons, the conglom-erate which is planning to spin off a
substantial part of its business to pay off borrowings of Pounds 123m,
yesterday passed its final dividend as annual pre-tax profits plunged by 78
per cent.
The dive in profits from Pounds 32.2m to Pounds 7.1m for the year to
September 24 wiped 11p from the company's shares to 68p. The share price has
fallen from a high of 127p in the last six months.
Sales were 27 per cent higher at Pounds 791.5m.
Mr Richard Mansell-Jones, chairman, had little comfort to offer shareholders
as he warned that any recovery was not likely to occur in the current year.
However, he was confident of an improvement in Bibby's prospects in the
medium term after demerging its science, paper and agricultural products
businesses next year. He said existing shareholders could expect a
post-demerger dividend of 2p.
Mr Mansell-Jones admitted that the acquisition of Finanzauto, the Spanish
Caterpillar distributor bought for Pounds 82m last year, had gone seriously
wrong. 'No one ever envisaged it (the Spanish construction market) would go
down this far,' he said. The market had 'completely disappeared' in Spain.
Bibby's capital equipment division, which distributes Caterpillar in Spain
and Portugal, returned sharply higher losses of Pounds 18.2m (Pounds 1.8m)
as a result. Some Pounds 7.8m of the increase was due to interest charges
following the acquisition of Finanzauto. Mr Mansell-Jones said the group had
cut its Spanish workforce by 25 per cent to 1,500, resulting in on-going
cost savings of about Pounds 5m.
Materials handling enjoyed brighter fortunes, however, returning a 14 per
cent pre-tax increase to Pounds 15.5m. These two divisions will be renamed
Stratford after the demerger. The agriculture, science and paper products
businesses will retain the Bibby name. The group aims to raise some Pounds
75m from the flotation, which will be used to reduce its gearing of about 70
per cent. Debt fell from Pounds 135.5m to Pounds 122.8m during the year.
The group's earnings per share fell from 20.09p to 2.26p.
Barlow Rand, the South African group which owns 79 per cent of J Bibby, will
retain 79 per cent of Stratford and 20 per cent of the new Bibby.

FT  11 NOV 93 / White-knuckle ride for fantasyland investors: The scale of
Euro Disney's financial crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors in Euro Disney have stomached a stream of bad news since the theme
park opened its doors on the eastern outskirts of Paris last year. But the
scale of losses and write-offs announced yesterday shocked even the most
hardened of them.
Exceptional charges of FFr3.62bn (Pounds 420m), which sent losses to
FFr5.3bn for the year to September 30, knocked a large chunk off the
company's capital. The net asset value per share now stands at less than
FFr10 compared with yesterday's closing price of FFr38, down 13 per cent on
the day.
The depressing figures mean that without a financial restructuring, and
soon, there is a question mark over the company's survival.
For the moment, Walt Disney, the US entertainment giant which holds 49 per
cent of Euro Disney, seems prepared to step into the breach. 'Walt Disney
has agreed to help fund Euro Disney for a limited period to afford it time
to attempt its capital restructuring by spring 1994,' the European company
said yesterday.
The American group simultaneously announced that it was taking a Dollars
350m (Pounds 230m) charge against fourth-quarter earnings to cover both the
winter funding commitment and receivables due from the European business.
Walt Disney is a reluctant saviour. From the beginning it has sought to
distance its investors from the risks at Euro Disney, supplying less than
FFr1bn of the group's original equity capital. Industry analysts, believe,
however, that the US group will provide support for Euro Disney, fearing the
effect that failure could have on its reputation.
'They have to look after their own investors,' says Mr Nigel Reed, leisure
analyst at Paribas Capital Markets in London. 'But they cannot afford to let
a company with the Disney brand name go under.'
The depth of the problems revealed by yesterday's figures means it is crunch
time for Walt Disney. 'They pretty much have to help and it seems they are
now prepared to,' says one banker close to the company.
Walt Disney's provision of winter funding buys time for Euro Disney, and the
large-scale write-offs should reduce depreciation charges, improving future
profits. But a capital restructuring remains problematic.
The central dilemma is that the most likely means of restructuring remains a
share issue, probably a rights issue. But the weakness of the share price
complicates such a solution. 'It would have to be a very big issue to raise
the sort of money that Euro Disney needs,' said one merchant banker in
Paris.
As a result, a restructuring package is expected to include other measures,
such as a renegotiation of the terms of the company's FFr21bn debt with its
bankers. They are also being asked to consider swapping loans into equity.
One further solution involves the injection of fresh capital from a new
partner. The group's financial problems, however, suggest it will be hard to
find ready investors. The task is made all the more difficult by depressed
trading conditions. 'Europe-wide recession, high interest rates and mounting
unemployment have all served to reduce disposable incomes,' Mr Philippe
Bourguignon, Euro Disney's chairman, said yesterday. 'Inevitably tourism has
been hit very hard.'
For Euro Disney the problems have been compounded by the effects of the
strong franc, which has reduced visits from the UK and Italy in particular.
At the end of last month, BA Holidays, the package tour subsidiary of
British Airways, announced it was abandoning sales of holidays to the
struggling theme park.
The depressed state of the French property market has prevented the company
from realising anticipated revenues from property development. 'Euro Disney
is in a vicious circle of high interest-rate costs and disappointing
revenues,' says Mr Reed at Paribas. 'The company is in serious trouble.'
Mr Bourguignon is responding with a cost-cutting programme. Last month, the
company announced it would shed 950 of its 11,100 staff. It has also frozen
plans to extend the French theme parks, although Mr Bourguignon has
reiterated that the second phase of EuroDisneyland remains a cental part of
the strategy.
The belated decision to write off its pre-opening costs should improve the
prospects for profitability in the future.
Mr Bourguignon has also taken encouragement from the sharp rise in French
visitors to EuroDisneyland. In the past two months, they accounted for about
45 per cent of the total.
But the bright spots at EuroDisneyland remain few and far between. They will
mean little if Mr Bourguignon fails to pull off his restructuring.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Diabetes drug raises US group'sprospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DRUG produced by Bristol-Myers Squibb, one of the world's biggest drug
companies, was found to reduce deaths from diabetes by 50 per cent.
The study by the New England Journal of Medicine has important implications
for diabetics, the company and health authorities anxious to keep down
costs. The drug, Capoten, should increasingly be used to halt progression of
the diabetes, reducing the need for expensive kidney dialysis and
transplantation.
The results are significant for Bristol-Myers Squibb because they will help
the New Jersey-based group generate additional revenues from its top-selling
product with sales last year of more than Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.1bn).
Capoten's US and German patents and run out in other markets in 1997.
Analysts warned, however, that the trial, the largest of its kind, confirmed
what had already been suspected. Mr Viren Mehta, analyst at New York brokers
Mehta &amp; Isaly, said: 'I'm not sure there will be a dramatic increase in
Capoten's sales. Many doctors are already using the medicine and other drugs
in its class of ace-inhibitors to treat diabetics. But the ace-inhibitors
will clearly become the drug of choice.'
There are about 15m diabetes sufferers in the US, and 1m in the UK. Dialysis
costs as much as Pounds 25,000 per patient a year, while transplants cost
about Pounds 15,000 and require between Pounds 3,000 and Pounds 5,000 a year
to maintain the patient. Bristol-Myers Squibb believes appropriate use of
Capoten, also known as captopril, could save Dollars 2.5bn in the US over 10
years.
The three-year study involved 409 diabetic patients using insulin in 30
centres in the US and Canada. Of the 202 patients on placebo, 42 died. Among
the 207 on Capoten only 23 died. The trial was organised by the US National
Institutes of Health.
The drug appears to improve circulation in the kidney, improving its ability
to process impurities in the blood. The trial showed Capoten nearly halved
the risk of high blood levels of creatine which results in reduced kidney
function.
Dr Marc Pohl, one of the principal investigators, said: 'This study provides
a mandate for Capoten to be used for diabetics whether or not they are using
insulin.'

NEWS Corporation, the media, film and publishing group run by Mr Rupert
Murdoch, yesterday reported a 21.4 per cent increase in third-quarter
profits after tax to ADollars 262.3m (Pounds 120m).
After abnormal items, profits rose to ADollars 246m from ADollars 193.7m.
Progress was mainly due to a doubled contribution of ADollars 73.9m from
associated companies, including BSkyB - in which Pearson, publisher of the
Financial Times, has an interest - and Ansett Airlines, and to reduced
interest charges of ADollars 173.6m, against ADollars 206.2m.
Operating profits from the main group fell almost 5 per cent to ADollars
412.2m. News Corp said this reflected the cost of the newspaper price war in
the UK - where newspaper profits fell 15 per cent - and reduced earnings
from the 'free-standing insert' division.
In the US, the filmed entertainment division saw operating profits advance
from ADollars 15.8m to ADollars 42.5m, helped by releases such as Rookie of
the Year, Robin Hood - Men in Tights and Rising Sun. However, the
HarperCollins publishing business saw weaker earnings.
Book publishing overall contributed ADollars 75.9m, compared with ADollars
82m.
The release of the results coincided with publication of the Australian
Stock Exchange's discussion paper on Mr Murdoch's controversial plan to
create a new class of shares with 'super' voting rights, which would be
issued on a pro rata basis to existing shareholders.
The plan - seen as a means of reinforcing Mr Murdoch's control - has run
into criticism from institutions.
Looking at arguments for allowing differential voting rights, the ASX said
it could encourage management commitment, counter short-termism by investors
and induce companies to issue equity rather than debt securities. It also
noted that share schemes should be a matter for shareholders, not the
exchange.
Conversely, the ASX said such shares could be seen to 'en-trench'
management; increase the opportunity for the abuse of minority shareholders;
and deprive shareholders of a potential takeover premium.
The ASX asked interested parties to submit answers to 26 questions by
November 29.

FT  11 NOV 93 / NatPower downbeat on earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Power, the UK's largest electricity generator, yesterday
disappointed the market with a dividend increase at the bottom end of
expectations and a downbeat trading statement.
A 24 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 250m for the half-year to
September 26, was helped by a Pounds 45m release from provisions following a
favourable decision on pension equalisation by the European Court of
Justice. Without this, the profit rise would have been just 2 per cent from
1992's Pounds 201m.
Mr John Baker, chief executive, warned that the company's share of the
electricity generation market could fall to below 30 per cent following a
reduction during the half year from 41 per cent to 33 per cent.
'The reliability of earnings growth remains under pressure,' he said, but
added that there would be real increases in the long term. Analysts had
expected a relatively downbeat statement from the company. Nonetheless,
shares fell by 9.5p to 402.5p.
The profit improvement was achieved on a 21 per cent fall in turnover, from
Pounds 1.97bn to Pounds 1.56bn. The result was helped by a further reduction
in the company's workforce to 6,700 from 7,300. That compares with more than
17,000 at privatisation three years ago.
The interim dividend goes up 14 per cent, from 3.3p to 3.75p. This is
covered 3.3 times by earnings per share of 12.2p, against 11.5p. The company
aims to reduce cover to about 2.5 times but will implement the change over
two to three years.
The results were the company's last before Professor Stephen Littlechild,
electricity industry regulator, decides whether to refer National Power and
its rival PowerGen to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Mr Baker said the chances of a referral were even, although the company did
not consider there was any evidence to justify this.
He expressed doubts about the viability of a third nuclear power station at
Sizewell. 'I do not consider it an economic proposition as it has been put
forward to us.'
Work would start on the company's second combined cycle gas turbine power
plant, at Didcot, Oxfordshire, early next year. The plant would be
commissioned in 1997. The company was likely to build a third CCGT at
Staythorpe, Nottinghamshire, by the end of the century.
Mr Baker said annual output was expected to be some 95 terawatt hours,
compared with 109 terawatt hours in 1992-93.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Unigate helped to 20% rise by acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ONE-FIFTH rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 50.3m at Unigate, the
food and distribution group, was 'a good performance in difficult trading
conditions,' chairman Sir Brian Kellett said.
However, the rise owed much to acquisitions and one-off items. The group
warned that profits growth would slow in the second half.
Mr Ross Buckland, chief executive, said promotions by retailers were causing
sharp fluctuations in fresh food volume, which made production inefficient
and squeezed margins.
He said Unigate would work aggressively with retailers not against them. But
he questioned whether retailers would benefit from price cutting. 'I would
suggest not,' he said.
Price cuts had particularly hit low-fat spreads and yoghurts. However, good
volume growth had been achieved in desserts.
Operating profits from dairies rose by half to Pounds 18.6m as acquisitions,
such as Clifford Foods, were integrated. Three dairies had been closed and
the group now produced a third more milk.
Mr Buckland said the dairy business had a good future, although doorstep
deliveries of milk - where margins are higher - were declining at an annual
rate of 10 to 12 per cent. Margins on supermarket milk were unsatisfactory,
he said, although volumes had risen.
Unigate, which has 16 per cent of the liquid milk market in England and
Wales, would be 'pleased to buy milk in whichever way dairy farmers wish to
sell it,' once the Milk Marketing Board was abolished next year. He was
confident the group could buy the amount of milk it needed at the right
price under the auction system proposed by Milk Marque, the successor body.
During the half there was a cash outflow of Pounds 70.1m, of which Pounds
20.1m represented excess of acquisitions over disposals. This increased net
debt to Pounds 172.1m from Pounds 98.2m at the previous year-end, giving
gearing of 52.8 per cent.
The interest charge rose from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 7.1m, but interest cover
was 'healthy' at seven times, Mr John Worby, finance director, said.
The rise in debt was partly caused by the cancellation of the sale of
Unigate's US restaurant business. Mr Buckland said the aim was to float this
in the next 12 to 18 months, but Unigate could make more acquisitions before
then. He indicated these could be in continental Europe.

FT  11 NOV 93 / UK wants to accelerate talks on Patten's plan: Major says
time very short for Hong Kong deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL and KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH government yesterday gave strong support to the efforts of Mr
Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, to broaden democracy in the colony and
asked China to accelerate negotiations on his proposals.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said after a cabinet committee meeting
chaired by Mr John Major, the prime minister, that London had proposed 'that
we move into a more intensive phase (of talks) straight away to try to reach
agreement on the outstanding issues.'
Britain wants to reach agreement quickly on uncontroversial aspects of
elections in Hong Kong next year and in 1995, so negotiations can focus on
the issues most in dispute with Beijing.
However, after 15 rounds of talks over six months in which there has been
little progress, ministers indicated that they would not allow negotiations
to continue indefinitely.
Mr Major told a London business conference on Hong Kong: 'Time is now very
short. I do not believe, and nor does the governor, that an agreement is
worth any price although we will do our best to get one.'
He said he recognised that 'some in the business community would prefer that
we did not have this argument.' But he said it was unavoidable. 'The point
at issue is a vital one. We owe it to the people of Hong Kong to hold
elections which give them a genuine choice.'
Mr Hurd said: 'It is weeks rather than months in which we have to reach a
conclusion.' He said quick agreement on uncontroversial matters would enable
the legislative work to begin.
Officials said this would provide more time for further talks on the main
issues, though they cautioned that an agreement would still be needed by the
end of the year to permit elections to proceed.
The issues most in dispute are expansion of 'functional constituencies' from
which business groups will elect 30 legislators; an election committee which
will elect 10 legislators; and the 'through train' - retention of office by
all 60 legislators elected in 1995 until 1999, two years after China assumes
sovereignty.
China indicated privately last week that it may be prepared to settle on the
smaller issues. British officials see the next round of talks beginning
November 19 as a key test of Beijing's willingness.
Mr Hurd said Mr Christopher Hum, the senior foreign office official
responsible for the Far East, will lead the British side in the next round.
He will stand in for Sir Robin McLaren, the ambassador in Beijing, who had
an operation this week on his back and will be out of action for some weeks,
officials said.
Britain wants to double the frequency of the talks to a round per week.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Clinton pledges to broaden area for free trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday raised the prospect of a broad free trade
zone in the western hemisphere by putting the whole of Latin America back at
the centre of US trade policy.
Speaking at a White House press conference, he promised to build on the
North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico by
expanding it to include free-market democracies such as Argentina and Chile.
The president, who has been fighting an uphill battle to win Congress
approval for Nafta, predicted that the House of Representatives would give
its backing in its deciding vote next week. 'I honestly believe we're going
to win it now,' he said.
Mr Clinton said he did not want to exaggerate the potential job gains to be
derived from Nafta alone, although he believed it was clear it would create
more jobs than it lost.
Much greater opportunities would come, however, when the pact could be
expanded to other market-oriented economies and with the successful
conclusion of the Uruguay Round of negotiations on the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
'The real job growth . . . will come when all the other Latin American
democracies and free-market economies also join in a great trade group with
Mexico, Canada and the US.
'And it will come because, once this happens, we will have enormously
increased influence in the world community to argue that we ought to adopt a
worldwide trade agreement before the end of the year,' he added.
After Tuesday night's Nafta debate between vice-president Al Gore and Mr
Ross Perot, the former independent presidential candidate, Mr Clinton sought
to portray next week's Congress vote as critical for the US's ability to
negotiate freer trade opportunities from its partners not only in Latin
America but also in the Uruguay Round.
Mr Gore warned in the debate that a defeat for Nafta would make conclusion
of the Gatt round difficult.
An expansion of Nafta to include the rest of Latin America was promised by
Mr Clinton's predecessor, Mr George Bush. But little has been heard of such
talk in recent months as the prospects of Congress accepting free trade even
with neighbouring Mexico seemed so remote.
Mexican stocks soared 81.49 points to a record close at 2,035.33, and the
peso recovered because of optimism over the result of the Gore-Perot debate.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Lone-parent claimants up sharply, official data show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE MPs urged the government yesterday to press ahead with its
examination of ways to cut state benefit to single-parent families after new
data showed a sharp rise in the number of lone parents claiming social
security in recent years.
Government figures showed that the number of lone parents claiming income
support, one of the main benefits disbursed by the Department of Social
Security, had risen by more than 38 per cent in the past five years.
Nearly half those claimants were single women, and 45 per cent of all
claimants had received the benefit for more than two years.
The release of the figures coincided with a row in Westminster over whether
ministers were planning to cut state benefit to lone parents in an attempt
to reduce the social security budget.
On Tuesday, a leaked cabinet document had claimed that the growth in the
number of lone parents was 'a burden on public expenditure'. It also
disclosed that ministers were considering cutting state benefits.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, played down the prospect that
the government would cut benefits to that group.
But yesterday, Mr Alan Duncan, a backbench Tory MP and member of the Commons
select committee on social security, said the data were another indication
that a 'culture' of lone mothers was growing.
'We must pursue our survey of how much this is costing and we are entitled
to ask whether any cuts in the costs can be made,' he said.
Yesterday's figures showed nearly 1m lone parents claiming benefit in summer
1992, compared with 694,000 in May 1988.
The number of lone parents claiming income support as a proportion of all
claimants had also risen over that period, from 16 per cent to 18.8 per
cent.
Lone parents also turned out to be the largest single category of claimants
for housing benefit last year, ahead of the disabled and the unemployed.
These figures go some way towards explaining the rising cost to the state of
supporting lone parents - at Pounds 6.6bn DSS in the 1992-93 financial year,
about 8 per cent of the total social security budget.
Mr Donald Dewar, Labour's social security secretary, said the figures
underlined that the government had to increase childcare provision and
educational opportunities. 'We have learnt this week that policy is
conducted from prejudice and not from facts,' he said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Rupert Murdoch has hardly put a foot wrong recently, as his latest burst
of deal-making and the 10-fold increase in News Corporation's shares since
1991 testify. But he trod in something nasty yesterday as News reported a 5
per cent fall in first-quarter operating profits and the controversy
resurfaced over its plans for a new class of super voting shares with a
discussion paper from the Australian stock exchange.
News's book publishing profits were weaker and problems grew at its
free-standing insert division. But the real hit came from its price-cutting
campaign in the UK, where newspaper profits slid 15 per cent. Thanks to his
non-executive directorship at Philip Morris, Mr Murdoch has had a ring-side
seat watching similar pricing punch-ups in the US. But Marlboro's assault
has led to a fearful bruising and US cigarette prices now appear to be
edging up again. The suspicion grows that any imposition of VAT on
newspapers would cloak restorative price rises on its UK titles.
The Australian stock exchange is treading gingerly over News's share
proposals. It may worry that if it blocks the scheme, its second most
heavily traded stock will switch its listing to the US. But that is no
reason to concede a point of principle. Besides, News can hardly count on an
ecstatic reception in New York. Calpers has been among the most vociferous
critics of the share proposal. Moreover, there was heavy selling of News's
ADRs after disappointment grew with its first-quarter results.

FT  11 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Unigate
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Unigate continues to make useful progress rationalising its illogical
collection of businesses. Though flattered by the release of provisions and
a gain from a pension revaluation, Unigate's rise in headline profits
represents an encouraging performance in tough conditions. Buying dairies on
the cheap and squeezing extra volumes out of reduced capacity is proving an
effective strategy to combat margin pressures - in the short term at least.
Unigate's shares will continue to be underpinned by their 5.5 per cent
yield. But the company's 40 per cent outperformance of Northern Foods this
year is beginning to look a trifle excessive. Northern has attractive
investment avenues in which to divert the funds milked from its dairy cash
cow. Unigate still lacks a suitable recipe for sustainable earnings growth.
With the grocery chains soon likely to apply the squeeze to commodity
producers, the market appears to be coming full-circle in believing branded
goods manufacturers are best placed to resist their fatal embrace. But that
will hardly be to Unigate's benefit. The success of Muller in grabbing so
big a share of UK yoghurt sales illustrates how vulnerable Unigate remains
on that score.

It is strange that the stock market should take the downbeat message from
National Power so seriously. The sharp fall in market share in the first
half was partly due to the company's tardiness in building new gas-fired
plant. The decline will be much less pronounced from here on. Since the
regulator is deciding whether to refer the generating duopoly to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission, National Power has an incentive to err on
the side of caution. That might also explain the disappointing dividend.
True, the 14 per cent increase in interim pay-out looks miserly against the
18 per cent rise afforded by PowerGen. But National Power is sticking to its
target of reducing dividend cover from 3.3 times to 2.5 times by 1995.
Working capital is being released as surplus coal stocks are run down, so
there is hardly a shortage of cash. Annual dividend increases of at least 15
per cent thus look probable, even if earnings do not grow at all.
The profits outlook is certainly becoming less rosy as operating
efficiencies become more difficult to find. But National Power looks some
distance from running out of cost savings. Besides, the Pounds 454m
provisions in the balance sheet are a cushion against hard times. A Pounds
34m slug was released to profits yesterday, in addition to the Pounds 45m
pension-related credit taken as an exceptional item. A monopolies reference
would undermine both generators, regardless of their financial strength.
With its shares now lagging those of PowerGen by 13 per cent, National Power
may have limited the downside risk.

FT  11 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Disney's big dipper
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The real world keeps intruding on Euro Disney's fantasy. Yesterday's
decision to change its accounting policies is a clear indication that the
decks are being cleared for a fresh injection of equity. By charging
start-up costs directly to the profit and loss instead of capitalising them
on the balance sheet, the company is saving future depreciation. The returns
to any future investors will thus look greater, even if the immediate result
has been to decimate the balance sheet. Under US accounting standards, net
assets per share work out at little more than FFr2. Shame on those who
fought for the mandate to sell the paper to investors at 707p in 1989.
Euro Disney's new management is applying itself with noble persistence to
the task of boosting the project's revenues. But it faces two daunting
obstacles. The first is that by cutting prices and adding facilities it is
diluting the operational gearing that comes into play with increased
attendance. The second is that the project can never generate enough cash to
service its FFr21bn debt. Even with the help of eventual economic recovery
and a weaker French franc, it is hard to see Euro Disney supporting more
than half that amount.
The equity injection will thus need to be at least FFr10bn to FFr11bn, which
puts Walt Disney on the spot. Without its support the project may simply
close, causing irreparable damage to the Disney name. But the amount is
large for it to shoulder on its own. One solution might be to seek a trade
partner who might find use for the excessively lavish hotels, perhaps by
adding conference facilities. In the absence of a second park, the surplus
hotel capacity is certainly a heavy drag. A more scary thought is that,
having squandered the proceeds of its flotation, a restructured Euro Disney
might come back to the market for more. That, as they say, is show business.

FT  11 NOV 93 / No such thing as a free treaty: Nafta will not solve the
deep-seated structural problems facing the Mexican economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two months ago, the Cummins Engine company closed down an assembly line in
its Mexican subsidiary. With output of the assembled truck engine one-tenth
of that in its US factory in Columbus, Indiana, Cummins Mexico could not
compete against its US parent, and production was moved north.
Since Mexico tore down trade barriers in the mid-1980s, Cummins' subsidiary
in Mexico has seen a trade balance in engines with the US turn into a trade
deficit of four to one. The company now produces only one heavy engine in
Mexico - even this might go when the country's remaining trade barriers are
dismantled, says Mr Steve Knaebel, president of of the Mexican subsidiary.
US critics of the North American Free Trade Agreement, to be voted on by the
House of Representatives next Wednesday, say the treaty will encourage US
companies to move to Mexico in search of cheap labour. But as the Cummins
case shows, Mexico's low productivity makes large parts of its economy
vulnerable to competition from the US.
'The US is already competing against countries which have much lower wages
than Mexico, while many parts of Mexico's economy are still heavily
protected,' says Daniel Oks, a World Bank economist. 'I am not convinced
Mexico is well prepared for competition.' He foresees bankruptcies and job
losses in sectors that cannot hold their own with US rivals - capital goods,
for instance - if Nafta passes.
This gloomy view has gained ground as Mexico's economy has stagnated. Gross
domestic product grew by just 1.3 per cent in the first half this year, and
23 of the 49 manufacturing sectors tracked by the Inegi, the government
statistics institute, were in recession. Even though the economy is
sluggish, Mexico is set to run a worryingly high current account deficit of
6 per cent of GDP this year.
Some Mexican businessmen, who until recently have been almost unanimous in
their support for Nafta, have begun to see the treaty's disadvantages.
Lorenzo Servitje, a prominent businessman and the billionaire president of
Bimbo, Mexico's bread maker, complained at a business conference in Cancun
that Mexico's abrupt trade liberalisation 'has not taken into consideration
that restructuring must be a gradual process, and has failed to appreciate
the limitations of our economic structure'.
Under Nafta, Mexico would sacrifice its high protective tariffs, which
average about 10.3 per cent, but which are higher on some goods. The average
US tariff on Mexican goods is just 4.5 per cent.
More significantly, Mexico would open up to free trade and investment
certain sectors that have been fully or partially protected from competition
for decades - cars and car parts, banks, agriculture, and government
procurement, among others. The US economy, with a few minor exceptions, is
open to Mexican imports and investment.
US critics of the treaty claim Mexico has one significant advantage: low
wages. But wages are not as low as some argue, and in dollar terms have been
growing faster than productivity. While Mexico's minimum wage is Dollars
4.20 a day, only 16 per cent of workers earn this amount. Average pay plus
benefits in manufacturing is Dollars 4.50 an hour, according to government
figures.
The World Bank has calculated that labour costs in Mexico are about a fifth
of those in the US, but that productivity is about a quarter of the US
level. Since last year, when the figures were calculated, Mexico's peso has
appreciated in real terms. Mr Oks of the World Bank says he doubts that
there is any average cost advantage to doing business in Mexico compared
with the US.
The Mexican government under President Carlos Salinas has pushed strongly
for Nafta in the belief that free trade and the new foreign investment drawn
by the treaty will raise low productivity levels. New investment and greater
efficiency are expected by many economists to be products of the treaty.
'Nafta will reinforce reforms and boost foreign confidence in the Mexican
economy. Mexico should continue to be able to attract Dollars 20bn of
foreign investment a year without problems,' says Mr Jeffrey Schott, a
fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. 'A defeat
would lead to a cut in those flows.'
Many foreign investors in Mexico's stock and money markets have been betting
on Nafta. At close yesterday, the market was up 4.2 per cent on the day,
stimulated by renewed optimism over the treaty. But earlier signs that it
might be rejected by the US Congress had sent the peso tumbling by almost 4
per cent on Tuesday, thus threatening the government's policy of a strong
exchange rate and price stability.
Even if Nafta does spur new investment, as many supporters predict, it is
unlikely to be evenly spread. Some sectors - cars, parts of the textiles
industry, fruit and vegetables, glass - whose productivity levels compare
favourably with those in the US, are likely to prove attractive to foreign
investors, but others - basic grains such as corn and wheat - are not
because they are inefficient and unmodernised.
Mexico's biggest competitive disadvantage is the relatively small size of
its industrial operations compared with those in the US. Like Cummins, many
US companies built factories in Mexico to avoid high tariffs or other trade
barriers. But with tariffs on the verge of falling further, some companies
have found it makes more sense to export spare capacity from the US rather
than to maintain costly plant south of the border.
For instance, General Motors announced this year that it was going to move
production of the Cavalier car in northern Mexico to Lansing, Michigan,
where economies of scale have reduced costs. Quality Coils, a US company
that makes electro-magnetic coils, decided in April to move its factory from
Ciudad Juarez to Connecticut after it found Mexico's low wages did not
offset lower productivity.
A further obstacle to Mexican productivity and thus its ability to
capitalise on Nafta is its crumbling infrastructure, lack of qualified
managers, and untrained workers. 'It's not as simple as wages being
one-fifth of those in the US - let's go to Mexico,' says Mr Joseph Donahue,
senior vice-president of the US subsidiary of Thomson, the French
electronics company. 'You have to ask, 'Can I buy the tools, where are the
managers, what are transport costs, and other things?' '
Mr Donahue says it is hard to find a good manager in Mexico, and when you
do, 'he will have 10 job offers'. Mr Knaebel, of Cummins, points to truck
journeys that take 40-60 per cent longer in Mexico than in the US as a
disincentive to foreign investors.
While Mexico is building new private toll roads, the cost of the tolls for
many businesses is prohibitive. These and other impediments to business -
notably high credit costs and an unreliable legal system - may explain why
the country has had only limited success in attracting direct foreign
investment since liberalising investment regulations in 1989. Since then,
Mexico has received a total of Dollars 33.1bn in new investment, but only
about half of that has been direct investment in plant and machinery. Much
of it has been in the service rather than the export sector.
President Salinas proposed Nafta in 1990 to draw foreign money into the
country. If the treaty fails, his government will have little choice but to
proceed with economic reforms in the faint hope that Mexico will draw the
necessary investment from Europe and Japan. The government plans to apply
for membership of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
next spring, and is likely to approve a more liberal foreign investment law
later this year.
Though the treaty may succeed in persuading US companies to invest in
Mexico, competition will prove a nasty jolt for many industries. Deep-seated
structural problems will remain, whether or not Nafta passes. Mr Jesus Reyes
Heroles, an economist who heads the economic consultancy GEA, says: 'If
Nafta does not pass, there will be a problem next year. If it does, the
troubles start in 1995.'

FT  11 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Cocom's future
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NO SYSTEM of export controls can guarantee to stop countries with the will
to establish large and sophisticated arms industries from carrying out that
aim. Restricting supplies of technology to countries which the international
community wishes to prevent from producing atomic, bacteriological or
chemical weapons can, however, act as a considerable disincentive to such
activities. During postwar decades, the 17-nation Co-ordinating Committee on
Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom) controlled access of western technology
to the former Soviet bloc as a means of hampering its military capability.
Four years after the Berlin wall fell, Cocom's membership and objectives
need radical redefinition. The US and its allies are due shortly to conclude
talks on creating a successor.
During the 1980s, Cocom restrictions were frequently the focus of commercial
and ideological differences between the US and Europe. In a post-cold war
world, policing flows of sensitive knowhow and components has become still
more difficult and controversial. However, a new Cocom which can reduce arms
proliferation is in the interest of international stability.
There is no shortage of impediments. The east-west line which separated
friend and foe into easily definable power blocs has disappeared. Underlined
by the weapons programmes of countries like Iraq, Pakistan, Libya or North
Korea, the list of suppliers and potential users of military technologies
has grown longer and more diffuse. China - treated leniently by Cocom, and
now a supplier of ever more sophisticated and deadly weaponry to the third
world - may prove impossible to bring into a new system.
For the west, however, the key aim of the new Cocom diplomacy is to persuade
Russia and other ex-Soviet republics to participate in enforcing new
arrangements. Otherwise, parts of their armaments capabilities will
increasingly migrate to other still more unstable regions. The US hopes that
relaxing remaining restrictions on exports to the former Soviet Union will
persuade erstwhile Cocom poachers to become gamekeepers. But the west will
need to provide former Soviet republics with more help to improve controls
of borders.
The Cocom system has already undergone change. Contacts between governments
on regulating exports with uses in nuclear and chemical weapons and
ballistic missiles include links with both Russia and China. The new Cocom
organisation can achieve better co-ordination by pinpointing which countries
are deemed as threats in particular sectors. The technologies subject to
embargo will need to be limited as tightly as possible to those with
clear-cut applications in weapons of mass destruction. Export controls are
an essentially defensive method of combating proliferation. They should not
be used to impede the economies of countries of which the west disapproves.

Full marks for trying. Retired bus driver Ken Clark, 79, has just conducted
a telephone survey of fellow pensioners in Lewisham and found that 10 out of
the 10 Ken Clark(e)s he contacted are against the government's plans to
impose VAT on domestic fuel.
Lucky for Ken that Norman Lamont is no longer Britain's chancellor of the
exchequer. As it is, he had to fiddle his figures a bit by counting all the
Clarks, whether or not their surname was spelt the same way as the current
chancellor.
But then even this government fiddles its figures from time to time.

China's public relations record in its future colony may be less than
perfect, but Beijing's de facto embassy in Hong Kong, the Xinhua news
agency, seems to think it can sell its services commercially.
For Xinhua is taking time off from flinging verbal mud at governor Chris
Patten to set up a subsidiary PR agency, Fortune China.
Subtlety having not exactly been its strongest suit, the agency at least
forbears from selling itself on the basis of its expertise. But a spokesman
claims that 'good credibility and connections (will) attract a swarm of
overseas companies eager to exploit the huge mainland market'.
Perhaps Patten should reveal his grasp of capitalism Hong Kong-style and
follow suit. With his new-found expertise in crisis management he would
definitely have services to sell, though his connections may have a more
limited lifespan.

The search is on for a new general secretary of the Society for

incumbent after only nine months in the job. Indeed, Edward Lowndes has
already left - not just the organisation but also the country, partly, it
would seem, because he was fed up with the bitter rivalry between the
society, which has become the public face of insolvency practitioners, and
the rival Institute of Practitioners of Insolvency, which licenses them.
Clearly he prefers a more peaceful life. He has taken up a job as
administrator to the United Nations peacekeeping forces in Sarajevo.

Why has the London Stock Exchange swallowed its reservations about the
dangers of fragmentation, and allowed London's established derivatives
exchange Liffe and the Swedish-owned tiddler OMLX to have a go at trading
derivatives based on the FT-SE Mid 250 equity index?
Both exchanges had wanted an exclusive licence, and it had been more or less
assumed that Liffe would win it. But a degree of mutual suspicion appears to
persist between the stock exchange, on the one hand, and Liffe, which now
trades the equity derivatives that the exchange itself failed to get off the
ground, on the other. Surely Throgmorton Street is not trying to spoil
Liffe's fun?
OMLX boss Lynton Jones, himself an old stock exchange hand, is more
interested in what potential customers will think. 'The question is whether
they are Pro-Liffe or Pro-Choice,' he quips.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Observer: Lawrence's stock in trade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps it is just a coincidence, but Michael Lawrence, the new chief
executive of the London Stock Exchange, has followed the same sort of career
path as his luckless predecessor, Peter Rawlins.
Both have spent the bulk of their careers in big accountancy firms and
tested their business skills in the insurance industry. Rawlins, ex-Arthur
Andersen, came from insurance broking and Lawrence, ex-Price Waterhouse, was
hired by the Prudential as its first finance director as recently as 1988.
However, there the similarities end. Lawrence is a good deal older, and
hopefully wiser, than the abrasive Rawlins and has first-hand knowledge of
the problems of the stock exchange's customers. He was an outspoken critic
of the stock exchange's Taurus settlement fiasco. His connections as
chairman of the 100 group of top finance directors also mean that he will be
listened to in boardrooms that matter.
That said, it is unusual for an accountant cum insurance man to take such a
risk with his career. After all, there could be very little left of the
stock exchange in three years, whereas if he stayed at the Pru he might have
been in the running to succeed Mick Newmarch as group chief executive.
Perhaps he decided that the Pru would never appoint two non-actuaries in a
row to the top job there.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Big guns come to town: England's relaunched urban renewal
agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The launch of the government's urban regeneration agency yesterday under the
new name of English Partnerships provides an answer to a puzzle that has
been taxing businesses and agencies involved in inner-city regeneration.
Which of two contrasting views of its role would prevail? On the one hand,
there are the well-known views of Mr Michael Heseltine, who as environment
secretary proposed the new agency before the 1992 general election. He had
long campaigned for an interventionist English development agency, modelled
on similar organisations in Wales and Scotland, which used public money to
attract investment into areas of economic decline.
Or there was the much more limited role seen for the agency when the less
interventionist Mr Michael Howard replaced Mr Heseltine at the environment
department. The new orthodoxy tended to describe the agency as 'an urban
development corporation on wheels'.
Under this much more limited remit, the agency would concentrate on clearing
derelict land and putting in infrastructure in urban areas that had not so
far been considered important enough to have a UDC of their own.
The picture had been muddied, however, by the appointment of Lord Walker,
the former cabinet minister, as chairman of the new agency. As secretary of
state for Wales between 1987 and 1990, he had converted his job into a
high-profile, one-man inward investment agency. Appointed by Mr Heseltine,
Lord Walker looked increasingly uncomfortable in the more constrained role
envisaged for him by his new political masters.
Yesterday's launch showed that it is the vision of Lord Walker and Mr
Heseltine that has prevailed. English Partnerships will be more of a
development agency than a body devoted to clearing contaminated inner-city
sites.
Even the choice of title - dropping the 'urban' and assuming responsibility
for the whole of England - indicates that the balance of argument has swung
back to those who see a far-reaching role for the new organisation.
Lord Walker is clear that he is as much interested in winning inward
investment as in clearing derelict land. 'Inward investment has transformed
the British economy in some sectors,' he told the FT in an interview
yesterday. 'My view is that in the next five years, there is going to be the
biggest flow of inward investment into Europe ever seen, and this agency can
make a contribution to ensuring that a share of that comes to the UK.'
Lord Walker also makes clear his desire to work closely with local
authorities of all political complexions, after a period in which much
Whitehall spending has been directed through local quangos to bypass
councils. 'Local authority co-operation is very important to us, and we will
want to have a good relationship with them. That will make it easier to get
things done quickly and more effectively.'
Ministers were unwilling at yesterday's launch of English Partnerships to
disclose its funding for next year. With the urban programme already cut
from Pounds 1.7bn this year to Pounds 1.4bn next year, there is keen
interest in knowing whether the new quango will start under straitened
circumstances.
Lord Walker is less coy, saying that he expects the total - to be announced
in the unified Budget at the end of the month - to be between Pounds 250m
and Pounds 300m. If that is so, English Partnerships will have much the same
to spend next year as this.
And Lord Walker says that he is quite content with what he has so far been
offered. 'It is plenty for year one. I will be able to assess what the need
is and then go to the government and say what I think is a sensible figure
for the next three years. There will be arguments over the amount of money,
but I will be able to say that it will produce this level of economic
activity and that it is in the Treasury's interest to put that amount of
money in.'
A strong card in Lord Walker's hand in such negotiations will be the amount
of private investment English Partnerships succeeds in levering in, or
attracting, with its budget. 'Some projects involving the clearance of land
will produce no such additional investment,' he says. 'But in others, I
expect public investment to lever in up to nine times as much private
investment.'
None of this will happen quickly - and Lord Walker is anxious that English
Partnerships' success is not judged too soon. 'There will be no impact on
regeneration next week or the week after,' he says. 'But I expect to see a
real impact after three or four years.'

<TEXT>
JONATHAN SWIFT would have been richly diverted by the contortions western
European governments are performing over how they should christen the
12-nation grouping just reborn under the Maastricht treaty. Just as in
Gulliver's Travels the rulers of Lilliput and Blefuscu fought for decades
over whether they should crack their eggs at the big end or the little end,
the leaders of late-1993 Europe are spreading confusion over the small
matter of a name for their remodelled organisation. Is it still the European
Community - grown from the 1957 Treaty of Rome and responsible for 35 years
of deepening economic and political integration? Or is it something new,
with ambitions that sound grander and vaguer - the European Union?
The legalistic answer is that it is both. Maastricht created a hybrid in
which the old European Community coexists with a new framework for
co-operation between its individual sovereign governments, within the
European Union. When its members discuss matters that fall within the
parameters of the Treaty of Rome, such as trade, they are the EC. When they
talk about new areas of co-operation under Maastricht - foreign and security
policy, justice and home affairs - they are the EU.
Confused? You are not alone. Even the organisation's own foreign ministers
have already found difficulty in following this fine distinction to the
letter. Deciding when they should switch EC hats for EU ones in the Council
of Ministers this week looked like becoming the diplomatic equivalent of
determining how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. Small wonder
that they decided to rename themselves the Council of the European Union,
regardless of whether they are discussing EC or EU business.
In doing so, they (like Maastricht) papered over fundamental disagreements
between governments concerning the nature of their enterprise. 'Federalist'
ministers could go away crowing that the cause of Union had been advanced by
one glorious centimetre, even though the EU enjoys no 'legal personality'.
Sceptics such as Britain could protest that they had not budged one inch
from their insistence on co-operation case by case.
That still leaves the problem of what mere mortals are to make of it all. To
listen to the British government sometimes, you would think it was still
more appropriate to call the EC/U the Common Market, when it has long since
been something substantially more than that. The Euro-priests, on the other
hand, invest the nomenclature itself with almost mystical powers, as if to
think Union means that it is.
This newspaper has no easy answer to the conundrum, but in order not to sow
daily confusion, we have to choose. As the opening words of the treaty
state: 'The high contracting parties establish among themselves a European
Union, hereinafter called 'the Union'.' The FT will take the union's heads
of state at their word: European Union it is.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Rescue culture
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the consequences of monetary mismanagement in Britain is that the
potential equivalent of Germany's Mittelstand - the powerful small to
medium-sized business sector - is invariably throttled whenever the economy
takes an excessive downward lurch. The process is made worse by insolvency
procedures that often give senior creditors little incentive to keep
troubled companies in business. While the 1986 Insolvency Act sought to
bring more flexibility to the process through company voluntary arrangements
and company administration orders, these have been under-used in the
recession. A new attempt by the government's Insolvency Service to explain
this failure is thus welcome; and its proposed solutions appear well-judged.
Insolvency practitioners have long argued that the problem with company
voluntary arrangements, which were designed to help the smaller companies
that account for the great majority of insolvencies, is that a company has
no protection from creditors once it has informed them of the need for
negotiations. A breathing space is clearly needed and the Insolvency
Service's report proposes a 28-day moratorium, binding on all creditors.
This would take effect immediately a notice of a prospective voluntary
arrangement had been filed and would be supervised by a nominee who would be
a member of a regulated profession. The report goes on to recommend some
changes in the rules for company administration orders, designed to remove
some of the more forbidding obstacles to this form of attempted
resuscitation.
More radical ideas come in the form of requests for comment rather than
specific proposals. The difficulty of obtaining funding in the course of a
corporate rescue is addressed, for example, with the suggestion that
super-priority over other creditors might be granted to the financier who
advances money in the course of a company voluntary arrangement. The report
also hints that the balance between the interests of secured and unsecured
creditors may not be right, by asking whether the rights of those who have a
floating charge over a business should be removed, allowing them to appoint
an administrator only.
This goes to the heart of the problem of creating a rescue culture in
Britain, because it implicitly addresses the clash of interests between
different classes of creditor for whom the survival of the company as a
going concern is a matter of varying importance. If the banks are to forfeit
some of their existing rights as senior creditors, they will no doubt
extract a price. There are also limits to what flexible insolvency laws can
do if the directors approach their creditors too late. But a tilt in the
balance of power between secured and unsecured creditors may be an essential
step towards saving more good businesses from bad financial structures. The
Insolvency Service deserves a positive response.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Why we cannot just 'go it alone'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
My articles attempting to persuade people that there is more danger of
deficient than of excess demand have contained one deliberate omission. They
have not called for slashing reductions in interest rates, irrespective of
what other countries do, and irrespective of what happens to sterling.
Instead they have concentrated on the need for a change of priorities at the
international level in both the 'summit' Group of Seven countries and the
European Community. As far as UK domestic policy is concerned, they have
focused on the case against taking risks with the recovery by piling on net
tax increases over and above the quite large imposts already left behind by
the former chancellor, Norman Lamont, for implementation next year and
beyond.
This emphasis has been there partly because the main sources of deficient
demand are outside the UK - they are particularly to be found in continental
Europe and Japan. There is an unnecessarily large gap between output and
capacity in most places. But it is at least possible that in the UK the gap
may be near to stabilising, while in other areas it is getting wider all the
time.
Another reason for not joining the ultra-cheap money bandwagon is that its
members exaggerate the extent to which an individual medium-sized country
can 'go it alone' in interest rate policy and ignore the consequences for
the exchange rate.
Nothing could be more misleading than the belief of the Tory loony wing that
the price of sterling is no more important than the price of tomatoes. While
a big change in the price of tomatoes might at most lead to related changes
in the prices of lettuce and cucumbers, the exchange rate is the main link
between one country's price level and that of its trading partners. It is
true that the 1992 British devaluation, following the departure from the
ERM, had a smaller inflationary impact than many analysts expected and that
the UK has since had a faster rate of growth than its European partners. But
these events may have given a highly misleading impression of the scope for
a single country to decide policy on purely domestic criteria.
The 1992 devaluation was a one-off event, taking place when downward
pressures on inflation and activity were exceptionally severe worldwide.
Indeed the governor of the Bank of England, Mr Eddie George, came to the
conclusion that, at the original ERM entry parity, the UK 'might have
actually had falling prices'. Instead the UK has had an underlying inflation
rate of 3 per cent, which will show an upward blip in coming months, but
which the Bank hopes will return to 3 per cent by 1995.
What applies to a single devaluation in exceptionally favourable
circumstances would not apply to a policy of repeated depreciation. Even in
the present depressed world economy, it will not be possible to absorb
nearly as much of the effects of another devaluation in importers' margins,
or in the margins of foreign goods competing with British ones in
international trade, as it was last time round.
There is, moreover, a tendency to exaggerate the scope for purely national
interest rate policies, even under a regime of flexible exchange rates.
Short-term real interest rates are then indeed freer to vary between
countries for temporary periods. But this is much less true of long-term
real interest rates or even of average short-term ones over a period.
The fact is that, in a world of free capital markets, real long-term
interest rates tend to converge. This is a more fundamental sense of 'not
being able to buck the market' than Lady Thatcher had in mind in her famous
remark after she stopped her chancellor shadowing the D-Mark in 1988.
In a single free capital market, there will be one prevailing long-term real
rate of interest. This long-term rate can be regarded as either the
prevailing long bond rate or the expected average of short-term interest
rates, appropriately discounted. These two measures must be consistent with
each other; otherwise there would be easy profits to be made from moving
from short to long-term fixed interest securities, or vice versa.
In practice, nominal bond rates in different countries are not, of course,
identical. But an individual country's can differ from the going
international rate - default risks apart - only by a currency premium or
discount, reflecting the expected appreciation or depreciation of the
currency against other main currencies.
The expected movement of a currency will, over a sufficient period of years,
in its turn mainly reflect expected inflation differentials. Thus, long-term
interest rates in the UK can only be lower than those in Germany if the
expected inflation rate is lower. This is clearly not the market's
expectation. UK 10-year bonds yield nearly 1 percentage point more in the UK
than in Germany, despite all the British base rate cuts. French bond yields
have, however, virtually closed the gap with German ones.
It is true that US bond yields are about half a percentage point lower still
 -more likely reflecting market belief in a temporary undershooting of the
dollar than that US inflation will fall behind that of France and Germany.
The country where nominal bond rates are decisively below the international
average is Japan - which reflects optimistic expectations both about yen
appreciation and Japanese inflation.
What flexible exchange rates permit is temporary variations in either
direction in real short-term rates. In some circumstances, this may be a
valuable degree of freedom; but it is, of course, limited. For a country,
such as the UK, trying to stabilise its currency after decades of inflation
and depreciation, the choice is illustrated in the first chart. If it could
carry out a successful domestic monetary policy, the result might look like
the line marked 'successful floating'. There would be periods - say during
domestic recession - when real short-term interest rates would be lower than
elsewhere.
There would be other periods, say after a burst of credit liberalisation
such as the UK experienced in the mid-1980s, when its rates would be higher.
There would be corresponding fluctuations in the exchange rate; but over the
long term there would be little trend one way or the other against the
currency of a country with stable prices. Even if those in charge of
monetary policy never looked at the exchange rate and only at domestic
monetary variables, success in their policies would ensure that the exchange
rate followed a horizontal trend, despite short-term variations on either
side.
A flexible rate can thus provide no more than an opportunity for a temporary
deviation from the international real interest rate norm. For instance
American short-term real interest rates could be well below those of western
Europe in 1992-93 because the dollar was regarded as depressed and likely to
recover. This temporary deviation may have been useful, as was the UK move
to lower short-term interest rates after September 1992. But there was no
way either country could indefinitely run a programme of real interest rates
below prevailing international levels. If you look at the gap between US and
German real interest rates over the years, the differential went first one
way and then the other, with a tendency to balance out over the years.
The risks of going it alone should now be pretty clear. For in the situation
shown in the chart it would be terribly tempting for the UK - or another
European country suffering from go-it-alone temptations - to let its
exchange rate slide just that fatal bit too long (as in the mid-1980s). Its
rulers are unlikely to know enough about monetary relationships to tighten
up in time. But a consequence of delay in taking corrective action is that
inflationary expectations become reinforced, and high costs entrenched.
After that the transitional output and job costs of bringing the exchange
rate up to the horizontal line will seem to be (and will be) too high. Thus
there will be strong pressures to tread the path of inflation and
depreciation shown by the diagonal line.
A more constructive, if at present unfashionable, route to a monetary policy
for non-inflationary growth would be through resumed international
co-operation. The most hopeful path is neither to go back to reconstructing
the ERM and constructing Emu as if nothing had happened. Nor is it to build
co-operation around inflation targets alone, as the Bank of England
sometimes hints. A better path would be to have a concerted policy towards
nominal demand, at least at a European level, and preferably taking in the
G7 as well.
By far the best place to begin would be with the European Monetary Institute
due to start in January in Frankfurt under Alexandre Lamfalussy. The
official British desire to confine and limit the role of the Institute is
narrow-minded and counterproductive. If Europe is to be less dependent on a
single anchor country such as Germany - which is now less able to play that
role - the EMI is its best bet, whether it develops into a European central
bank or has to settle for something less glamorous but still playing a vital
role.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Japanese nuclear policy increases
UK's risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WILLIAM WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, For the first time, a Japanese official has acknowledged that, if Thorp
operates, plutonium separated from Japanese fuel will have to be stored at
Sellafield (Letters, November 8). While Mr K Kaneko of the Federation of
Electric Power Companies of Japan says that it will not remain there
'forever', he knows that Japanese objectives cannot now be met without
long-term storage at Sellafield.
If current contracts are honoured, around 35 tonnes of fissile plutonium
will be separated from Japanese fuels by British and French reprocessors.
Japan is also constructing its own reprocessing plant at Rokkasho-mura which
is expected to produce a further 50 tonnes in the 10 years after it opens in
2001. Add another 5 tonnes from the existing Tokai-mura plant and one
arrives at a supply of about 90 tonnes by the year 2010.
The trouble for Japan is that its consumption of plutonium cannot approach
this figure. The fast reactor programme that was to have absorbed most of
the plutonium has been much delayed, and plans for using the material in
conventional reactors are still in their infancy. A surplus of more than 20
tonnes by 2000, and 40 tonnes by 2010, is now probable if reprocessing plans
are implemented.
The Japanese government has recently reaffirmed its 'no stockpiling' policy.
The great great political sensitivity in east Asia about plutonium has led
the Japanese government to declare that only a 'running stock' sufficient
for current needs will be held on Japanese territory.
The implication is that any surplus will have to remain in Europe until well
into the next century. This will be true even if plutonium recycling expands
after 2000, since priority will then have to be given to using the plutonium
separated at Rokkasho-mura. Otherwise, stockpiling in Japan will be
unavoidable.
If Thorp operates, large tonnages of Japanese separated plutonium will
therefore have to be held in store at Sellafield. Along with the British
plutonium for which there is no use, and the German plutonium which is also
likely to remain here, the surplus stock at Sellafield will exceed 100
tonnes soon after the year 2000.
Reprocessing is now the most expensive and risky storage policy imaginable.
Instead of leaving the plutonium and radioactive wastes safely stored in
spent fuel, they are separated out just to be stored again. How can the
government consent to this?

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr M D SANDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Macdonald's letter (November 4) referring to my comments on the
proposed changes to the British Standards Institution Royal Charter and
their relevance to the recommendations of the Cadbury committee misses the
point.
The Cadbury committee took special care to define clearly the respective
responsibilities of executive and non-executive directors.
The proposed BSI Royal Charter changes sought to create a new species of
corporate animal, the 'executive non-executive'. Apparently, members of this
new species would have the power under the proposed changes to reward
themselves financially for services rendered without the normal checks and
balances.
These changes were outstandingly rejected by the subscribing membership of
the BSI, representing a cross-section of British industry, at the BSI annual
general meeting.
Mr Macdonald may have been a member of the Cadbury committee, but perhaps he
should have listened and understood more carefully.

<TEXT>
Sir, If Sir Leon Brittan, the European Commission's trade commissioner,
wants to double the staff of his anti-dumping unit he ought to be told that
predatory dumping presupposes a dominant market share ('Brittan wants larger
anti-dumping unit', November 4). If the Commission confined itself to those
cases in which a foreign supplier or a cartel of foreign suppliers has
acquired a dominant market share in the Community, it could cut its
anti-dumping unit by more than one half.
The condition of a dominant market share is well established in EC
competition policy. It would also be consistent with the EC anti-dumping
regulation. Competition and anti-dumping policy would at least be
integrated.

UTOPIA UNARMED: THE LATIN AMERICAN LEFT AFTER THE COLD WAR
By Jorge G. Castaneda
Knopf Dollars 27.50
For 30 years until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the left in Latin
America was transfixed by Fidel Castro's Cuban revolution. Now the Soviet
regime that subsidised him is history and Castro looks like an old Latin
caudillo clinging desperately to power.
Since the end of the cold war it has been the rightwing advocates of
market-oriented reforms, and not the left, that have been offering change in
Latin America. Governments across the region have been squeezing the size of
the state, deregulating and opening up protected markets to foreign
competition.
For many on the left, these policies have failed to stimulate sustainable
growth. Worse, they have widened divisions between rich and poor. But what
is the left's alternative?
This is the question the leftwing Mexican academic, Jorge Castaneda,
addresses in Utopia Unarmed. He says revolution - except for extreme groups
such as Peru's Shining Path - is no longer on the left's agenda.
Indeed, in contrast with its past equivocation, the left as envisaged by
Castaneda views representative democracy and human rights as priorities.
Democracy requires more than elections, however. What is needed is reform of
existing democratic institutions, including increasing accountability, and a
fair judicial system.
The left in the 1990s must continue to be nationalistic, he says, in part
because the process of nation-building is incomplete. But its nationalism
must take a new shape. The left should recognise that developments in the
global economy constrain this nationalism. It should reject foreign
interference in domestic issues, such as narcotics policy. However, the left
should embrace the notion that international influence on other issues -
human rights, the environment, fair elections - can enhance nationalist
objectives.
The left should build alliances with groups in the west - to seek, for
example, to influence US policy on specific issues. Castaneda and others of
the Mexican left have already begun the process, co-operating with labour
groups in the US to oppose the North American Free Trade Agreement between
Mexico, the US and Canada.
Within the nation, governments should decentralise power to regions.
Outside, they should seek regional economic integration, but only among
equals. This rules out Nafta, but includes accords among developing
countries.
In the Castaneda vision, state ownership is no longer an end in itself, but
he still advocates a central role for the state in the economy. He accepts
market capitalism - but not the Anglo-Saxon variety. Instead, he looks to
continental Europe and its system of social welfare, and to the Far East for
its model of industrial policy and export-led growth.
Castaneda, however, fails to resolve some crucial problems for the left. How
much of the free-market agenda would left-leaning governments have to adopt
not to scare off investment? Though he calls this a false dilemma, he agrees
that 'the business community in most of Latin America has a choice today . .
. when faced with the unpleasant prospect of a reformist government - pack
up and go elsewhere'.
Castaneda fails to pursue some of the more interesting ideas from the right
that could have an impact on poverty. For example, giving people in Latin
America's slums legal title to their homes - currently owned by nobody -
could alleviate the plight of the urban poor.
His vision may ultimately be unworkable. But if the left does shape up in
the way Castaneda suggests, it would end up embracing many of the social
democratic traditions of west Europe. That can only be good news for Latin
America's still shaky democracies.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: No order to seize Brazilian mahogany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HERMAN SCHEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The article 'Judge orders seizure of UK-bound mahogany' (October 29),
by Oliver Tickell, is misleading and inaccurate.
We are concerned that your readers, who include many of our suppliers,
customers, bankers and professional advisers, may now be under the
impression that we have been involved in an illegal shipment of mahogany
from Brazil.
At the time of your article, Tradelink had no 'shipload of mahogany half way
across the Atlantic'. No Brazilian judge ordered 'the immediate seizure' of
this shipload, nor had he ordered 'the sequestration of thousands of cubic
metres of mahogany belonging to C&amp;C'.
The last shipment we made from C&amp;C was loaded on October 8 and had already
arrived and been distributed in the UK. It was exported from Brazil with the
usual valid export licence and necessary export documentation. In terms of
The Timber Trade Federation guidelines for shipments from a non-AIMEX
supplier like C&amp;C, we took the additional precaution of insisting on
Brazilian certificates of origin guaranteeing that the mahogany did not come
from Indian reserves.
The information we have about C&amp;C regarding the judge's ruling on October 18
is that IBAMA, Brazil's environment protection agency, accused C&amp;C of
obtaining a mahogany export quota on the basis of false information. The
Brazilian judge ruled that all mahogany exports by C&amp;C from Brazilian
territory should be halted. He also suspended its mahogany quota and gave
C&amp;C five days to respond to the allegations. C&amp;C responded on October 21,
vigorously contesting all the allegations made against it, and the matter is
still in the hands of the Brazilian courts. In the meantime, C&amp;C continues
its business in other species because its export licence has not be revoked.
We have suspended our mahogany purchases from C&amp;C effective October 19 and
will review our policy towards it after clarification of its legal position.
We do not wish to be seen as fighting for or defending C&amp;C's legal position
as this is a matter for the Brazilian authorities. We fully support TTF and
its efforts to ensure that mahogany is derived from legal sources. We will
take no part in illegally sourced timber from anywhere in the world and
always attempt to obtain supplies from well-managed forests.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Arts: 'Mandragola' opens new theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seeing a comedy by Niccolo Machiavelli (1467-1527) is like discovering John
Stuart Mill was big in panto or George Eliot had a fizzy stand-up routine.
Machiavelli's Mandragola (1522) is the old wine in the new bottle, since it
inaugurates The Southwark Playhouse.
First the theatre. The renovation cost under Pounds 10,000. This used to be
a tea warehouse, engineering shop, and Filipino church; so trade, technology
and religion have now ceded to entertainment. The pews for seats are an
irony Machiavelli would have enjoyed, but the black or dark green walls
would have reminded him of his spell in prison after the Medici lost control
of Florence. There are a dozen spotlights, a small playing area, and a bar.
The Southwark Playhouse fills a need for a studio space in this part of
London and, on first acquaintance, looks good.
Now the play. Machiavelli wrote Mandragola long after his political
ambitions had been thwarted; it has a realist outlook and a comic execution.
Like his Discoursi and Il Principe, it catalogues what men and women do
rather than what they ought to do.
The plot weaves around Lucrezia, the beautiful wife of an impotent
Florentine, Messer Niccia. Hearing of her beauty, Calimacco has come from
France to seduce her, and enlists the limber offices of Ligurio to gain
entry to her bedchamber. First Calimacco pretends to be a medic prescribing
mandrake root, but he diagnoses death to the first man who makes love to
Lucrezia post-mandrake. He then takes on a second disguise as an expendable
street urchin, ushered in by Ligurio and Messer Niccia for a night of
pleasure with Lucrezia. She enjoys it, Calimacco declares his love, and they
plot a future as doctor and patient. The church, in the form of a quiet,
worldly friar, watches indulgently.
The result is a cocktail of Up Pompeii and Les Liaisons Dangereuses, all
trust and trysts, but laced with Machiavelli's sententia: 'Always weigh
certain gain against uncertain loss' or 'it is the part of the wise man to
choose the lesser of two evils.' There are philosophical debates waiting to
happen; Ligurio, resplendent in pink socks, green suit and orange shirt, can
still observe: 'I believe what satisfies the majority is itself good.'
The Turkish director Mehmet Ergen, who has worked on Sam Shepherd and David
Mamet, keeps the dialogue natural and relaxed; Peter Pacey as the slimy
Ligurio and Clive Webster as the pragmatic Friar are particularly good, in
love with the deliciousness of the plot, but nevertheless keeping the issues
humane. Matthew Morrison as Calimacco is by turns libidinous and lurid as
the chief seducer.
It is surprising to find that Machiavelli works on stage. His maxims are
most suited now not to politics (the thrust of Edward Pearce's recently
published book Machiavelli's Children) but to organisations (the focus of
Anthony Jay's Machiavelli &amp; Management), where it is much more secure to be
feared than to be loved and where the reputation of power is power.
Southwark Playhouse, Southwark Bridge Road, SE1 (071 620 3494) until
November 27

FT  11 NOV 93 / Arts: Han Ong's 'The LA Plays' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
According to a programme note for the new play at the Almeida, there were 36
arrests of male prostitutes under the age of 18 in the city of Los Angeles
last year.
I have been wondering what that figure means. Is 36 a lot or a little?
Should there have been more arrests, fewer or none at all? Is it the age
figure that is significant? What happened after the arrests and, while we
are on the subject, what are the numbers for female prostitutes, and the
changes over time?
On the basis of other figures in the programme, 36 seems rather small. The
population of Los Angeles County grew by 50 per cent to just over 9 million
between 1960 and 1990. There are 31,753 actors and directors living in LA,
not including dancers, models, singers and game show hosts. Equity, the
actors' union, has a membership of 9,000 in the Los Angeles area.
The conclusions from the statistics are not clear. On the other hand, Han
Ong has the good sense to keep the figures off the stage. The LA Plays are
an effective piece of theatre at least until about two-thirds of the way
through. They tail off when they enter into a bout of repetitive four letter
words, but before that there is much to entertain and to instruct. The
quality of the acting and the direction is uniformly high throughout.
The difficulty, for the author as much as for the audience, is trying to
determine what the piece is about. Three strands compete. One is what it is
like to be an Asian-American; another is what happens if you are a male
drug-pushing prostitute to boot; and the third is the special nature of Los
Angeles in particular (the pursuit of stardom) and America in general - 'a
big country', as one of the characters says, 'but a lonely place'. There is
also Aids. All of which is a lot to put into a piece of 21 short scenes
lasting barely two hours including an interval.
To a European, not resident in Los Angeles, quite the most interesting
aspect sociologically is the absence of blacks. Here are whites, Hispanics
and Asians: no wonder the blacks in the city sometimes rebel.
The Asian 18-year-old, beautifully played by Francois Chau, and oddly called
Greg, is universally described as 'smart'. He is frequently asked by
Caucasians about his ethnic origins - American Indian, Japanese, Chinese or
what? (In fact, his family is from Taiwan.) All that he takes in his stride.
He does not seem to have any doubt that American is what he has become, but
he prefers to use his smartness on homosexual affairs, a bit of travel to
New Mexico, while making enough money from peddling drugs and hiring himself
out. He is rather a striking, attractive figure even when the inevitable
Aids sets in.
Other characters stand out less, though I greatly admired the performance of
Ramon Tikaram as Greg's friend, Nicholas. Ong says his play is as much about
geography as about people, and one can see what he means. A young white
arrives in LA from Iowa, and seems more out of place than Greg from Taiwan:
he, too, takes to male prostitution, but tends to call his clients 'sir'.
For the most part, this is a haunting production with some very terse
dialogue. It is directed by Matthew Lloyd and cleverly designed by Julian
McGowan.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Arts: Brooding Russian - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Tuesday we should have heard Nikolai Demidenko playing Tchaikovsky and
Rakhmaninov piano trios in the Wigmore Hall, with his violin-compatriot
Grigori Zhislin and the French-Canadian cellist Sophie Rolland. But when we
got there, the concert had shrunk to a solo recital by Demidenko. I might
just have gone home; this formidable pianist compels admiration, but rarely
any sympathetic warmth. His last-minute programme included a lot of Nikolai
Medtner, however - two of whose concerti he recorded with electrifying
commitment last year; so I stayed.
Medtner is a peculiarly interesting composer: a contemporary of Skryabin and
Rakhmaninov, and hugely fluent - but unlike them a Westernising
'conservative', because his favoured models were Schumann and Brahms. He
fled Russia soon after the Revolution, and lived his last 30-odd years in
Golders Green.
Demidenko cuts rather a daunting figure: lofty, chilly, saturnine. His
Medtner here was the Sonata Reminiscenza and the Sonata Tragica, each of
them prefaced by a slighter piece from which it grew: a 'Canzona Serenata'
and a 'Canzona Matinata', respectively wistful and morning-dewy.
Viktoria Postnikova used to make a speciality of the Sonata Reminiscenza,
which flowed under her hands continuously and hauntingly, amid subtle
shadings. With Demidenko each new thematic idea arrived with a grinding
clash, as if Medtner's structures were held together by main force alone.
Moments of pungent character erupted as if from nowhere, lightning-flashes
in no cogent order. The laser-illuminations were brilliant, their sequence
fractured and unpersuasive.
Demidenko had begun his recital with Tchaikovsky's Dumka, virtually an
'occasional' piece - tuneful but little more than routine concert-stuff,
which he searched through with slow, excruciating tenderness, rather
marvellous to hear. The second half of his programme, all Rakhmaninov (three
Etudes-Tableaux, seven Preludes), was only fitfully concentrated. There was
a regular scatter of finger-slips, especially in rapid bass-shots - most
unlike Demidenko's usual omni-competent form.
The E-flat minor Etude-Tableau began with a nervily original kind of
brooding and ended in drawn-out gloom, but the middle was all-out,
triple-forte bashing. The programme-notes reported the expatriate Demidenko
as declaring that 'being Russian is a duty'] That may be so; but the duty
need not be so icy, nor so grimly stern.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Arts: What the butler didn't see - Cinema
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REMAINS OF THE DAY (U) James Ivory
DEMOLITION MAN (15) Marco Brambilla
GUILTY AS SIN (15) Sidney Lumet
L'ACCOMPAGNATRICE (PG) Claude Miller
The Remains Of The Day takes the oldest of movie genres and turns it upside
down. Instead of 'What the butler saw' here is 'What the butler didn't see
(or in some cases pretended he hadn't).' Like Kazuo Ishiguro's Booker
Prize-winning novel, James Ivory's film is a tragicomedy about spiritual
myopia. But irony dances gleefully amid the gloom. Not the least of the
movie's own tangy paradoxes is that our buttoned-up and blinkered hero, this
all-unseeing carrier of silver salvers, is played by Sir Anthony Hopkins,
whose most famous recent screen role was as a man who Saw Everything. Not
only saw it but smelt it, heard it and whenever possible ate it alive.
The main things Stephens fails to see - let alone savour - are love
(housekeeper Emma Thompson) and political imbroglio (James Fox as his
quisling master Lord Darlington, hosting appeasement pow-wows in the
Nazi-threatened 1930s). But he also fails to discern his own atrophying
sensibility as a life of 'Yes, sir, no, sir' self-subordination cuts off the
normal arterial flow between heart and brain.
The novel was a tour de force of wry pathos and behavioural comedy. Its
autopsy on British repression - on what EM Forster once called our
'deficiency of the heart' - was not just about Stephens, it was narrated by
Stephens. And like all good first-person narratives, from Gulliver's Travels
to Moby Dick, it encouraged us to be sceptical about the narrator himself.
Might not this omniscient 'I', aiming his prejudices or disdains or
disingenuous innocence at the world, be the biggest of all the book's
boobies, prigs or self-deceivers?
Helped by his longtime screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala (A Room With A
View, Howards End), Ivory deftly transfers the book's past/present interplay
onto screen. Here is Stephens in 1956, tooling through the English
countryside in his new master's Daimler to rendezvous with, and he hopes
re-hire, the now unhappily married Miss Kenton (Thompson). And here is
Stephens 20 years before, when she and he suppressed their little flame in
the ruthless rituals of domestic service. Polish that gridiron] Dust that
alcove] Prepare your 'staff plan' for those all-important visits by
Chamberlain and Ribbentrop.
The book's comic highlights are wittily born again for the film: Stephens
aghast at being asked to instruct a young relative of Lord D's in the 'facts
of life'; or Stephens shrinking into himself like a salt-sprinkled slug when
Miss Kenton tries to wrest his latest reading matter from him (a romantic
novelette). Even when the film threatens to overplay a moment from the novel
 -Stephens intruding on a Miss Kenton sobbing helplessly in her bedroom to
convey the latest dusting instructions - caricature is kept at bay by our
total belief in Hopkins and Thompson.
Other casting choices are dodgier. Too often the film reaches for the James
Ivory Rep Directory and sticks a random pin in it. Christopher Reeve? - oh
dear me no] - as the American anti-appeasement senator who roughs up the
1930s conferences and then returns, greyer but no less one-dimensional, to
buy up Darlington Hall. (This is an over-neat screenwriter's touch; in the
novel the two American characters were different.)
Reeve is a gawky bantamweight thrown into a ring full of swift-moving
heavyweights. But what a show those superior bruisers put on. Hopkins is all
bullheaded grace and lethal diffidence, holding off the world's blows with
little flinches of the head and sometimes offering his own respectful
version of a right hook. (Show him a dirty hand-towel and you will be
spreadeagled on the canvas.) Thompson, as in Howards End, strides straight
out to the middle of the emotional arena and never retreats. This actress
can make everyday distress seem like high tragedy and spinsterly longing
wring the filmgoer's heart. More British acting Oscars on the way?
In Demolition Man Sylvester Stallone wakes up in the year 2032. He has spent
36 years in a 'cryo-penitentiary,' but age has not withered nor
refrigeration staled those plug-ugly features. (Nor that Yogi Bear voice
with a hint of lisp.) Soon Sly is re-donning the cop clothes he disgraced
back in 1996, when his gung-ho showdown with black psychopath Wesley Snipes
resulted in the death of 30 hostages.
Now he is back in 'San Angeles' (sic) and so is Snipes, woken from his own
deep-freeze to become a state hit-person. Add a comely policewoman (Sandra
Bullock), a villainous city ruler with a Brit accent (Nigel Hawthorne) and
an outbreak of runaway production design (David L. Snyder, once of Blade
Runner) and you have this merry if sometimes indigestible recipe for a
sci-fi film cum cop opera.
Mercifully, amid the bang-bangs, there are some ha-ha's. If Schwarzenegger
gave self-satire an honourable name in Last Action Hero, it is Stallone's
turn now to put the 'ludic' back into ludicrous. He mows down baddies with
post-modern implausibility; he cracks blithe one-liners; and he even has a
gentle swing at his rival with a bit of dialogue about the 'Schwarzenegger
Presidential Library.' (It transpires that Big Arnie has recently run the
White House.)
Erupting around our hero is the movie's take-no-prisoners futurist vision.
Among the 21st century terrors to contemplate: the Taco Bell chain will run
every restaurant (you have to have been to LA to realise the full horror of
this); street pay-phones will allow you to 'dial an ego-boost'; and smoking,
drinking, meat-eating and sex will be banned except through the pretend
thrills of Virtual Reality.
Oh, and under the sidewalks dwell the rebels of Cardboard City, munching
ratburgers, swilling beer and declaring war on political correctness. In a
film that shamelessly casts a black man as baddie - give or take Mr Snipes's
orange hair - no prizes for guessing on which side of the PC line dwell the
film's own sympathies.
No prizes either for guessing who is sympathetic and who not in Guilty As
Sin. Murder-suspected ladykiller Don Johnson, a walking thousand-dollar suit
with a smirk on top, smarms his way into top lawyer Rebecca De Mornay's
office and insists that she defend him. Did he defenestrate his now-dead
wife? Probably. Will he throw De Mornay off the top of her career pinnacle?
Probably. 'This is the monster client syndrome every lawyer dreads]' gurgles
our heroine to her (soon to be ex-)boyfriend Stephen Lang.
Director Sidney Lumet, once of Twelve Angry Men, is himself tottering atop
his pinnacle at present. He last gave us Close To Eden in which Melanie
Griffith, playing a hardnosed woman detective, met the monster miscasting
syndrome. Lumet does a better job here with Griffith's spouse. But even an
extra-oleaginous Johnson and a super-califragilistic Mornay - suggesting
frailty along with with the hydraulic-hipped sex appeal - cannot help the
director lift the contrivance-heavy script by Larry Cohen (late of Q - The
Winged Serpent) into plausibility.
Also, where do these people live? Like Demolition Man - but at least that
was a fantasy - Guilty As Sin has a case of runaway production design
(Philip Rosenberg). Every flat looks like a white-scrubbed modern art
gallery; every office seems to exist in a penthouse beyond the clouds.
Perhaps it is a metaphor for the high living that comes before a fall. Or
perhaps it is therapeutic wish-fulfilment for a movie town that lives with
smog, earthquakes and forest fires.
It should make one warm to the honest, low-key period detail of Claude
Miller's L'Accompagnatrice (The Accompanist). But low-key can be a synonym
for dull. Here the tale of a beautiful Russian-French soprano (Elena
Safonova), her timid young pianist (Romane Bohringer) and the refined
battering their lives take in the political storms of the French Occupation
never rises, in wit, perceptiveness or excitement, above middle C.

RTZ states that its mining companies in Papua New Guinea have consulted the
local people and complied with the environmental demands of the government.
Yet according to 'Hell In The Pacific' (C4, 9.00) in the Critical Eye
series, there has been much bitterness since the RTZ subsidiary CRA began
mining copper at Bougainville in 1966 and gold at Mount Kare in 1990.
Michael Ignatieff begins a six-part series on nationalism, Blood And
Belonging (BBC2, 9.30), in the former Yugoslavia where he lived as a child.
Since he was born in Canada, his father in Russia, and he now lives in
Britain, he seems particularly well equipped to present programmes which
visit all those countries.
Richard Briers stars as 'God' (Godfrey) in the four-part comedy If You See
God, Tell Him (BBC1, 9.30). When struck by a load of builder's rubble
Godfrey is transformed into 'a parody of the ad-man's dream': a disabled
pensioner who believes in advertisements as fundamentalists believe in The
Bible. ITV begins six short dramas set in London's tube train system: Going
Undergound (11.15).

<TEXT>
Brian Redhead, 63, who steps down as presenter of the Today programme in a
few months' time, is to be chairman of a new think-tank which will
investigate the state of local government in England and Wales.
Redhead, who has become one of Britain's best-known radio broadcasters
during his 18 years on the Today programme, is no stranger to controversy
and his new post will give him a chance to contribute to the sometimes
acrimonious debate about the reform of local government in Britain.
The new think-tank, which is called the Commission for Local Democracy and
will have a two-year life, has tried to guarantee its independence by not
taking funding from either local or central government. It has raised funds
from a number of sources including Unity Trust Bank and the Municipal
Journal.
David Clark, 36, director of the new body, says that local democracy is in
'need of friends and we hope we can contribute to its strengthening in
future'. The aim will be to analyse some of the ills that beset local
government and suggest solutions.
The organisation has nine commissioners who will oversee its work and draw
up its recommendations. Apart from Redhead, they include Roger Jefferies
(formerly an under-secretary, environment department, and chief executive,
London Borough of Croydon); Steve Bullock (former Labour leader of London
borough of Lewisham); Jane Clark (former Liberal leader of South Somerset
District Council); Gareth Gimblett (former Conservative leader of Berkshire
County Council); Simon Jenkins (former editor of The Times); Gerry Stoker
(Professor of Politics, Strathclyde University); Kieron Walsh (Professor of
Public Sector Management, Birmingham University) and Sally Witcher
(director, Child Poverty Action Group).

FT  11 NOV 93 / People: Sears changes its finance director
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stephen Park, finance director of retailing group Sears and Liam Strong's
first big appointment after he became chief executive in 1991, has resigned
with effect from the beginning of next month. He will be replaced by David
Defty (right), deputy finance director at Grand Metropolitan.
A company source says Park, who was headhunted in June last year from Hanson
where he was Lord Hanson's personal assistant, had been having discussions
with Strong in recent months. 'He and Liam agreed that it just wasn't coming
together in the way they had hoped. They decided it was better for them to
part company.'
Park, who had been finance director of Hanson's Allders division and later
responsible for strategic planning, acquisitions and divestments, is said to
have 'two or three other irons in the fire'. He will receive an undisclosed
severance package.
Defty, 48, has what Sears calls a 'solid record in financial management of
well-regarded companies'. He began his career at Philips Electrical, and
joined Colgate-Palmolive in 1968 where he held several senior positions
including director, corporate finance, New York. After leaving in 1984 he
worked as finance director at Guinness and Woolworths, and joined Grand
Metropolitan in 1988 as finance director of the IDV drinks division.
He became deputy group finance director of GrandMet in March last year.
Sears, which found Defty through an executive search, said his experience in
the US and in several 'customer-orientated' businesses fitted him well for
his new post.
Sears does not expect Defty's appointment to lead to any changes in
accounting policy; it has worked hard in the past few years to make its
accounts more transparent.
Sears is also beefing up its board through the promotion of two new
directors, Ian Thomson, 47, managing director of Sears footwear business
British Shoe Corporation, and Rod Taylor, 40, director of group human
resources. The board has seen its numbers depleted by a series of management
changes in the past two years.
Taylor's association with Strong goes back to Strong's days as director of
marketing and operations at British Airways, when Taylor was his human
resources general manager. Thomson joined Sears in September last year from
South African retailing group Edgars Stores.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Ducking the price
wars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Price wars are growing so common in businesses from grocery retailing to
personal computers and telecommunications that, for many companies, joining
in has become a pre-requisite of survival.
However, an article in the current McKinsey Quarterly argues that price wars
should - and often can - be avoided. Indeed, it says, preventing them should
be a cardinal rule of marketing.
Almost invariably, the resulting losses outweigh any gains. For a typical,
publicly quoted US company, McKinsey says, a one percentage point cut in
prices translates into a 12.3 per cent drop in profit.
That fall can be reversed only if sales volumes rise 4 per cent. Yet in most
businesses, a 1 per cent price reduction is unlikely to generate more than a
2 per cent increase in sales.
Furthermore, price wars rarely squeeze competitors out of the market or
discourage new entrants. Instead, they undermine premium pricing structures
and discourage consumers from paying a premium for higher quality.
McKinsey says most price wars result from misjudgments, not from deliberate
strategy. Most are over-hasty reactions to flawed information about what
competitors are up to, or a mis-reading of their motives.
For instance, an unnamed US food manufacturer recently triggered a price war
which destroyed all this year's industry profits because it assumed that a
10 per cent price cut by a competitor was intended to win market share. In
fact, the competitor was simply selling off a discontinued line cheaply.
As well as ensuring that their commercial intelligence and competitive
analysis are sound, companies can avoid price wars by emphasising product
benefits to customers.
If a price war starts, companies should seek quickly to lock big customers
into long-term contracts. If that fails, McKinsey says, the last resort is
to match competitors' tactics with aggressive tit-for-tat retaliation.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A potentially
explosive brew - Carlsberg has entered the lucrative Thai beer market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thailand can be a difficult place to launch a mass-market product. In a
recent A-Z guide to doing business in Thailand, the A stands for
assassination. Yet Carlsberg, the Danish brewer, has succeeded this year in
pushing its way into the potentially lucrative Thai beer market in the only
way possible: with the help of a powerful local partner.
There was never any doubt about the opportunities. With the economy
expanding at an average of 10 per cent a year, beer consumption has tripled
to more than 330m litres a year in the last five years. Per capita
consumption is still low and Carlsberg executives believe the market will
continue to increase by 25 to 30 per cent annually.
The challenge for newcomers has been to loosen the stranglehold of
Thailand's duopoly of existing brewers. Until Carlsberg Brewery (Thailand)
began production at its new Dollars 80m (Pounds 57m) plant north of Bangkok
in May, the market was dominated by Boon Rawd Brewery - whose Singha brands
accounted for nine-tenths of the beer sold in the country - and Thai
Amarit's Kloster and Amarit brands.
As Thais have become more prosperous, they have increasingly taken to
drinking beer, regarded as a western, up-market product, instead of the
cheaper, rum-type beverages known as 'whisky'. But Boon Rawd and Thai Amarit
have hitherto controlled the beer distribution networks and imported beers
are heavily taxed.
Carlsberg has broken into the market by teaming up with Charoen
Sirivadhanabkhadi, an influential ethnic Chinese businessman. He produces
and distributes Mekong, the most popular Thai whisky and therefore has a
ready-made distribution network across Thailand, as well as an interest in
branching out as beer consumption rises.
Charoen, his wife Wanna, Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark and Carlsberg's
managers celebrated the new partnership at a lavish ceremony at the brewery
last month.
'You've got virtually 100 per cent distribution (of Carlsberg) because of
their whisky,' said Michael Iuul, Carlsberg International's managing
director. 'If you're starting from scratch you have to work much harder to
get penetration.'
Charoen has demanded a high price for his part in the business. He and his
local partners own 90 per cent of the joint venture and they say they may
use a second brewery to be completed by the partnership next year to produce
their own brand as well as - or even instead of - using it to make more
Carlsberg.
Carlsberg executives regret failing to secure a larger share, but console
themselves with the knowledge that Carlsberg receives royalties for the use
of its name and technology. The Thai operation also fills a gap in
Carlsberg's network of Asian operations.
Early indications are that Carlsberg is selling well in Thailand and has
seized about a fifth of the market. The new brewery, which can produce 1m
hectolitres a year, is working at full capacity and Carlsberg says it has
only three days of stocks.
Heavy advertising has helped - Carlsberg in Thailand believes it will spend
between 30 and 40 per cent of the Dollars 10m being spent by Thai brewers
this year on television and other main media - and the brewer has matched
Singha's 6 per cent alcohol content to suit Thai tastes.
But Charoen's distribution network is vital. Launches of other beers have
failed in the past because the product was not widely available.
Boon Rawd is putting up a strong fight. Its advertising emphasises
nationalism and positions the product as a local beer in contrast to
Carlsberg's international image.
Carlsberg has been obliged to take the unusual step of producing own brands
of bottled soda water and still water; these are essential mixers for Mekong
whisky and Charoen feared that Boon Rawd, hitherto the main soda water
manufacturer, would threaten to withhold supplies from retailers who
accepted Carlsberg beer on their shelves. The rivalry between selling agents
on the backstreets of Bangkok and other towns was described by one Carlsberg
manager as 'fairly violent'.
Carlsberg's European executives are painfully aware of their dependence on
Charoen, but know they could have entered the Thai market only with the help
of somebody like him.
Asked if Charoen could market Carlsberg in the face of stiff resistance from
Boon Rawd, one manager described Charoen as 'resourceful' and pointed out
that cornering the whisky market in Thailand - as Charoen had done - was not
an achievement for the fainthearted.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Famous faces fit the
bill - American Express has launched its first global campaign for five
years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The film shows Anita Roddick, Body Shop founder, striding around the jungle,
discussing her way of doing things: 'Trade not aid for us is a real symbol.
It's about trading in the developing world, setting up commercial
initiatives with indigenous peoples. We don't change the environment, we
don't touch the culture. I'd rather promote human rights . . . than ever
promote a bubble bath.'
Misty rainforest shots are interspersed with indigenous peoples going about
their business, ethnic music and then - shock - Roddick starts talking about
her American Express card. 'I travel a lot, I'm in bizarre places, I'm in
unsafe places, I need to get in and out. What I use for that is American
Express. There is no option, there is no debate.'
It is comforting to know that even in the depths of the rainforest one need
never be embarrassed by a shortage of cash or having the wrong piece of
plastic.
The 60-second, lavishly shot Roddick TV film, which is initially being shown
in the US, is part of a vast global advertising campaign - the first by
American Express for five years - currently being unleashed on the world. In
the UK alone, Pounds 10m has been earmarked for the advertising, which is
already under way; by next year the ads will be showing in up to 30 of
Amex's main markets. Overall costs are not being disclosed - all the company
will say is that 'investment is very large'. Currently, the American Express
card is placed well behind the two leaders globally, Visa and MasterCard, in
charge volume - value of sales and cash advances made on the cards.
Each of the ads - there will be about 50 in all - follows an identical
format but the national content is different in each case. Amex has selected
people it considers to be recognisable 'local business heroes'. They each
talk to an unseen interviewer about their achievements, vision and how their
businesses are run. Snatches of film, clearly shot on no-expenses-spared
locations, illustrate their points. It is only towards the end of the films
 -which are closer to 'advertorials' than conventional ads - that the heroes
explain their attachment to American Express and the card makes its
appearance.
Noticeably absent is information about membership fees and the like.
According to Aldo Papone, special adviser and a director of the company: 'We
have always built on who has it, rather than its features.'
In view of the current heated competition between card-providers in the US,
which is being mirrored elsewhere, this is perhaps just as well. The latest
feature of the card wars is a flurry of 'customer loyalty' schemes. In the
UK, for example, where Amex has 1m of its almost 37m cardholders, the
company last month launched an air travel and hotel accommodation points
scheme. The scheme will cost Pounds 20m over the next three years in
marketing and administration in the UK.
That came within a few days of the first launch by a UK manufacturer
(Vauxhall, the General Motors subsidiary) of a mass-market credit card,
which also provides discounts on the purchase of Vauxhall cars. Save and
Prosper, the financial services group, is another to have recently offered a
new, low-interest card.
Papone lists the qualities Amex was seeking in their 'local heroes' as
including: conviction, pursuit of ideals, learning from failure, hard work
and success - in terms they define for themselves. They must be able, of
course, to sing the praises of the American Express card through personal
experience, as well as recommending it as a way to pay in their
establishments. The whole thrust of the campaign is away from former elitist
images and towards what Papone calls the gentler 'emerging value of the
1990s'.
Amex's choice of the heroes is weighted towards restaurateurs and hoteliers
and includes, in the UK, Richard Shepherd and the ghost of the late Peter
Langan of Langan's restaurant, and Mike Gooley, founder of the travel
company Trailfinders. Most familiar is Sir Terence Conran, the eclectic
designer, who is filmed cooking, cycling and at his London restaurants
before giving his endorsement to the 'classic green card'.
Besides Roddick, the US advertisements feature Charles Lazarus, founder and
chief executive of Toys R Us, and Jean-Louis Dumas, chairman of luxury goods
company Hermes. The latter is seen surrounded by the luxury materials of his
business as he extols the virtues of his products. 'I'm embarrassed to speak
about a scarf like a still-life piece. A scarf is only good when it moves
around,' he intones to the sound of violins. 'We give birth to the product,
the customer gives life to it.' For the benefit of those who can afford it,
he concludes: 'American Express, it is a very good way to pay at Hermes'.
Italian advertisements feature Roberto Scio, from Il Pellicano, the
Portofino hotel, and Ninetta Ceccacci Mariani, owner of the Rome Checchino
restaurant. German local heroes include Ruediger Kowalke from the Hamburg
Fischereihafen restaurant and, in Japan, Kyoichi Egashira from Royal Host
restaurants.
All the ads, says Shelly Lazarus, president of Ogilvy &amp; Mather New York, the
advertising agency which has been responsible for the campaign, were
unscripted. They were also unpaid - an arrangement which is not likely to
have left the heroes dissatisfied, given the massive plugs they received for
their businesses.

PAPERS circulating behind the scenes among the UK's larger accountancy firms

shield them from the effects of law suits. So far, there has been rather
less of a result.
At issue is whether the firms should be protected from the risks they
currently run of being made responsible for paying out legal damages in
excess of their culpability in an audit following the financial collapse or
failure of a company.
Against them stand parliamentary priorities perceived to be more important,
intransigence, fears of jeopardising the public interest and a wall of
unsympathetic investors, banks, and even accountancy firms.
The UK profession has lagged behind its compatriots overseas in its
campaign, in spite of its long-standing and relatively prominent position
among firms both damaged by legal settlements - such as over Ferranti and
Johnson Matthey Bankers - and by potential claims, most voluminously in
relation to the Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
Australia and the US have seen longer-running efforts to bring about
reforms, with sophisticated lobbies developed to appeal for changes in the
law over several years.
The first public indications that the UK was at work came this spring. Ian
Greer Associates, a political lobbying firm, launched a programme of
interviews with politicians, companies and opinion formers to assess their
views on the subject.
The largest eight accountancy firms have since commissioned Greer on a
longer-term contract to advise on reforms. Steering the developments are a
trio of senior partners, from Arthur Andersen, Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Price
Waterhouse.
A detailed, confidential discussion document obtained by the FT which was
prepared in late March this year and runs to nearly 20 pages, provides an
insight into the firms' strategies. It has since been updated, but is
believed to still take broadly the same line.
It cites despairingly from the Department of Trade and Industry-sponsored
report on auditors' liability submitted in 1989, which was prepared by
Professor Andrew Likierman - recently appointed as the government's chief
accountancy adviser.
The paper notes that little of its advice has been implemented, and that its
recommendations are, in any case, 'somewhat more muted than one would have
wished'.
It stresses that the potential damages facing accountants have escalated
considerably since and argues that the current system is unjust, jeopardises
the range of services now provided, and risks larger firms shedding 'high
risk' companies. It argues such a move would be against the public interest,
no doubt much to the chagrin of smaller firms which might inherit these
audits.
It also hints that without reform auditors might refuse to honour their
commitments in the recommendations of the Cadbury committee report on the
financial aspects of corporate governance, notably in verifying statements
on whether a company is a going concern and in ensuring that descriptions of
internal controls are accurate.
The paper suggests five options:
Incorporation of accountancy firms so they would conduct audit business as
companies with limited liability.
The introduction by law of a statutory cap on liability, as already exists
in Germany at DM500,000.
Reforming the law on joint and several liability, to make damages
proportionate to blame rather than the current system where a defendant can
be made to pay all an award.
Compulsory insurance for directors and officers of companies, to ensure that
these individuals have assets worth pursuing through litigation, rather than
accountants being the sole target for redress because they have 'deep
pockets'.
Amending section 310 of the 1985 Companies Act (as the Likierman report
suggests) to permit auditors to limit their liability by contract.
It goes on to dismiss the first three options. Incorporation, it argues,
would still leave those involved in an audit vulnerable to personal
liability in negligence cases and does not fully address the problem.
A statutory cap would be most appealing, by giving certainty to the level of
potential liabilities as a result of litigation. But it argues that such
reform has twice foundered in Australia, and that there are 'real
difficulties in convincing governments that capping legislation is necessary
and equitable'.
Reforming joint and several liability would require fundamental change on a
principle which most parties consider equitable, and hence could prejudice
other more likely proposals for reform.
That leaves the provision of directors' and officers' insurance, which it
endorses, and the amendment of the 1985 Companies Act. It suggests a minimum
limit on liability in an audit contract of at least 10 times the audit fee,
and not below Pounds 50,000 for a sole practitioner or Pounds 100,000 for
other professionals.
These figures are believed to be merely initial and illustrative, and the
firms claim to be willing to be very open to negotiation on limits. They
have also stressed in private that they have no problems paying out heavily
where they are found to be at fault.
But the campaigns for litigation reform seem to have been losing steam
around the world. In Australia, proposals in New South Wales to introduce a
cap on liability have foundered. In the US, many businesses have supported
the efforts of Ceass, the coalition to eliminate abusive securities suits,
which was spearheaded by the 'big six' accounting firms. It hopes for a
draft bill next year, though sentiment at public hearings held in the summer
was not entirely favourable.
Similarly in the UK, the campaign also seems to have lost some of its steam.
The great groundswell hoped for this year has been postponed. Deputations
have returned empty-handed, though not without hope.
Over the summer, the senior partners of the larger firms met Mr Neil
Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs at the Department of Trade and
Industry, and received what they considered to be a sympathetic hearing.
Their representatives have since met officials several times.
On the other hand, as one senior Whitehall official put it: 'There was a
certain level of, shall we say, healthy scepticism about the proposals.'
They have been asked to come back with a stronger case which stresses how no
group would be prejudiced by their proposals.
They have also agreed to provide further financial details on their case, by
collating aggregate figures on the costs of insurance premiums, legal awards
and other related expenses connected to litigation.
Above all, they still need to demonstrate how truly financially damaging
litigation is proving, and to clarify their stance in cases where there
genuinely has been poor audit work.
In the meantime, the firms plan to gather further support from industry for
their proposals. They have drawn some comfort from a sympathetic statement
calling for reform by the Confederation of British Industry.
They can also hope for responsiveness from a new committee created by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, which expects to
debate proposals by early in the new year. But many smaller and medium-sized
firms seem to view the debate as irrelevant.
They may approach government officials again during the spring, and aim to
build support with a more public campaign over the summer. Even if things go
extremely well, they are unlikely to be able to squeeze any proposals on to
the legislative agenda as soon as next year.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Technology: Tapping into convenience - High-street habits
are changing with the advent of computerised shopping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is summer a few years' hence and you want to lay on an outdoor grill. You
call up the American barbecue page on your computer screen and the system
linking your home with the local supermarket asks whether the meal will be
for two, for several people or for a party.
You give your answer. It asks what sort of drinks, appetisers, main courses,
side dishes and desserts you want, even whether you want to use a food
processor. All screen options are illustrated, some with videos. You tap in
your preferences and recipes with ingredients and brand names and prices can
be called up and printed out.
You order the shopping electronically with a simple barcode scanning device
or direct from the screen. The goods are delivered through a secure entry
point, or 'hole-in-the-wall' in your home, or to a collection point at, for
example a nearby petrol station.
It all sounds blissfully effortless, if somewhat soulless. However, a US
study has shown that 64 per cent of people dislike going to the supermarket
for their basic shopping, as many as hate going to the dentist. The figure
is quoted by Andersen Consulting which has opened a Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.3m)
retail centre in the UK to demonstrate how technology can be applied to meet
the pace of change in the industry.
Named Smart Store Europe and located in Windsor, west of London, it shows
some of the gadgetry and computer systems which are becoming available to
the retail, distribution and manufacturing sectors. As well as shopping by
screen, it gives an idea of what the automated, computerised store of the
future will look like, from the check-out counter to the manager's office.
John Hollis, a partner in Andersen Consulting's UK practice and director of
the Smart Store, believes the retail sector is about to experience a
tremendous shake-up. 'I see us going through such huge, turbulent changes in
this industry in the next few years that just talking about it is not
enough. There are real fundamental issues that the boards of companies will
have to work through.'
Evidence of change is abundant. In Germany, the Karstadt and Hertie store
groups are discussing a merger to combat the effect of the shift in consumer
tastes to niche and discount retailers.
Competitors are crowding in to the UK. Costco, the US warehouse club
operator, plans a big, cut-price outlet in the east of England. Discount
retailers such as Aldi of Germany and Netto of Denmark have invaded the food
market. US-style factory outlet malls are also coming to the UK. Aware that
their high profit margins cannot last, UK supermarkets have now embarked on
a price-cutting wave.
Such developments will make a big difference to the way people do their
shopping. So will the changes in the telecommunications and entertainment
industries, mainly led from the US; these have implications for shopping by
television (already a reality in the US), video links to the home and
multimedia services combining sound, pictures and computers.
If people can have their basic purchases delivered, will they want to go
shopping at all? Some will not. But most will want to see some of the goods
they buy. Shops and stores are also places of social activity, the
difference being between 'replenishment' and 'enjoyment' shopping. In
future, a person could enjoy a drink or a snack while browsing through lists
of items on a screen and ordering by scanner. Shopping trolleys will have
video information about goods on offer and where they are to be found, as
well as games to keep children amused.
Advice on anything from building a conservatory to clothing will be
available from in-store computers. Managers' offices will also become more
electronic. The one in Andersen's Smart Store has a terminal with
information about sales trends; this is duplicated on a pad computer which
managers can carry around the store.
'Managers don't have to be in the office,' says Tamar Herman, a consumer
products manager with Andersen. 'The idea is for them to get close to the
customer and manage the workforce better.' The computer would tell managers
when they needed to order more of a certain product and help work out labour
schedules.
With better data, managers would be able to make more marketing and strategy
decisions, says Herman. 'A common problem is that information gathered at
the store goes up to the central office and comes back down in a stack of
paper two weeks later.'
The first company to visit the Smart Store in Windsor - there are others in
Chicago and Sydney - was Marks and Spencer, the UK clothing and food chain.
The visitors' list also includes Nestle, the Swiss food producer and
Hachette, the French publishing group.
Some companies have longgrasped the value of keeping ahead in technology.
ICA Handlarnas, the Swedish co-operative food retailing group, has spent
SKr500m (Pounds 42m) on streamlining its distribution system by using
computers to link its 2,800 member stores; it has shut half its distribution
sites. Stores are also being equipped with new scanning equipment, so that
up-to-date sales information can be used to help purchasing and analysis.
Hollis sees scope in the UK for store groups to save money by pooling their
distribution efforts. If direct ordering from the home really does take off,
goods could be delivered from the warehouse without ever being in a
supermarket. This could cut prices by some 5 per cent, depending on how much
of the savings are kept by suppliers.
At a time when flat population trends mean retailers can only grow in many
countries by eroding others' market share or expanding abroad, the way they
use technology will have a powerful influence on their success in improving
service for shoppers while keeping prices down.
This is what consumers are coming to expect. Many have become used to the
convenience of automated banking and buying insurance by telephone, notes
Hollis. 'People have changed some of their habits to quite devastating
effect on the high street.'

FT  11 NOV 93 / Technology: Trials and tribulations of drug harmony - The
need for a standard approach to pharmaceutical testing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER O'DONNELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Discussion flared in Florida last month over how much sun could get through
the window of a Tokyo pharmacy in high summer.
This conundrum was just one item on the agenda of 1,600 scientists from the
pharmaceutical industry and health ministries around the world who attended
the Second International Conference on Harmonisation of the Technical
Requirements for the Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use.
Against the improbable background of Disney World, the cream of the world's
drug developers and regulators spent three days debating how an alignment of
divergent national testing requirements could bring new medicines onto the
market more quickly.
At present, there is no standardised approach to checking how medicines
stand up to light - which is why the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare
was presenting detailed data on how it measured the exposure of a drug
stored near a south-facing window during a 14-day period in June.
Drug manufacturers face a daunting technical challenge in bringing their new
products on to international markets. Differing regulatory demands from
country to country oblige a company to perform new tests or present its data
in different formats to satisfy each health authority.
With the average cost of developing a new drug estimated at nearly Dollars
360m (Pounds 238m), companies have a powerful incentive to eliminate
unnecessary expenditure and delay - and one obvious route is the
rationalisation of testing requirements.
According to David Kessler, commissioner of the US Food and Drug
Administration: 'Science-driven harmonisation can curtail duplication and
thereby reduce significantly the cost of new drug development - not just in
dollars spent by the industry, but in risk-taking by patients, in
experimentation with laboratory animals and in the regulatory effort of our
governments.'
After more than three years of intensive collaboration, the health
authorities and the pharmaceutical industry in the world's big three drug
development regions - the EC, US and Japan - are now starting to see the
first results of their labours towards rationalised drug registration
requirements.
Cuts of 33 per cent in the cost of stability testing have been claimed as
the result of one of the harmonisation measures announced in Orlando.
A joint guideline nearing agreement on long-term toxicity studies holds out
the promise of halving the length of some tests without any significant loss
of data.
Similar agreements are in prospect on a standard format for presenting
clinical trials data, how to screen out potential cancer-causing agents,
whether it is legitimate to transfer results between ethnic groups and the
hundreds of other detailed testing standards that have pushed drug costs
upwards and held back new product introductions.
These could be only the first steps. Drug regulators are now admitting, for
the first time, that the prospect of a single standard application format
worldwide is not entirely unrealistic, and that the road could even extend
to joint review of new drug applications.
Given that the EFTA countries, Canada and the World Health Organisation are
also involved in this harmonisation process and that many other countries
wish to join in, the long-term benefit for companies introducing new drugs
already appeals to business managers as much as to research heads.
However, the touchstone of success will be how quickly the new agreements
can be put into practice in the three regions which are the motors for
change. Kessler has warned that cost constraints could prevent the FDA
moving ahead 'with the sense of urgency that harmonisation projects may
deserve'.
Keith Jones, director of the UK Medicines Control Agency, has responded that
delay by any of the three regulatory parties 'would deliver little to
industry or to patients'. And Fernand Sauer, the EC Commission's head of
pharmaceuticals, has drawn a connection between the success of the
harmonisation programme 'and its correct and swift implementation in the
three regions'.
There is also a perceived need to speed up the harmonisation process itself
and make the negotiations more efficient. As Nobataka Tsunakawa of the
Japanese Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association remarked on the
development of the stability testing guideline: 'At the beginning of the
process, we expected to obtain early results with this issue. But it took
three-and-a-half years to reach our goal.'
Some European industry representatives at Orlando, resentful that they had
been bounced into a deal which tightened up testing requirements for them,
ruffled the feathers of diplomacy by circulating a letter complaining of
decisions being made 'in a political climate'.
Nevertheless, the process appears set to continue. The obvious motivations
include long-term economic benefit, faster drug development, fewer animal
tests and better science.
But for many of the hundreds of experts involved in this network of meetings
and discussions over the last three years, the satisfaction - and the
principal recompense for a heavy increase in personal workload - is that of
the pioneer.

FT  11 NOV 93 / BT users 'would prefer AT&amp;T'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORPORATE customers of British Telecommunications believe that American
Telephone and Telegraph, the US telecommunications giant, would provide a
better all-round service than BT if allowed to compete in the UK, says an
industry survey to be published today.
The Telecommunications Users Association, which represents more than 1,100
users across the public and private sectors, said the 1,000 respondents
believed AT&amp;T had the 'strongest set of credentials' to compete in the UK,
and was rated above BT on three out of five performance indicators.
The survey is a significant boost to AT&amp;T in its attempt to gain a licence
to compete with BT in the UK. Its application is being considered by the
government.
Although user perceptions of AT&amp;T depend to some extent on reputation alone,
the association stresses that a large proportion of respondents has already
dealt with the US operator, either through AT&amp;T's US offices or other
services already available in the UK.
Ms Vivienne Peters, the association's chief executive, said: 'BT is going to
have a tremendous fight on its hands if AT&amp;T is given a licence and takes
the UK seriously. It will be good for UK companies.'
AT&amp;T was rated ahead of BT on customer-service skills, value for money and
understanding of the business needs of customers. BT scored more on
reliability and financial stability.
Two-thirds of the respondents believe that BT and Mercury have become more
customer-focused in the last two years, with strong support in particular
for new billing arrangements.
But 41 per cent of BT users and 27 per cent of Mercury users reported
'recurring faults' over the past year. Nearly a third of Mercury users
reported a 'major loss of service' over the past year, compared with 22 per
cent of BT users.
The frequency of changes in account managers was felt to be a shortcoming
with BT. Most respondents said account managers were influential in their
perception of the network operator: 'Frequent changes in account managers
mean that customers very rarely reached a point where the BT manager fully
understood the business organisation.'
Although competition was welcomed, most felt discount schemes were too
complex. Advanced services were generally considered too expensive, while
the cost of calls within Europe caused strong dissatisfaction.
New operators such as Colt and Worldcom attracted positive responses,
particularly from users in the City.
Outside the City, however, users were reluctant to use more than two network
operators because of the complexity involved.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Minister underlines cabinet's changed role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR minister's analysis yesterday of the structure of Whitehall
decision-making underlined the transformation of the cabinet from an
executive into a reporting and reviewing body.
Lord Wakeham, Lord Privy Seal, and one of the longest-serving members of the
cabinet, said that the delegation of decision-making to small groups of
ministers was 'an irreversible consequence' of complex modern government.
In a lecture offering a comprehensive account of the workings of the
cabinet, Lord Wakeham said Mr John Major, the prime minster, had halted a
controversial trend of Baroness Thatcher's premiership.
Mr Major was by and large avoiding her tendency to establish small ad hoc
groups of hand-picked ministers to push through decisions. Instead he was
relying on the more formal cabinet committees with their fixed membership of
senior departmental ministers.
Speaking at Brunel University, Lord Wakeham said these committees, which
embrace all the main domestic and foreign policy issues, have 'authority to
decide on behalf of the cabinet'. They did so unless the committee's head
took the unusual step of referring an issue to full cabinet.
Lord Wakeham, who chairs many domestic policy committees, agreed that by the
time the full cabinet met each Thursday most main issues had been settled.
But he insisted that the cabinet maintained a vital role.
'I think many commentators who bemoan what they see as the decline of the
cabinet as a decision-maker fail to appreciate its significance as the
cement which binds the government together,' he said.
Lord Wakeham's lecture confirmed the pivotal role of the Treasury in all
significant policy decisions, and highlighted the constitutional and
practical limitations on the prime minister's authority. It was 'not
practicable' for Downing Street to have a depth of knowledge to 'drive
policy forward across the whole field'.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Lilley to seek curb on foreign claimants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER LILLEY, social security secretary, has called for an investigation
of ways in which overseas visitors can be restricted from making claims for
state benefits.
Mr Lilley has asked the Social Security Advisory Council, a government
advisory body, to consider draft legislation to preclude people from abroad
from receiving housing or council tax benefits to which they were not
entitled when they arrived in the UK.
Social security officials say foreign visitors can now change their
residential status to qualify for new benefits.
From next spring, housing benefit will no longer be available to foreign
claimants. The government also plans to impose a residency qualification on
European Union nationals who claim benefits.
Mr Lilley last month highlighted the issue in his speech to the Tory party
conference. He said: 'We have all too many home-grown scroungers, but it's
beyond the pale when foreigners come here expecting our hand-outs.'

FT  11 NOV 93 / Political Notebook: The National Insurance fiction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEBATE about the welfare state will not go away. What started as a
Treasury exercise to regain a grip on public spending after the excesses of
the late 1980s and the recession of the early 1990s has become entwined
inextricably in the internal politics of Mr John Major's government.
No matter that the ambitious social engineering envisaged by one or two in
the cabinet is regarded by most of their colleagues as wistful rhetoric -
witness the latest furore over single mothers. Nor that more sober analyses
about the future costs of welfare provision, such as this week's report from
the Rowntree Foundation, invariably undercut the gloomy demographic
projections of Treasury pessimists. Unemployment, not an ageing population,
is the principal enemy of prudent control of welfare spending.
But the government has more narrow perspectives. There is the pressing need
to justify the harsh measures to contain public spending over the next few
years. Whatever the prospects in 2020, the present Pounds 80bn social
security budget is pre-empting what limited scope there is for higher
spending elsewhere.
Then there is Mr Major's search for a patch of political ground on which the
still-disgruntled right of his party can stand. For those who have not
forgiven him for deriding the 'golden age that never was' a debate on the
role of the state has become the acid test of his commitment to
reconciliation.
So Mr Michael Portillo, the guardian both of the Treasury's purse strings
and of the Thatcherite inheritance, is set free each week to ponder publicly
about rolling back the frontiers of the state.
During his latest appearance he worried aloud about the 'massive' amount of
Britain's income being taken in taxation and spent by the government. By
pre-empting 45 per cent of national income the state was threatening to
strangle the wealth creation process and undermine fatally Britain's
competitiveness.
There were dangerous social consequences. An ingrained assumption that the
state would provide was undermining the essential Conservative concepts of
individual responsibility and self-reliance.
There was no mention, of course, that this dire state of affairs followed 14
years of Tory government. Mr Portillo is as adept as any at drawing lines
under the awkwardness of the past.
Mr Portillo takes as an example the basic pension. Instead of paying into
the National Insurance Fund and expecting a state pension on retirement, he
suggests, people should use the money instead to buy their own insurance for
old age.
At first sight it seems an entirely reasonable proposition. No-one would be
worse off as most people would simply collect their pension from an
insurance company. A safety net system, of course, would remain in place for
the disadvantaged. But then comes the political roadblock that even the bold
Mr Portillo is not prepared to confront. His argument is built on the flimsy
fiction that the National Insurance Fund is what it pretends to be - a fund.
It is no such thing. The Pounds 38bn a year paid in National Insurance
contributions by the present generation of employers and employees is not
salted away to meet future liabilities. It is used to pay the benefits owed
to a past generation.
But to admit the fiction would be politically explosive. The price would be
public acknowledgement that contributions are indistinguishable from income
tax and that the basic rate of income tax is 34 per cent not 25 per cent -
and that from next April it will rise to 35 per cent.
Mr Portillo sidesteps the resultant flaw in his argument. The present
generation of contributors could not replace their present National
Insurance payments with private provision without impoverishing today's
elderly. The chief secretary is instead asking the under-40s to continue
paying the fund's past liabilities while foregoing any future benefits.
Perhaps Mr Portillo believes that is unavoidable. The Treasury has been
seeking anyway to undercut by stealth the contributory principle. Industrial
disablement and death payments have been quietly dropped from the list of
contributory benefits. The Treasury would like to do the same with sick pay,
sickness benefit and invalidity benefit.
Other universal benefits have long been outside the National Insurance net
so are exempted from the constraints imposed by the contributory fiction.
But Mr Portillo has stressed he wants an open debate encompassing all
benefits. Fair enough, as long as he recognises he will only get one if the
government owns up about National Insurance contributions.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Revenue hits out at DTI creditor plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Inland Revenue yesterday criticised proposals by the Department of Trade
and Industry that threaten its preferential status as a creditor to
companies in financial difficulties.
It argued that its priority ranking above other creditors was 'necessary',
and wanted it to be maintained in any changes to insolvency legislation.
The comments were in response to a DTI consultative document issued on
Tuesday which called for an overhaul of existing procedures for company
voluntary arrangements (CVAs) and administration orders. The document said
some countries were eliminating or reducing the number of preferential tax
creditors, and suggested that 'Crown preference' for pay-as-you-earn, value
added tax and other measures could be removed.
Banks yesterday maintained their tentative support for the proposals, which
would require them to lose some of their rights as priority creditors by
abiding by CVAs and giving a company seven days' notice before appointing
receivers.
One banker said he supported the principle of trying to rescue more
companies. 'We are not trigger happy,' he said. 'We have lost a lot of
customers and we want to stop losing them.'
But he questioned how far the proposals would succeed. 'So many of the
companies we see are bust by the time they suggest a CVA,' he said. 'They
are terminal cases and don't seek professional help in time.'
He also stressed the need for close supervision of a company's directors
once a CVA was under way to ensure that assets were not removed.
Consultation on the DTI document is open until until the end of January next
year.
Mr Tim Hayward, head of insolvency at KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy
firm, also welcomed the document. He stressed the need to balance the
concerns of directors in financial difficulties against the need to act
where there was no case for keeping an insolvent company operating.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Brooke tells press to obey own code of practice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER BROOKE, national heritage secretary, last night warned the press it
had to demonstrate that it would respect and abide by its own rules in the
wake of the row over the publication of unauthorised pictures of the
Princess of Wales in the Sunday Mirror and Daily Mirror.
Mr Brooke, speaking at a London dinner, said the press must conduct its own
examination to see how the 'very good code of practice', drawn up in the
wake of the Calcutt report on the press and privacy, would be adhered to.
It might also be time for the press to consider the establishment of a
voluntary ombudsman to adjudicate on matters of privacy with the power to
recommend correction and compensation, he added.
Mr Brooke said he did not want to dwell on the Mirror's behaviour, which had
been widely condemned. But the government would 'take into account the
failure that has occurred' when examining the scope for criminal or civil
remedies to protect personal privacy.
'People are, I think, getting past the stage where a bit of tinkering and
promises to do better really carry conviction,' Mr Brooke said. The current
voluntary arrangements were working well on matters of accuracy, he added.
'In terms of privacy the press must do better.'
Mr Brooke was speaking after Lord McGregor, chairman of the Press Complaints
Commission, and Mr David Montgomery, chief executive of Mirror Group
Newspapers, had reached a compromise in a row that had seen the group
withdraw from the commission.
The Daily Mirror earlier this week had described Lord McGregor as an 'utter
buffoon'. Last night MGN said it withdrew any criticisms made of the
commission and 'apologises to their chairman for any remarks which he may
have found offensive'.
Lord McGregor withdrew remarks urging advertisers to boycott the Daily
Mirror, which had ignored commission comments by republishing the
photographs which had first appeared in the Sunday Mirror.
Lord McGregor last night added: 'I trust that all newspapers will create an
unprejudiced environment in which all future complaints will be heard
fairly.'
The commission welcomed the fact that MGN had decided to rejoin the
self-regulatory system. It also noted that it could not issue an
adjudication on the pictures of the Princess of Wales while court
proceedings were current.
Senior MGN executives believe the legal proceedings are unlikely to go
further and are preparing for an apology to the Princess of Wales and the
payment of an agreed sum to charity.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Sunday trade options queried
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONFUSION over Sunday trading law in England and Wales could be deepened by
two of the options for reform under consideration by the government, four
leading barristers said yesterday.
The lawyers, who have all been involved in the protracted litigation over
the 1950 Shops Act, warn that if proposals from either the Keep Sunday
Special Campaign or the Retailers for Shops Act Reform are adopted,
compliance and enforcement problems will worsen.
MPs are expected to decide on the change before Christmas with the new law
coming into force by next summer.
The lawyers, led by Mr David Vaughan and Mr John Samuels, say the Keep
Sunday Special Campaign option, which involves a general ban on Sunday
opening with exceptions for some small shops and some types of goods, would
lead to increased uncertainty for retailers, local authorities and the
courts.
The barristers believe this option would hit the activities of banks and
building societies and could effectively outlaw the use of hole-in-the-wall
cash dispensers on Sundays. It would only need one such anomaly to result in
a prosecution for the new law to be questioned, they warn.
The Retailers for Shops Act Reform proposals, which are broadly similar but
allow for open shops on the four Sundays before Christmas, in effect pose
the same problems.
The lawyers say total deregulation to bring the law into line with Scotland
offers the best solution.
They say that even the Shopping Hours Reform Council proposals, which would
allow small shops to open all day but restrict the opening of shops above
280 sq m to six hours, could lead to endless disputes over shop size.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Sales of summer holidays rise by 8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAVEL AGENTS sold 7.9m summer holidays this year, the highest level since
1988, Lunn Poly, the largest retail travel chain, said yesterday.
Last summer's figure was 8 per cent up on the 7.3m holidays sold the
previous year. In 1991 travel agents sold 6.4m.
Lunn Poly said this year's increase was the result of the poor UK summer and
competitive pricing. The average price of a summer 1993 holiday before
travel agents' discounts was Pounds 375, the same as last year. It said the
increase also appeared to reflect confidence that the recession was ending.
The seven airports owned by BAA handled 7.4m passengers last month - 7.9 per
cent more than in October last year. The total number of passengers handled
for the 12 months to the end of October exceeded 80m for the first time.
