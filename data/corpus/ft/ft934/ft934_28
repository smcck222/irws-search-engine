FT  11 NOV 93 / Budget 1993: Small-business sector steps up its demands -
Kenneth Clarke has been urged to boost the supply of equity finance and bank
credit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL businesses and their lobby organisations have never been slow to come
forward with advice for the chancellor at Budget time.
The run-up to the second of two Budgets this year on November 30 is no
exception. Requests for changes to legislation have flooded in to the
Treasury.
The most pressing concern is whether finance will be available for
businesses as they emerge from recession. The Treasury and the Bank of
England are independently looking at the availability of equity finance and
bank credit.
It may be hard for Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to influence the
attitude of banks towards lending. But small businesses believe there is one
tax measure that could significantly improve the supply of equity at little
cost to the Treasury - a new Business Expansion Scheme. The present scheme
has been discredited because it attracted so much capital to Assured Tenancy
Schemes - relatively risk-free property deals. But it has channelled new
equity into productive business expansion.
The British Venture Capital Association, anxious to prevent the government
throwing the baby out with the bathwater, wants a scheme that ensures tax
relief is provided only for genuine risk capital. Companies involved in
property, financial services and investments such as wine would be excluded;
the limit should be raised from Pounds 750,000 to Pounds 1m; and the limit
for each individual investor should be raised from Pounds 40,000 to Pounds
100,000 in any one year.
The Small Business Bureau is more specific. It would like to see equity
channelled to smaller manufacturing companies and tax relief for investments
of up to Pounds 250,000 a year. Both versions are based on the idea that
wealthy individuals will need tax relief up-front if they are to participate
in risky investments.
There are, however, proposals for a widening of the scope of personal equity
plans, where the tax advantages are deferred. The Venture Capital
Association, for example, wants qualifying UK investors to be able to put
money in investment funds for unquoted companies. At the moment, Peps are
available only for quoted investments.
The association would like to see its proposal stand with quoted company
Peps. It also wants a limit of Pounds 100,000 a year for investments in
general investment plans, or a single company Pep. Allowing this size of
investment in single company Peps would facilitate investment by the
so-called 'Business Angels' who not only want to invest, but would like some
form of non-executive involvement.
The Confederation of British Industry approaches the same problem from a
slightly different viewpoint, calling for up-front tax relief for personal
income invested in business assets - similar to the relief that is applied
to private pension scheme contributions.
Some want to see a change in capital gains tax which, among its faults,
makes no differentiation between short- and long-term capital gains. This
tends to focus investors on a quest for income today rather than future
capital growth.
It also tends to work against entrepreneurs and individuals who are sitting
on unrealised capital gain in a quoted portfolio or unquoted investment.
These investors currently find a 40 per cent CGT rate a substantial barrier
to selling investments to reinvest in unquoted companies, becoming a
so-called 'serial investor'.
The Venture Capital Association wants to extend rollover tax relief to cover
capital gains earned on quoted shares as long as the proceeds are reinvested
in an unquoted company within six months.
Equally important to smaller businesses are some other familiar themes.
Prominent in a submission from the Forum of Private Business, for example,
is a call for statutory interest penalties for the late payment of debt.
The forum is also calling for an integration of national insurance and PAYE,
to cut paperwork, as well as a reduction in National Insurance which it sees
as a tax on jobs. It wants a reform of the uniform business rate, which it
says places an unjust burden on the shoulders of small businesses.
Small businesses generally believe they had a fair hearing and a 'good'
March Budget. But many say that if the government is attempting to create
the environment for a true enterprise economy there is much more to be done.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Ofwat urges stand on EU directive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Customer Council, the water quality watchdog, yesterday called
on the government to take a 'firm stand' to reduce the impact of the
European Union's urban waste water directive. It said the cost of
implementing the directive was far exceeding initial estimates. The council
looks after the interests of water and sewerage customers.
Ofwat has to set new water-price limits next year, and the council urged the
government to instruct the agency to assume that the timetable for the
directive would be relaxed.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S reply to a report by the cross-party Commons committee on
the British aerospace industry was 'disappointing' and had 'important
deficiencies', the committee said yesterday.
The government did not go 'far enough to address our recommendations and the
evidence and arguments on which they are based'.
The committee had taken evidence from most of the UK aerospace industry,
including Lord Weinstock, managing director of GEC, and Mr Dick Evans, chief
executive of British Aerospace. Mr Richard Caborn, chairman of the select
committee, said, 'It's less than adequate, especially given the government's
objective to improve the manufacturing base.'

FT  11 NOV 93 / BAe may make Hawks for S Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE is holding discreet talks with South Africa on a possible
contract for the Hawk military jet, once the United Nations lifts its
embargo on defence sales, David White writes.
A deal would involve either supplying UK-built Hawks, which are designed
both as trainers and as light combat jets, or licensing their construction
in South Africa.
The company would not confirm that it was in negotiations with the
state-owned South African group Denel. It added that any deal was clearly
not possible under present circumstances.
Contacts have been held at government level on potential opportunities for
UK defence companies if the embargo is lifted following South Africa's
elections next year.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Recovery 'quicker than expected' in W Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A QUICKER-than-expected recovery from recession is leading to demands from
the west Midlands that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, should avoid large
increases in tax or cuts in expenditure in the Budget.
The latest survey of regional business performance from Wolverhampton and
Warwick business schools and Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, shows
that more than half of the 1,022 companies in the survey increased profits,
and more than a third took on more labour over the last six months. 'Major
employers, during the last six months, appear to have ceased the haemorrhage
of labour which has taken place over the last three years,' says the
analysis, published today.
The survey shows west Midlands business more optimistic than at any time
since winter 1990. There is a distinct difference from the east Midlands,
where a similar exercise indicated a slowdown in the pace of recovery. In
the west Midlands the proportion of manufacturing companies working at full
capacity has increased steadily to 29 per cent; in the east Midlands it
dropped from 27 per cent in the spring to 20 per cent.
Assuming that annual economic growth will be higher than the 1.25 per cent
forecast in the last Budget, the survey suggests that Mr Clarke is under
less pressure to cut the public sector borrowing requirement.
Growth can save him from 'having to make too many unpopular decisions', it
says. 'It would be folly to kill this recovery by over-reacting when a light
hand on the tiller would be more effective.'

FT  11 NOV 93 / Further slump in business confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS confidence in north-west England has slumped by nearly 30 per cent,
according to a survey of more than 2,700 managing directors or senior
managers, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes.
The survey was conducted by EAP Consultants, a subsidiary of Lancashire
Enterprises, the privatised economic development arm of Lancashire County
Council.
An index of economic confidence developed by EAP for its first survey in
July had fallen from 34 to 23 by last month. Agriculture was worst hit,
reflecting poor harvests, but manufacturers were less positive than during
the summer because of recession in mainland European markets.
There was also a marked fall in confidence in the distributive sector, where
the index fell from 37 to 18 over the three months.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Japanese contract confirmation boosts Thorp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN has reconfirmed its commitment to the use of plutonium for nuclear
fuel. The move is encouraging for the Pounds 2.8bn Thorp nuclear
reprocessing plant in Cumbria.
The commitment, restated in the Japanese government's annual report on
atomic energy, indicates that the country is likely to honour contracts to
buy reprocessed fuel from the Cumbria plant.
Japan would be Thorp's biggest foreign customer, if the plant wins approval
from the UK government. A decision is expected shortly.
The Japanese Atomic Energy Commission report said recycling was 'an
important element' in the country's energy policy, citing the country's
scarce natural resources and heavy energy consumption.
It aims to lift nuclear-generated electricity from the present 28.2 per cent
of electrical power capacity to 40 per cent over 20 years.
A fledgling environmental movement, which includes members of parliament
from four of the seven ruling coalition parties, is lobbying for an end to
plutonium imports because Japan has a surplus. They fear that weapons-grade
material could fall into the wrong hands.
But the report says Japan will have a plutonium fuel shortage until the end
of the decade, when its own reprocessing plant is due to open.
Stocks now stand at 4.5 tonnes, of which 1.6 tonnes are stored in Japan and
the rest at reprocessing plants in France and Britain. They will be consumed
at a prototype reactor at Monju, on Japan's west coast, due to start
operation next spring.
Officials estimate that stocks will last about three years, after which
Japan will have to import another shipload of plutonium from Britain or
France. In January Japan shipped 1.1 tonnes of plutonium from a reprocessing
plant owned by Cogema, the French nuclear fuels group, causing an
international outcry from environmentalists.
David Lascelles adds: British Nuclear Fuels, the owner of Thorp, said its
main German and Japanese customers had reaffirmed their commitment to Thorp
contracts.
In an open letter, Mr Takeo Matsunaga, secretary-general of the overseas
reprocessing committee which represents the 10 Japanese utilities with
contracts to reprocess their fuel at Thorp, says: 'The Japanese government
as well as the Japanese utilities strongly support the early commencement of
Thorp operation.'
Dr Karl Staebler, chairman of the VDEW nuclear sub-group which represents
Thorp's German customers, said German utilities would abide by the contracts
they had signed with BNF for the first 10 years of Thorp operation.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Former Daf workers win Pounds 10m award: Tribunal condemns
receivers for ignoring legal obligations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKERS made redundant after the financial collapse of Leyland Daf, the UK
subsidiary of the failed Dutch truck maker, won compensation technically
worth about Pounds 10m yesterday.
Unions claimed a 'famous victory' after an industrial tribunal censured
receivers of the former truck company for ignoring employment laws.
The tribunal ruled that 2,400 workers in Leyland in Lancashire, Birmingham
and Glasgow were made redundant unlawfully because neither their employers
nor the receivers who took over last February gave them the statutory 90
days' notice.
The tribunal strongly criticised the receivers Mr Murdoch McKillop and Mr
John Talbot of Arthur Andersen. It said: 'It is very surprising that the
administrative receivers of eminence involved in this case should fail to
meet their statutory obligations so repeatedly and so lamentably as they
have done here.'
The receivers argued yesterday that when they moved in they were fighting to
keep the business alive, and there had been no alternative but to issue
redundancy notices.
Mr McKillop said: 'As receivers we had to use what limited funds that were
available to save what was left of the company. The alternative was complete
closure.'
The Leyland Daf case mirrors a successful claim by 700 former workers of the
Swan Hunter shipyard on Tyneside who were awarded Pounds 1.5m compensation
in September.
Although yesterday's award was worth Pounds 10m, the unions will have to
seek payment from the Department of Employment redundancy scheme, as they
are unable to lodge a claim with the company. The government scheme would
give them a potential maximum award of nearly Pounds 4m and, because
compensation is likely to be offset by pay in lieu of notice, the final
payment could be even lower.
Mr John Allen, AEEU engineering union chief negotiator at Leyland Daf, said:
'While no amount of money can compensate those who were unceremoniously
sacked, the union has established an important principle. Companies and
receivers will in future have to obey the law or face the consequences. Just
because a company is facing financial difficulty they clearly have no right
to behave in an arbitrary and cavalier manner and expect to get away with
it.'
Mr Michael Short, the union lawyer, said the tribunal made it clear there
was no excuse for the 'brutal and unfair' manner in which the receivers
dismissed workers. He added: 'Unfortunately it seems the company has no
money to pay the awards. We are now looking to recover the money from the
government.'

FT  11 NOV 93 / Regions report patchy recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER evidence that the UK is experiencing a patchy and uneven recovery
emerged yesterday in the latest survey of regional industrial trends.
The survey, produced by the Confederation of British Industry and Business
Strategies, a regional economic consultancy, showed that differences in
demand have produced mixed fortunes for manufacturing across different
regions.
Overall, UK manufacturing orders and output changed little in the four
months to October. But orders for companies in the west Midlands and
Scotland increased sharply while in Northern Ireland and the south-west they
fell.
A mixed demand pattern is forecast for the four months from October, with
strong order growth expected in the north-west and Wales against forecasts
of falling orders in the east Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside.
Although Scottish industry expects to increase staff slightly in the coming
months, manufacturing employment is expected to fall in all regions in the
present quarter compared with a year ago.
Recession in continental Europe has dampened confidence, especially about
export prospects. Just four regions - Scotland, Northern Ireland, the west
Midlands and East Anglia - recorded substantial increases in business
confidence. Only in Scotland and Wales were manufacturers more optimistic
about export prospects over the coming year than they had been in the last
CBI-BSL survey in July.
Most UK regions reported falling export optimism with declines especially
pronounced in the south-west, the north and the east Midlands. Export orders
declined during the past four months in all regions except Wales and
Scotland.
The survey, carried out in the first half of last month, shows that output
rose appreciably in six UK regions, with especially strong growth in the
west Midlands, Wales and East Anglia. All regions except Northern Ireland
and Yorkshire and Humberside expect increased production in the four months
from October, with the west Midlands expecting the most robust growth.
Mr Andrew Sentance, the CBI's economic director, said the buoyancy in the
west Midlands could reflect increased demand for motor components and the
effect on output and orders of the temporary acceleration of investment
allowances that expired last month.
Scotland is also performing well. According to Mr Charles Burton, BSL joint
managing director, Scotland could be benefiting from increased demand for
electronic products and relatively low levels of household and corporate
debt.
The rundown in the coal industry and recession on the Continent have
probably contributed to less favourable trends in Yorkshire and Humberside.
The outlook for investment is mixed although the east Midlands, west
Midlands and Scotland plan higher spending on plant and machinery.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Revenue criticises DTI proposals on creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Inland Revenue yesterday criticised Department of Trade and Industry
proposals that threaten its preferential status as a creditor to companies
in financial difficulties.
It argued that its priority ranking above other creditors was 'necessary',
and wants it to be maintained in any changes to insolvency legislation.
The comments were in response to a DTI consultative document issued on
Tuesday which called for an overhaul of existing procedures for company
voluntary arrangements (CVAs) and administration orders. The document said
some countries were eliminating or reducing the number of preferential tax
creditors, and suggested that 'Crown preference' for pay-as-you-earn, value
added tax and other measures could be removed.
Banks yesterday maintained their tentative support for the proposals, which
would require them to lose some of their rights as priority creditors by
abiding by CVAs and giving a company seven days' notice before appointing
receivers.
One banker said he supported the principle of trying to rescue more
companies. But he questioned how far the proposals would succeed. 'So many
of the companies we see are bust by the time they suggest a CVA,' he said.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Investors 'misled about forecasts'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORMER chairman of Harland Simon, the electronics company, had no
knowledge that the company's profit forecasts would be revised downwards
soon after he allegedly spoke to two institutional investors about its
likely results, he told Aylesbury Crown Court yesterday.
Mr Roy Ashman is alleged, at a meeting last February, to have told Mr Nigel
Savage and Mr Marc Gordon - two managers of Govett Strategic Investment -
that he was comfortable with initial forecasts for Harland's pre-tax profits
of Pounds 13m to Pounds 14m.
The two fund managers bought 155,000 shares worth almost Pounds 1m in the
group just hours before the profits forecast was reduced to Pounds 4m and
the share price fell from 585p to 270p. The company eventually reported a
pre-tax loss of more than Pounds 6m.
Mr Ashman denies making a misleading statement contrary to section 47 of the
Financial Services Act 1986.
Mr Colin Nicholls QC, cross-examining, said the company had known by January
that year that the original profit forecast could not be met and that
something in the region of Pounds 6m was a more correct figure.
Mr Ashman replied: 'No one mentioned to me that the figure would be Pounds
6m.'
He denied saying anything to indicate Harland's profits would be in line
with the original forecasts. At the meeting with the two fund managers Mr
Savage had led the discussion and asked 'questions he should not have been
asking', Mr Ashman told the court.
The trial continues.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Japanese pledge boosts Thorp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pounds 2.8bn Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant has been boosted by the
Japanese government's confirmation of its commitment to the use of plutonium
for nuclear fuel.
The commitment, in the Japanese government's annual report on atomic energy,
indicates that the country is likely to honour contracts for fuel from the
Cumbria plant.
Japan would be Thorp's biggest foreign customer, if the plant wins approval
from the UK government.
The report said recycling was 'an important element' in the country's energy
policy, citing the country's scarce natural resources and heavy energy
consumption. It aims to lift nuclear-generated electricity from the present
28.2 per cent of electrical power capacity to 40 per cent over 20 years.
A fledgling environmental movement, which includes members of parliament
from four of the seven ruling coalition parties, is lobbying for an end to
plutonium imports because Japan has a surplus.
But the report says Japan will have a plutonium fuel shortage until the end
of the decade, when its own reprocessing plant is due to open. Stocks now
stand at 4.5 tonnes, of which 1.6 tonnes are in Japan and the rest in France
and Britain. They will be consumed at a prototype reactor at Monju, on
Japan's west coast, due to start next spring. It estimated that stocks will
last about three years.
David Lascelles writes: British Nuclear Fuels, the owner of Thorp, said its
main German and Japanese customers had reaffirmed their commitment to Thorp
contracts.
Mr Takeo Matsunaga, secretary-general of the overseas reprocessing
committee, representing the 10 Japanese utilities with contracts to
reprocess fuel at Thorp, said: 'The Japanese government as well as the
Japanese utilities strongly support the early commencement of Thorp
operation.'
Dr Karl Staebler, chairman of the VDEW nuclear sub-group which represents
Thorp's German customers, said German utilities would abide by the contracts
they had signed with BNF for the first 10 years of Thorp operation.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Council reforms block Pounds 36m order for trains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE impending reform of local government in Scotland is blocking a Pounds
36m order for new trains because the council that wants to place the order
is due to be abolished.
Strathclyde Regional Council has also found that Treasury guidelines on
leasing appear to make it impractical for the deal to be saved by a
government guarantee.
The council, which runs the Strathclyde passenger transport executive that
covers the greater Glasgow area, wants to obtain 21 diesel multiple units
from Hunslett TPL of Leeds. Because of Scottish Office reductions in the
council's capital borrowing consent, it decided to obtain them through an
operating lease.
It discussed terms with Lombard North Central, a leasing subsidiary of
National Westminster Bank. But after Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary,
announced in July that Strathclyde was to be broken up into 10 new councils
in 1996, the bank decided there was inadequate security for the deal.
Strathclyde said the bank was concerned that transfer arrangements involving
a joint committee of the new councils might be less reliable than the
region. After legal advice the bank concluded that the deal could be open to
a successful legal challenge from one of the new councils.
Lombard suggested that Strathclyde ask the government to act as guarantor of
the deal. But the council found that if the risk were underwritten with
public money it would breach Treasury guidelines on operating leases, and
would have to be considered a financial lease.
The full capitalised value of the lease would then have to come from the
council's capital borrowing consent, thereby defeating the object of
leasing.
Mr Malcolm Waugh, chairman of Strathclyde's transport committee, said
yesterday that, after long discussions with Mr Roger Freeman, the transport
minister, he had 'to concede that our hoped-for leasing deal may not now
happen'. The council fears it may receive a claim from Hunslett, which is
retaining staff in anticipation of the order being confirmed.
Yesterday Mr Freeman, who was in Glasgow, said he was sure the problem could
be solved. He thought other assurances could be provided by the government
to meet the problem of the lenders.
Mr Waugh is to meet Mr Freeman and Mr Lang in London next week to try to
resolve the issue.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CIVIL SERVICE union leaders are stepping up their campaign for union
membership at GCHQ with demands to see Mr John Major, the prime minister, in
an effort to break a deadlock in talks.
Two hours of discussions between the five leading civil service unions and
Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, on the possibility of ending the
nine-year ban on union membership at the Cheltenham eavesdropping centre,
ended in impasse yesterday.
Union leaders said they were disappointed but not surprised at the outcome
which they said hinged on the government's fears over the possibility of
conflicting loyalties among union members.
The Cabinet Office said that the request to see the prime minister was being
considered.

<TEXT>
THE SOCIETY of Motor Manufacturers and Traders will shortly announce that Mr
Ernie Thompson, sales director of Ford of Britain, is to become its chief
executive, Kevin Done writes.
The appointment follows an eight-month search for a successor to Sir Hal
Miller, the former Conservative MP who left the society in March after only
16 months as chief executive.
Mr Thompson has spent all his business career at Ford. His appointment will
mark a sharp change of direction by the society after the controversial
appointment of Sir Hal, which had been designed to give the industry a more
powerful political presence and to improve its Whitehall lobbying.
Sir Hal had been joint chairman of the House of Commons all-party motor
industry group.

two of the main companies in the industry - has lost both its broadcasting
licences.
The Radio Authority yesterday decided not to renew the licences of DevonAir
which broadcasts in the Exeter and Torbay area. It awarded both FM and AM
licences to Gemini Radio, a local consortium put together by Mr Ivor
Stolliday, a former secretary of the ITV Association and Television South
West; and Mr David Rogers, managing director of Orchard FM in Somerset.
The authority gave detailed reasons for its decision for the first time. It
said it had awarded the licences to Gemini 'because it was particularly
impressed by the applicant's coherent, detailed and well-researched
proposals for two complementary AM and FM programme services'.
DevonAir appears to have lost because it broadcasts the same mainly
pop-orientated service on AM and FM. Gemini, which takes over in January
1995, plans to have at least 45 per cent speech on its AM service.
The authority will advertise the franchise for the mainly speech-based third
national commercial station on November 30.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Met and FBI to form joint fraud arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday signed an unprecedented agreement with the US
establishing a joint US/UK team of police officers to investigate fraud and
financial crime in Britain's five dependent territories in the Caribbean.
The accord to establish the joint investigation unit, to be based in Miami,
Florida, follows growing US concern over the use of Anguilla, the British
Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Montserrat and the Turks and Caicos
Islands as a base for financial fraud against Americans.
Under yesterday's memorandum of understanding signed in Washington, two
detective inspectors from the Metropolitan Police will join Federal Bureau
of Investigation agents in Miami. It will operate initially for a two-year
period. The team will largely be involved in intelligence and gathering
evidence in cases of white-collar crime.
They will begin work on about 50 outstanding cases of white-collar crime.
These usually involve victims in the US. In most cases, if prosecution is
obtained, it is likely to take place in the US.
The territories are depending on the growth of the financial services sector
as an important part of their economic development. According to Foreign
Office officials, the agreement has been welcomed in the territories because
they see that their financial sectors are attracting criminals, driving away
good business.
Mr Mark Lennox-Boyd, Foreign Office minister, said the aims of the agreement
were to catch existing criminals, to dissuade others from using the
territories as a base for fraud and to develop local expertise in tackling
white-collar crime.
This will be the first time US officials have been given law-enforcement
rights in the dependent territories, although there is already co-operation
between police forces in the Caribbean territories and the US on drugs
trafficking and money laundering.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Vans boost commercial vehicle sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE START of a recovery in the van market helped to push sales of all
commercial vehicles last month to a level 4.4 per cent higher than a year
before. It was the second consecutive monthly year-on-year increase.
The sector has taken much longer than cars to emerge from recession, but
there are growing signs that a recovery is under way.
New commercial vehicle registrations rose to 16,148 last month from 15,465
in October last year, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said
yesterday. But registrations for the first 10 months of the year at 169,359
were still 2.2 per cent lower than a year earlier.
Demand for medium-sized vans has also begun to pick up, albeit from a low
base. The first signs of recovery in the heavy-truck segment of the market
came late last year as hauliers began to replace ageing fleets.
Truck sales (above 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight) rose 14.4 per cent in
the first 10 months of the year to 30,314, while sales of heavy trucks
(above 15 tonnes) jumped 23.4 per cent in the same period to 17,045. During
the recession heavy-truck sales more than halved from 38,935 in the whole of
1989 to 16,118 in 1991 and 16,427 last year.
Iveco, the commercial vehicles subsidiary of Fiat of Italy, and the Swedish
producers Scania and Volvo have gained most ground and drawn most benefit
from the Daf collapse with their sales volumes increasing by between 35 per
cent and 45 per cent this year.
European truckmakers, hit by a heavy fall in new-truck sales in continental
Europe, are concentrating marketing efforts on the UK - virtually the only
European market where sales are growing.
MAN, the German truckmaker which took control of its UK importer/distributor
last year from the Lonrho trading group, increased its sales by 66 per cent
in the first 10 months.
Registrations of medium vans and pickups (1.81 tonnes to 3.5 tonnes) rose by
15.2 per cent in October following an 11 per cent rise year-on-year in
September. The increases have begun to compensate for the continuing
weakness of the market earlier in the year, although sales for the first 10
months at 75,890 were still 2.1 per cent lower than the same time last year.
Light van sales (up to 1.8 tonnes) have remained the most depressed segment
of the market, reflecting continuing uncertainty among small businesses and
traders.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Train franchise companies could get incentive payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES that win franchises to run train services could qualify for
incentive payments to meet punctuality and reliability targets, Roland Rudd
writes.
The scheme is included in draft objectives for the franchising director
which the government published yesterday. The director is Mr Roger Salmon, a
former director of the merchant bank NM Rothschild. He will be able to use
part of his budget on the incentives, which could be worth hundreds of
thousands of pounds.
Mr Salmon will be responsible for deciding who will run the franchises
created under the rail privatisation proposals, and will control subsidies
to lossmaking services.
Railtrack, which will be responsible for the running of the the track and
signalling, could also qualify for bonuses if it reduces costs.
Mr Salmon has been asked to outline a franchising programme by the end of
January. He will become responsible from April for paying subsidies, but
they will no longer be paid in an annual lump sum. Subsidy will be attached
to specific train operations, to prevent British Rail from cross-subsidising
bids for franchises.
When assessing bids from BR, Mr Salmon has been asked to take into account
its record in providing services and the transfer of risk. The government is
keen to transfer the financial risk associated with running a franchise from
the public to the private sector.
BR will only be able to bid for a franchise when there are no credible
alternatives from the private sector.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SALE of mortgage protection policies should be regulated by statute to
make up for the failure of arrangements to protect homebuyers in difficulty,
the National Association of Citizens' Advice Bureaux says today.
It warns, for example, that borrowers often do not realise that they can
have continuing liability for their debts even after their home has been
repossessed.
The association wants the Financial Services Act to be extended to include
the sale of mortgage protection policies and that in some circumstances
borrowers should be able to sell their properties on the open market at a
shortfall.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Games move by Olympic bidder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MANCHESTER yesterday took the first steps towards bidding for the
Commonwealth Games in 2002, with the aim of ensuring that a national stadium
is built in the city as a springboard for another attempt to host the
Olympic Games, this time in 2004, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes.
Organisers of the failed bid for the 2000 Olympics have started talks with
potential backers and sporting interests. If a consortium can be formed the
Commonwealth Games Federation for England will be asked to make Manchester
its candidate.
Mr Graham Stringer, leader of Manchester City Council, acknowledged that
many recent Commonwealth Games had lost money, but said media rights would
be more attractive after South Africa's re-admission.
Mr Bob Scott, leader of the Olympic bid, said the stadium and athletes'
village would continue to be focal points for regeneration in Manchester.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Radio group loses Devon broadcasting licences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMMERCIAL radio station owned by Capital Radio and GWR two of the main
companies in the industry - has lost both its broadcasting licences.
The Radio Authority yesterday decided not to renew the licences of DevonAir
which broadcasts in the Exeter and Torbay area. It awarded both FM and AM
licences to Gemini Radio, a local consortium put together by Mr Ivor
Stolliday, secretary of the Dartington Hall Trust and former secretary of
the ITV Association and Television South West; and Mr David Rogers, managing
director of Orchard FM in Taunton, Somerset.
The authority gave detailed reasons for its decision for the first time. It
said it had awarded the licences to Gemini 'because it was particularly
impressed by the applicant's coherent, detailed and well-researched
proposals for two complementary AM and FM programme services'.
DevonAir appears to have lost because it broadcasts the same mainly
pop-orientated service on AM and FM. Gemini, which will take over in January
1995, plans to have at least 45 per cent speech on its AM service.
The authority will advertise the franchise for the mainly speech-based third
national commercial station on November 30.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Lib Dems in fresh racism charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIBERAL Democrat party was embroiled in a racism row last night after
party officials condemned a leaflet issued by its activists in east London,
but said they had no power to discipline the authors.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, was said to be 'ballistic' about the
leaflet, in which an article about violence against old people is
illustrated with a picture of a black boxer.
The leaflet was distributed to residents of Tower Hamlets, a Liberal
Democrat-controlled borough where Mr Derek Beackon, of the far-right British
National Party, won a council by-election last month.
Leaflets issued by Liberal Democrat activists in Tower Hamlets have been
vetted by party headquarters since Mr Ashdown set up an inquiry into the
publication of another allegedly racist leaflet during the by-election
campaign.
Party officials said the latest leaflet was allowed to go ahead because a
copy sent to Mr Graham Elson, the party's general secretary, was blurred.
Mr Elson said the party was 'determined to stamp this out as soon as
possible'. However, he said officials had no power to ban the publication of
future leaflets, or to suspend or expel the authors until the inquiry
reports.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow local government minister, said he planned to refer
the latest leaflet to Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney general, for a ruling
on a possible prosecution for incitement to racial hatred.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Civil service unions seek meeting with PM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIVIL SERVICE union leaders are stepping up their campaign for union
membership at GCHQ with demands to see Mr John Major, the prime minister, in
an effort to break a deadlock in talks.
Two hours of discussions between the five leading civil service unions and
Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, on the possibility of ending the
nine-year ban on union membership at the Cheltenham-based eavesdropping
centre, ended in impasse yester-day.
Union leaders said they were disappointed but not surprised at the outcome
which they said hinged on the government's fears over the possibility of
conflicting loyalties among union members.
Mr Bill Brett, general secretary of the IPMS, which represents specialist
and managerial civil servants, said: '(The talks) have not gone as well as
we would have wished . . . I haven't heard anything which would enable us to
reach an acceptable conclusion.'
Mr Barry Reamsbottom, general secretary of the CPSA civil service union,
said he was optimistic that Mr Major would agree to talks.
The Cabinet Office said that the request to see the prime minister was being
considered.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Lagos court hears of top officials in land case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS and MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIAN government ministers and senior army officers have been allocated
prime building sites on land in Lagos acquired through compulsory purchase,
according to evidence filed in the High Court.
The land has been acquired under a retroactive decree issued by the former
military government led by General Ibrahim Babangida. The decree has not so
far been repealed by the military-backed civilian administration which
succeeded Gen Babangida in August.
The evidence has been filed in support of legal challenges to the decree by
a private development company and the Lagos state government. Issued last
July and retroactive to 1975, the decree provides for the compulsory
purchase of land on the city's shoreline.
Lagos State Assembly, which has begun a court action seeking to restrain the
federal government from acting on the decree, told the court last Friday the
names of those who will allegedly benefit.
Defence Minister General Sani Abacha, Foreign Minister Matthew Mbu, Justice
Minister Clement Akpangbo and Information Minister Uche Chukwumerije are
among those named.
Also named is Mr E O Shonekan. A government minister who requested anonymity
said this was the son of Chief Ernest Shonekan, the country's civilian head
of state. The minister was speaking on behalf of Chief Ernest Shonekan, and
responding to questions from the Financial Times.
The minister also said that those allocated the 140 sites would have to pay
N500,000 (Pounds 8,000) per plot, and stressed that the allocation system
did not contravene the law. Responsibility lay with the previous government
led by Gen Babangida, he said. He declined to comment further, saying that
the matter was sub judice.
City estate agents said yesterday that the designated price is substantially
less than the sites' worth on the open market.
The list of recipients reads like a Who's Who of Nigeria's ruling
establishment under Gen Babangida, who stepped down last August after
seizing power in a coup in 1985.
Chief Shonekan, who had been appointed chairman of a transitional council of
ministers in December 1992, was made head of state in August following Gen
Babangida's annulment of last June's presidential elections. A new poll is
set for February.
The list includes Admiral Augustus Aikhomu, a former vice president, and
several former ministers who had served in the transitional council, which
was disbanded in August: Mr Oladele Olashore, former finance minister, Mr
Philip Asiodu, former oil minister, and Mr Oluwole Adeosun, former transport
minister.
Prominent among the military names in the list are the chief of defence
staff Lt Gen Oladipo Diya, head of the army Lt Gen Aliyu Mohammed and former
heads of the army, navy and air force.
Others among the beneficiaries of the land deal are Mr Pascal Bafyau, the
head of the Nigeria Labour Congress, and Mr Iyorchia Ayu, the recently
deposed speaker of the Senate.
The Lagos state high court last week temporarily restrained the federal
government from exercising ownership rights over the land it acquired
compulsorily under the decree.
A separate legal action has been initiated by the Lagoon City Development
Corporation (LCDC), the privately owned company responsible for reclaiming
the disputed land.
LCDC has been negotiating with state and federal authorities for more than a
decade for permission to develop the site.
Earlier this year Mr B. Gemade, housing minister, told the developers that
the federal government was acquiring the land and that they would be
compensated at rates well below the market value. Surveyors estimate that
each plot is worth eight times the value the government is selling the land
for.
LCDC refused to accept the order and took the government to court. In
September at the court hearing the government produced a handwritten decree
which swept aside the rights of individuals and state governments in Nigeria
who own land reclaimed from the sea or within 100 metres of the shoreline.
A spokesman for the company said: 'They dated it the day before we went to
court so they could invalidate our action, although the decree was not
promulgated till September. They also backdated the effect of the decree to
overrule the 1978 legislation which ceded all federal government land to
state governments.'
The decree forces each lessee in Nigeria to renegotiate his lease with the
federal government within 30 days although it was not gazetted until two
months later. Failure to renegotiate risks dispossession and a fine of
N10,000 or a five year prison sentence.
The measure also denies the right of any court in Nigeria to challenge the
decree's legitimacy and overrules property rights set out in Nigeria's
constitution.

JAPAN plans to upgrade the next meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic
Co-operation forum, due in Tokyo in 1995, from a ministerial session to
include a formal summit of heads of government.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's foreign minister, suggested the idea yesterday,
marking a fresh enthusiasm for regional consultation by the Tokyo
government. Apec, grouping some of the world's fastest-growing economies
among its 15 members, will stage a ministerial meeting headed by the US in
Seattle next week, to be followed by an informal meeting of leaders at
President Bill Clinton's invitation.
'We have to think what kind of management will be most beneficial to the
world economy after the end of the cold war. Apec can be an extremely
effective place to think about that,' said Mr Takeshi Isayama,
director-general of economic co-operation at the ministry of international
trade and industry.
Apec should be a forum for consultation, not for negotiations, said Mr
Isayama. Most of Apec's Asian members, especially Malaysia and Thailand,
share Japan's view. They are suspicious of what they see as US eagerness to
turn Apec into a free trade zone, economically dominated by the US.

FT  11 NOV 93 / LDP calls for Ozawa evidence on donations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S opposition Liberal Democratic party yesterday demanded that its
former powerbroker, Mr Ichiro Ozawa, now a senior member of the governing
coalition, testify in parliament about donations received from a
construction company.
Mr Ozawa has admitted receiving Y5m (Pounds 31,250) late last year, when he
was still an LDP member, but insists the donation was legal, and claims the
LDP is attempting to use the issue to derail the coalition's political
reform programme.
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has promised to change the political system
by the end of the year, and needs to secure quick agreement on four reform
bills. However the LDP has listed 21 objections to the proposals and delayed
negotiations with the government.
Disagreement over the reform bills has yet to dent Mr Hosokawa's personal
popularity, according to a poll published by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper
yesterday. After three months in office, his cabinet has an approval rating
of 70 per cent, (71 per cent last month), but still higher than any other
cabinet since 1946.
Apart from convincing the LDP to discuss reform and dealing with the Ozawa
controversy, Mr Hosokawa faces difficulty in convincing the Social
Democratic party, the largest group in the coalition, to accept even minor
changes to the reform bills.
The SDP, formerly the Japan Socialist party, yesterday would not accept any
alteration to a proposal for 250 MPs to be chosen from single-seat
constituencies and through proportional representation, making a total of
500 members for the House of Representatives, the more powerful of Japan's
two houses.
But the LDP wants 171 seats chosen through proportional representation and
300 from single-seats, which will replace the present multi-seat
constituency system. Komeito (the Clean Government party), a coalition
member, has suggested 275 single-seats, but the SDP said it would quit the
coalition if the original proposal is changed.
SDP members, some of whom fear changes to the political system may end their
parliamentary careers indicated yesterday that they want Mr Ozawa questioned
in parliament about the background to the construction company's Y5m
donation.

FT  11 NOV 93 / US agencies to pull out of Yangtze Project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO US government agencies are to end their involvement in China's
controversial Three Gorges project to build the world's largest dam on the
Yangtze river.
The Bureau of Reclamation, which is in charge of irrigation and water
management in the US, and the Army Corps of Engineers, whose
responsibilities include flood control and navigation, will sever their
involvement in Three Gorges after they have completed work on a hydrological
database.
Although the bureau and corps had only a consulting role in Three Gorges,
their withdrawal is a symbolic blow to the credibility of the project, which
opponents charge will displace 1.3m people and flood nearly 100,000 hectares
of China's best farmland.
Competing with each other in the 1930s and 1940s, the two agencies
symbolised an era of monumental civil engineering when the US believed it
could bend nature to its will with ever bigger dams such as Bonneville,
Hoover or Grand Coulee.
The Bureau of Reclamation said its withdrawal from Three Gorges reflected
the change in the agency's mission since the Clinton administration took
office. 'We are not really in the dam-building business any more. We are a
water resource management agency now,' a bureau spokeswoman said.
The bureau falls under the aegis of Mr Bruce Babbitt, interior secretary,
who has launched an ambitious attempt to transform the federal government
into a better steward of the land and resources under its control. However,
the US withdrawal is also a comment on the appropriateness of massive dams
such as Three Gorges. 'We wouldn't support such a project in the US now, so
it would be incongruous for us to support it in another country,' the bureau
said.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Vietnam promised Dollars 1.86bn in aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VIETNAM was yesterday promised Dollars 1.86bn (Pounds 1.23bn) in development
aid from foreign governments and multilateral agencies, in a move which
marks a further step in the country's return to the international financial
community.
After the first meeting of a World Bank-headed donors' conference for
Vietnam, Mr Phan Van Khai, its vice-prime minister, said the money would be
largely spent on education, child nutrition and infrastructure. The World
Bank agreed with these priorities, but stressed Vietnam needed to tackle its
'quite high' population increase of 2.2 per cent a year.
Mr Phan expected the aid programme would lead companies to increase
investment in Vietnam. Hanoi had already licensed some 700-800 investments
worth Dollars 7bn.
More than half the promised aid, mainly in the form of soft loans, will come
from other governments, with Japan accounting for the largest amount, of
Dollars 550m. Other prominent donor governments are France, Britain, South
Korea and Australia. The rest of the aid will come from multilateral
agencies such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
The one predictable absence from the aid consortium is the US, Hanoi's
antagonist during the Vietnam war. But Japan as the main regional power, and
France as the region's former colonial power, have stepped in to wipe out
Vietnam's debt arrears to the World Bank and the ADB.
This has allowed Hanoi to reach agreement, with US acquiescence, on a
Dollars 223m standby credit with the International Monetary Fund.
The IMF accord in turn opens the way for Vietnam to start discussions with
the Paris club of official creditors in early December on rescheduling
payments on some Dollars 500m of its debt, Mr Phan confirmed yesterday. The
country's total debt stands at Dollars 2bn.
Mr Phan said Vietnam would need considerable further aid, if it was to meet
its goal of doubling its national income by the year 2000. The vice-prime
minister did, however, bridle at questions about human rights, stressing
Vietnam had its own Asian interpretation of such rights which differed from
western concepts.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Nissan pays Y17bn in US penalty taxes: Concern over moves
against multinationals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN, the Japanese car maker, has paid nearly Y17bn (Pounds 106.25m) in
penalty taxes to the US Internal Revenue Service, in settlement of an IRS
ruling that the company avoided US taxes by transferring part of its income
from the US to Japan.
The move by Nissan, which in effect accepts the IRS ruling, comes amid
mounting international concern about US moves to tighten the tax grip on
foreign multinationals operating in the US.
The penalty payment by Nissan relates to an IRS ruling that Nissan set
transfer prices on its passenger cars and trucks imported by its US
subsidiary in California at much higher levels than the IRS deemed
appropriate, and that as a result Nissan reported lower income in the US
than it should have.
Nissan contested the IRS ruling and the matter was referred to the National
Tax Agency of Japan. 'We do not believe the prices we charged were
inappropriate,' Nissan said. The Japanese Tax Agency has agreed to refund
Nissan the Y17bn so that it can avoid double taxation.
While the move by Japan signals acceptance that at least part of the income
reported by Nissan in Japan should have been declared in the US, the case
reflects 'a difference of interpretation' of what constitutes acceptable
transfer prices for goods sold within the group, a National Tax Agency
official said yesterday.
The US has claimed that multinationals often abuse international transfer
price rules which state that goods and services sold from one group company
to another should be priced as if they were sold to any outside company.
By setting higher or lower transfer prices, the US claims, multinational
companies have been able to shift their US profits abroad, thereby escaping
US taxation.
But it is difficult to determine what an appropriate transfer price is, the
Tax Agency official said.
In the US, for example, the strategy of sacrificing profits for market
share, which is common among Japanese companies, is seen as unnatural and
raises suspicions of inappropriate transfer pricing practices, he noted.
The US interpretation looked at profits alone and not at the entirety of
business practices, the official added.
It is not the first time for Nissan to be charged penalty taxes on the
grounds that it had breached transfer pricing rules.
The IRS ruled previously that Nissan breached transfer pricing rules in
connection with income for the years from 1975 to 1984. During those years
Nissan exported 5.2m passenger and commercial cars, including the Sentra,
the Stanza and Datsun trucks, to the US.
The company has already paid Y62bn in penalty taxes to the IRS, which has
been refunded to it by the Japanese tax authorities. Nor is Nissan alone
among Japanese companies in being charged on those grounds. The Japanese Tax
Agency has intervened in negotiations with the IRS in at least eight cases
involving Japanese businesses in the US.

<TEXT>
THE managing director of the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation
has chosen to take voluntary retirement following concerns expressed by
Kenya's donors of financial mismanagement and corruption in the public
utility.
Mr Kipng'eno arap Ng'eny said he thought it was 'wise and desirable to
retire' after 14 years at the head of KPTC. Mr Philip Okundi, managing
director of the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation, has been appointed to
replace him.
Mr Ng'eny's departure follows an intense campaign by the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank for a complete overhaul in the way KPTC
conducts its business. In an auditor-general's report, KPTC was criticised
for channelling funds to insolvent local banks and for failing to remit to
the Treasury the 18 per cent value added tax it charges on telephone bills.
It is also in arrears on its foreign debt and in its contributions to the
National Social Security Fund. The company, with a payroll of 30,000
employees, is seriously overstaffed.
President Daniel arap Moi's government has promised to reform the parastatal
sector in order to win back financial assistance suspended by donors in
1991. The World Bank is hosting a meeting in Paris this month to discuss the
resumption of international aid to Kenya.
Mr Dalmas Otieno, the minister for transport and telecommunications,
yesterday denied that Mr Ng'eny had been involved in any financial
impropriety at KPTC. 'Mr Ng'eny is not under investigation, and we have no
intention to investigate him,' he said.
'We are not looking for criminals, just ways of enhancing the efficiency of
the parastatal sector,' Mr Otieno said.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Seoul rules for Citibank in fund row: First arbitration in
labour dispute involving foreign business
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE SOUTH Korean government has issued its first arbitration decision
involving a labour dispute at a foreign business by ruling in favour of the
management at Citibank, the largest foreign bank in the country.
Foreign businessmen, particularly bankers, had worried that a government
decision supporting union demands would provoke labour unrest at their
concerns.
The ruling for Citibank, hit by staff demonstrations and industrial action
since late August, follows government efforts to reverse a decline in
foreign investment. Labour problems have often been cited as a main factor
discouraging foreign investment in Korea.
The arbitration panel, appointed by the Ministry of Labour, said Citibank
did not have to establish an employee welfare fund that was at the heart of
the dispute.
It also ordered Citibank to give its workers a 9.5 per cent wage increase,
higher than the management offer of 8.9 per cent but much lower than the
union demand of 15.7 per cent.
Foreign businessmen had initially feared the labour ministry's intervention
in the dispute would hand down a a victory for union members, since the
ministry has been promoting the idea of an employee welfare fund since 1991.
The government wants companies to use part of their pre-tax profits to
establish a fund that would finance employee benefits, such as low-interest
housing loans. Proposed as a way to slow high wage demands, the fund has
been accepted by most domestic banks and some large manufacturing companies
as a result of state pressure.
Citibank refused to establish the fund because its workers are already among
the best-paid in the Korean banking industry and are provided with a
compensation package that is more generous than that offered by local banks.
Several other foreign banks, including Westpac, ABN-Amro and Bank of Boston,
have suffered labour disputes over pay differences and compensation
policies. High wage growth has been blamed for falling profits at most
foreign banks, which have also been hurt by the economic slowdown and a loss
in market share.

Nigeria's military-backed interim government said last night that it would
appeal against a Lagos court ruling that it was illegal, Paul Adams writes
from Lagos.
In a case brought earlier in the day by Chief Moshood Abiola, winner of last
June's annulled presidential poll, the judge ruled that former military
ruler Gen Ibrahim Babangida had no authority to appoint the interim
government led by Chief Ernest Shonekan to take his place when he stepped
down on August 26.
Mr Shonekan is due to address the elected national assembly in Abuja today
when he is expected to defend this week's unpopular decision to increase
petroleum prices.

MR JIM Anderton, leader of New Zealand's Alliance party, which holds the
balance of power in the new parliament, cannot work with Finance Minister
Ruth Richardson, he said yesterday, Terry Hall writes from Wellington.
Ms Richardson was regarded as a leading 'dry' in cabinet, and has been
largely blamed by opposition parties for helping push through sweeping
reforms in social welfare, health and other areas. 'Ruth is all for pushing
on while the country wants to take its foot off the accelerator,' Mr
Anderton said. The prime minister has refused to comment on the likely shape
of the new cabinet, to be formed after 200,000 special votes are counted
next week.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Anti-corruption official sacked in Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR official of Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption
(ICAC), the anti-corruption watchdog, was yesterday dismissed without
explanation.
Mr Alex Tsui, the commission's deputy director of operations, was sacked
with immediate effect following an internal probe, the ICAC said in a brief
statement. It would not specify the nature of the inquiry but he has been
under investigation for some months.
The dismissal of Mr Tsui, the most senior ICAC official to be sacked since
the founding of the commission in 1974, comes at a time of heightened
concern in Hong Kong about the rise in corrupt practices, especially those
involving business dealings, and mainland Chinese parties.
Fear of increased corruption is the issue people in Hong Kong worry about
most as they prepare for China's sovereignty in 1997.
In the first nine months of this year complaints about business corruption
in Hong Kong rose by 51 per cent to 1,341 complaints. Recently Mr Bertrand
de Speville, the commissioner against corruption, said the ICAC was
investigating 40 cases involving mainland Chinese companies or individuals.
A recent ICAC survey had found that corrupt business practices may represent
3to 5 per cent of the cost of doing business in China. But respondents to
the survey said this was bearable and did not amount to a disincentive to do
business there.
Late last month Mr de Speville held discussions in Guangdong and Beijing
with senior government officials about cross border corruption and its
prevention. He came away with an agreement from Guangdong's Provincial
People's Procuratorate to increase liaison and co-operation.

FT  11 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Healthcare reforms constrain sales of
medicines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEALTHCARE reforms and changes in the customer base have constrained the
drugs markets in both the US and the European Union this year.
Sales in pharmacies in the seven largest European markets fell from Dollars
33.7bn to Dollars 30.2bn in the first eight months, but were affected
adversely by currency depreciation. Excluding exchange rates, there was a 1
per cent increase, according to figures compiled by IMS International, the
specialist research-based company.
The European market was held back by the effects of healthcare reform in
Germany and Italy. Sales in Germany fell from Dollars 9.6bn to Dollars
8.2bn, a drop of 10 per cent at constant exchange rates.
The Italian market fell from Dollars 7.47bn to Dollars 6.6bn, a drop of 3
per cent excluding currencies. Sales in the UK also fell, from Dollars 3.6bn
to Dollars 3.3bn, but increased at constant rates by 11 per cent. Those in
Spain also fell from Dollars 3.3bn to Dollars 3bn, but rose 12 per cent
excluding currencies. The Spanish market could slow in coming months,
following the introduction of measures to control drugs spending.
The French market continued to grow, up from Dollars 7.7bn to Dollars 7.9bn
or 7 per cent at constant rates. The Dutch market was up 13 per cent, from
Dollars 979m to Dollars 1bn, while sales in Belgium were static in dollar
terms at Dollars 1bn, but increased 6 per cent excluding currencies.
The US market increased 4 per cent from Dollars 27.8bn to Dollars 28.8bn.
Compared with 19 per cent in 1991, growth is anaemic. Sales have been hit by
patent expiries and increasing use of generic products, as well as greater
discounting to bulk-buyers of medicines which are becoming increasingly
aggressive
The Japanese hospital market increased 13 per cent at constant rates, up
from Dollars 9.9bn to Dollars 12.8bn. However, the market is likely to be
hit next year when the health ministry is expected to implement one of its
biennial prices cuts - expected to be about 7 per cent.

FT  11 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Gore scores but game is still in doubt -
The TV clash with Perot over Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUNDITS and pollsters alike declared Vice-President Al Gore the clear winner
in Tuesday night's televised debate with Mr Ross Perot about the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
Unlike an election debate, however, this confrontation could hope to
influence fewer than a hundred members of Congress who remain uncommitted
either for or against Nafta. The debate's impact on ordinary viewers - a
pool already diminished because the debate reached only homes with cable
television - will be felt only indirectly in the crucial vote in the House
of Representatives next Wednesday.
Mr Gore may have attained a number of his objectives. The forum gave him the
opportunity to present the case for the treaty to a sceptical public, made
fearful by the slow recovery and corporate cutbacks. The vice-president
underlined the foreign and trade policy initiatives at stake and the danger
that the administration might be unable to overcome a Nafta defeat to
complete the Uruguay Round of global trade talks.
However, he also presented a somewhat negative case for the agreement: he
repeatedly noted that the US could withdraw with only six months' notice if
the pact did not work, and warned that 'the Gatt round would probably not be
completed if Nafta were defeated'.
While the vice-president did not manage to provoke Mr Perot into any
stunning displays of paranoia, by constant needling he succeeded in making
his opponent appear nasty and thin-skinned. (Only on Sunday Mr Perot told a
rally that he had been warned by the FBI of a plot against his life by six
armed Cubans.)
The perception that Mr Perot may be more of a drawback than an advantage to
the Nafta opposition appears to be shared by several leading opponents of
the treaty, both inside and outside the Congress. The tone of Mr Perot's
arguments was so unremittingly negative and defensive that he actually
served up an excuse for any congressman still in search of a reason to vote
in favour in next week's Nafta debate.
The administration's calculated gamble, that identifying the anti-Nafta camp
closely with Mr Perot would work in favour of the agreement, appears to have
paid off, at least to some modest degree.
It still needs a political miracle to get Nafta through the House of
Representatives. The hope was that the debate would create a momentum
towards passage of the treaty that the administration has been unable to
achieve after weeks of deal-making.
Indeed, in its wake, one congressman, Mr Jim Bacchus of Florida, announced
his support, but he had been leaning towards a yes vote and the
administration has to secure 25-35 more.
It was useful to the pro-Nafta side that an hour after the debate was over
Mr Gore was quickly declared the winner in an ABC telephone poll by 47 per
cent of viewers compared with 33 per cent for Mr Perot. But the real gains
come in the televised soundbites - like the one in which Mr Perot calls the
vice-president a liar - and follow-up reporting.
Mr Al Hunt, former Wall Street Journal bureau chief, yesterday accused Mr
Perot of lying when he claimed to have never hired lobbyists. Mr Hunt said
Mr Perot had secretly lobbied the Ways and Means committee and had 'snuck
through' a Dollars 15m tax break for himself 'in the middle of the night'.
It was one more attack on Mr Perot's credibility, begun when the
vice-president pointed out that the Texan had supported Nafta before running
for president. Mr Gore held up a brochure featuring Mr Perot's picture and
extolling the benefits to be derived from Latin American trade for the Perot
family Alliance airport project in Fort Worth, Texas.
Mr Perot scored a number of debating points with his visual aids. One
featured a modern US company factory in Mexico surrounded by slums which
have sprung up for the workers. Mr Gore could have made the point more
effectively that, without Nafta, working and environmental conditions will
just worsen.
Ironically, Mr Perot often sounded as though he were more interested in
protecting the living standards of Mexican workers than those of their US
counterparts, and argued, with apparent seriousness, for a 'social tariff'
to force the Mexican government and elites to raise wages.
The sheer fact that the debate took place reflects the administration's need
to play catch-up in a race that is almost won by Nafta's opponents. The best
opportunity for winning support for the agreement was during the
negotiations on the side accords on environment and labour. But those
accords were not strong enough to win over influential members like
Congressman Richard Gephardt, the majority leader. Instead, the
administration is caught up in nerve-wracking last minute efforts which seem
only Sisyphean.

FT  11 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Supersonic airliner gets new go-ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBAI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US government has given the go-ahead to the next stage of the programme
to build a supersonic airliner to replace Concorde.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration will start work next year
on the second phase to develop the air frame, propulsion and systems
technologies over seven years at an expected cost of Dollars 1.2bn, Mr Lewis
Williams, Nasa's director of high speed research, said yesterday at an FT
conference at the Dubai Air Show.
Preliminary design studies have defined the characteristics of the aircraft,
planned to enter service early in the next century, which will have twice
Concorde's 3,000 nautical miles range and carry 300 passengers, three times
Concorde's capacity, at fare levels close to those charged on sub-sonic
aircraft.
Nasa began research in 1990, evaluating environmental considerations
including atmospheric effects, nitrogen oxide engine emissions, noise and
sonic boom. That first phase, costing about Dollars 400m, has shown the
aircraft to be 'environmentally compatible', said Mr Williams.
Although other government agencies, aircraft manufacturers and engine-makers
in other countries are collaborating on the supersonic aircraft study, the
US appears to be taking a far more active role in research. Nasa's annual
high speed research budget has just been increased from Dollars 117m this
year to Dollars 197m in 1994, although the agency had asked for Dollars 187m
for next year.
The US is keen to catch up with the European aerospace industry's expertise
and experience in supersonic airliner development through Concorde. However,
any future aircraft is expected to involve broad international co-operation
because it is widely accepted that the market will bear only one programme.

FT  11 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Japan offers to cut some import duties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and FRANCES WILLIAMS

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN has told the European Union it is prepared to remove import duties in
three industrial sectors to encourage progress in the deadlocked world trade
liberalisation talks.
The offer comes in a letter from Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign minister, to
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's chief trade negotiator, due to visit Tokyo on
Sunday and Monday to discuss the Uruguay round of Gatt talks, the agreement
deadline for which is just a month away, December 15.
Japan would be prepared to lift tariffs on electronics, scientific equipment
and pulp and paper and calls on the EC to do the same, says Mr Hata's
letter. He says Japan has already offered to reduce import duties on
industrial goods by an average of 60 per cent, as against the 33 per cent
offered by the EC and the US's 37 per cent.
Japan will seek to encourage progress in Gatt at the Asia-Pacific Economic
Co-operation forum meeting next week.
Frances Williams adds from Geneva: Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of
Gatt yesterday rebuked negotiators for wasting time 'on arcane technical
points of doubtful importance' and warned against the temptation to leave
all important concessions until the last possible moment.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Consumer prices show 0.4% gain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNDERLYING pace of US inflation remained moderate despite a 0.4 per cent
gain in consumer prices last month.
The Labour Department, which reported the latest figures yesterday, said
that the increase partly reflected a 1.9 per cent increase in energy costs
after petrol taxes were raised by 4.3 cents a gallon on October 1.
The year-on-year rate of inflation rose to 2.8 per cent, against 2.7 per
cent in September.
The relatively poor consumer price figures followed exceptionally good
wholesale price figures earlier this week. The producer price index for
finished goods declined 0.2 per cent last month.
Bond prices fell modestly as many traders had hoped that the drop in
wholesale prices would be reflected in the consumer price data.
Taking the two sets of figures together, however, 'inflation is stable to
lower', said Mr William McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York.
Fed governors and regional presidents meet next week to discuss monetary
policy. Most analysts expect the Fed to leave short-term interest rates,
currently 3 per cent, unchanged for the next few months. But a tightening of
policy is widely expected sometime next year.
Last month's consumer price increase was the largest since April. However,
it followed a zero increase in September and moderate gains during the
summer. Apart from energy, the main upward pressures on the index came from
food prices, up 0.6 per cent from September, and housing, healthcare and
entertainment, which registered 0.5 per cent increases.
The core consumer price index, which excludes food and energy, rose by 0.3
per cent last month and by 3 per cent in the year to October.
The annual increase in core prices was the lowest for two decades.
In recent weeks, signs of an acceleration of economic growth in the second
half of the year have dented confidence in bond markets.
Investors worry that faster growth will put upward pressure on inflation,
forcing the Fed to raise interest rates which would cause bond prices to
fall.
Most forecasters, however, say that there is enough slack in the economy to
prevent inflation rising much above its current rate of about 3 per cent.
Some predict a further slight decline in inflation.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Congress succumbs to a fever of legislation against crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Congress is working itself up into an anti-crime frenzy in which an
array of bills proposing tougher gun controls, tougher sentences and tougher
measures against immigrants could sweep into law.
The Senate has already voted to ban the sale of handguns to anyone under the
age of 18; to expand federal prosecutors' powers to pursue gang crime; to
make carjacking a federal crime; and to impose the death penalty on a long
list of federal crimes. It was near to outlawing the manufacture and sale of
assault weapons, whose import is already banned.
The House of Representatives yesterday passed the Brady Bill, legislation
named after the former White House press secretary severely injured in an
assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. This orders a five-day
waiting period for anyone buying a handgun. It follows the passing of a
number of crime measures last week, which included putting more policeman on
the streets and giving drug treatment to convicts.
Senator Joseph Biden, the chairman of the Senate judiciary committee,
sneered that the only restraint which his colleagues had shown was in not
proposing the death penalty for jay-walking.
Congress's efforts to prove it is taking action against crime usually
provoke cynicism among prosecutors and police chiefs around the country.
Most violent crime falls under state and city jurisdiction.
The expansion of the death penalty to such federal offences as wrecking a
train or fatal violence against maritime platforms is viewed by most law
enforcement officials as symbolic and ineffective against the street crime
that most worries US voters.
The federal government has not executed a prisoner for 30 years. Texas
yesterday carried out its 16th execution this year. 'I know of no
law-enforcement professional who believes all the death penalty provisions
and new federal crimes would affect public safety in the slightest,' wrote
Mr Robert Morgenthau, the New York district attorney, in yesterday's New
York Times.
'Proposals to put more police officers on the beat nationwide and to
construct new high-security prisons are sound. Little else deserves
support.'

United Nations Security Council to impose sanctions on North Korea if it
continued to resist full inspection by the International Atomic Energy
Agency.
'Our patience is running out, and the North Koreans need to know that is our
next step,' Ms Davis told the Foreign Affairs Committee. She did not,
however, set any specific deadline by which the US would request sanctions.
Sanctions, however, are an extremely sensitive issue because many fear that
North Korea might be more likely to attack neighbouring South Korea or other
nations if driven into a corner.
North Korean officials have said they would consider the imposition of
sanctions an aggressive act.
Last week, Japan and South Korea warned Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary,
against seeking UN sanctions out of fear that North Korea might undertake a
terrorist campaign. Mr Aspin spent two days in South Korea discussing the
northern threat with President Kim Young-sam. The US has 35,000 troops
there.
President Bill Clinton said on Sunday that North Korea 'cannot be allowed to
build a nuclear bomb', but did not discuss specific actions the US might
undertake.
Ms Davis told the committee that in the past North Korea 'could have
produced weapons grade material sufficient to produce one or two nuclear
weapons,' but added she was confident that Pyongyang was not making atomic
bombs now.
Preventing North Korea from producing nuclear weapons was among the most
important of the administration's goals, Ms Davis said.
She was hopeful China would not veto a Security Council request for
sanctions. 'They share our goals and we hope that they would work with us on
the Security Council. The US is willing to pursue non-proliferation goals
rigorously even when they may cause friction'.
In addition to fears about nuclear weapon development, the US is concerned
about possession of conventional arms. Ms Davis grouped North Korea along
with Iran, Iraq and Libya as nations of particular concern. She said that
North Korea could become one of the countries to be monitored closely by a
new international safeguard organisation.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Heady cocktail in NY: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN early abstract expressionist work, 'Year after Year', painted in 1947 by
Arshile Gorky, sold for Dollars 3.85m (Pounds 2.6m) at Christie's in New
York on Tuesday night.
The price paid by a private American collector for this colourful,
optimistic, cocktail of greens, reds and oranges was not only a record for
the artist but set the seal on Christie's most successful auction of
contemporary art for years.
'This was the most heady sale since the late 1980s,' said Mr Christopher
Burge, Christie's US president.
'The excitement in the room signalled a return of confidence to the market,
with people keen to buy works of art again, whether expensive or reasonably
priced,' he said. 'We noticed a number of new buyers.'
The auction brought in Dollars 15.9m (Pounds 10.8m) and was 85 per cent sold
by value, a high success rate for a contemporary art sale. A fire at Gorky's
studio destroyed much of his output, and important works rarely come on to
the market.
Another highlight was the Dollars 1.7m paid for a study by Francis Bacon of
his fellow-artist Lucien Freud. It fetched almost double its estimate. Bacon
painted the portrait in 1964.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Canada prepares for record budget deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S new Liberal government is preparing the ground for bad news on the
federal budget deficit. Officials are suggesting the shortfall could reach a
record CDollars 40bn (Pounds 20.8bn) in the fiscal year ending March 31,
1994, compared to the CDollars 32.6bn deficit predicted last April by the
previous Conservative government.
Estimates of last year's deficit are expected to be revised upwards to well
above the projected CDollars 35.5bn.
Analysts predict that revisions of the federal deficit will be followed by
announcements from several of the 10 provinces that they too will fail to
meet budget forecasts.
The provinces, some of which are heavy borrowers on international capital
markets, have been under pressure to trim deficits. Credit-rating agencies
have warned failure to do so may result in downgrading of creditworthiness
and rising borrowing costs.
Higher deficits, coupled with a narrowing gap between US and Canadian
interest rates and nervousness on the future of the North American Free
Trade Agreement, have pushed the Canadian dollar down sharply over the past
two days.
The currency was trading at 76.47 US cents yesterday morning, compared to
more than 77 cents on Monday.
The Bank of Canada's efforts to bring down interest rates are expected to
keep a lid on the dollar in coming weeks. The gap between the yield on
10-year US and Canadian government bonds shrunk yesterday to about 1.1
percentage points, compared to 1.4 points before Canada's general election
on October 25. Canadian banks earlier this week lowered their prime lending
rate to 5.5 per cent, the lowest in 31 years.
Federal and provincial budget projections have been thrown off course
largely by sluggish tax revenues, rather than runaway spending. The revenue
shortfalls are ascribed partly to slow economic growth. But there is also
growing evidence of an expanding black economy.

FT  11 NOV 93 / South Korea urges haste on nuclear issue: President Kim
Young-sam believes his talks in Washington could be decisive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE NORTH Korean nuclear issue was 'entering a critical phase' and must be
resolved soon, South Korea's President Kim Young-sam said yesterday. His
meeting with President Bill Clinton in Washington on November 23 could prove
'the decisive discussion on the issue,' he added.
President Kim plans to meet China's President Jiang Zemin during the
Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation conference in Seattle on November 19.
China has indicated it may block a possible attempt by the UN Security
Council to impose economic sanctions on North Korea if it does not accept
international nuclear inspections soon.
A national security meeting headed by Mr Kim yesterday saw no sign of
military provocation by North Korea. 'There is some military movement in
North Korea, but not of the type associated with an offensive undertaking,'
he explained.
The US Defence Department refuted reports of a sudden build-up of North
Korean forces on the South Korean border. A senior US defence official was
quoted at the weekend as suggesting North Korea might be preparing to attack
South Korea soon, out of economic desperation.
'There was no mention that the department felt an attack by the North
Koreans was imminent. That was never said and never even implied,' a
spokesman said in clarifying the official's remarks.
'There has been a build-up of North Korean conventional forces near the
border area along the demilitarised zone gradually over the past 10 years.
The senior official described some things worrying the department. One of
them is the North Korean economy; second, the trend to the build-up of
conventional forces along the border.'
Officials in Seoul expressed cautious optimism that a diplomatic solution to
the impasse over the international inspection of North Korea's nuclear
facilities could still be reached.
They said one sign was a meeting on Tuesday between US and North Korean
officials in New York, called at the request of Pyongyang. No progress was
reported, but it indicated North Korea was unwilling to abandon negotiations
with Washington in seeking a solution to nuclear inspections.
Some South Korean officials believe North Korea is engaged in brinkmanship
complicated by disagreements within the Pyongyang government over the future
course of talks. But Mr Kim expressed frustration that North Korea
'counteracts with an irrelevant issue' whenever Seoul and Washington want
nuclear inspections resumed.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Poles look to new cabinet to deliver
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE POLISH government yesterday consigned opposition politics to the status
of a minority sport, after three stormy years of vulnerable cabinets.
Indeed, with 310 votes behind him in yesterday's vote of confidence - in a
460-seat chamber - Premier Waldemar Pawlak, the 34-year-old farmer and head
of the Polish Peasant Party boasts a majority that many would envy.
The PSL, with its political base in the rural areas where well over
one-third of Poles live and work, and the post-communist Left Democratic
Alliance (SLD) together won 35 per cent of the vote in elections on
September 19. But a new election law, eliminating parties with less than 5
per cent of the vote, translated that into just under two-thirds of the
seats, leaving the right-wing parties - representing over 20 per cent of the
voters - unrepresented in parliament.
It is even possible that Mr Pawlak's cabinet could serve a full four-year
term. If the opinion polls are to be believed, the Polish people are now
looking to the future with a degree of optimism last recorded in the early
days of the reforming Solidarity governments.
The new cabinet has also inherited a growing economy, with 4 per cent
increases in GDP forecast for this and next year. Inflation promises to fall
from this year's 32 per cent to around 21 per cent next year if the new
government holds next year's budget deficit to the International Monetary
Fund's recommended target of around 5 per cent of GDP.
It is here though that cracks could emerge. The rural voters who supported
the PSL, and those in the recession-struck towns who backed the SLD, are
looking for tangible, and rapid, economic improvements.
Elements in both parties are willing to take risks with inflation. Such
moves, as Mr Marek Borowski, the SLD politician in charge of the economy,
knows full well, would risk a worsening of relations with the IMF. That, in
turn, could jeopardise a desperately needed 20 per cent cut in the country's
Dollars 30.6bn debt to western governments, due to be implemented next year.
The fact that the World Bank remains Poland's largest source of capital -
until a debt rescheduling agreement can be negotiated with western
commercial banks owed Dollars 12.3bn - also puts a premium on monetary
stringency.
However, the SLD's trade union component, which makes up around a third of
the parliamentary party, could provide the focus for a left-wing alternative
to the party's free marketeers, such as Mr Borowski and Mr Wieslaw
Kaczmarek, the new privatisation minister who promises to continue to
whittle away at the state sector.
The politicians at the top of the PSL and the SLD appear to have the
sophistication to maintain a common front and prevent internal rivalries
from undermining the new government. However, the social pressures the
government faces will be difficult to contain.

FT  11 NOV 93 / A Russian constitution for Yeltsin's time: Written for the
president alone, the document's permanence is not guaranteed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The great powers of the president, connected with his duration in office,
will lead to oppression and ruin, said the columnist 'Cato', writing in the
New York Journal in 1787, during the passionate debate over the US
constitution.
The immediate reaction to the Russian constitution, widely published for the
first time yesterday, has been much the same.
In both cases, the assertion of a new central power after the collapse of an
old one has been seen as containing a potential for tyranny and for
division.
But most commentators have followed the lead given on Tuesday by Mr Vitaly
Tretyakov, the editor of the Nezavisimaya Gazeta, who said the constitution
was fashioned for Mr Yeltsin alone and could thus not stand for future
presidents.
Mr Alexander Tsipko, a leading candidate for the centrist Civic Union bloc,
said yesterday that 'what was needed after October was something which
unites the country, but this merely divides it into those who are for and
those who are against the president'.
Mr Nikolai Travkin, head of the Democratic party, talked of a constitution
which could not gain the trust of the people. While Mr Gary Kasparov, the
world chess champion, who is a candidate for the Russia's Choice group most
closely associated with the president, dismissed the document as 'clearly
temporary'.
The central problems for the drafters of the constitution were
the legacy of the Soviet era - in which all power was actually centred in
the party but was titularly vested in the parliament;
the recent tragic struggle between parliament and presidency following the
blockage of political and economic reform; and
the actions of the 89 republics and regions, which in the past two years
have become increasingly assertive of their own rights and independence.
They have thus attempted to construct a document which gives the presidency
powers that are superior to those of the parliament. Like the French
constitution, which was its largest influence, it gives the president the
right to form governments and dismiss parliaments, lays out a complex
impeachment procedure and has indirect regional elections to the upper
house.
However, the country lacks the French experience with a democratic system,
and there is no guarantee that Mr Yeltsin would appoint a government from
the largest bloc in parliament, if it were not to his liking.
Mr Yeltsin, in his address to the nation on Tuesday night, said that the
provisions for his impeachment by parliament and his ability to dismiss the
deputies were, like nuclear weapons, there to preserve stability, and not to
be used.
In the thin fabric of Russian democratic practice, however, they could
easily be used - especially if the majority parliament found itself in
strong opposition to the president but baulked of any other means for
expressing that opposition.
Second, the constitution's drafters have insisted on the equality of the 89
subjects of the federation.
That means that the 21 republics will have the same legal status as regions
big and small, and the two cities of Moscow and St Petersburg. For some of
the republics - especially the self declared independent republic of
Chechnya, which will not hold elections on its territory and Tatarstan,
which will not hold a referendum on the constitution - this dismisses the
rights they enjoyed in the Soviet era (even if these were mostly on paper).
In this sphere, much will depend on what powers are given to the subjects of
the federation in the Federation Treaty - which has yet to be thrashed out.
Finally, the constant change of mind and last-minute additions to the
constitution by the president and his team is a sharp reminder to the future
deputies of how little they could do about the status of parliament before
it existed. Originally planned for a four-year term, its first term will be
only two years.
The deputies of the upper house (or Federation Council) will be elected for
the first term, then will be selected by the regions in ways apparently left
to their leaderships - which leaves the first term deputies looking rather
spare.
The very site of the new parliament has been proposed (though not yet
decided) for the Academy of Administration on the outskirts of Moscow -
hardly underscoring its prestige.
Mr Yeltsin, having promised he would stand for president in pre-term
elections next June, will now serve his full term apparently irrespective of
what the new parliament thinks.
The parliamentary democracies among the seven leading powers are the
constitutional (and titlar) monarchy in Britain, Canada with a British
model, and Germany, Italy and Japan with parliamentary systems reconstructed
after the last war to avoid a future dictator.
The presidential states are France and the US, both with revolutionary
traditions from which their constitutions and their presidencies derive.
Russia, it is clear, will join the latter group - but with no guarantee that
this will be the final stab at a constitution.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Bare shelves and barely a choice: The grim outlook for the
people of Serbia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'BUT who else?' is the brazen electoral slogan for the ruling Socialists of
Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic, as 2,000 per cent a month inflation
plunges Serbia into poverty.
Mr Milosevic last week boasted how 'the Serbian economy, in spite of the
draconian embargo, is faring even better than countries which receive
economic aid'.
But even Mr Milosevic's optimistic remarks can no longer mask the
impoverishment of the country's 9.8m inhabitants.
While the Serbian president blames United Nations sanctions for economic
collapse, the country's coffers have been emptied to pay for Serb armies in
Bosnia and Croatia.
The average wage has fallen below DM10 (Pounds 4) a month - which buys one
kilo of meat. Serb officials claim that 70 per cent of economic activity is
in the grey market, eluding tax collectors. Faced with a huge budget
deficit, the cash-hungry government has flooded the market with dinars in
order to boost hard currency reserves.
In the most recent effort to lure people into converting their dwindling
hard currency savings, the government 10 days ago lifted a three-month ban
on converting hard currency through giro accounts - at a premium rate of up
to twice the black market rate. On Tuesday, however, the government devalued
the dinar by 98.5 per cent and made giro payments illegal.
In the crucial run-up to parliamentary elections, set for December 19, the
Socialists are keen to put a gloss on the grim economic picture.
They need to increase pensions and wages, decimated by inflation, and return
basic staples to grocery store shelves.
Belgrade is also paying more than 1m workers sacked when their factories
shut because of the break-up of the Yugoslav market and the sanctions.
The powerful state television will convince Serbian citizens that there is
no alternative to the Socialist party: a pitch borne out by the failure of
the quarrelsome and disorganised opposition to pose a coherent challenge.
The ultranationalist leader, Mr Vojislav Seselj, their lone political
challenger, is being systematically discredited. A paramilitary commander
who last year was accused of war crimes by the US, he achieved widespread
popularity as the leader of the second biggest political party.
At that point, his meteoric rise to power was aided by both the state
television, and Serbia's secret police. But, after the collapse last month
of his unofficial alliance with Mr Milosevic, Mr Seselj became the target of
a smear campaign orchestrated by the state-controlled media and the secret
police.
The government of Macedonia yesterday arrested several ethnic Albanians,
including two deputy ministers in the coalition government, on charges of
preparing an armed rebellion.
Macedonian police yesterday renewed their clampdown on Gostivar and Tetovo,
mostly ethnic Albanian towns.
The move could shatter the fragile ethnic co-existence between Albanians and
Macedonians in the former Yugoslav republic. Albanians comprise 20 per cent
of the 2m people.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Eight Russian Political groups disqualified from elections
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Russian election commission last night disqualified eight of the 21
political groups which had sought to register for parliamentary elections on
December 12, because they had failed to gather the required 100,000
signatures.
As all 21 claimed to have collected at least 100,000 signatures, it is
presumed that a number of signatures were regarded as forgeries. The main
victim is the Russian National Union, led by Mr Sergei Baburin, a former
hardline nationalist deputy. He said 20,000 signatures had been stolen by
thieves who wore police uniforms.
All other main blocs have been accepted, including the liberal Russian Unity
and Yavlinsky blocs, the centrist Civic Union and the far-left Russian
Communists.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Pohl sees jobs as Twelve's priority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE REAL issue' facing Europe is the task of reducing unemployment,
combined with the challenge of opening the west of the continent to the
former eastern bloc, Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the former Bundesbank president,
said last night.
The objective of the Maastricht treaty for establishing fixed exchange rates
and a common monetary policy in Europe was no longer the main priority. 'The
question of whether the Maastricht treaty will ever be implemented is open,
to say the least.' But conditions for economic and monetary union were 'much
less favourable' than in the 1980s.
Mr Pohl voiced doubts over whether the anti-inflation consensus espoused by
the treaty would prove durable in view of the 'tremendous problems' facing
Europe. These included the consequences of German unification, where he
pointed to errors over the introduction of the D-Mark into east Germany in
1990 and a wrong mixture of budgetary and monetary policies as contributing
to high German interest rates after unity.
Mr Hans van den Broek, the European commissioner responsible for external
political affairs, yesterday dropped his resignation threats and agreed to a
truce in his long-running power struggle with Sir Leon Brittan, the
Commission's chief trade negotiator, writes Lionel Barber.
Mr van den Broek, the former Dutch foreign minister, was on the brink of
quitting until a last-minute compromise brokered by Mr Jacques Delors, the
Commission president, gave him management responsibility for the EU's
overseas delegations.
Other commissioners have found the feuding a source of amusement - one
insider's joke is that the only satisfactory way to separate the foreign
affairs portfolio is to create a new commissioner called 'Mr Hans van den
Brittan'.

FT  11 NOV 93 / EU jobless total heads for 18m
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT in the European Union will continue to rise until mid-1995,
with little hope of a rapid or consumer-led recovery, according to the
latest economic forecasts by the European Commission published yesterday.
More than 18m people are expected to be out of work in the next two years,
amid high interest rates, weak output, and only a modest improvement in
budget deficits, which are at the highest average level since 1945.
Mr Henning Christophersen, economics commissioner, called for an early
reduction in interest rates, particularly in Germany. 'It's not the size or
the volume which matters, it's the speed,' he said.
The Commission's forecast assumes that Germany will continue to lead the way
on interest rate cuts, with countries such as France and Belgium sticking to
their policy of shadowing the D-Mark in an effort to maintain exchange rate
stability. Overall, it expects short-term rates to drop by 2 percentage
points to an average 6.4 per cent in 1994.
But it warns that inflationary pressures could prove more resistant,
particularly in Germany. In this case, 'the assumed monetary easing could
occur later and to a lesser extent'.
Despite the bleak outlook for jobs and growth, Mr Christophersen said the
timetable for European monetary union by 1997 or 1999 was still realistic.
He insisted that countries could still meet the tough budget deficit targets
set down in the Maastricht treaty.
Germany is expected to grow by only 0.5 per cent next year, with all the
growth coming from former east Germany, and only by 1.6 per cent in 1995.
France, the other economic motor, is likely to stutter along at 1 per cent
growth in 1994 and 2.1 per cent in 1995.
The UK, which left the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992, is
expected to outperform most of the EU, with growth of 2.5 and 2.7 per cent
expected in the next two years.
Ireland and Denmark also figure strongly, with the Irish expected to be the
only European country registering more than 3 per cent growth.
The Commission is sticking to its earlier EU growth forecast of 0.4 per cent
and 1.3 per cent in 1993 and 1994 respectively. while output is expected to
rise by 2.1 per cent in 1995.
Unemployment is forecast to rise from 10.6 per cent in 1993 to 11.2 per cent
and 11.3 per cent in 1994 and 1995.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Lamfalussy preaches peace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAN who will be keeping an eye on the next phase of European economic
and monetary union yesterday got his first look at the people who will be
keeping an eye on him.
Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, the Belgian president-elect of the European
Monetary Institute, the forerunner of a European central bank, was quizzed
by members of the European parliament, revelling in their new powers to vet
important institutional appointments in the European Union.
But while the deputies blustered through the three-hour session, Mr
Lamfalussy remained unruffled, like a grey-suited Mahatma Gandhi, softly
preaching a policy of passive resistance to currency speculators and
imprudent finance ministers.
Mr Lamfalussy, who will launch the EMI on January 1, 1994, renounced weapons
such as capital controls and central bank intervention. 'I think the only
way to influence the market is (with) the credibility and sustainability of
policies,' he told MEPs. 'Credibility leads to (exchange rate) stability.'
Were current government economic policies credible? Mr Lamfalussy refused to
be drawn, but he said recent combinations of monetary and economic policy at
least seemed to be having some positive effect on the European recession:
'Whether government policies were deliberately wise or whether they were
just lucky I don't know, but the result isn't too bad.'
It was too soon to consider reforms to the discredited exchange rate
mechanism, following the recent series of currency crises, he said. As a
result, Mr Lamfalussy said he thought it 'improbable' that the EU would meet
the Maastricht treaty's first EMU target by 1997. Instead, a few of the
strongest EU economies would probably press on with monetary union in
'jumps', rather than pursuing an unworkable 'gradualist' approach, he said,
adding 'it isn't an easy solution, but I think it's a practical solution' -
provided all EU members accepted the discipline of stable real exchange
rates.
Mr Lamfalussy will launch the Frankfurt-based EMI in January, and he told
MEPs it would have a staff of some 200 people. They would help him act as an
impartial 'honest broker' between independent central banks, which he said
had to have a clear mandate to preserve price stability. But certain MEPs
seemed unconvinced that Mr Lamfalussy, a Belgian baron and distinguished
central banker, would have a real influence over street-fighting finance
ministers such as Mr Kenneth Clarke of the UK.
But the MEPs approved his candidacy - unanimously.

France's judicial authorities yesterday released almost all 88 people

kept three for questioning, including two leaders of the Algerian Fraternity
in France, believed to be a front organisation for the Algerian Islamic
Front (FIS), Reuter reports from Paris. The Interior Ministry said
investigators found pro-FIS propaganda, false identity papers and money, but
no weapons. The government said the dragnet, a response to the abduction
last month of three French consular officials in Algiers, aimed to prevent
potential acts of violence.

In a bizarre twist to the Polly Peck saga, a Turkish prosecutor has issued
an order for the arrest of administrators of the collapsed
fruit-to-electronics conglomerate on bribery charges, a lawyer for former
Polly Peck chairman Asil Nadir said yesterday, Reuter reports from Nicosia.
The lawyer, Ali Riza Gorgun, said he had received a copy of the arrest
warrant for the three main administrators - Richard Stone and Michael Jordan
of Coopers &amp; Lybrand and Christopher Morris of Touche Ross - and six of
their colleagues as well as their Turkish lawyer.
Mr Gorgun said the Istanbul prosecutor's office had acted on a complaint by
Mr Nadir about how the administrators had handled the affairs of Polly Peck.
A similar complaint had been lodged with the prosecutor's office in northern
Cyprus, he added.
Mr Nadir, who was charged with theft and false accounting following the
collapse of Polly Peck, jumped bail in Britain and fled to his native
northern Cyprus in May. He accuses the British authorities of mounting a
conspiracy to deny him a fair trial.

The European Commission yesterday opened an inquiry into a FFr1.5bn (Pounds
170m) capital injection granted to Air France, on the grounds that it might
amount to illegal state aid, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. The French
government announced in February that it was providing extra capital to the
national carrier through a subscription of equity-linked debt from Caisse
des Depots et Consignations, the state-controlled financial institution.
It is the Commission's third inquiry in two years into alleged state
subsidies at Air France. In November 1991, Brussels waved through a FFr2bn
capital injection and last July approved the FFr1.25bn purchase of an 8.8
per cent stake in the company by Banque Nationale de Paris, the
state-controlled bank.

WEAKNESS in the Japanese economy will depress average growth among the
world's leading industrialised economies to 2.2 per cent next year, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development forecast yesterday,
David Buchan reports from Paris.
After a two-day meeting of its economic policy committee, Mr Kumi Shigehara,
OECD chief economist, said growth estimates of real gross domestic product
were being revised downwards from 1.2 to 1.1 per cent for this year and from
2.7 to 2.2 per cent next year. While European members could expect an
average 1.5 per cent next year, Japan's growth 'could be well below 1 per
cent'. Ms Laura Tyson, head of President Bill Clinton's Council of Economic
Advisers, said the US was on course in the second half of this year and in
1994 for a 3 per cent annual growth rate.
The discussion on monetary policy had concluded that the macroeconomic
benefit of interest rate cuts in the US, Canada, UK and Australia had been
delayed or reduced because of 'build-up of debt positions in the business,
household and banking sectors'.
By contrast, many countries in continental Europe did not face such balance
sheet adjustments. 'Here, monetary easing may have a more rapid effect on
activity'. But several continental European countries had indicated that
their concerns about currency and price stability prevented them cutting
interest rates.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Steel industry plans reach new impasse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian and German governments' reluctance to agree production and
subsidy cuts at state-owned steel mills risks plunging the European steel
industry even deeper into crisis, the European Commission warned yesterday.
Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, yesterday indicated that if
Rome and Bonn remained intransigent they could derail the Commission's plans
to help the whole west European steel industry.
Mr Paolo Savona, the Italian industry minister, has raised the stakes in the
long and fraught negotiations with Brussels, by threatening to press ahead
with plans for privatising Ilva, the state steelmaker, without Commission
approval. He told the Italian parliament on Tuesday that he would fight the
Commission's strict limits on subsidies as far as the European Court of
Justice, if necessary.
The new impasse makes it almost certain that industry ministers will have to
delay formal agreement on a series of controversial restructuring plans for
Spanish, east German and Italian state-owned steel producers at their
meeting next Thursday.
Mr Van Miert told a news conference yesterday: 'Those who want to make this
(plan) impossible are going to have to justify themselves to the industry,
which will suffer if the Commission's approach fails.'
Private steelmakers, which have already undergone substantial painful
restructuring, such as British Steel or Usinor-Sacilor in France, will not
make further capacity cuts unless they are reassured that state aid to their
publicly owned competitors is under strict control.
Western Europe's steelmakers have already warned that as many as 100,000
jobs could be lost in the restructuring of the industry, which is suffering
from overcapacity, lack of demand and cheap competition from beyond the
European Union's borders.
Mr Van Miert reserved his principal criticism yesterday for the Italians,
who seemed close to striking a deal with Brussels a fortnight ago. 'We went
as far as we could to convince the Italian authorities that this was the end
of it as far as the Commission was concerned.'
However, Mr Van Miert sounded more optimistic about the possibility of
altering the Treuhand privatisation agency's plan to sell off 60 per cent of
the east German steelmaker, Ekostahl. He and Mr Martin Bangemann, the
industry commissioner, were last night negotiating with Mr Gunter Rexrodt,
German economics minister, in the hope of agreeing further capacity cuts
before the ministerial meeting next week.
The commissioner alleged that the Italian authorities had misled the
Commission about the exact number of furnaces at Ilva's Taranto plant.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Germans confirm worst evasion fears of taxman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German taxman's worst fears of tax evasion appear to have been
confirmed: instead of getting DM24bn (Pounds 9.7bn) this year from a
controversial new tax on investment income, the likely receipts are expected
to be less than half, around DM11bn.
The figures have emerged in the latest tax estimate published by a special
working group of finance officials. They show a new drop in overall public
sector revenues this year of DM2.7bn and next year of DM9.3bn.
As a result, the federal government's budget deficit is expected to reach
DM73bn-74bn this year and DM75bn-76bn in 1994.
While the most important element in the overall shortfall is the slowdown in
the German economy and the steady decline in interest rates, tax evasion is
also thought to have played a significant role.
In particular, officials believe there has been a big rise in the transfer
of investment income from German bank accounts to foreign accounts, above
all in neighbouring Luxembourg, where bankers don't tell tales.
Opposition politicians called yesterday for tighter banking controls to
close the obvious loophole in the taxation of investment income, which has
taken the form, since last January 1, of tax withholding on interest income
paid into German bank accounts.
A red-faced Finance Ministry in Bonn confirmed the tax estimates for
investment taxation yesterday, but insisted that the net effects of the
miscalculation were not as bad as they might appear.
A spokesman explained that the original estimate of a gross income of almost
DM24bn was based on the assumption that some DM17bn was already paid on
investment income in the form of income and corporate taxation. Thus the net
revenues were assumed at only DM7bn.
A further DM4bn had to be deducted because of the high tax thresholds
introduced, precisely in order to discourage the ordinary income earner from
switching his money to offshore bank accounts. Thus the final net income
assumed in the Finance Ministry model was only DM3bn.
The spokesman said that the real miscalculation appeared to be the figure of
DM17bn as the assumed amount of investment income tax paid under the old
regulations, before the new tax was introduced.

<TEXT>
EUROPE risks being left behind North America and the Asia Pacific region in
the 'communications revolution' because of poor foresight and co-ordination,
according to the president of a leading data networking company.
Mr Eric Benhamou, president of 3Com, based in California, said that
'insufficient public awareness about Europe's plan for a superdigital
highway' - an advanced, high-volume communications network for data, image
and voice - was jeopardising its economic potential.
Delivering the London Business School's annual Governors' Lecture, sponsored
by the FT, Mr Benhamou contrasted the low profile of European projects with
their high status in competing regions. 'The US has NII, Canada has the
Canarie project, Singapore has IT2000, Japan has its 2015 ISDN milestone,
but there is no direct equivalent in Europe.' Despite 'exciting' networking
projects, such as SuperJanet, to interconnect universities and research
institutions, Europe lacked the strategic vision of the US and the Far East,
he said.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Paramount pays Dollars 552m for US publisher Macmillan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MACMILLAN, the largest US business in the empire of the late Mr Robert
Maxwell, was sold yesterday to Paramount Communications, which outbid rivals
with an offer of Dollars 552.75m (Pounds 366m).
Paramount owns publishing imprints such as Simon &amp; Schuster and Prentice
Hall. Its unsuccessful rivals in the final round of bidding are believed to
have been Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, the US educational publishers, K-111,
the US magazine company, and Pearson, the publishing and information group
that owns the Financial Times.
The sale agreement takes the gross total raised by administrators Price
Waterhouse from the sale of Maxwell Communication Corporation's US interests
beyond Dollars 1.5bn. Mr Mark Homan of Price Waterhouse said he believed the
net figure would fall within the predicted range of Dollars 700m-Dollars
1.1bn.
'We are looking pretty good on that,' Mr Homan said. He said he believed the
main Maxwell disposals in the US could be wrapped up by the year-end.
Offers are now being received for the last significant US business, Standard
Rate and Data, the specialist advertising industry publication.
The purchase of Macmillan will considerably strengthen the publishing
interests of Paramount, itself in Dollars 10bn merger talks with Viacom, the
US cable and television company.
Mr Martin Davis, chairman and chief executive of Paramount Communications,
said the transaction was 'a significant step in furthering our strategic
objective of creating proprietary intellectual properties that can be
distributed through a wide variety of media, from printed pages to computer
and video screens'.
As part of the sale, a reorganisation plan was filed under Chapter 11 in the
US Bankruptcy Court. Price Waterhouse said that was a technical step needed
'to remove the uncertainty created by Mr Maxwell's involvement with
Macmillan Inc'.
During a transition period, expected to last about three months, Mr Jonathan
Newcomb, president and chief operating officer, and Mr Andrew Evans, chief
finance officer of Paramount Publishing, will work on combining the two
companies.
Mr Richard Snyder, Paramount Publishing chairman, said the two businesses
were complementary and 'significant savings' were expected from integration.
Macmillan's backlist of authors includes Hemingway and Faulkner and its
publishing interests range from reference to children's books and general
fiction.
The prestige created by the Macmillan acquisition may expand possibilities
for Paramount's planned merger with Viacom, which is being hotly contested
by home shopping service QVC Network.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Euro Disney hit by Pounds 610m loss: US parent under
pressure over rescue plan as leisure group's shares fall sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EURO DISNEY, the European leisure group controlled by Walt Disney of the US,
yesterday announced a net loss of FFr5.3bn (Pounds 610m) for the year to
September 30, prompting a sharp fall in the company's shares on
international stock markets.
The scale of the losses increases the urgency of a capital restructuring at
Euro Disney and puts pressure on Walt Disney, the US entertainment group, to
help rescue the leisure company.
Mr Philippe Bourguignon, Euro Disney's chairman, said the company would
require significant funding throughout the current financial year. He said
negotiations were under way with its banks and Walt Disney, and that he
hoped to complete a restructuring plan soon.
Industry observers said the fate of Euro Disney now rested largely in the
hands of Walt Disney, which holds 49 per cent of its shares. 'It is
make-your-mind-up time,' one analyst said.
Walt Disney said it would provide finance for Euro Disney for a limited
period to enable it to achieve a financial restructuring by spring 1994.
Euro Disney's losses included a write-off of FFr3.6bn for pre-opening costs
at the EuroDisneyland theme park in the eastern outskirts of Paris and for
planned redundancies.
The exceptional charges represent a serious blow to the company's capital
base, reducing shareholders' equity to just FFr1.5bn, compared with FFr7bn
at the end of September last year, using French accounting standards.
Euro Disney said it had written off all of its pre-opening costs, including
marketing and training expenses, to improve its future results.
The French theme park has been a growing worry for Walt Disney since it
opened 18 months ago. Bad weather has discouraged tourists who have
sometimes found it cheaper to go to Disney World in Florida.
Mr Bourguignon has taken a number of steps to encourage more visitors and to
entice them to part with their money. New rides have been opened, and prices
have been reduced sharply at the resort's hotels. Euro Disney reports some
success from its measures. Mr Bourguignon also points to the fact that 17m
visitors have come through the gates of EuroDisneyland in the first 18
months of its operation, making it, he says, Europe's largest tourist
attraction.
But even if visitors are being attracted, investors are still wary.
Yesterday, Euro Disney's shares fell sharply in London and Paris. In London,
shares fell by 72p to 436p after the results announcement. In Paris, shares
were temporarily suspended and fell by FFr5.7 to FFr38.
The bulk of the losses for the year to September 30 reflected the
exceptional charges relating to pre-opening costs and provisions for a
planned reduction in staff from 11,100 to just over 10,000. The net loss
before exceptional items was FFr1.7bn, which was achieved on revenues of
FFr5.7bn.
In view of the uncertainty surrounding Euro Disney, Walt Disney took a
Dollars 350m (Pounds 231.7m) charge against fourth-quarter earnings to
establish full reserves for the temporary funding and for receivables due
from the French associate.
Walt Disney's charge, together with its share of Euro Disney's operating
losses, meant the US company recorded a total Dollars 414.5m loss from the
European venture in the quarter and Dollars 514.7m in the full year.
That in turn pushed Walt Disney into a fourth quarter net loss of Dollars
77.8m, compared with net income of Dollars 223.7m in the same period of last
year. After heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Walt Disney's
shares finished unchanged at Dollars 41 1/8.

FT  11 NOV 93 / National Power plan to close 10 coal-fired plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Power, the electricity generator, expects to close about 10
coal-fired power stations by 2000. The news comes as a severe blow to
Britain's beleaguered coal industry.
The closures may leave National Power with only eight coal-fired stations.
It now operates two dozen power plants, including those fired by gas and
oil. Most of the remaining coal-fired stations would be running at
considerably less than full capacity, the company said.
National Power's gloomy prognosis underlines the difficulties the government
will have in privatising the coal industry. With the coal market shrinking
and its future uncertain, ministers are likely to struggle to find potential
buyers. Large companies have shown little interest in bidding.
National Power yesterday identified only two of the doomed power stations,
Thorpe Marsh in South Yorkshire and Staythorpe in Nottinghamshire, saying
both will shut next spring.
Mr John Baker, chief executive, said plants at risk were the smaller ones
which are less efficient and can be more easily run at partial load.
Typically they employ between 100 and 150 people. Plants likely to survive
to the next century are thought to include Drax and Eggborough in North
Yorkshire, Westburton in Nottinghamshire, Didcot in Oxfordshire, Rugeley in
Staffordshire, Aberthaw in South Glamorgan, Tilbury in Essex and Ironbridge
in Shropshire.
National Power, publishing half-year profits of Pounds 250m, up 24 per cent,
disclosed a sharp decline in its share of the electricity generating market,
down from 43 per cent last year to 33 per cent.
Mr John Baker, chief executive, blamed the fall on increased competition in
a stagnant market from nuclear power and new gas-fired stations owned by
independent companies. He said the company's market share might fall below
30 per cent.
In a further setback for British Coal, Mr Baker said National Power's coal
stocks were down just 1m to 18m tonnes in the half year and it was unlikely
to buy additional coal this winter.
In expectation of limited extra sales to National Power and PowerGen, the
other large generator, British Coal has started to close about half of its
remaining 30 pits. Mr Colin Webster, managing director of National Power's
UK business, said the driving force behind plant closures was environmental
controls. Increased controls after 2000 have been proposed by both the
European Commission and the UK pollution inspectorate.
Mr Baker said one coal-fired plant closure a year was likely between now and
the end of the century. Coal-fired capacity would then be about 11,000MW,
against 16,000MW.

FT  11 NOV 93 / Prudential director to get top job at Stock Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Stock Exchange will announce today that it is appointing Mr
Michael Lawrence, the finance director of the Prudential Corporation, the
UK's biggest insurer, as its new chief executive.
His appointment ends an eight-month search following the resignation in
March of Mr Peter Rawlins, who took responsibility for the collapse of the
exchange's Taurus project to reform its share settlement system.
It is one of the most important City appointments for many years, coming at
a time of widespread debate about the exchange's future.
Following the humiliating collapse of Taurus, at a cost to the exchange and
City firms of hundreds of millions of pounds, many in the City believe the
exchange should withdraw entirely from settlement services. Mr Lawrence was
one of the most outspoken critics of the exchange's handling of Taurus.
It had been thought Ms Jane Barker, the exchange's highly regarded finance
director, was a leading contender for the chief executive's position.
However, it is understood she did not allow her name to be considered and
may leave the exchange for reasons unconnected with the appointment of a
chief executive.
The exchange has had great difficulty attracting an appropriate candidate.
The initial list of contenders, drawn up in early autumn by headhunting
firm, Heidrick &amp; Struggles, was unacceptable, according to a member of the
exchange's board.
'They were told to go away and start again and we also threatened to appoint
a new headhunting firm,' he said. 'Once the committee got this name in front
of it, everyone agreed this was the man.'
The exchange's selection committee - which consists of Mr Rudi Mueller,
chairman of Union Bank of Switzerland's London operations, Mr Miles
Rivett-Carnac, deputy chairman of merchant bank Barings, Sir Michael
Richardson, chairman of the stockbrokers Smith New Court, and Mr Donald
Brydon, chief executive of BZW Investment Management - was particularly
impressed with Mr Lawrence's performance as chairman of the 100 Group of
leading finance directors, in particular his criticism of parts of the
Cadbury code of corporate governance.
'(He) has considerable energy and competence', a senior City financier said.
Mr Lawrence joined the Prudential in 1988 after working as a partner in the
accountancy firm Price Waterhouse. He informed the Prudential board of his
decision to quit on Tuesday and is likely to take up his new position in a
matter of weeks.
His pay at the exchange will be linked to performance, but it is understood
he is likely to receive less than Pounds 300,000 a year. One temporary
sticking point to his appointment was whether he should be compensated for
the loss of Prudential share options.

FT  10 NOV 93 / ABB enters robot venture with Renault
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ASEA Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss engineering group, yesterday
strengthened its position in the market for industrial robots, by agreeing
to acquire the robotics operations of Renault and form a joint venture in
automated vehicle assembly with the French car group.
The two companies said the 50-50 venture would employ about 290 people and
have annual sales of about Dollars 80m. After the acquisition of Renault's
robotic operations, ABB's French robotic operations will have annual sales
of about Dollars 60m and employ about 200 people.
Mr Stelio Demark, managing director of ABB Robotics, said that the deals
with Renault were a central element in the company's strategy of shifting
from a product supplier to a partner of industrial groups in the design and
manufacture of automated systems. He said that the joint venture, which will
centre on 'body in white' activities - where cars are assembled and welded
together - would give ABB access to Renault's production line expertise and
enable it to offer higher value-added products and services.
The proposals, which require final approval by Renault employees, would give
ABB its first joint venture project with a carmaker, the biggest market for
robotics, and its first direct participation in the assembly stage of the
production line.
Mr Demark said that prices for industrial robots had fallen by between 25
and 30 per cent over the past few years, prompting the Renault sale.
Renault's robotics operation, the largest in France, accounts for about 12
per cent of total sales of FFr1.4bn (Dollars 238m) from its automation
division. The French group will retain management control of the separate
joint venture for at least two years.
According to Mr Demark, the market for industrial robots has strong growth
potential, in spite of the fall in prices. He said that while in Japan there
are 25 robots for every 1,000 manufacturing workers, the ratio is lower in
Europe: in France, there are three robots per 1,000 workers.
ABB estimates that it has about 20 per cent of the world market for robots
with more than 33,000 currently in operation. Last year, ABB's robot
division achieved sales of about Dollars 350m. ABB has worked with Renault
on several automation projects, including the Twingo and Clio cars. It also
supplies Volvo, with which Renault is planning to merge.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Nextel plans US digital network

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEXTEL, a rapidly expanding US mobile data communications services company,
plans to construct an advanced digital communications network in the US that
will compete with existing cellular telephone services.
Under the plans, Nextel is buying licences to operate mobile communications
services in several of the largest metropolitan areas in the US from
Motorola, the makers of semiconductors and communications systems, in a deal
worth around Dollars 1.8bn.
Nextel has purchased licences from Motorola covering the use of more than
2,500 radio frequencies in 21 states. Motorola will receive a 20 per cent
stake in Nextel and is providing Dollars 260m in new financing.
These arrangements will result in a total of more than Dollars 500m in
financing being provided by Motorola, Nextel said. 'We view this transaction
with Motorola as the capstone of our acquisition campaign,' said Mr Morgan
O'Brien, chairman of Nextel.
Nextel's goal is to upgrade all of these systems with digital technology
developed by Motorola, which will provide the company with equipment and
technical assistance. For Motorola, the biggest operator of dispatch
services in the US, the sale reflects its previously announced decision to
offer technology and equipment rather than provide services.
Nextel also announced that it has reached a technology alliance with Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone of Japan. NTT has also taken an equity stake in
Nextel, purchasing 1.5m shares for Dollars 75m. NTT will assist Nextel in
developing its digital wireless network.
When fully constructed in 1995, Nextel's networks will be capable of
reaching 180m people across the US, the company said. Services will include
mobile telephone, dispatch, alpha-numeric paging and data transmission from
a single mobile telephone handset.
Already, Nextel has started offering its integrated digital services in
southern California. The company said that its services will cover most of
the state within the first quarter of 1994. New services will be available
in New York and Chicago by mid-1994. Nextel said the services will represent
'the wireless portion of an information super-highway'.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Brazil president seeks to restore credibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S President Itamar Franco, his government almost paralysed by
corruption allegations in Congress, yesterday made an important gesture to
try to restore the credibility of the country's institutions by ordering
that anyone in an elected or official post should reveal their property and
income before taking the job.
The measure, which also applies to acting members of the executive, congress
and judiciary, is the first time many elected and government officials will
be open to scrutiny. The law is expected to come into effect soon.
President Franco's actions follow mounting concern among political leaders
that corruption hearings under way, which are investigating allegations that
a group of up to 30 politicians and ministers profited from fees and other
payments channeled through the government's budget, are undermining the
credibility of all the country's leaders.
So far one minister has resigned over the scandal, which is thought to
involve several million US dollars, and the bank accounts of over 50
individuals and organisations have been opened to scrutiny.
Brazil's constitutional revision, seen as vital to solving some of the
country's economic problems, was stalled again yesterday because of
political problems stemming from the corruption hearings. The rules and
working arrangements for the revision, which were due to be approved several
weeks ago, were delayed again after corruption allegations threatened to
bring down Mr Ibsen Pinheiro, a leading politician and the elected
'reporter' or senior clerk for the revision.
Mr Pinheiro, the former president of Brazil's lower house and an important
leader of the country's biggest political party, the Party of the Brazilian
Democratic Movement, is the most senior figure to be linked directly to the
corruption hearings.
He was a leading figure in the investigation of separate corruption
allegations which led to last year's downfall of ex-president Fernando
Collor. Mr Pinheiro is alleged to have received about Dollars 40,000 from
another parliamentarian, Mr Genebaldo Correia, himself accused of receiving
money from the alleged ringleader of the scheme, Mr Joao Alves.
Mr Pinheiro has claimed the payments were legal and transparent, although he
has been unable or unwilling to remember why he received the money. He has
claimed the allegations have been made by political enemies at a time when,
because of excitement over the corruption hearings, it is difficult for
individuals to prove their innocence.

QUEBEC separatist leader Lucien Bouchard swore allegiance yesterday to Queen
Elizabeth II, Canada's formal head of state, despite his avowed aim of
leading his French-speaking province to independence, Reuter reports from
Ottawa.
Mr Bouchard had to take the oath to gain his seat in Canada's House of
Commons and become the official leader of the opposition as head of its
second largest party.
His Bloc Quebecois swept up 54 of Quebec's 75 seats in last month's general
election, promising to lead the province to a referendum on sovereignty in
1995. The Bloc's success has placed new strains on Canadian unity and,
ironically, earned the party the official title of 'Her Majesty's Loyal
Opposition'.
Mr Bouchard has refused to live in the official residence of the leader of
the opposition in the Canadian capital.

NATO'S most senior military official yesterday expressed clear reservations
about expanding the alliance, saying its effectiveness could be undermined.
Field Marshal Sir Richard Vincent, chairman of Nato's military committee,
also warned against offering security guarantees to former members of the
Warsaw Pact.
Drawing comparisons with security promises made in the late 1930s, he said
guarantees had to be underpinned by political will and by military
capabilities.
'I do not see either of these seriously in prospect,' he told an audience at
the Royal United Services Institute in London. He said his remarks were
'strictly personal'.
Sir Richard recognised that Nato might not be moving 'far and fast enough'
to satisfy the expectations of central and eastern European countries or to
fulfil its own aim of helping to create a stable security environment.
But Nato's best path was a step-by-step policy based on practical military
co-operation in areas such as peacekeeping. Allies could not afford to 'rush
into this recklessly'.
There were already signs that different national and regional perceptions
among existing allies were making it more difficult to achieve a common
approach.
Links with eastern Europe will be high on the agenda of a Nato summit in
Brussels on January 10.
Sir Richard's outspokenness created a stir earlier this year when he said
Nato could not intervene in Yugoslavia unless political leaders provided
clear objectives.
He returned to this theme yesterday, arguing that a larger-scale military
operation required decisions beforehand on its scope, on its funding, on who
should take the ultimate responsibility and on who would exercise day-to-day
oversight and direction.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Rexrodt presses for deal on E German steelmaker

<TEXT>
MR Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, today will try to cajole the
European Union's industry and competition commissioners into agreeing plans
for the future of Ekostahl, the east German steelmaker.
The Treuhand privatisation agency wants Riva, the private Italian
steelmaker, to buy 60 per cent of Ekostahl, and invest in the construction
of a hot-rolling mill.
But Mr Karel Van Miert, EU competition commissioner, is understood to be
insisting on further cuts in capacity at Ekostahl to offset the addition of
the new mill.
Mr Van Miert and Mr Martin Bangemann, who is in charge of industry policy,
are keen to limit state subsidies to publicly owned steelmakers and to cut
capacity to relieve pressure on the industry throughout the member states.
They will meet Mr Rexrodt in Brussels today to discuss their difficulties
with the Ekostahl case.
A spokesman for Mr Van Miert said yesterday that the full Commission would
consider both the Ekostahl case and the Italian authorities' plans for
restructuring of Ilva, the loss-making state steel producer, at their
meeting today.
But it is almost certain there will not be enough time to prepare for a
formal decision on the controversial subsidy cases at the meeting of EU
industry ministers on Thursday next week.
Mr Paolo Savona, the Italian industry minister, added to the confusion
yesterday when he threatened to press ahead with restructuring of Ilva if
the Commission was not more flexible. Mr Savona told the Italian parliament
the government would complain to the European Court of Justice if the EU did
not make concessions on capacity cuts.

EFFORTS to revive the moribund peace process in Bosnia yesterday failed to
stop a surge in violence as three children and their teacher were killed in
a mortar bomb attack on a school in Sarajevo which wounded at least 20
children.
In Mostar, Croat tanks demolished a famous bridge, built in 1566 and which
embodied the heritage of the southwestern town. 'It was a shot in the heart
and soul of every inhabitant of Mostar,' a local Moslem leader told Bosnian
radio.
Amid intense disappointment with the international community for turning its
back on Bosnia, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, yesterday
snubbed Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the UN mediator, who visited Sarajevo in an
attempt to get the peace process back on track.
Instead, Mr Stoltenberg met Mr Haris Silajdzic, the prime minister, to
discuss the opening of blocked aid routes, reaching a peace settlement.
In another incident which could further tarnish the UN mission in Bosnia,
Serb guards on Monday used crowbars to pry open a UN armoured car carrying
the Catholic archbishop of Sarajevo and two other Croat clerics who were on
a peace mission to the central town of Vares. The Serbs abducted the
churchmen's two bodyguards

THOUSANDS of SEAT motor workers shut down assembly lines yesterday in their
third strike in protest at job cuts at the company's Zona Franca plant, AP
reports from Barcelona.
Unions called the 24-hour strike in opposition to plans by Volkswagen,
SEAT's owner, to stop producing vehicles at the Barcelona factory. Company
officials confirmed that all their production facilities - in Zona Franca,
Pamplona, Martorell and El Prat - were paralysed by the walkout.
The unions also called on workers at SEAT dealers and suppliers to stop
work, but it was not immediately known how widely that call had been heeded.
VW purchased SEAT from the Spanish government in 1986, but has seen its
subsidiary's sales decline sharply. Sales plunged 19 per cent in the first
10 months of this year. Losses are expected to reach Pta100bn (Dollars 763m)
this year.
The company has said it wants parts suppliers to convert the Zona Franca
plant into an industrial park. It is not clear how many suppliers will
accept that invitation nor how many jobs would be saved if they did.

FT  10 NOV 93 / UK to raise concerns about EC trade data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK is facing three years of unreliable and incomplete trade figures
following problems with the European Community's new system of measuring
intra-Community trade.
The Central Statistical Office said yesterday it was delaying publication of
complete visible trade figures for the first eight months of this year
because a lack of data had made it difficult to seasonally adjust the
figures.
The delay marks a further setback for Intrastat, the EC's VAT-based system
for measuring trade that was introduced at the beginning of the year to
coincide with the single market.
The problem has arisen as government officials from France, Germany, the
Netherlands and the UK meet today to discuss the teething problems of the
EC-wide system, which have proved far greater than expected.
Officials believed the method of collection would be operating smoothly by
the middle of this year. But detailed figures are unlikely to be produced
before the end of the year and even then, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark
and Ireland are not certain they will be able to publish.
Statisticians in the UK say problems connected with seasonally adjusting the
figures mean a reliable series of statistics for Britain's trade with the
rest of the world will not be possible for at least three years.
The CSO said yesterday it needed another two days to 'reassess seasonal and
constant price adjustments made under the new system now in use throughout
the EC'.
Figures for Britain's world trade published this year have been stamped with
a government warning about their reliability. The CSO wants to make the next
set of figures - the last set before the Budget on November 30 - as accurate
as possible to avoid embarrassing, large revisions.
The switch from a customs-based system of measuring intra-EC trade to one
based on VAT returns has been beset by problems since its introduction in
January.
Last month Eurostat, the EC's statistical office, said publication of
up-to-date figures was being hampered by a slow rate of reply by companies,
particularly small companies.
The UK has been quicker to produce monthly figures than other member states,
although its plan to produce monthly figures by the end of July proved too
optimistic.
Pressure for today's meeting has come particularly from the UK, which is
concerned that the new method of collecting data may be giving an inaccurate
view of economic trends.
Some economists are concerned the unreliability of export and import price
figures may have led to an underestimation of the level of output in the UK.

FT  10 NOV 93 / VW may bar managers in compromise with Opel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL top Volkswagen managers may be ordered temporarily to stop work if a
compromise, reached yesterday between lawyers representing the German
automotive group and rival Adam Opel, is approved by the two companies'
boards later this week.
Prospects of a deal, which could end one of the legal battles between the
groups, emerged after private negotiations in the back room of a Frankfurt
court.
An open court hearing, called to consider an appeal from Opel, the General
Motors subsidiary, that seven former GM group employees should be banned
from working at VW for a year, was adjourned after Mr Heinz Traub, the
presiding judge, recommended that the two sides should look for a
compromise.
An earlier attempt by Opel to win a temporary banning injunction was turned
down because, the court decided, the seven had been drawn to VW by the
'charisma' of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, a former senior GM
executive, who defected to Volkswagen in March.
However, further evidence has since emerged to strengthen Opel's claim that
VW systematically poached key GM group employees, mainly production and
purchasing executives.
According to sworn statements Mr Lopez personally approached about 17
people. Volkswagen is still bound by a separate injunction not to continue
this practice.
Closing yesterday's proceedings, Mr Traub said both companies had already
been damaged by the affair.
Under orders from the judge to keep strictly silent or risk endangering the
outcome, neither company would discuss yesterday's deal.
However, three or four of the seven, possibly including Mr Jorge Manuel
Gutierrez, head of VW production and Mr Lopez's closest colleague, may be
suspended from their normal work if the companies' boards approve the
compromise before the end of this week - a deadline set by Mr Traub.
Agreement to such a compromise is likely to be seen as acknowledgment by VW
that it was at least partly at fault.
Rejection will result in a full open court hearing next month at which Mr
Lopez could be called to give evidence. He spent yesterday waiting in an
hotel near the court but was not summoned.
Criminal investigations are continuing into suspicions that he, Mr Gutierrez
and a further two of the seven people involved in yesterday's hearing stole
secret GM data before leaving for VW. A probe into possible perjury by Mr
Lopez is also under way.

BRAZIL'S mounting corruption scandal yesterday claimed its most senior
political figure when Mr Ibsen Pinheiro was forced to resign from the
country's constitutional revision team, writes Angus Foster in Sao Paulo.
President Itamar Franco also tried to restore credibility of the country's
institutions yesterday by ordering that anyone in an elected or official
post should reveal property and income before taking the job.
The measure, which also applies to acting members of the executive, congress
and judiciary, is the first time many elected and government officials will
be open to scrutiny. The law is expected to come into effect soon.
Mr Pinheiro, former president of Brazil's lower house of deputies and a
leader of the country's biggest political party, the Party of the Brazilian
Democratic Movement (PMDB), has denied any involvement in the corruption
scheme. The scandal is alleged to have involved up to 30 politicians and
ministers in illegal fees and other payments from the government's budget.

<TEXT>
CLASSIC ways of lifting France out of recession through a big boost in
public spending and a sharp cut in interest rates would not work in an
economy beset with such a high level of structural unemployment, the prime
minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, said yesterday.
Addressing a conference organised by the International Herald Tribune, Mr
Balladur was thus rejecting criticism, partly from within his own
parliamentary majority but also often echoed in the foreign exchange
markets, that his go-slow approach will prove politically untenable in the
face of lengthening dole queues.
Mr Balladur said that, given the openness of the French economy, the effect
on employment of policies designed simply to stimulate demand 'would at best
be negligible in the short term and unfavourable in the long term'. Spending
in the 1994 budget is due to rise by 1.1 per cent, or at half the predicted
inflation rate.
Equally, Mr Balladur ruled out trying to 'force' interest rates down, not
only because such a move would bring the franc down and inflation up, but
also because 'with companies so uncertain about demand and with significant
unused capacity . . . the impact on consumption and investment would be very
weak'.
In contrast to the government's first four months in office, in which French
interest rates were cut eight times independently of the Bundesbank, French
monetary policy now seems to be awaiting German action. Only half a million
of the 3.2m French now out of work had lost their jobs due to the cycle of
recession, Mr Balladur said. More than three quarters of France's
unemployment was due to the high cost and low qualification of French
labour, and to waste in the public sector.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (15): Cost of credit is still too high
after privatisation - Banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUPHORIA that followed the privatisation of Mexico's 18 state-owned
banks has come to an end.
Last year and the year before Mexico's business elite paid out Dollars
12.4bn for the banks - paying around 3.1 times book value - in the belief
that the economy would grow by at least 4 per cent a year, and the financial
sector by twice that.
The rosy forecasts have turned out to be too optimistic. The economy is
almost stagnant, loan losses have increased sharply, and the banks have had
to increase their provisions. Profitability, while still high by
international standards, has begun to fall, as measured by a return on
assets or equity.
The private sector, which had hoped privatisation would cut funding costs,
has complained about the persistently high spreads between lending and
borrowing. The government has responded by authorising nine new banks this
year, and seems set to authorise several more next year.
The troubles in the banking sector have already provoked a shake-out. Three
financial groups have merged: Banca Cremi and Banco Union, two multiregional
banks; Bancreser and Banoro, a multiregional and regional bank; and Afin and
Banorte, a brokerage and bank. Other mergers, or alliances are expected.
Bancomer and Banamex, Mexico's two largest banks, are undertaking sweeping
changes to make themselves more competitive. Mr Ricardo Guajardo, chief
executive of Bancomer, says Bancomer will reduce staff by 6,000 out of a
total of 40,000 this year, but net cuts will be deeper, because slow
economic growth has reduced by about half the numbers of new branch
openings.
The banks will face still more pressure next year when Mexico is expected to
allow foreign competition. If Nafta is agreed by the US Congress, US and
Canadian banks, and other foreign banks with subsidiaries in the US and
Canada, will be permitted to set up branches over 10 years. If Nafta is not
approved, Mexico will still open up, probably in the form of bilateral
investment treaties.
'It is in the interest of Mexico to have financial intermediaries from
abroad,' says Mr Guillermo Ortiz, the under-minister of finance in charge of
banking regulation. While foreigners are not expected to open many bank
branches, they will probably cherry-pick the most profitable segments in the
corporate and retail sector.
Under present law, foreigners in the aggregate are allowed up to 30 per cent
of a financial group, which may increase to 49 per cent under the new
foreign investment law. So far the Bank of Nova Scotia of Canada has taken a
5 per cent stake in Comermex-Inverlat; Spain's Banco Bilbao-Vizcaya a 20 per
cent stake in Mercantil-Pobursa; and Spain's Banco Central Hispano a 20 per
cent stake in Prime-Internacional.
The banks are in trouble largely because they have little experience in
lending to individuals and businesses. In the 1980s, the banks lent most of
their money to the public sector and hardly anything to the private sector.
Now the public sector has largely stopped borrowing, while credit to the
private sector has exploded - up 327 per cent from 1989 to 1992.
While spreads are higher on private-sector loans, so is the chance of
default. With the economy stagnant, growing numbers of companies and
individuals have stopped paying their debts. Net past due loans as a
promotion of net loans increased from 0.71 per cent in December 1991 to 4.37
per cent in June 1993.
The banks contend that the high rate of default forces them to keep interest
rate spreads high. Contrary to expectations, the Mexican bank's net interest
margin has increased since privatisation, from 5.61 per cent in 1991, to
6.56 per cent in June 1993.
Some steps are now being taken to help banks analyse risk more efficiently.
The government recently passed new laws that will allow banks to share the
credit history of customers. This should help them to avoid making loans to
customers with a history of default. A new national credit bureau, the
product of a joint venture between Mexican banks and specialist US credit
companies, is being set up. The banks are investing tens of millions of
dollars in improving computer systems.
The banks say that still further de-regulation is necessary before interest
spreads fall. Mr Roberto Hernandez, chief executive of Banamex, Mexico's
largest bank, urged the authorities at the Bankers Convention in September
to reduce obstacles to banks' use of derivatives, international emission of
peso bonds, and external funding.
'Foreign bankers are arriving in our country proposing schemes in a few days
that takes us several months to receive authorisation for,' he said. 'It is
urgent that the authorities allow the banks to act with more liberty in the
definition of operations, assets and liabilities.'
Mr Hernandez launched into an attack on Mexico's legal system, that he said
made it difficult to recover collateral. 'The implementation of justice is
not always agile and efficient,' he said. 'All kinds of subterfuges are used
to delay trials. The judicial processes frequently last for years. And when
they are resolved, the (bank) guarantees have lost significant value.'
Mr Guajardo of Bancomer complains that it can take three years or more to
win a settlement in the case of a mortgage default, and that the law is not
clear on ranking of creditors.
He says these problems can add 2.5 to 3 percentage points on the cost of
credit on mortgages and to small- and medium-sized businesses, and leads
banks to insist on more collateral when lending than in the past.
Mr Ortiz admits that deregulation has to go further. He says the government
will propose later this year new laws that should help a secondary mortgage
market develop, by removing restrictions on the transfer of property titles.
The government will also gradually loosen restrictions on Mexican bank's
participation in derivatives, once a correct capitalisation regime is in
place.
However, the government is worried about the capacity of banks to take risks
in an unregulated environment. It likes to remind those who favour more
aggressive deregulation, that four years ago Mexican banks were state-owned,
forced to lend to the public sector at subsidised interest rates, and
protected from foreign competition.

FT  10 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Inflation news fails to give
Dow lasting lift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
RETREATING bond prices and concern about passage of the North American Free
Trade Agreement through congress saw US stocks end mixed yesterday in spite
of posting solid early gains in the wake of surprisingly good inflation
news, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 7.83 down at 3,640.07, about 30
points below the day's high. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended just 0.12 up at
460.33, while the American SE composite lost 0.58 at 476.02, but the Nasdaq
composite gained 3.63 at 769.84. NYSE volume came to 276m shares.
Stocks rose from the opening, buoyed by a sharp rise in Treasury prices  -
during the morning the benchmark 30-year issue advanced more than a point
and the yield fell to 6.118 per cent - and good news on inflation, which
came in the form of a 0.2 per cent decline in the October producer prices
index. Analysts had been expecting a small increase in the PPI. There was
even better news in the form of the 'core' measure of the PPI (this excludes
the volatile food and energy components), which fell by 0.5 per cent last
month.
The surprisingly positive inflation figures not only lifted bond prices, but
also helped allay what ever fears equity investors might have had that the
Federal Reserve would be forced to put up interest rates to prevent a
resurgent economy from reigniting inflation.
Stocks stumbled during the afternoon, however, as bond prices began to
retreat from their highs following a disappointingly weak auction of new
three-year notes. Share prices were also undermined by growing concern about
the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The vice-president was due to debate with Nafta opponent Mr Ross Perot on US
television last night, and the markets remained worried that congress might
not vote to ratify the treaty next week.
News that RJR Nabisco is putting up cigarette prices by 4 cents a pack
raised hopes that the cigarette price war is over and boosted tobacco
stocks. RJR improved Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 6 3/4 in volume of 6m shares
and Philip Morris advanced Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 55 3/4 .
A broker's upgrade lifted Banc One Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 37 in active
trading. Smith Barney Shearson put out a buy recommendation on the stock.
Good quarterly earnings helped WalMart gain Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 28 3/4
and The Limited put on Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 20 3/8 . Motorola moved ahead
Dollars 1 to Dollars 99 3/4 on news that it has purchased a 20 per cent
stake in Nextel, the mobile communications service provider. Nextel climbed
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 47 1/4 on the Nasdaq market.
Canada
TORONTO stocks were solidly higher in extremely heavy trading. The TSE 300
index ended 34.9 up at 4,251.4, with advances leading declines by 435 to 345
after a record turnover of 105.2m shares.
Volume was swollen by 34.8m shares traded in Bramalea, which jumped 10 cents
to 48 cents. The company said it had not made any announcements which would
cause the increased activity in its shares, but reiterated that it is well
ahead of its cash flow targets for the fiscal year that ended last month.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: A little help from their
friends - Venezuela is using foreign investment to develop the nation's
petroleum industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Venezuela has announced a Dollars 45.8bn investment programme for its
petroleum industry over the next 10 years that stresses a substantial
increase in crude oil production capacity and the upgrading of oil
refineries to produce higher-quality products.
The plan, which was announced by Mr Gustavo Roosen, president of national
oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), assigns a key role to foreign
investment in Venezuela's oil and gas sectors for the first time since the
country nationalised all private oil companies in 1976.
Of the Dollars 48.5bn in projected capital spending, PDVSA plans to invest
Dollars 29.1bn or 60 per cent of the total directly, while private companies
 -mainly foreign investors - are expected to supply the remainder of about
Dollars 19.4bn. Groups such as Royal Dutch/Shell, Exxon, Conoco, Mitsubishi
and Total are already planning large joint-venture projects with PDVSA in
natural gas and heavy oil. And the Venezuelan oil company is actively
seeking new partners for a variety of other projects in oil exploration and
production, refining, petrochemicals and coal.
PDVSA ranks as one of the world's biggest oil companies; at the 1992
year-end it had 63.3bn barrels of crude oil reserves, the largest outside
the Middle East.
One of the main thrusts of the company's investment programme is to develop
crude oil production potential of 4m barrels per day (b/d) by 2002, up 1.1m
b/d from the current capacity of approximately 2.9m b/d.
New exploration work will be carried out in traditional oil production zones
and other areas, and PDVSA's goal is to raise proved reserves of crude oil
to 65bn barrels over the next decade, up 3 per cent from the current level.
International investors are becoming involved in PDVSA's plans through
operating agreements, production sharing and strategic associations.
Under operating agreements, private companies invest to develop production
of crude oil and natural gas in so-called 'marginal fields', or areas with
relatively small volumes of production that PDVSA does not wish to operate
directly. Investors do not own the oil and gas they produce but are
compensated according to production volume.
The first operating agreements were signed in 1992, and earlier this year
British Petroleum agreed to invest around Dollars 60m over the next three
years in a marginal oil field under a 20-year operating agreement.
Using a BP study, PDVSA has also identified sectors in eastern Venezuela
with strong prospects for large discoveries of light and medium-weight
crudes, which Venezuela needs to balance out its existing reserves, now
dominated by heavy crudes.
Next year, PDVSA plans to look for international partners who will assume
all the risks to develop these zones. If commercial quantities of oil are
discovered, PDVSA will share future production with the foreign partner.
Last August, PDVSA received congressional approval to move ahead with two
multi-billion dollar projects to produce and upgrade heavy oil. Conoco,
Total, Itochu and Marubeni are the international partners. The investors
plan to produce heavy and extra-heavy crude from Venezuela's Orinoco Belt (a
large reserve of heavy oil), and use delayed coking to convert it into
lighter-weight, higher-value crude for export. In addition, PDVSA, Shell,
Exxon and Mitsubishi are developing a Dollars 5.6bn project to produce
liquefied natural gas (LNG) for export.
In refining, PDVSA will complete upgrading projects at three of its home
refineries and raise crude processing capacity at these plants and Curacao -
where it leases a former Shell refinery from the government - from the
current level of 1.1m b/d to 1.2m b/d by 2002. That increase will be quite
small in volume terms but the company is investing heavily to upgrade and
modernise the refineries so that they can turn out high-quality,
increased-value, refined products, meeting tougher environmental standards
in the US and other markets.
PDVSA, which already owns, either wholly or jointly, large oil refining
operations in the US and Europe, plans to expand its overseas network
through the acquisition of new refining capacity. The company would not
comment on its acquisition plans, but executives said future marketing
efforts would focus on Latin America and Asia, as well as on expanding
market share in the Caribbean.
In developing their 10-year programme, PDVSA planners are assuming 2 per
cent annual growth in world energy demand during 1992-2002, with projected
demand for hydrocarbons reaching 76m b/d by 2002, up from consumption of 66m
b/d in 1990.
They also assume that potential demand for Venezuelan crude oil on
international markets will rise to about 3.6m b/d in 2002, and to 4.5m b/d
in 2010. Home demand for refined oil products is expected to grow at 2 per
cent a year.
Venezuela's crude oil production last year averaged 2.33m b/d, while exports
of crude and refined products averaged 2.1m b/d, with crude accounting for
1.43m b/d of the total.
A large share of the country's crude oil exports is processed at PDVSA
refineries in the US and Europe.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (23): Rich pickings for criminals -
Kidnapping has become increasingly common in the past year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON A Saturday in June Eduardo Creel, a successful Mexican banker, was
opening the gate to his country house, when two young men seized him, took
him to a nearby forest, chained him to a tree, and left him without food and
water.
Mr Creel was eventually released six days after his capture. What was
perhaps most unusual about the kidnapping was the small amount of the ransom
 -about Dollars 300,000, according to press reports. The kidnappers
apparently did not know that Mr Creel, who has just formed a new bank Grupo
Financiero del Sureste, could have afforded much more.
Kidnappings such as Mr Creel's have become increasingly common in Mexico in
the past year, as criminals have found it perhaps the easiest and quickest
way to make money fast. Epoca magazine cites an official report which
estimates at least 88 other Mexicans were kidnapped in the first seven
months this year for a total ransom of about Dollars 90m. This is almost
nine times more than the amount stolen in bank robberies last year.
In September alone, El Norte newspaper reported that Daniel Wong, a
businessmen from Tijuana, paid Dollars 700,000 for his release; Vicente
Robles Villa, a fruit farmer from Chihuahua, paid Dollars 400,000; Rodolfo
Gamboa, son of a prominent businessmen in Duranago, paid Dollars 600,000. It
is unclear whether two other businessmen kidnapped in September, Jorge
Morales from Cuernavaca, and Andres Castana have been freed.
The spate of kidnappings has started to worry Mexico's rich, who are among
the least security-conscious of Latin America's wealthy people. Now,
however, increasing numbers are beginning to hire bodyguards or take other
preventive measures. Even foreign businessmen, who up to now appear to have
been safe, are taking precautionary steps, according to Grupo Fairfax de
Mexico, the leading international security firm in Mexico.
'This year more than ever before people are starting to wake up,' says
Michael Hershman, president of Fairfax de Mexico. 'At the beginning, the
Mexican attitude was very macho. While it has not completely changed, we
have noticed people feeling vulnerable.' Fairfax says its personal security
business in Mexico has more than doubled in the past 18 months.
The problem is at its worse in rural states away from Mexico City, where
lawlessness and disparities in wealth have long made kidnapping a highly
attractive business. A long report in the El Norte newspaper cited some 183
kidnappings in the rural state of Michoacan alone last year, of which some
could have been drug or politically related.
Kidnapping has proven so lucrative mainly because of the low risk of being
caught, a result of police inefficiency and corruption. 'Once the criminals
are aware that you pay and that there is no follow-up organisation, then the
kidnappers are going to have a field day,' says Mr Hershman.
Under Mexican law, families do not have to inform the police of the
intention to pay a ransom, and such is the low esteem in which the Mexican
police is held, many do not tell. The effect is that unlike in say the US,
when the FBI is called in automatically in the event of a kidnapping, in
Mexico there is often little police follow-up, or investigation.
Police or former policemen are also believed to have been involved in many
kidnappings, according to a government official. The government attributes
this in part to its anti-corruption drive, that has led to hundreds of
senior policemen being fired. The rejected police have apparently used their
contacts, access to arms and intelligence, to protect or lead groups of
kidnappers.
Occasionally policemen have been arrested for kidnapping. Four policemen
have been detained for kidnapping Juan Cuevas Calderon, a car dealer, on
February 2. The policemen are alleged to have arrested the car dealer on
trumped up charges, but to have promised to release him if he paid about
Dollars 200,000. The car dealer reportedly finally gave them about Dollars
8,000, a car and a van. When free the car dealer reported them to higher
authorities, who then pressed charges.
Recently, there has been speculation that Mexican kidnappers have joined
forces with international groups, such as Central American guerrillas or
Basque terrorists. Two months ago a list of 150 rich Mexicans thought worthy
of kidnapping was found in Nicaragua beside an arms stash, believed to have
been left by a faction of the FMLN guerrilla group of El Salvador.
The list, published by the Nicaraguan newspaper Barricada, included several
Mexican billionaires such as Mr Emilio Azcarraga, the owner of Televisa, and
Mr Carlos Slim, the head of Telefonos de Mexico. The Mexican government took
it seriously and sent an official to Nicaragua to discuss it with the
interior ministry, according to Epoca.
There have been further rumours that the Basque terrorist organisation ETA
was behind the kidnapping of some rich Mexicans. While a government official
says there is no evidence of this, the international reach of some Mexican
kidnappers is impressive.
Two years ago Juan Gutierrez Cortina, the son of the owner of the private
construction company Gutsa, was kidnapped, and his brothers were sent to
Spain to receive instructions from the kidnappers, and then to Brazil to
make the Dollars 15m payment. Luckily for the family finances, Mr Guttierez
Cortina escaped just before the ransom was paid.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (22): Immigrants drawn to US in greater
numbers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICAN migration to the US shows little sign of falling significantly, in
spite of more border patrol agents, fences and other mechanisms to keep
immigrants out. According to the US Immigration and Naturalisation Service,
the number of immigrants apprehended along the border rose to 1,203,754 in
the 12 months to October 1993, from 1,146,698 in the same period the year
before. While such figures overstate the number of immigrants, since many
will be caught crossing several times, the Colegio de la Frontera, a leading
research institute in Tijuana, estimated around 300,000 immigrants illegally
entered the US last year from the border. The picture shows would-be
immigrants crossing the Rio Grande.
President Carlos Salinas likes to argue that Nafta will provide Mexicans
with jobs at home, and thus lower migration to the US. However, academic
evidence is unclear. The restructuring in Mexico's economy that is likely to
be wrought by Nafta may in the short term increase migration, especially
from the rural sector.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (21): Punishing agreement - Labour and
environmental accords
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE parallel agreements that form part of the proposed North American Free
Trade Agreement mark the first time a trade treaty requires member countries
to enforce their environmental and labour laws, and punishes them with fines
or sanctions if they do not.
The side agreements, which were proposed by Mr Bill Clinton when he was a
candidate for the US presidency, do not require countries to write new laws,
but simply to enforce those they have. They impose penalties on countries of
up to Dollars 20m - and if they are not paid, sanctions can be imposed -
that allow their companies to gain a competitive advantage by not complying
with existing environmental and labour regulations.
The agreements will formally apply to all three members of Nafta, (although
Canada will not be liable for sanctions) but were negotiated to persuade
wavering Democrats in the US Congress to support Nafta. They had opposed the
treaty partly on the grounds that Mexico would take jobs from the US by
exploiting its labour, and providing a haven for polluting factories.
While going further than any previous trade treaty, the accords fall short
of what most critics of Nafta wanted, and have failed to win over many
converts to the treaty.
Critics complain that under the accords the process of imposing fines on
member countries is long and cumbersome; that only governments, rather than
pressure groups, are empowered to initiate investigations into lack of
compliance; and that the powers of the labour commission are deficient.
Even supporters of the trade pact agree that the main intention of the side
accords is to promote co-operation, rather than compel through sanctions the
enforcement of all laws. None of the three countries, including the US, was
prepared to give up sovereignty that supra-national enforcement would have
required.
The accords create a tri-national Environmental and a tri-national Labour
Commission, both of which comprise a Council (made up of three ministers),
and a professional secretariat of staff members, which is partly protected
from interference from the national governments.
If a complaint has been made about non-enforcement of environment, the
environmental council has to vote by majority to convene an arbitration
panel of five independent members to decide if there has been a 'persistent
pattern of failure' to enforce the relevant regulations.
The arbitration panel has to issue a final report and make recommendations
within about eight months. If the panel's recommendations are ignored, the
panel can fine the offending nation, if the non-enforcement is
trade-related. If the fines are ignored for another six months, the
complaining country can impose sanctions on the country (in the case of
Mexico and the US) or take it to court (in the case of Canada).
The process is even more long-winded for violations of specified labour
rights. For, while the original intention was to have symmetrical labour and
environmental accords, the provisions on labour are weaker than those on
environment.
The failure to enforce all environmental laws is subject to fines and
sanctions, but with labour, penalties are limited only to failure to enforce
minimum wages, safety standards, and child labour laws. The North American
Labour Commission is limited to a staff of 15, whereas there is no limit on
the Environmental Comm-ission.
The environmental agree-ment allows all information to be used in findings,
whereas the labour agreement only allows publicly available information from
governments to be submitted.
The impact of the labour side accord could be significant, if Mexican
enforcement was stepped up as a result. While Mexico's minimum wage laws are
in effect enforced by the market place, child labour is widespread in Mexico
 -according to the estimate of the 1990 census there were 418,575 workers
between the ages of 12 and 14. Likewise, factories, especially small ones,
routinely ignore health and safety standards, and could probably not remain
in business if they had to comply with all the existing laws.
Nevertheless, US unions have complained that the labour side accord fails to
address violations of the right to strike and the right to choose
independently a union - such violations, they say, keeps Mexican wages down
to artificially low levels. Mexico's minimum wage is about Dollars 4.20 a
day, and the registered average wage Dollars 12.50 a day.
The Mexican government has wide powers to interpret labour law to its
advantage. The government is closely allied with the official Confederation
of Mexican Workers, headed by non-agenarian labour leader Fidel Velazquez,
and the two have worked together to make sure no break-away union acquires
too much power, and undoes the official wage and price policy.
Last year unions announced plans to strike 6,814 times, but only about 140
resulted in plant shutdowns. In a not unusual example, a strike at
Volkswagen car plant was declared illegal by the (government-controlled)
Federal Labour Board, even though a majority of workers had voted in favour
of the strike. A labour leader in the border city of Matamoros that has
urged workers to strike for higher wages, was arrested for not paying his
taxes, and the strike called off.
Ironically, Mexican labour laws go much further than US laws in defending
labour rights - guaranteeing the right to annual leave, profit sharing,
three months maternity leave, generous severance payments and in disallowing
factories from replacing striking workers. But the laws are so complex, that
full compliance is difficult.
By forcing Mexican companies to compete under free trade, Nafta may in fact
lead the Mexican government to reform the labour law, and strip some of the
legal protections offered to workers. Government officials and businessmen
argue that the labour law over-regulates the labour market, and is an
obstacle to productivity.
The environmental accord is tougher than the labour one, partly because
environ-mentalists were closely involved in drawing up the drafts to the
accord.
There was also a greater willingness on behalf of Mexico and Canada to make
concess-ions in the environment, a politically and economically less
sensitive area than the labour market.
The Mexican government has been stepping up its enforcement of environmental
laws lately, but independent reports suggest there is much to be done.
A study released last year by the US General Accounting Office found that
none of six in-bond plants that were questioned along the US-Mexican border
had complied with the necessary Environmental Impact Statement before
setting up their factories.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (20): Change on the land - for good or ill
 -Twenty-two per cent of the economically-active produce just 8 per cent of
GDP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER

<TEXT>
FEW, if any, parts of the Mexican economy have been as subject to as much
reform in the past four years as the agricultural sector. Since 1989 the
government has eliminated almost all indirect subsidies, allowed more than
half the farmers to sell their land for the first time, ended land reform,
and, more recently, announced the removal of price supports for basic
grains.
Mexico's farmers have not yet seen much benefit. The agricultural sector
grew by an annual 1.7 per cent in the four years to 1992, well below the
average for the rest of the economy. The agricultural trade deficit has more
than tripled. And hundreds of thousands of farmers have been left bankrupt
after borrowing too much money.
While critics charge that the crisis is proof enough that the reforms have
failed, the government says the old system of supporting agriculture did not
help Mexico's poorer farmers, and was prohibitively expensive. The new
system, it says, will in time offer those who survive the shake-out a better
standard of living.
'The reforms represent a profound transformation of Mexico's agriculture
sector,' says Dr Arturo Warman, the government's Agrarian Attorney, 'but you
cannot confuse them with an immediate solution. The changes open the
possibility of a new development.'
Mr Warman argues that the agricultural sector has been in crisis since 1965,
and that the reforms have not made things much worse. Instead he and other
officials point to bad weather, low international prices, and, above all,
structural problems in the sector that date back to the populist
agricultural redistribution policies of the 1930s as the principal causes of
the current troubles.
The government contends that Mexico's perpetual commitment to land reform
and uncertain rules over ownership - which were reversed two years ago -
made farms too small to compete in world markets, and deterred private
investment. Years of protection meant farmers did not have to learn how to
sell their crops to foreign markets. Poorly directed subsidies in credit,
fertilisers and insurance made some farmers better off, but left the vast
majority in poverty.
The extent of the present problems are partly concealed by rapid growth in
production of crops, such as corns and beans, that until now have been
protected from imports. From 1989 to 1992 the production (measured in value)
of corn increased by 52.8 per cent in real terms, and beans by 21 per cent.
However, production of unprotected crops has nose-dived; rice production
fell 19.6 per cent, soya by 40 per cent, and cotton by 80 per cent in the
same period.
On October 4 the government announced a radical new agricultural programme
that would scrap price supports, and instead subsidise farmers according to
how much land they own. The intention was to end discrimination in favour of
basic grain production, which because of the increase in output of protected
crops, was becoming increasingly expensive, and contributing to the decline
of the unprotected sector.
The programme, known as Procampo, breaks the link between subsidies and
production, since a farmer will receive the same amount of aid whatever and
however much he produces. It thus ends Mexico's long-term commitment to
self-sufficiency in food, since output will in the future vary according to
changes in international prices, and domestic costs.
Procampo will eventually pay the 3.3m farmers who were producing subsidised
crops between 400 pesos and 900 pesos for each hectare of land they
cultivate, depending on the average productivity of the land. The subsidies
will be phased in over the next two years at the same time as price supports
are removed, and the market opened to imports.
At present the government pays farmers about 750 pesos for a tonne of corn
and pays another 160 pesos in transport and commercialisation costs. The
international price plus delivery is about 450 pesos, the same average price
Mexican consumers pay.
The programme makes redundant Mexico's commitment under the North American
Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) to allow US and Canadian corn exports without
restrictions within 15 years, since Mexico will now open up unilaterally in
two years.
The scheme should encourage farmers to switch some production from formerly
protected corn to export crops such as fruit and vegetables, and may arrest
the decline in cotton, rice and other products subject to international
competition. The diversification into value-added crops may be given a
further boost by Nafta, which, if approved by the US Congress, would
eventually remove US tariff and non-tariff barriers to such Mexican exports.
Even without Nafta, exports of value-added products have surged in the past
decade, taking advantage of the good climate in northern Mexico, its cheap
labour force, and its proximity to the US. From 1980 to 1991 strawberry
production increased by 420 per cent, tomato production by 57 per cent and
melon production by 80 per cent.
Procampo will have an important distributive impact in favour of the poor
farmers in the south and centre of Mexico - one of the stated reasons the
government is to go ahead with the reform. But it will also put cash in the
hands of farmers a few months before next August's president election, and
has thus been attacked as an attempt to buy votes.
The average farmer in the rich northern state of Sinaloa produces six tonnes
of maize per hectare, giving him, under the price support scheme, an
equivalent subsidy of about 2,760 pesos per hectare - considerably less than
the 900 pesos or so he will receive with Procampo.
However, the average farmer in the southern state of Oaxaca produces less
than two tonnes per hectare, most of which he consumes, so that he hardly
benefits at all from the price subsidy. He will gain at least 400 pesos per
hectare from Procampo.
By injecting more than Dollars 3.7bn of cash subsidies into the rural sector
every year, Procampo will give farmers money to improve quality of their
land, and produce more profitable crops. With banks unwilling to lend to
farmers because of the lack of guarantees in case of default, the land
subsidy gives farmers a future cash payment that they can swap in return for
credit.
Not even the government contends that Procampo will solve Mexico's
agricultural problems overnight. It admits it may in the long-run contribute
to further decline in the sector. Many producers of corn and beans will not
make a living selling crops at international prices, and will have to
convert their land into non-agricultural use.
Some recent studies by academic economists suggest that as many as 700,000
farmers could be forced out of work by full liberalisation of corn prices.
While offering direct subsidies will soften the blow of price
liberalisation, one official says: 'In the end we will have fewer people
working in agriculture as a proportion of total employment. You cannot
expect to improve the standard of living in the countryside, when you have
22 per cent of the economically-active nation producing just 8 per cent of
GDP.'
The implementation of Procampo is also likely to be difficult. 'Procampo
sounds good on paper,' says one government official, 'but sometimes I wonder
how it is going to work in practice.' The possibility of corruption is high,
since the government will have to dole out cash payments to 3.3m farmers in
a short period of time.
The reform of the ejidos (communal land) will accelerate migration from the
countryside. The reforms allow ejido farmers to sell their land, if a
sufficient majority in the farm agree to do so, or rent it out. The changes
also make it a lot easier for ejido farmers to enter into joint ventures
with businesses, and formally end more than 50 years of continuous land
reform.
The changes have not yet had the impact hoped for, partly because the
certification of land titles has been much slower than many expected. As
part of the reform, the government agreed to certify land titles to about
102m hectares of land, about half of Mexico. Ejido land cannot be legally
sold or rented out, and access to bank loans is difficult, until the land
title is certified.
The process has gone more slowly than some had hoped for, and the first
title was only given out in August. Dr Warman says the programme of
certification will not be finished until 1996 or 1997.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (19): Government plans a sea change - The
country's ports are due for a transformation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR A country bordering on the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, Mexico's ports
play a surprisingly small part in the nation's economy.
Mexico's three largest cities - Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey -
are all land-locked, and almost all internal trade goes by road or train.
The US ports at Los Angeles and Long Beach handle more of Mexico's trade
with Asia than any Mexican competitor, and that at Houston handles most of
the trade between the industrial north-east of Mexico and Europe.
The Mexican government now hopes to change this. It is in the process of
privatising the 22 principal ports, and is confident private capital and
better management will transform the ports' fortunes. This would not only
boost Mexico's exports and its ability to compete in the world economy, but
would take some off the strain off Mexico's over-burdened roads and
railways.
The port privatisation is part of a co-ordinated effort by the Mexican
government to bring private capital into public infrastructure, and improve
communications across the country. Poor communications is considered by the
government and the private sector as one of the critical constraints on
economic growth, especially for the underdeveloped southern part of the
country.
The government has already built more than 4,000km of toll roads at a cost
to private investors of more than Dollars 10bn. It is planning later this
year to pass new laws that would allow privately-run airports and trains. It
is keen to have foreigners investing in new projects, either directly or by
buying bonds that are backed by future revenues from them.
The toll road programme has now run into trouble, and no new road
concessions are being awarded, mainly because of insufficient domestic
capital, and high tolls on existing roads that have deterred users. The lack
of new road construction could hurt the port privatisation, since investors
may be unwilling to bid for a port if it is not well-connected to Mexico's
main cities.
Under the new port law, the government envisages three separate groups of
private companies taking part in each port. One group will be akin to a US
port authority and acts as a sort of port landlord, charging ships and
terminal operators rent for use of the port space; a second will build and
operate private terminals and other physical facilities; and a third manage
general port services (such as moving cargo or towing ships).
Mr Jaime Corredor, the top government port official, believes the first port
authority concessions will be sold by the end of this year in competitive
auctions, and the remainder by next. Under the law foreigners can earn up to
49 per cent of a port authority.
Meanwhile, the government is awarding concessions to the private sector to
build new terminals and run basic services, and will sell off concessions to
existing terminals later in the year. There are no foreign limitations on
investments in terminals.
The law would mark a sharp break with present practice. Mexico's principal
ports have been run out of Mexico City by a single centralised state
authority. That meant there was no competition between the ports, and plenty
of cross-subsidies between the profitable and loss-making ones. Given the
shortage of public money, port equipment was often out of date, and
inadequate.
'The new regime will allow competition both between and within ports,
significantly increasing productivity,' says Mr Corredor.
While private companies have for a while been able to build their own
terminals within a port, and manage some port operations, such companies
were often effectively controlled by port unions, notorious in Mexico for
corruption and restrictive practices.
In the first tentative step to privatisation, the government took over the
Veracruz port some two years ago in a midnight raid, broke up the corrupt
union, and handed over most operations to three competing private companies.
Since then productivity has surged ahead, and the port handled about 6.4m
tonnes of the cargo last year, 23 per cent more than 1991, according to
Angel Gonzalez Rul, the delegate at Veracruz port.
The new law expects to draw from the Veracruz success, since it removes
exclusivity contracts enjoyed by unions, says Mr Corredor. The law gives
investors in terminals freedom to manage their operations and hire their own
workers. Unlike the past, several companies will compete with each other
when offering basic port services, reducing the power of any group of
workers.
In mid-August the government awarded 27 concessions to the private sector to
build cement, grain and car terminals in ports around the country. The
companies included the German chemicals giant BASF, Nissan of Mexico, and
Apasco, the Mexican arm of the Swiss cement company Holderbank.
Such investment is badly needed, but may not affect one of the greatest
constraints on Mexico's ports - poor communications with the rest of the
country.
At Veracruz, cargo at the port often waits for days because there are not
enough trains to take the goods to Mexico City, says Jaime Sanchez Diez,
head of Operadora Portuaria del Golfo, one of the private operating
companies in Veracruz.
Mexico's railways remain in public hands, and have suffered from government
cuts in public investment over the past decade. In apparent recognition that
improving ports without touching railways may not take Mexico very far, the
government is expected to change the constitution later this year that would
permit some form of railway privatisation.
The improvement in Mexico's ports will have to involve reforms of the custom
clearances if they are to be competitive, says an executive at
Transportacion Maritima Mexicana (TMM), Mexico's largest shipping company.
He says that while 'while the privatisation measure is very good as it is,
it is not sufficient. Mexico's customs clearance is overly complicated and
discriminates against shipping.'
TMM complains that while trains coming from the US frequently do not have to
stop for clearance until they reach their final destination in Mexico, ships
are checked immediately and laboriously. This can hold up shipped cargo, and
given the long and complicated Mexican custom procedures, add significantly
to costs. The TMM executive says it can take 18 days for cargo to reach
Mexico City by port from the north-west port of Manzanillo, and just 13 days
by train from the north-west border.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (17): Skilful political negotiator - Diego
Fernandez de Cevallos
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DIEGO FERNANDEZ DE CEVALLOS looks more like an Old Testament prophet than
the presidential candidate of Mexico's centre-right opposition party.
He is tall and erect, sports a long and sometimes shaggy beard, and has a
booming voice. He happily pontificates on religion, the spiritual renewal of
Mexico and the moral responsibilities of a politician, but has few specific
suggestions on what he would do were he elected.
When arriving late for an interview, he explains that he has been legally
recognising an illegitimate son he never knew about. A Jesuit-educated
practising Catholic, Mr Fernandez de Cevallos had, by his own admission, a
wild youth before discovering marriage.
His messianic manner disguises a skilful political negotiator who has worked
his way up the National Action Party to become the party's leader in the
Chamber of Deputies. He is backed for presidential candidate by almost all
the leading figures in the PAN.
He owes his position partly to luck and some skilful political manoeuvring.
All the well-known national leaders of the PAN, such as the governors of
Baja California and Chihuahua, decided not to run some time ago. The other
main contender, Mr Vicente Fox is the son of a Spanish-born parent, and thus
inadmissible under Article 82 of constitution.
As the party's top official in Congress, he has become leader of the PAN's
conciliatory wing that supports close co-operation with the Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI). He almost single-handedly negotiated with the PRI
the political reforms, which while approved by the PAN, were opposed by the
Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD).
His negotiations with PRI have been long criticised by those in the PAN who
argue the party should be more confrontational in the fight for democracy.
Last year several leading members of the PAN - including a former
presidential candidate and head of the party - resigned, complaining that
'the party has not acted as the opposition but as one more sector of the
system'.
His candidacy is widely considered a boost to the fortunes of the much
better known Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, of the PRD. While the PAN is better
organised than the PRD, and electorally more successful, Mr Fernandez de
Cevallos is hardly recognised outside political circles in Mexico City, and
his public support for the government may put off those wanting to register
a protest vote against the PRI.
He has modest campaign experience, and his patrician, eccentric manner,
might alienate some ordinary Mexicans. So far he has been inept at handling
the press.
Far from being defensive about his good relations with the government, Mr
Fernandez de Cevallos cheerfully describes President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari as the best president Mexico has had. He hangs in his office a
signed photograph of Mexico's former interior minister Fernando Gutierrez de
Barrios, a stalwart member of the ruling PRI.
Mr Fernandez de Cevallos says that by negotiating with the PRI, the PAN has
extracted important concessions. Under the recently passed electoral reform,
the PRI agreed to long-standing PAN demands - namely, to open up the Senate
to opposition parties, make electoral bodies more independent of the
government, and cap campaign spending.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (16): The men who would be president - A
look at the strengths and weaknesses of the likely foursome awaiting the
final word from President Carlos Salinas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE next two months Mexico's ruling party will unveil the candidate to
succeed President Carlos Salinas.
The chosen man will, in all likelihood, win next August's presidential
election. If the past is any guide, he will rule Mexico with unfettered
power for the next six years.
While the decision is nominally that of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI), Mr Salinas is expected to anoint his own
successor, just as all his predecessors have done. The PRI will then
formally nominate the chosen candidate.
So far President Salinas has allowed three candidates to emerge as
front-runners; Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the social development minister, and
the favourite; Mr Manuel Camacho, the mayor of Mexico City; Mr Pedro Aspe,
the finance minister. Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the education minister, a fourth
candidate, is considered the dark horse, but with an outside chance.
The candidates share much in common: they are all in their 40s, were
educated at US graduate schools in economics or public administration,
worked under Mr Salinas in the budget ministry in the mid-1980s, and played
an important part in the reforms of the past five years. Whoever wins is
likely to appoint a cabinet reasonably similar to the present one.
On the economic front, all candidates will offer some continuity with the
Salinas policies. As Manuel Camacho, perhaps the candidate least identified
with Mr Salinas's economic reforms, says: 'The economic changes are here to
stay. No-one would overturn them.'
Since candidates publicly support everything the president does, no-one can
be sure how they will behave if elected to the top office - and in the past
most predictions of presidential performance have been far from accurate.
Nevertheless supporters of each candidate have been busy defining the
differences between their boss and the rivals, in an effort to sway
political opinion behind their preferred choice.
Mr Aspe is seen alternatively as a powerful advocate of economic reform with
an ability to make tough decisions, and as politically inexperienced and out
of touch with Mexico. Mr Camacho is viewed by supporters as the candidate of
democracy, the man who can bring legitimacy to the political system, and by
rivals as a dangerous populist with no experience in economic
administration.
Mr Colosio is the self-styled candidate of continuity and decentralisation.
But opponents question his achievements to date, and ask if he is clever
enough to run the country.
The public defining of candidates is considered important, because each has
to be seen to be credible before becoming eligible for the presidency. He
has to enjoy some support within the PRI or political classes - especially
after 1987, when the ruling party split over Mr Salinas's candidacy.
The views of the business and labour sectors, foreign investors and the US,
even perhaps the army, have to be taken into account. More so than in the
past, the candidate's public appeal needs to be considered. A convincing,
legitimate victory next August would help erase the memory of 1988's
fraud-tainted result, and give Mexico's political system some much needed
legitimacy.
However, the final word in the past has been the president's. His power is
such that he can always rescue a candidate who is in trouble, by praising
him in public, inviting him on a trip, or, as happened to Mr Camacho
recently, to lunch in a public canteen. Conversely, a candidate that falls
out of presidential favour, often finds himself losing support with one
group or another, and being considered unsuitable.
Even a candidate with little rapport with the public would still be favoured
to win next August's election. After 64 continuous years in power, the PRI
enjoys huge advantages relative to other parties in terms of resources and
control over the media.
The president of the PRI has said that the nomination will be made in
January, but Mr Salinas may not be able to wait that long. The uncertainty
is already driving many members of the government frantic, and the
in-fighting between rivals is hurting the administration.
There are widely assumed to be three possible scenarios for the date. The
most likely is between November 17, the date of the vote on the North
American Free Trade Agreement, and December 12, when President Salinas goes
off on a 10-day trip to Asia. It is thought unlikely the president would
leave the country for 10 days without having cleared uncertainties over the
succession. The losing candidates could be invited with the president on the
Asian visit, keeping them from stirring up trouble.
The president could decide to choose the candidate before the vote on Nafta,
although this is considered unlikely. While this would have the attraction
of reducing uncertainty associated with the Nafta vote, an unveiling before
Nafta would take power from the president when he may need it most.
Finally, the president could stick to the original programme, and wait until
after his Asian visit, or even after the New Year. This would break with
past practice of selecting a candidate at least nine months before the
election.
Pedro Aspe
Mr Aspe's claims lie in the economic realm largely because as finance
minister he is given credit for economic stability, and Mexico's return to
favour in international capital markets. He is likely to be supported by
businessmen, foreign investors, some old-style politicians in the PRI that
approve of his strong hand in implementing policies, and members of the
centre-right Party of National Action estranged from their candidate.
As president, Mr Aspe is expected to press ahead with structural economic
reform. Colleagues say he would be likely to overhaul the social security
system, change labour laws to make them more flexible, and instigate a
thorough shake-up of the legal system. The Salinas-inspired reforms in
education, agriculture and commercial de-regulation would be deepened.
His supporters say he would guarantee macro-economic stability and offer the
most attractive economic environment for foreign investors. Says a colleague
of the finance minister: 'Mexico will need a huge amount of foreign
resources to grow by 5-6 per cent a year - around Dollars 20bn-Dollars 30bn
a year . . . We will only get that with a 100 per cent record in
macroeconomic performance . . . We cannot deviate one single inch from
macroeconomic orthodoxy - if we (deviate) the money will not be there.'
Mr Aspe in recent speeches has been emphasising the social aspects of
economic reform. His newly published book, Economic transformation: the
Mexican Way, makes the case over and over again that economic liberalisation
releases money for anti-poverty programmes, and increases opportunities for
people from all backgrounds.
Mr Aspe's perceived weakness is lack of political experience, a certain
patrician air borne from his aristocratic background, and identification for
austere economic policies that have left many Mexicans worse off. He is seen
by some as too pro-American, too unwilling to make concessions to
politically important interest groups. He is not personally close to Mr
Salinas's circle of friends, who may not fully trust him.
In a difficult economic situation this could spell trouble. Mr Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas is likely to focus the electoral campaign around the costs of
economic stabilisation, the concentration of wealth under the Salinas
administration, and the sacrifice of sovereignty in the process of
negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. As the architect of
economic policy, Mr Aspe is identified with all these policies.
Manuel Camacho
Mr Camacho, the son of an army general, an old university friend of Mr
Salinas, and former political science professor, is at the other end of the
spectrum. He has a keen sense of Mexico's national identity, as mayor of
Mexico City is not associated with Nafta, and has good relations with the
Mexican left.
He would try to strike some kind of pact with Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the
candidate of the left, that could ensure a fair and transparent election.
Mr Camacho clearly sees this as the issue of the day. He stresses that
'legitimacy is something very important in the consolidation of our
changes'. He is widely reported to have pushed for more far-reaching
political reforms than those passed by the PRI, in the hope of winning
approval for them from Mr Cardenas.
He says recent moves to censor Mr Cardenas from radio stations 'were
political errors' and that it is essential the elections next year are
peaceful and calm.
But even his own team is nervous over how financial markets would react to
his candidacy.
His economic policy would look after those who have not done so well under
the Salinas presidency. He refers to an 'industrial and agricultural policy
that would protect employment'. He is said to find economics boring.
Mr Camacho also has important enemies. He is not close to Mr Jose Cordoba,
the president's powerful chief of staff, to the old-style politicians who
distrust his conciliatory approach to the opposition, nor to the technocrats
in the finance ministry, and other government departments.
Mr Camacho's colleagues are aware of these weaknesses. They talk about an
(improbable) alliance with Mr Aspe - just as some in the Aspe team talk
about an alliance with Mr Camacho. They say that an independent central
bank, and Nafta, make his economic inexperience less important. They go to
great pains to stress aspects of his economic record while mayor of Mexico
City - Mr Camacho has balanced the budget, privatised urban services such as
water, and presided over a property surge.
Mr Camacho himself says: 'Investors will come to a country with peace and
tranquility' and with a 'policy of national development'. In his view
economic and political reforms of the Salinas presidency will make the job
of governing Mexico much more difficult in the future. 'Politics in Mexico
is going to demand more abilities and democratic skills,' he says, hinting
that he is the person to manage such a process.
Luis Donaldo Colosio
Mr Colosio is seen as offering a bit of Mr Camacho and Mr Aspe, and perhaps
for this reason is viewed as the favourite. While his friendship with Mr
Salinas is relatively new, he is believed to be totally loyal to the
president. He is the only candidate to have held elective office, as a
deputy and then senator.
As head of the PRI for three years, it is assumed he would carry the party
without difficulty. His two years in the social development ministry, which
runs the president's anti-poverty programme, Solidarity, has given him an
opportunity to travel around the country, and enabled him to build up
friends and allies.
Mr Colosio talks about the need for greater decentralisation in Mexico, and
giving more power to the states. He says municipalities have to modernise
their source of income, and points out that property tax is just 0.002 per
cent of GDP, 'which has to be raised'. He believes that reforms of the past
10 years have to be continued at a state level, with each state pursuing
deregulation in the way the federal government has.
The theme of regionalisation goes down well with Mexico's governors and
local politicians, and is consistent with Mr Colosio's roots. He only
arrived in Mexico City from a cattle ranch in Magdelena, Sonora, in his
mid-20s (after passing through the University of Pennsylvania and Vienna,
Austria), and so his view of Mexico may not quite as fixed on the capital as
are the viewpoints of the other candidates.
Mr Colosio's team says he would 'guarantee absolute continuity' in economic
reforms. He would delegate to cabinet colleagues such as Jaime Serra Puche,
the trade minister, and Mr Zedillo. He is expected to protect Mr Cordoba. He
has good relations with influential businessmen who have done well during
the Salinas presidency.
Mr Colosio says economic orthodoxy is vital. 'In the decade of the 1990s
there will be a great competition for capital. We cannot forget that.' He
adds: 'You have to know what are Mexico's advantages to investors . . . You
cannot have a man on the side managing the economy.'
But rivals say his views are vague, his accomplishments as minister
unimpressive, and they do not regard him as articulate or intellectually
able. They say he hardly ever speaks in economic cabinet, and conclude he
has no opinions worth mentioning. While Mr Camacho and Mr Aspe have
published articles on Mexico's economic or political situation, Mr Colosio
has never written anything memorable.
'Mr Colosio may be smart, but it is a huge mystery what he believes in,'
says one government minister. 'Isn't it worrying that he has no enemies? At
his level you should be taking difficult decisions that cost you support.'
His main enemies are in Mr Cardenas's party, who suspect him of hard-line
political instincts, and of having opposed more fundamental political
reforms.
The Colosio supporters flatly deny this. They said their candidate was not
involved in negotiations over political reform, and would favour an
electoral pact with Mr Cardenas in the right circumstances, and television
debates. They say their candidate would promote further reform of the PRI
were he president.
Ernesto Zedillo
Mr Zedillo's chances are considered low, but he has the right economic
credentials for the job, and presumed support of Mr Cordoba. A former
central banker, with an economics PhD from Yale, he is seen as dry and
cautious. Last year's storm over new history textbooks revealed his
political inexperience, and perhaps more importantly, a lack of friends to
come to his rescue. The books were widely criticised for being overly
partial to Mr Salinas and betraying the spirit of Mexico's revolution, and
finally had to be withdrawn.
The final choice of candidate will depend in part on what Mr Salinas
believes are Mexico's most urgent problems. Mr Aspe could be favoured if
further economic reform and macroeconomic stability were considered
essential; Mr Camacho, if a legitimate and convincing electoral defeat of
the left and further democratic reforms were deemed necessary; Mr Colosio,
if, as many believe, the president is looking for personal loyalty,
pragmatism and continuity with present policies of steady economic reform
and cautious political changes.
The vote on Nafta could affect the decision, but in no obvious way. On the
one hand, Nafta's rejection makes a candidate's economic abilities more
important, since future economic policy is no longer guaranteed by the
treaty. On the other hand Nafta's rejection would make the economic
situation difficult, the electoral campaign closer, and put a premium on a
candidate with good political skills.
Mr Salinas could still spring a surprise, and name one of the dark horses,
or throw up the selection to the PRI. Some members of the PRI might even
refuse to support the chosen candidate. But the overwhelming likelihood is
that the party will rally around the chosen candidate, who will bring into
his fold some of the erstwhile rivals.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (18): The nearly man of 1988 - Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE unlikely event that the Institutional Revolutionary Party does not
provide the next president, the man most likely to be head of state is Mr
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. He bears the surname of the man who remains one of the
country's most revered presidents: his father Lazaro, who nationalised the
oil industry. In a political elite dominated by the descendants of the
Spanish, Mr Cardenas is clearly of Indian stock - a tremendous electoral
asset in this predominantly mestizo country.
Mr Cardenas was narrowly defeated in the fraud-marred 1988 elections which
brought President Carlos Salinas to power, and believes he was cheated of
victory.
The level of animosity between the president and Mr Cardenas is high: the
latter can barely bring himself to mention the president's name. The rise of
Mr Salinas and the technocrats in the PRI during the 1980s spelt an end to
Mr Cardenas's political career in the ruling party. As a result, he and
others defected to present a left-of-centre alternative to the increasing
market orientation of the PRI.
Yet after his being so close to victory in 1988, Mr Cardenas's Party of the
Democratic Revolution (PRD), has performed badly. It made a poor showing in
the 1991 elections and received a blow in losing to the PRI the state of
Michoacan. There has also been internecine squabbling and its ability to
deliver votes may have suffered.
Despite these losses, Mr Cardenas and the party have played an important
role as a goad to the administration, putting pressure on the government to
open the political system and improve the conduct of elections. This has
been partly successful, even though Mr Cardenas himself dismisses the
administration's reforms as a 'backward step'. The access of government and
the opposition to the media remains heavily loaded against the opposition:
Mr Cardenas was interviewed by Televisa, Mexico's biggest private television
network, last month for the first time in five years.
While publicly condemning the government, Mr Cardenas received the minister
of interior, Mr Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido, to talk over electoral reforms.
The talks concentrated on attempts to ensure that independent individuals -
rather than, as Mr Cardenas would see them, PRI apparatchiks - were
appointed to the electoral commissions overseeing the elections at federal
and state level. The fact that they failed means almost certainly that,
should Mr Cardenas lose, he will refuse to accept the victory of the PRI as
legitimate.
Nonetheless, Mr Cardenas is as aware as anyone that the world has changed
significantly since 1988. He has toned down his anti-US rhetoric and has
been careful in his comments about the North American Free Trade Agreement.
'We have good relations with all countries, including the US,' he said in an
interview.
He did, however, make the point that Nafta has been negotiated on the
assumption that the three economies are equal. In fact, Mexico's economy
needs greater support because it is demonstrably weaker than that of the US
and Canada.
He was critical of the administration's economic policies, saying they have
resulted in unemployment and a fall in living standards. 'Where are the
results of the great economic project?. We have a concentration of economic
power, weak growth, a growing current account deficit and a fragile economic
situation.
'It's not sufficient to leave all this to the forces of the market,' he
said. Investment should be oriented 'to the key sectors of the economy',
which could be done both through the private and the public sector, in the
latter case, for example, using existing state development banks. On
privatisation, he said: 'We see neither privatisation nor nationalisation as
ideological questions.'
However, he added that the transparency of some of the Salinas
administration's privatisations was in doubt, and his government would
examine the propriety of the sales to see if action was necessary.
The country's foreign debt remains a problem, he said. 'We have to
renegotiate the debt which remains too heavy a burden for the economy.'
Mr Cardenas has yet to gain much headway in the opinion polls. Nonetheless,
the campaign has hardly begun. If as expected, the right-of-centre PAN puts
up a weak presidential candidate, Mr Cardenas could once again expect to be
the focus of the protest vote against the government.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (14): Hopes for an upgrade in rating - A
look at the investor view of an emerging market that is growing up fast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB

<TEXT>
FOR AN emerging market, Mexico is growing up fast.
International investors have had a wide array of Mexican equity offerings
and high-yielding bond issues from which to pick and choose for their Latin
American portfolios over the past couple of years. And as a further sign of
'maturity', those Mexican companies which have come into close contact with
the international investor fraternity have taken steps to improve the
quality of information they provide.
Now, investors are holding their breath for a decision on the North American
Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), which the optimists believe will eventually be
passed by the US Congress. Once Nafta is out of the way, Mexico could well
see its credit rating - a sensitive indicator of a country's standing in the
eyes of the international investor community - raised from speculative to
investment grade.
Hopes of a rating upgrade have already helped to underpin the performance of
Mexican bonds: if and when an upgrading eventually happens, a far wider
range of investors will be able or more willing to invest in Mexican debt.
Mexican names have been among the most prolific Latin American issuers of
new debt and equity, accounting for about 40 per cent of total new eurobond
issuance from the region as companies refinanced existing borrowings or
raised money for further expansion.
In the first nine months of 1993, Mexican borrowers raised a total of
Dollars 5.909bn in the eurobond market, according to IFR Securities Data,
compared with a total of Dollars 4.098bn in the whole of 1992.
This year has seen the launch of larger, more liquid bond issues, including
a Dollars 1bn, five-year issue from Cemex, the largest cement company in
Mexico, in May, and a Dollars 750m eurobond from Bancomer, Mexico's second
largest bank, in June. Such liquidity has been warmly welcomed by
international investors.
In addition to bigger issues and greater liquidity, the international
capital market has seen a far greater variety of Mexican borrowers, some of
whom the international investing community regard as 'second tier' names,
but which have nevertheless succeeded in raising funds.
Despite a setback in the performance of Latin American bond issues in the
autumn of 1992, when investors suddenly panicked at the thought of just how
much new issuance was likely to hit the international capital market, yields
have continued to fall in the secondary market, and borrowers have been able
to launch deals at increasingly more aggressive levels.
One Mexican sovereign issue, the 7.25 per cent issue due 1998, was sold in
March at 208 basis points over the US treasury bond, and the spread narrowed
to as little as 130 basis points in September before widening out slightly
thereafter. As Mr Paul Luke, head of emerging market debt research at Morgan
Grenfell, points out: 'Such a spread is closer to US corporate investment
grade spreads than to the sub-investment grade that new Mexican issues are
rated by Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P).'
However, Mr John Purcell, director of emerging markets research at Salomon
Brothers, notes some signs of investor resistance to the ever-tighter yield
spreads at which new issues are launched.
Investor demand for Mexican paper has been driven by the desire for
high-yielding paper, given that US interest rates are at their lowest levels
in 18 years.
'Institutional investors are in the market in a much bigger way than a year
ago: they like the high yields and many of the investors have been making
the effort to do their homework on the region so they feel more confident
now about investing there,' says one Mexican analyst.
Some investors hope to see a further rally in bond prices (and narrowing of
yield spreads) if Mexico's credit rating is raised.
S &amp; P rates Mexico's sovereign foreign currency debt as BB+, the highest
category of sub-investment grade, whereas Moody's, the rival international
credit rating agency, rates it Ba2, which is one notch below S &amp; P's
equivalent rating. Meanwhile, Duff &amp; Phelps, a less closely-followed rating
agency, has assigned an investment grade rating of BBB to Mexico's foreign
currency debt.
In the case of sovereign long-term peso-denominated debt, the discrepancy is
greater: S &amp; P rates it AA- while Moody's rates it Baa1. Mr Purcell of
Salomon Brothers, says S &amp; P is altogether far more optimistic about
Mexico's creditworthiness and argues that an upgrading of the rating for
foreign currency debt could take place in the second half of 1994.
'We believe that Mexican sovereign debt should be regarded as virtually
investment grade, even in terms of foreign currency obligations. We agree
with S &amp; P that the policy process has encountered difficult tests in 1992
and has passed them with flying colours, exhibiting both flexibility and
consistency. To the list of accomplishments mentioned by S &amp; P (fiscal
policy and flexible exchange rate policy) we would add the renewed emphasis
on education, the solidarity programme and agricultural reform among
others,' says Mr Purcell.
For both S &amp; P and Moody's, the sovereign debt rating provides an effective
ceiling for the credit ratings for Mexican corporate borrowers, even though
analysts argue that certain Mexican companies deserve better credit ratings
in their own right. 'Some of the big Mexican companies would be as good as a
double-A credit in the US if they weren't impeded by the country rating,'
says one analyst.
The key point is that if Mexico receives an investment grade rating, a much
wider range of investors will be free to invest in Mexican debt. US
insurance companies buy quite small amounts of Mexican debt at present,
deterred by the fact that they must set aside capital because the debt is
not investment grade: if that changes, they will be able to increase their
exposure to high-yielding bonds significantly.
While the international capital markets are set to see plenty more new bond
issuance in 1993 and 1994, the volume of international equity issuance has
slowed down when compared with the volumes seen in the early 1990s.
This is largely a reflection of the absence of substantial privatisations
during 1993 rather than a sign of poor investor appetite.
If anything, Latin American equity specialists predict that demand for new
international equity issues should remain fairly firm given the ever-growing
number of emerging market funds and a perceptible shift of US investors into
non-US markets.
Mexican international equity offerings amounted to Dollars 3.103bn in 1992,
boosted by a Dollars 1.243bn offering from Telmex, the Mexican
telecommunications group, and large share offerings from Bancomer and Cemex.
However, the deluge of new issues in 1992 came to a halt in the summer due
to difficult market conditions and worries about too much supply. Some
planned issues were put on hold and the calendar only really picked up again
at the beginning of 1993.
Total volume so far in 1993 - predominantly from private sector companies -
amounted to Dollars 882.56m, according to IFR Securities Data, and included
issues from Grupo Carso, Mexico's largest industrial conglomerate, Grupo
Tribasa, Mexico's second largest construction company, Grupo Dina, Mexico's
largest truck manufacturer, and Coca-Cola Femsa, the Mexican soft drinks
bottler.
Generally, Latin American analysts report that new equity issues have gone
quite well, even though the stock market has been vulnerable to Nafta
sentiment. If Nafta goes through, analysts expect to see a further Dollars
2bn of issuance unleashed over the next year.
The variety of new issues has been accompanied by a noticeable improvement
in reporting procedures and provision of information, analysts say, dictated
partly by the US regulations governing the listing of American Depositary
Receipts (ADRs).
Many investors were justifiably peeved when Cemex launched an international
equity offering in 1992 and promptly used the proceeds to make acquisitions
in Spain. Investors who had bought the shares because they wanted a Mexican
stock were annoyed to find they had bought exposure to the Spanish economy
instead.
It was not a happy chapter in investor relations: however, Mexican companies
have probably learned from the episode, and analysts admit that Mexico today
is probably among the best of the emerging markets in terms of disclosure.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (13): Institute means business - The Tec
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF MONTERREY'S big companies are still for the most part owned by its old
families, they are to a large extent run by the product of one institution:
the Monterrey Institute for Technical and Higher Studies, known as the
'Tec'. The institute was created 50 years ago to provide engineers for city
industry and its approach today remains business-oriented.
Now the Tec has 62,000 students on 26 campuses throughout Mexico, 14,000 of
them in Monterrey. It has a Dollars 200m a year budget, 30-40 per cent of
which comes from companies and the rest from tuition. The Tec's alumni are
to be found all over Latin America.
But important though training of engineers is for Mexico, the work of the
Tec does not end there. It sees its business as preparing Mexican business
for the challenges it faces, in the area of management, of technology and
the environment. The Tec's Competitiveness Centres have been established to
look at productivity issues; its research, usually sponsored by Mexican
companies, aims to keep abreast of new manufacturing technology.
A recent visit to Monterrey showed researchers studying the use of robots in
flexible manufacturing processes and the manufacture of plastic products -
such as chain links and artificial hip joints - in a single process without
the necessity to make joins.
Mr Rafael Rangel, the Tec's president, expresses a concern increasingly
heard in Mexico: the ability of small- and medium-sized companies to survive
in an open economy. These companies' access is limited to reasonably-priced
credit, management techniques and to new technology.
'We have a problem with productivity and we have a long way to go. Some
people blame only the exchange rate, but there is more to it than that. It's
not just a matter of labour; the owners have to be convinced that they can
improve productivity by training and through new production systems.
'Medium-sized and small industry is most affected. Large industry is going
to survive very well.'

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (12): Burning desire for new markets -
Pulsar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PULSAR'S chairman and founder, Mr Alfonso Romo Garza, is not pleased to have
his company described as a conglomerate. Pulsar owns Mexico's biggest
cigarette company, Moderna. It now has 22 per cent of the country's
insurance market, thus making it, he says, the largest Latin American
insurance company. It has an agricultural company, carpet manufacturers and
a stockbroker. But, insists Mr Romo, it is not a conglomerate.
There is no doubting that it is an unusual company. Pulsar's companies'
annual revenues total Dollars 2.5bn and they employ 23,000 people, but
Pulsar's headquarters in Monterrey have just 25. 'This is a highly
decentralised company,' says its chairman.
The core of the company - and the key to its growth from nothing since 1981
 -is its highly profitable cigarette business, which it claims has 55 per
cent of the market. It has the Mexican brand leaders such as Raleigh,
Viceroy, Finesta and Montana but also has the Mexican rights to distribution
of international brands: Winston, Salem, Camel, Dunhill and Gitanes.
Mr Romo acquired control of the company from Grupo Carso, the company of
Telmex magnate, Mr Carlos Slim. Now, thanks to the deregulation of cigarette
prices in the past two years, cigarette prices - and therefore profit
margins - have risen dramatically.
Mr Romo's motivation for moving into the insurance business is based on his
belief that the Mexican economy is heavily underinsured. Premium income is
equivalent to just 1.2 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with up
to 8 per cent in industrialised countries and in some other Latin American
states. If Mexico grows, therefore, insurance premiums should grow even
faster.
His interest in agriculture derives from the company's connection with
tobacco farmers. Almost all Moderna's tobacco leaf is sourced in Mexico. The
company therefore has links with farmers of 20,000 hectares of tobacco. It
also has developed relationships with 10,000 hectares of fruit and vegetable
growers, with an eye on the export market. Some observers doubt the synergy
of these two elements of the company's business, but Mr Romo is enthusiastic
about recent agricultural reforms which he believes will further help this
side of the business - by increasing the availability of credit to farmers
for example.
Mr Romo does not seem inclined to let his business stand still. In
particular, he is enthusiastic about the prospects of new markets overseas
for the cigarette company. Having sought areas where he could compete on an
equal footing with the US tobacco giants, he has identified markets in
eastern Europe, Russia and China for expansion.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (11): Newspaper's capital move - The press
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONTERREY boasts not just Mexico's leading companies, but by common repute,
the country's most profitable and best-run newspaper, El Norte.
El Norte reads and looks more like a Texas newspaper than one from Mexico.
It is printed in colour, makes liberal use of photographs and graphics, and
contains about eight sections a day, all thick with advertisements.
News articles are generally brief and the style is plain, while the
editorial line is pro-market and pro-business. The offices in the centre of
Monterrey are sleek and modern, and everything, from writing to editing to
graphics, is done on computers.
The paper is proud of its independence from government, and takes delight in
exposing fraud in elections. Unlike many journalists in Mexico City, El
Norte reporters do not accept money from departments they cover, do not work
on commissions for the advertising departments, and are paid a reasonable
salary.
The owners of El Norte are now about to publish a Mexico City newspaper,
with an initial investment of Dollars 50m, which they say will bring to the
capital the same standards that have helped the Monterrey newspaper's
morning circulation rise to certified 145,000. The paper, to be named
Reforma, will come out on November 20, the day Mexico celebrates its 1910-20
revolution.
Mr Alejandro Junco, publisher and (with his family) the owner of El Norte,
believes there is a tremendous business opportunity for a new newspaper in
Mexico City, with readership levels about one eighth of those in Monterrey.
The paper, he says, will be similar to El Norte, and carry sections on local
issues, consumer products, real estate, food, as well as standard ones on
sport and business.
The project has already raised questions in Mexico City about whether a
commercial, brash approach to news and culture will go down in the capital,
which likes to think of itself as a little more civilised than compatriots
in the north, and less consumer-orientated.
Mr Raymundo Riva Palacio, an editor of the independent daily El Financiero,
says: 'El Norte is effective in the society of Nuevo Leon, but you cannot
translate this to Mexico City. The reader in Mexico is more sophisticated,
more interested in international affairs, his knowledge of arts is more
profound. He demands longer articles and more political analysis than that
offered by El Norte.'
Mr Junco contends that existing Mexico City newspapers are so concerned
about developments in politics and the bureaucracy that they lose sight of
the middle-class concerns of their readers. He believes that the paper's
independence and objectivity will gain readers, and claims to have lined up
some top-rate political columnists to increase the paper's appeal to a
Mexico City readership.
Mr Riva Palacio questions whether Reforma will be able to maintain its
independence as effectively in Mexico City as El Norte does in Monterrey.
'It's one thing being told off by the minister of interior in the state of
Nuevo Leon, another by the minister of interior for the whole country.' he
says.
Reforma's ability to withstand commercial and possibly political pressures
received a blow several months ago when the Dow Jones company, publisher of
the Wall Street Journal, pulled out of talks to acquire a 49 per cent stake
in the newspaper. The negotiations failed after Dow Jones insisted on the
right to buy out or be bought out by its partner in the event of a
disagreement, a condition Mr Junco refused.
Mr Junco still hopes to use Dow Jones news for coverage of the US and
international financial news, and the two companies may reach some agreement
on sharing advertising revenues in the Mexico City-based newspaper.
The entry of Reforma promises to shake up the Mexico City newspaper
industry, which is already going through heavy restructuring. Mexico City
boasts more than a dozen mainstream daily newspapers, but most have
circulations well under 100,000. The majority survive only thanks to
subsidies from their owners or from the government.
In a largely successful effort to manipulate the press, Mexico's state and
federal government departments pay heavily for advertisements that appear as
news articles, advertisements that serve no obvious purpose, and often
subsidise salaries of journalists through the monthly embute (envelope) of
cash. Such practices ensure ample coverage of favoured political leaders,
but may explain why newspaper readership is so low.
However, some government departments are now cutting back subsidies,
reducing generous printing contracts, and are putting an end to the practice
of embutes. Private sector advertising is falling as a result of the
economic slowdown, and almost all newspapers are feeling the pinch.
In a sign of the economic difficulties of the press, the government recently
put up for sale the state-owned El Nacional newspaper, but found no-one
willing to meet the modest reservation price. Several other newspapers are
now up for sale and La Jornada, the favoured paper of the leftist
intelligentsia, is seeking a capital increase.
Other newspapers are seeking foreign partners to help them out in the battle
for readers and advertisers. La Prensa, Mexico's top selling tabloid daily,
was recently sold to a group of investors that include Mr Jesus de Polanco,
Spain's most powerful media baron. The US media group Capital Cities/ABC has
just bought Mexico's largest business magazine, Expansion.
Even competitors concede El Norte has an edge over southern rivals in
selling advertising and distribution. Mr Junco says with some pride that
Reforma will be the world's first newspaper with 'flexible manufacturing'. A
reader can, if he wants, customise his newspaper to receive two copies of
the section on sports and no copy of the section on food and drink, or
whatever.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Austria (9): Profit, but little joy - Banking:
rationalisation is the theme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST BANKS in Europe are either already enjoying or anticipating enjoying
the impact of lower interest rates on their basic business.
Austrian banks are in the first category, having already had a taste of
wider spreads as the Austrian National Bank has dared for some months to
push a step ahead of the German Bundesbank in lowering rates.
Profits of Bank Austria (BA), the country's largest bank, jumped 51 per cent
in the first half, to Sch2.01bn, while those of Creditanstalt soared 77 per
cent to Sch2.3bn.
Both banks made clear that the gains had to be seen against extremely
depressed results last year, and that the profit surge came mainly from
trading activities, but they were nevertheless optimistic for significant
improvement in the year as a whole.
In spite of this pleasant outlook, there is not much joy in Austrian banking
circles these days. Rather, a pall of unfinished business hangs over the
scene, leaving a certain amount of anxiety in the boardroom of nearly every
major bank.
Rationalisation has been the key theme in Austrian banking for several
years. The country has a ridiculous number of bank branches, one for every
1,340 residents. However, for a long time, most banks were well armed with
hidden reserves and state backing, and so could afford to take a fairly
relaxed attitude to the hard decisions that had to be taken.
Now, after huge losses in foreign misadventures and, more recently, domestic
losses, the big banks are coming to the end of their reserves, and the
government wants to sell out. Smaller savings banks, too, are under pressure
from nervous local authorities to throw in their lot with larger groups.
The main focus in the past year has been on Bank Austria, the country's
largest bank following its creation in November 1991, from the merger of the
city of Vienna's Zentralsparkasse savings bank group and Landerbank.
BA realised from the start that it had to close about 50 of its 407
branches, but it has had to proceed cautiously because of trade union
sensitivities. It has also had immense problems trying to integrate the
computer systems of the two banks, and faces a huge provision to cover the
costs of the old Zentralsparkasse pension obligations. By a quirk of
history, Zentralsparkasse employees were not included in the otherwise
universal state pension system.
Analysts reckon that by the time these matters are settled in two or three
years, BA will have completely used up its roughly Sch6bn in hidden
reserves.
Another area of tension is the country's large savings bank sector. The
problem here, paradoxically, is that rationalisation has proceeded so
quickly that it has altered the balance of power in the system.
In the mid-1970s, there were over 170 savings banks, and each had a
relatively small stake in their large central clearing organisation,
Girozentrale. As a result, Giro could dominate the organisation and pursue
its wholesale banking business as it saw fit.
In the 1980s, the two largest savings bank groups, Zentralsparkasse and
Erste Oesterreichische (First Austrian), bolstered by a landmark court
judgment facilitating the sale of savings banks by local authorities, went
on acquisition sprees.
The result today is that only 80 savings bank organisations remain, and
Zentralsparkasse, now part of Bank Austria, and Erste together control over
half of the shares of Giro, since renamed Girocredit.
Being large universal banks in their own right, Bank Austria and Erste have
no need of a clearing organisation like Giro and tend to see it as a
competitor, particularly in capital markets business.
Not surprisingly, Giro has squirmed uncomfortably under these new
constraining forces, and has tried various strategms to force its two
largest shareholders to sort the situation out.
The main proposal, first made three years ago, was that Bank Austria should
sell out of the savings bank sector, and that Erste and Giro should merge. A
first round of negotiations in the summer of 1991 collapsed in mutual
recrimination, and a second attempt is now at a sensitive stage.
It now seems clear that Bank Austria will sell its 31 per cent stake in
Giro. The problem is: who will buy it, and at what price? BA put down a
marker, when it sold the stake at the end of last year to an affiliate, in
order to crystallise capital gains to cover loan losses, at a
self-determined price of Sch400 per share. This would indicate a value of
Sch16.4bn for the whole bank.
That is perhaps a bit on the high side, even though Giro's profit
performance has improved substantially this year. But any reasonable price
would be beyond the ability of Erste alone to pay. Its total assets at June
30 this year of Sch184bn were significantly less than Giro's Sch330bn at the
same point.
Moreover, Erste is at best a diffident buyer. It has carved out a successful
niche in retail banking, and is nervous about making its life more
complicated.
Hence, an effort is being made to form a consortium that would include the
other largish savings bank groups from provincial capitals. But it all takes
time.
'The 20 key people in the savings bank sector are beginning to understand.
Now they have to tell 60 others and get their supervisory boards to agree,'
an Erste director explains.
Ownership and control are also live issues at Creditanstalt. The bank's
proud patrician management has been eager for several years to rid itself of
state control.
The government cut its capital stake from 60 per cent to 49 per cent several
years ago, but it still holds 70.5 per cent of the votes. Last year, as its
own budgetary problems mounted, it became more eager to sell, and in
November, it emerged that negotiations on the sale of a 20 per cent stake to
General Electric of the US had taken place.
These apparently came to naught, and in the spring an attempt was made to
merge the bank with the very large Raiffeisen group of co-operative banks,
with Raiffeisen buying the government's stake.
Creditanstalt's management balked at this project, and the government agreed
that it was not a sensible solution. Since then, as a result of the sharp
rise in the CA share price this year, there has been much talk of floating
the government's shares in the market.
That is clearly the wish of the bank's management, which would rather not be
faced with another strong controlling or influential shareholder. Mr
Ferdinand Lacina, the finance minister, is not convinced that it is the best
solution.
'Their interest is not necessarily the same as ours,' Mr Lacina says.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Austria (11): Cable bypasses the monopoly - The
media
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC FREY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COUNTRY like Austria, which lives in the shadow of a much larger country
that shares the same language, is bound to have trouble maintaining its
national media.
Technological advances and economic liberalisation have made it almost
impossible to protect a national media, but the government goes on trying.
Austria is one of the last countries in Europe with a state broadcasting
monopoly. Neither private television nor radio stations are allowed, and the
Austrian Broadcasting Corporation (ORF) has a government mandate to air
quality documentaries as well as important cultural events.
This has made two-channel ORF perhaps the most respected German language
television group, but not the most profitable.
In the newspaper sector, most of the papers that were backed by political
parties have recently folded, but the government is still spending more than
Sch200m a year to subsidise a handful of dailies with smaller circulations.
Even so, the days of a distinctively national media appear numbered, whether
Austria joins the European Community or not.
Through the growth of cable television, more than half of Austrian
households can watch German TV channels, including the popular commercial
stations like SAT 1 and RTL.
And in recent years, German newspaper concerns, looking for an opportunity
to invest excess cash, have bought large stakes in some of the largest
Austrian publishing groups.
It all started in the mid-1980s with a quarrel between the co-owners of the
largest tabloid daily, the Kronenzeitung. Hans Dichand was looking for
someone to buy out his long-time partner Kurt Falk for Sch2bn, and finally
found Westdeutsche Algemeine Zeitung (WAZ), a large German newspaper chain.
WAZ then went on to invest in Kurier, the second-largest daily, which also
owns several important magazines. This created the media group with the
highest market share anywhere in Europe.
Other German media groups jumped in. Axel Springer Verlag, in 1988, helped
launch the Standard, which soon became the country's largest quality daily,
and took stakes in other newsprint products. As many papers are currently
losing money, they depend financially on their German sugar daddies.
Even bigger changes are happening in the electronic media. Standing on the
verge of EC membership, Austria knows that it cannot maintain the ORF
monopoly for long. But the legalisation of private broadcasting has been
stymied by a battle over influence and ideology between the two main
political parties, the Social Democrats (SPO) and the conservative People's
Party (OVP).
The Social Democrats, who dislike commercial television, want to permit a
private channel to co-exist next to the two ORF channels. Conservatives
argue that the advertising pie is much too small to support three Austrian
channels. So they want ORF to spin off its second channel to private
investors, a move strongly opposed by the ORF leadership.
Meanwhile, a power struggle has begun at ORF following the retirement of
veteran chairman Gerd Bacher. Strong-willed and politically aware, Mr Bacher
had improved ORF's financial fortunes by cutting costs and boosting the
state-regulated advertising revenues.
His successor, however, will have to do more to guarantee the group's
survival amid growing competition. He will have to cut down on the vast
bureaucracy and curtail political interference in personnel decisions and
content.
A law permitting private radio stations will finally come into effect next
year, but its terms are controversial. Foreign participation will be limited
to 25 per cent, and most of the new stations are likely to be controlled by
the large newspaper groups and quasi-governmental institutions, thus
increasing the already high concentration of media power.
The small independent radio stations that set up across the border in
neighbouring countries and broadcast into Austria are likely to fold.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Austria (10): A helping hand for equities - The
stock market reformers have moved fast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW STOCK markets have given investors as rocky a ride as Austria's in
recent years. A sparkling bull run in 1989 and early 1990 was followed by
three years of slump, with the all-share index losing over half its value in
the period from January 1990 to January 1993.
This year, the market has bounced back, but many investors remain suspicious
of the uptrend, given the still weak economic outlook for the country.
In part, the Austrian market's high volatility reflects its small
capitalisation and the relatively small proportion of most companies' shares
that are freely available for trading. It suffices for a couple of big UK or
US institutions to adjust their overall weightings for Austria by a point or
two to move the whole market.
But there have also been many structural problems - a lack of active
domestic institutional investors, a tax system that discriminates against
equity securities and inadequate investor protection provisions.
In mid-1991, when the market was showing no signs of emerging from its long
decline, Austrian leaders decided that enough was enough. Within a short
time, a strategy committee was formed under the personal leadership of Mr
Ferdinand Lacina, the finance minister, and containing representatives from
all interested groups. 'This was deliberate. We wanted to break up the old
bankers' club image,' one official, working on the committee, says.
By any measure, the committee has moved with remarkable speed on several
fronts. Among the more important measures taken to date:
An amendment to the Stock Exchange Act was passed in the spring, making
insider trading a criminal offence. This came into effect on October 1. Mr
Lacina has since said that he will outlaw the use of anonymous bank accounts
for securities transactions by the end of this year. This move is a
prerequisite to the effective investigation of suspected insider dealings.
Meanwhile, leading banks and brokers have drawn up and adopted a standard
compliance code for handling price-sensitive information. This is a
particularly important measure, because trading in securities in Austria is
dominated by the same three large universal banks that dominate the
new-issue and corporate-lending businesses.
For their part, quoted companies are being pressed to adopt fair and timely
procedures for disclosing their accounts and other information likely to
have an impact on their share prices.
A series of capital market-friendly tax reforms was agreed in May, and will
come into force at the beginning of next year.
A wealth tax, which discouraged entrepreneurs from taking their companies
public, is to be abolished, as is an irritating trade tax. The stock
exchange turnover tax will be abolished with respect to securities lending.
Individuals are given special incentives to invest, the most important being
an annual tax-free allowance of Sch10,000 invested in equities. Taxation on
income from securities and bank savings accounts will be equalised at 22 per
cent. Previously, income from securities was more highly taxed.
The Vienna Borse itself has taken a number of steps to make trading more
efficient and transparent, and more are on the way. In July, daily trading
hours were extended by one hour, and a computerised analytical data base has
been set up to promote the equal dissemination of information.
A screen-based trading system is scheduled for installation late next year,
and the exchange is encouraging companies to simplify their equity
structures so that the market in their shares is more liquid.
The exchange is eager to improve, because of the danger of more trading
activity leaking out to the SEAQ market in London. Already five of the
largest Austrian quoted companies - Creditanstalt, EVN, OMV, Wienerberger
and Verbund - are quoted on SEAQ, and analysts estimate that nearly a fifth
of trading of their shares is done in London.
The two big outstanding issues for the committee are the establishment of an
overall market supervisory body and the stimulation of institutional
participation.
The government tried to promote institutional participation four years ago,
by raising the proportion of their funds that insurance companies could put
into equities to 30 per cent. But these companies have remained extremely
cautious about exercising their new freedom, and so far have only about 6
per cent of their funds in equities. Analysts agree that they are unlikely
to change until the cozy Austrian insurance market becomes part of the
European Community market, forcing them to try to get better performance
from their funds.
Pension funds are virtually non-existent in Austria, because the
government's (unfunded) universal pension scheme covers about 80 per cent of
requirements.
As for an Austrian securities and exchange commission, everyone agrees that
there is a need for such a body, but Mr Lacina, for one, is worried about
using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. 'We do not want an over-bureaucratic
system,' he said in a recent interview.
The reform process suffered a serious blow last spring with the death of Mr
Helmut Haschek, chief executive of the Austrian Control Bank (OeKB), the
clearing house for the Borse.
However, Mr Johannes Attems, another OeKB director, says anxieties about the
loss of Mr Haschek's drive and influence on the process are misplaced. 'Once
you get a critical mass of things moving, then the whole process gains
momentum and cannot be reversed,' Mr Attems says.
He adds that government leaders understand the urgency of reform.
'We are going to have some Dollars 100bn - Dollars 150bn in privatisation
projects in the next five years in Europe. Private capital has to be
attracted.
'We in Austria are competing with other capital markets. If we want the
large Anglo-Saxon institutional investors in our market, then we have to
adopt their rules, make it easier for them and provide better opportunities
for them than elsewhere in Europe.
'We also have to tell the Austrian investor that he should invest more in
equities, and not just Austrian equities.'

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (8): A thirst for expansion - Femsa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONTERREY began attracting money during the US civil war from the smuggling
of goods across the border to the Confederate states. Among the enterprises
built with the capital thus attracted to the city was a brewery, the
Cerveceria Cuauhtehmoc, which still stands today. It is now part of the
Femsa group, the headquarters of which abut on the brewery and which itself
is part of the Visa group.
The company began to shift its strategy from 1989, realising that thriving
in Mexico's newly-opened economy would require different qualities from
survival in a closed economy. Investments have been made, international
expansion is under way, and, say senior executives, the 'search continues
for other markets and other technologies'.
Femsa's beer brands are increasingly famous abroad: Dos Equis, Tecate, Carta
Blanca and Sol, to name a few. But Femsa - which employs 37,500 people and
had 1992 revenues of more than Dollars 2bn - is more than a beer company. It
has interests also in packaging, soft-drinks - it holds Mexico's Coca-Cola
franchise - and a chain of convenience stores.
This year, the company floated in the Mexican and international markets a
minority stake in its soft drinks subsidiary. Retaining a 51 per cent stake
for itself, it sold 30 per cent to Coca-Cola for Dollars 195m and 19 per
cent to the public for Dollars 177m.
The soft drinks subsidiary now plans to go after other markets, particularly
in Latin America and first perhaps in Argentina.
Mr Othon Ruiz, the company's chief executive, says the company is talking to
prospective foreign partners over similar arrangements in its packaging and
beer subsidiaries. Philip Morris of the US, maker of Miller beer and holder
of about 8 per cent of Femsa stock, is thought to be interested in the beer
business.
The company - forced to increase debt significantly after the acquisition by
Visa shareholders of Bancomer from the government - used the funds from the
flotation to pay down debt. Followers of the company say it remains fairly
heavily indebted and worry that some senior managers spend too much time on
the bank.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (6): Monterrey captures entrepreneurial
spirit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CITY of Monterrey in north-eastern Mexico, 200 kilometres from the
border with Texas, has long been known for its entrepreneurial spirit.
Sitting beneath the bone-dry mountains of the Sierra Madre, Monterrey - with
its freeways and fast food stores - often appears to have more in common
with the United States than with Mexico City.
Close though it is to the US, Monterrey cannot insulate itself from the
Mexican economy. Its companies are feeling the effects of slow growth which
has brought an end to the boom times in Mexico's third largest city, at
least for now. The companies face further challenges from the North American
Free Trade Agreement, if it comes about. If Monterrey's corporations cannot
handle the competition from the north, there seems little chance for most of
the rest of corporate Mexico.
The descendants of the founders of Monterrey's industrial base are still
prominent on the boards of the companies: members of the Garza family are
chairmen at Femsa and Alfa, the Sadas at Vitro and the Trevinos and
Zambranos elsewhere.
Their companies are often conglomerates - built up when Mexico's economy was
closed to the outside world and when expanding into other businesses was the
only wayto grow.
The opening of the Mexican economy has forced on many of them a different
business strategy. Many have shed peripheral businesses to concentrate on
one sector. Others still seem reluctant to sell or cede control of any
businesses, defying the conventional management wisdom that success stems
from specialisation. In the past few years, some of Monterrey's families
have diversified further particularly into the financial sector, buying
banks in privatisations.
Monterrey's companies are nonetheless probably better known outside Mexico
than ever.
Many are pushing into new markets; others are raising capital
internationally.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (10): Cementing global ambitions - Cemex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CEMEX is the largest producer of cement in the western hemisphere and the
fourth largest in the world. As early as 1986, the company decided it should
concentrate on its main business, ridding itself of assets in mining,
petrochemicals and tourism.
To succeed, the company decided it needed to increase its market share. 'We
saw the concentration that was taking place in the industry worldwide. To
ensure our survival we needed to spread throughout the country,' said Mr
Gustavo Caballero, the company's finance and planning director.
It was able to do that through the purchase, from Blue Circle of the UK, of
Tolteca in 1989: now it has a 60 per cent market share in cement and 70 per
cent in ready-mixed concrete. It protected its home market by purchases of
cement makers over the border in the US. But it did not end there: last
year, in a controversial move, it bought two cement companies in Spain,
giving it more than a quarter of the Spanish market.
It was controversial for a variety of reasons. The company had just made an
international stock offering and some shareholders felt aggrieved that they
had not been advised of Cemex's intention to make the big Spanish purchases.
Many were buying Cemex as an investment in Mexico, and they found themselves
with significant investments in Europe. Furthermore, Cemex was seen by some
as having paid too high a price for cement companies in a market that was
heading rapidly for recession.
Since then, Cemex has come back into favour, outperforming the Mexican stock
market index, even though Spanish cement market volumes fell last year and
are expected to fall again this. This is partly because Cemex is seen as
managing well the integration of its Spanish operations, placing it in a
good position for recovery there.
But Mexico has not been forgotten: 'We are investing Dollars 400m-Dollars
450m a year in Mexico' to upgrade its plants, says Mr Caballero. But if
growth in Mexico is disappointing, the company will slow down or stop the
investment.
Beyond this, the company's aim is to complete the restructuring of its
Spanish operation. In the long term, 'we'll probably look to the Far East'.

VITRO came into being as a producer of bottles for Cerveceria Cuautehmoc.
Recently, Femsa started producing all its own bottles, thereby ending a
long-standing relationship. Unlike other Monterrey companies, Vitro has
stuck to one business, although some observers say that the acquisition of
the Serfin financial group by Sada family interests has been taking up an
increasing proportion of the time of the company chairman, Mr Adrian Sada.
Vitro, the only glass producer of size in Mexico, is the country's largest
industrial company with 1992 revenues of Dollars 3.3bn. A third of this
revenue comes from its US glass containers subsidiary, Anchor Glass. In its
home market, it has aggressively pursued a monopoly position in the Mexican
market. It has bought up competitors and has kept a tight grip on
distributors.
Yet Vitro has underperformed the market in the past few years. Margins on
its US operations have been low, in spite of significant new investment
there. So have world glass prices, reducing the importance of its monopoly
position in Mexico's newly-opened market. 'They are reacting now but they
have been slow to react to the new situation in Mexico,' says Mr Pablo
Riveroll of Bursamex.
Like other companies in Monterrey, Vitro has long experience of joint
ventures with foreign companies: Pilkington of the UK, Owens-Corning and PQ
Corporation of the US. But as Mr Ernesto Martens, its chief executive
officer, says, the motive for these joint ventures has changed over time.
'Originally, in the 1950s and 1960s, the aim was to have the best technology
available for the domestic markets. Then, as Mexico began to change, the
need for exports became more evident. We began to look at how we could gain
access to technology and to markets.'
He says management of companies has improved significantly but that change
is still needed. 'The most important change that many Mexican companies have
to go through is to become fully aware of their customer and how properly to
service his needs.'

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (7): Steeled for tough times - Alfa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE bookshelves of Mr Peter Hutchison's Monterrey office sit more than
half a dozen thick, black volumes. They represent the fruit of years of hard
work during the 1980s - the documentation of the Alfa conglomerate's debt
rescheduling.
The 1980s brought a debt crisis to more than the government; many companies
such as Alfa and Femsa were forced into complex restruc-turings.
Mr Hutchison, an Anglo-Chilean who is now senior vice-president for
corporate finance and planning, moved to Monterrey 17 years ago and is now
an adopted regiomontano, as the 2m people of the city call themselves.
He says the dark days of debt restructuring are behind the company now.
None-theless, times remain tough for this steel, petrochemicals and food
business.
Alfa's two main businesses - steel and petrochemicals - received a double
shock: not only did prices in Mexico come down because tariff barriers were
reduced but world prices were depressed by the recession in much of the
industrialised world.
It has invested more than Dollars 800m in four years in meeting the
challenge of an open economy, but questions still remain about whether it
has a long-term future in its main businesses.
'Especially on the petrochemicals side, you have to ask whether the size of
the Mexican market will allow it to compete worldwide,' says Mr Pablo
Riveroll of the Bursamex stock brokerage. A further problem is the quality
of the feedstock delivered to Alfa from the state-owned oil monopoly, Pemex,
he says.
Alfa broke what seems to be an unwritten rule for success in open developing
economies: invest only in those sectors where barriers to the entry of
competition are significant, for example, in services, where cultural
differences are important or where the costs of transport from foreign
markets are high.
Mr Hutchison says there is a cushion, however, because the company's food
and other businesses - it is a leading mattress and carpet maker and also
makes auto parts - are doing well.
In June, Alfa was forced to scrap a proposed flotation of part of its Hylsa
steel-making subsidiary. Alfa was hoping to sell about 16 per cent of Hylsa
for more than Dollars 100m; in the event investors would not pay what Alfa
thought it was worth and the sale was scrapped. Mr Hutchison says the idea
has not been abandoned.
Like many Monterrey companies, Alfa has a long experience in joint ventures
with foreign companies.
Among others it is seeking a partner for textile production using its
petrochemical products.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Austria (8): 'Three years of reforms' - Interview:
Franz Vranitzk - The Austrian chancellor replies to questions put to him by
Ian Rodger and Patrick Blum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER and PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Q: The nationalised industries are in trouble again. Is there any chance
that the government will bail them out again?
A: I am not open for a bail-out in the old sense, as it was done in the
sixties and seventies. We do not help those companies by covering their
deficits and letting them return to business as usual.
Q: Is it important to you that Austrians still hold majority control in
these companies?
A: It is understandable that the workers in these companies would feel safer
if their shareholders were not foreigners. We have to make them understand
that this is not the only consideration. There has to be more international
co-operation to tap new technological know-how or new markets. And we
sometimes have to offer the know-how developed here to others to open new
market opportunities.
Q: The government's deficit-reduction plan has been thrown off course by the
recession. Will there be further relaxation in the forthcoming election
year?
A: I do not believe in a lot of election promises. Our standards of social
security, our education system, our ecological standards are all so high
that it is not politically necessary to increase them. Let us be glad of
that. Probably we could not afford increases.
Q: Your critics say that the present coalition government has been hesitant
in implementing reforms. Should there be another coalition after next year's
election?
A: This government has brought more reforms in the past three years than any
other.
Q: Why then are both ruling parties losing popularity?
A: Not all reforms are popular. I think that mass parties in many countries
in Europe face a much tougher challenge. We have called for more
individualisation, more open democratic systems, more plebiscites, so we
must not wonder that the citizen comes back and uses the opportunities that
have been opened. The individual citizen no longer subscribes to a political
party as fully reflecting his own thinking as he did earlier in the post-war
era: This is not an excuse. I am aware that we have to try harder.
Q: How optimistic are you about completing negotiations aimed at Austria's
joining the European Community?
A: The most important point is that we become members by 1996, so that we
can not only attend the intergovernmental conference as members, but also
participate in the preparatory work. Therefore, I took up the EC's
suggestion that we should become members by January 1, 1995. I see no reason
why we should not take this date seriously.
Q: Austria has long been an immigration and asylum country, but has recently
closed its borders to immigrants. Is this a permanent change in policy?
A: Eight to 9 per cent of the people in this country are immigrants. That is
not an extremely low rate by international standards. Some of our new laws
aim at keeping the number of those coming in within magnitudes that we still
can cope with. In 1994, we will open again to some 25,000 immigrants. There
is no limit on asylum seekers.
Q: Is Austria reassessing its security needs in the light of new challenges
since the end of the cold war?
A: We have to deal with an increased number of conscientious objectors. We
have to modernise equipment. And with this modernised equipment, we will try
to increase our ability to join United Nations forces in trouble spots int
he world. We have abstained from defining a different kind of threat after
the east-west antagonism vanished. We say only that we must always be in a
position to defend our borders.
Q: How do you feel about the evolution of the new regimes in central and
eastern Europe?
A: They have serious deficiencies in infrastructure that lead to a smaller
capacity to improve their private economies. We need a new initiative -
Europeans together, not on a bilateral basis - to develop their
infrastructure. They cannot do it by themselves, and it is unwise for us to
say to them, 'First develop your infrastructure, and then we will come with
investment'.
I have recently asked my German and Italian and Finnish colleagues - those
in the front-line states, so to speak - to work together to support our
financial and industrial groups to pool resources and concentrate on a
number of specific projects.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Austria (7): When the curtain lifts - Immigration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC FREY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN HUNGARY removed the first piece of the Iron Curtain, on its border with
Austria, in mid-1989, it not only put in motion the fall of communism, but
also Europe's largest migration wave since the second world war.
Ever since, Austria has become a magnet for thousands of refugees and
immigrants from eastern and south-eastern Europe. For them, it is is the
first stop on the way to the wealthy west - as Italy, France and Spain are
for people from Northern Africa.
As in other European countries, immigration has come to dominate Austrian
politics well beyond the scope of the problem.
Some 6.6 per cent of the population, or about half a million people, have
foreign passports, many of them guest workers who have lived in Austria for
years.
Austria has never had such liberal asylum laws as Germany, where the right
to asylum was written into the constitution until last summer. Ever since
the Austrian military began guarding the border with Hungary in 1990,
officials have said that they have the immigration flows under control. Even
so, the market for unskilled labour has been swelled in recent years by
job-seekers from eastern Europe, mostly Slovaks, Poles and Rumanians.
Pick-pocket gangs from across the border have made petty crime a serious
problem in Vienna.
Meanwhile, about 40,000 Bosnian refugees have poured into Austria, and no
one expects them to return to their homes in the foreseeable future.
Especially in the working-class districts of Vienna, the influx of
foreigners has become a symbol of the perils of economic change.
Feeding on fears of crime, unemployment and a growing housing shortage, the
right-wing Freedom party (FPO) and its charismatic chairman Mr Jorg Haider
have repeatedly played the xenophobic card. The FPO has boosted its share of
votes to nearly 20 per cent in recent years, even though a controversial
petition drive against immigration failed to garner significant support at
the start of the year.
But it has been the Social Democratic party (SPO) which has been the driving
force behind curbs on immigration. Worried that its blue-collar voters will
desert the party for Mr Haider, the SPO chairman and Chancellor, Mr Franz
Vranitzky, has quietly engineered some of Europe's toughest immigration
laws, which went into effect last July.
Getting political asylum is now a gamble with very little chance of success,
and receiving a legal work permit has become equally difficult. The most
controversial aspects of the new bill concern long-term residents who are
applying for an extension of their visas. Making a mistake or missing a
deadline can result in immediate expulsion.
A widely criticised clause of the new law states that foreigners must have
at least 10 square metres of living space per person in order to have their
residency permit extended. Given the tight housing situation in Vienna and
wide-spread discrimination against non-Austrians, this clause would make
more than 100,000 people illegal aliens.
Like Germany, Austria does not grant automatic citizenship to long-term
residents, or even to children born in the country. This traditional policy
has hampered the integration of foreigners and weakens their ability to seek
legal protection.
Several well-publicised cases about foreigners trapped in the bureaucratic
maze have caused an uproar over the new law in political and intellectual
circles. Key members of the People's party (OVP), the junior coalition
partner, have called for a quick revision to eliminate its most vicious
elements.
In the forefront of the fight is a broad-based coalition of artists, writers
and church leaders, called 'SOS Neighbour', which was originally formed to
oppose Mr Haider's petition drive. Their anger is now mostly directed
against Mr Franz Loschnak, the interior minister and a key aide to Mr
Vranitzky.
Opposition has also been voiced by business and industry, which has come to
depend on cheap foreign labour. As the number of work permits for foreigners
is gradually reduced, many sectors are complaining about a worsening labour
shortage.
Sectors such as construction and tourism could not survive without guest
workers, executives say. But Social Democrats have held firm on their tough
immigration policies, and several figures show their calculation may be
right.
The number of asylum seekers had dropped to 3,187 in August, from 13,820 a
year earlier, and surveys show broad support for the policy among average
Austrians.
Even Mr Loschnak has gained in popularity in recent months. The SPO may lose
some young voters to the leftist Greens, who call for a liberalisation of
immigration laws, but the party seems to have secured its core working-class
constituency.
Loschnak also argues that Austria still hosts more war refugees per capita
than any other European country, and individual hardship cases are often
settled leniently. Moreover, Austria has avoided the kind of right-wing
violence against foreigners that has engulfed Germany over the past two
years.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Austria (6): An attractive deal is needed -
Foreign policy: many voters are undecided about EC membership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE END of the Cold War and moves towards greater integration in the
European Community have created radical new challenges for Austria. How it
faces up to them will shape its prospects for years to come.
Within a relatively short time, the country will have to decide whether or
not to join the Community. The main political parties favour membership, as
does about a third of the electorate; but many voters are still undecided,
so the government will need to secure a sufficiently attractive deal from
Brussels to win Austrian hearts and minds. The outcome of a referendum, next
year or in 1995, is expected to be favourable, but there are many
uncertainties.
'We've been kept waiting for such a long time, feelings are no longer
ardent,' says Mrs Maria Schaumayer, governor of the central bank.
At the same time, policymakers are reappraising Austria's relations with its
former communist neighbours, whose drive towards market economies presents
opportunities and dangers. After initial enthusiasm - Austrian exports to
the region grew spectacularly, helping to postpone the impact of the world
recession - Austria soon found itself besieged by cheap central and east
European imports and a flow of refugees. The government introduced
protective measures against sensitive imports, and for the first time in
decades halted the flow of immigrants.
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky says it was necessary to put a temporary halt to
immigration. 'It is conjunctural. We had 8-9 per cent of immigrants already,
and that is not a low rate by international comparison. We have to provide
immigrants with housing, jobs and education.'
Politicians are also concerned about conflicts and instability in the
region. The wars in former Yugoslavia, and the west's (especially the EC's)
ineffective attempts to end the crisis caused dismay in Vienna. The rise of
nationalist sentiment worries Austrians brought up to value consenus almost
above anything else.
The outlook is not all bleak. Mr Johann Farnleitner, deputy general
secretary of the Federal Economic Chamber, which represents employers, is
enthusiastic about prospects in what he describes as Austria's historical
hinterland. 'Eastern Europe presents a unique challenge for us. I am
comfortable as far as our immediate neighbours are concerned. Sooner or
later they will do very well,' he says.
Meanwhile, Austria is vulnerable to competition from low-cost producers.
'We're close to a number of producers, and they want to sell things here. It
means some products are offered at tremendously low prices,' he says. A
tonne of cement produced in Austria sells at Dollars 90-Dollars 100,
compared with Dollars 30 if produced in Ukraine, and Dollars 55-Dollars 60
from the Czech Republic. Even efficient domestic producers cannot match such
prices.
These problems can be solved by quiet negotiations, encouraging regional
producers to raise their prices by guaranteeing them a set volume of sales,
Mr Farnleitner says. This is good for producers, as it increases the value
of their exports, and it helps to reduce the impact on domestic
manufacturers. In the long run, it is also good for industry as a whole,
because companies have access to cheaper inputs.
Austria's economy is becoming more deeply integrated with that of its
neighbours. It has more than 8,000 joint ventures in the area, including
4,000 in Hungary. It is an important investor in Slovakia, Slovenia and the
Czech Republic. Co-operation with these countries raises Austria's
competitiveness in world markets - the cost of 25 workers in a workshop in
Austria can pay for 200 workers in a factory in Slovakia.
Mr Farnleitner believes Austria's trade with the region could rapidly build
up to 15-20 per cent of its total trade.
'We have to live with these countries, and the sooner they get rich, the
richer we will get, too. There are 8m Austrians, and 50m neighbours who
expect something from us. This is a far greater challenge than joining the
European Community,' he says.
Relations with the Community, however, will become increasingly important.
Austria already has faced an argument with the Community over industrial
subsidies, and it is entangled in a dispute over duties on Austrian exports
to the EC of products partly made or finished in eastern Europe. The duties
add 10 per cent costs for Austrian exporters, Mr Farnleitner says, but the
row is unlikely to be resolved until Austria joins the EC.
Negotiations on membership terms have begun in earnest, and Austria hopes
they will be completed in time to join on January 1, 1995, though that may
be over-optimistic.
'Negotiations were slow to start, but we are well on our way now,' says
Ambassador Wolfgang Wolte, who heads the foreign affairs ministry's
department for European integration. About half of the main issues have been
resolved or are close to resolution, but the hardest part will be over
agriculture, transit, and establishment of residences.
Agriculture: Austria wants some form of protection/support for its Alpine
farmers who, it says, face much more difficult conditions than farmers in
the rest of the Community. Some will be worse off as a result of joining the
EC, Mr Wolte says. 'We'll have to find some common ground. We need to
convince the EC that it is more than an economic and agricultural question.
It is part of our social fabric. We have to preserve these alpine regions.'
Transit: This is a very sensitive issue for environment-conscious Austrians.
Ideally, the government would like to keep an existing transit agreement,
signed concurrently with the treaty establishing the European Economic Area
in 1992. Traffic is expected to rise dramatically with Austria's former
communist neighbours, and the government hopes it can win support for
developing regional infrastructures. Failure to reach an agreement that
safeguards Austrian sensibilities about the environment could jeopardise
support in the referendum.
Residences: Austria wants to limit the right of EC citizens to buy
residences in Austria to those who have lived in the country for a minimum
of five years. Some provinces want a more restrictive limit based on
residence in the province for the previous five years. The fear is that
parts of the country that are popular with tourists (the Tyrol, Salzburg,
Vorarlberg and Carinthia) could be overwhelmed by the establishment of
secondary residences that would destroy the character of the area and push
property prices beyond the reach of Austrians.
None of these issues will be easy to resolve, though Austrian officials
believe negotiations could be completed by March, allowing a referendum by
the summer, before a general election in October. If the negotiations drag
on, the referendum will have to wait until after the elections. 'We're not
giving up the date of January 1, 1995 (for membership) . We'll do everything
we can to stick to that target. . . But in the end, it's not so much the
date that matters, but the results (of the negotiations,' says Mr Wolte.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (5): Vote deadline is November 17 - Nancy
Dunne explains the US procedures for approving Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE North American Free Trade Agreement, the most controversial US trade
agreement since the second world war, has now entered the shadowy world of
the Congressional fast track where legislative procedures are turned on
their heads, a bill is not a bill, a conference not a conference, and
legislation to implement trade agreements is born.
The fast-track procedure mandates an up or down vote on the 'implementing
legislation', thus evading deal-killing amendments designed to benefit
special interests. Unlike a treaty, which requires a two-thirds senate vote
for passage, fast track gives the responsibility of approval to a majority
in both houses.
The only hope for getting a trade pact through Congress without amendments
is to ensure a majority vote in advance.
This is achieved through a pre-approval negotiating process between the
administration and the Congress. Representatives of both essentially write
the implementing legislation together.
Work on the 'non-bill' that will become the implementing legislation begins
first in committees - the House Ways and Means Committees and the Senate
Finance - which have primary jurisdiction over trade. Other committees with
jurisdiction - like banking and agriculture - will also hold hearings.
After holding hearings, Ways and Means and Finance each write a 'non-bill',
in consultation with the administration and other committees. This process,
ordinarily called a 'markup', to produce bills, is called a 'mock up'.
The 'non-bill' makes changes in current law necessary for the implementation
of trade agreements, provides for financing mechanisms and changes tariffs.
It could also include the administration's interpretation of unclear
portions of the trade pact. Other trade legislation can be attached.
There is talk about adding a 'Super 301' provision to the Nafta in order to
attract wavering Democrats. Super 301 requires the administration to
negotiate away foreign trade barriers (or use sanctions if the trading
partners baulk).
The committees take their non-bills to a House-Senate 'mock conference'
where they iron out their differences and most of the changes are made. Mr
Richard Daley, the administration's 'Nafta czar', will be hard at work,
making backroom deals in exchange for member votes.
The result then goes to the president, who has a free hand with the
'non-bill'. He can tear it up, alter it, or submit it to Congress for
fast-track action, at which point it becomes a bill.
The bill can no longer be changed. It must be voted on in no fewer than 90
legislative days (days in session). The House committees have 45 days to
debate its merits before it moves on to full House debate for 15 days. If it
loses here - which may well happen - that is the end of the process.
If it passes, it goes on to the Senate, where the committees have 15 days to
debate and vote and the full Senate has 15 days. Both houses must schedule
20 hours of floor debate.
The president has asked Congressional leaders to accelerate the process in
order to get a Nafta into effect on January 1, as scheduled. Mr Tom Foley,
the House speaker and Nafta supporter, has scheduled a floor vote for
November 17.
There is considerable speculation about whether or not the vote will go
forward on schedule. The White House and Congressional leadership have vowed
that it will. A senior Senate aide said that the administration wants to get
the issue 'over and done with' to make way for more popular issues such as
health care and crime legislation. 'Members don't want to go home and talk
about it any more,' he said. 'The administration won't pick up votes by
waiting.'
Others say the administration has been forced to take a tough line on the
Nafta schedule to stem the flow of defecting Republicans and Democrats, who
are afraid a pro-Nafta vote will hurt them in their districts. They will not
want to support the bill if they think the president might delay it or pull
it for re-negotiation.
But will the leadership act if a Nafta loss seems probable? November 17 is
less than a month before the December 15 deadline for the Uruguay Round.
There is concern that a failure of Nafta in US Congress would discourage
politically-risky concessions in the Gatt talks, particularly if as
expected, Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire, comes out in opposition to
the Gatt and promises to fund a fight against its passage.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (4): Putting the bite on business - A look
at the obstacles faced by companies in Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN AN Iranian-born Briton claimed in February that he had been asked for a
bribe to secure a Mexican air traffic control contract, he unleashed a storm
of controversy. Mr Kaveh Moussavi, who said he was asked for a bribe while
acting as agent for IBM, was condemned by the Mexican government and
ministers as soon as his allegations appeared in the Financial Times.
While it is clear that Mr Moussavi informed IBM at the time of an encounter
with three Mexican officials seeking a bribe in Mexico City's Nikko Hotel
last November, his allegations have not been proved. On the other hand, Mr
Moussavi says they have received only perfunctory investigation by the
Mexican government. Certainly, Mr Moussavi was condemned by government
ministers as a liar before an investigation could have been carried out.
The controversy raised a number of important questions over the extent to
which corruption and the country's judicial system - widely said to be
inefficient, corrupt and arbitrary in its decision-making - are obstacles to
doing business in Mexico. As such, the Moussavi affair has become one of the
issues that opponents of the North American Free Trade Agreement have used
to attack the treaty.
In reality, US multinationals such as IBM are usually sufficiently
well-connected politically to achieve redress for any real or imagined
wrongs. Mr Moussavi - who has since reached an 'accommodation' with IBM not
to criticise the company - has himself pointed out: 'If this is the trouble
the government can give to a Dollars 72bn corporation, God help the smaller
companies.'
If these issues are problems for foreign companies - and if Nafta is passed,
corporationsfrom the US and Canada will at least have a right to redress
through the treaty's disputes procedures - they are potentially devastating
for smaller Mexican companies. While deregulation of the economy at a
federal level has reduced some of the obstacles to these enterprises, they
are still often faced with obstructive and corrupt officialdom at lower
levels. Even newly-privatised industry is often unhelpful: the traditional
bribe - known as the 'mordida' or bite - is still often necessary to ensure
timely repairs of telephone lines, for example.
There are groups within the Mexican government who agree that the judicial
system and the consequent lack of ability to enforce contracts is a serious
weakness of the Mexican economy: the reform of the legal system is
considered by the finance minister and presidential candidate, Mr Pedro
Aspe, among others, as a reform priority for the next administration.
Indeed, the travails of small- and medium-sized companies are of more than
peripheral importance to the Mexican economy. Mr Rafael Rangel, of the
Monterrey Institute for Technical and Higher Studies, estimates such
enterprises are responsible for 80 per cent of Mexico's industrial
production.
These companies are also, he says, poorly equipped to deal with the
technological and management challenges posed by the opening of the Mexican
economy. It is a theme echoed by Mr Luis Rubio, of the Centre of
Investigation for Development in Mexico City. 'There is still an enormous
abyss between those companies that have understood what's going on and those
that have no idea how to adjust to it. They have a lack of access to good
information. There are perhaps 120,000 to 130,000 companies in the country,
many of which are going to die needlessly. That doesn't mean they should be
subsidised; just that they they should be allowed access to information.'
These and other issues coalesce into what is the main problem facing most
Mexican companies: high interest rates and a lack of access to credit. The
government has transformed Nacional Financiera, the state development bank,
from a source of government funding to a provider of credit to the private
sector. But loans remain expensive - with real interest rates well into
double digits - and scarce. Only big companies with access to international
capital markets cancircumvent the problem.
It is clear that the privatisation of 18 banks has not been enough to secure
competition in the provision of bank loans. However, the government is
taking further steps to inject more competition into the banking system:
cutting withholding tax on interest payments to banks abroad and trying to
establish a market in mortgage securities. Here again, the lengthy and
uncertain legal procedures required for lenders to gain access to collateral
in Mexico may inhibit such developments.
It is not only in banking where questions of competition arise. The
administration has left the state electricity monopoly untouched, and
electricity prices are high. Where it has privatised, the government has
been skilful at extracting the best price possible for state companies
industries but at a cost, some say, of concentrating economic power into
relatively few hands. This increases the importance - for small businesses,
distributors and consumers - of ensuring effective redress for the abuse of
monopoly power.
The law aimed at ensuring competition is probably one of the most advanced
in the world, encapsulating the distinction now made by economists between
size per se - the old definition of monopoly - and monopolistic behaviour.
Mr Santiago Levy, president of the new Federal Competition Commission and
the man who framed the law, says: 'The link between performance and
structure is more elaborate than has been generally understood. You can't
infer that more concentration is necessarily bad. What is important is the
behaviour of businesses, not so much the size of the firms. What the law is
looking for is efficiency and competitive markets; in other words that
prices are as close as possible to costs.'
The law distinguishes between what is illegal per se - such as bid rigging -
and issues for which a 'rule of reason' should apply. These latter issues
would include, for example, restrictive agreements between producers and
distributors. In investigating these, the commission must first define what
the relevant market is - for example, cotton shirts, shirts or clothing. It
must then decide that the company complained of has substantial power in
this market, which will involve a close investigation of the market
structure.
Mr Levy reckons more competition in some sectors - including communications,
transport and financial services - would be beneficial. 'Particularly in
non-tradeable sectors, we think a more vigorous competition policy could be
useful.'
Along with the central bank, now being made independent, the competition
commission is one of two new government institutions that will transcend the
presidency. Commissioners will sit for 10 years - although in the first
place their terms will be staggered to ensure one of the five is rotated
every two years.
Still, the incorporation of best practice in the law is noguarantee that it
will be followed. Mr Levy knows that to gain credibility his organisation
will have to show its teeth. That will mean not only issuing effective
judgments against the government's enemies and those with little political
influence, but also against those with huge influence in the corridors of
power.

Politics: A look ahead to a year that will bring a series of elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT YEAR will be a lively one in Austrian politics. With four provincial
elections, a general election and the possibility of a referendum on
European Community membership - coinciding with the arrival of a new party
that threatens to draw support away from the establishment - politicians
will be more than usually busy.
The voting season kicks-off in March, with provincial elections in
Carinthia, Tyrol and Salzburg providing an important test of the
electorate's mood. The vote in the southern province of Carinthia will
attract most attention. There, Mr Jorg Haider, the controversial leader of
the right-wing Freedom party (FPO), will try to recapture his governor's
chair after being forced out of it more than two years ago following a
speech in which he appeared to endorse Nazi employment policies.
Mr Haider's blend of youthful populism and nationalism has been a magnet for
those disenchanted with the political establishment. After he had become
party chairman in 1986, the FPO's share of the vote rose from under 10 per
cent to almost 17 per cent in the 1990 general election. There are signs
that support for Mr Haider may have peaked, and a clear victory in Carinthia
would give him a fresh impetus for the general election that is due in
October at the latest.
At stake will be the maintenance of the the current ruling 'grand coalition'
of the Democratic Socialist party (SPO) and the conservative People's party
(OVP), both of which have seen their popularity decline in recent years. In
addition to Mr Haider, they now face another challenge from the newly
created Liberal Forum. 'The liberals are a threat to all of us, but not to
Haider,' says Mr Erhard Busek, vice-chancellor and OVP leader.
The Liberals make strange opponents. They have only the bare bones of an
organisation (to be fleshed out at their first national congress in
November), little money, less than a handful of members of parliament, and
they have yet to agree on a programme.
But this did not prevent them from making a dramatic entrance on the
political scene by winning 5.1 per cent of the vote in last May's provincial
elections in Lower Austria, giving them three seats in the provincial
parliament. Their success, less than three months after the party's birth,
stunned the political establishment.
The Liberals enticed voters away from the government parties, drew support
that otherwise might have gone to the FPO, and won an unusually high
proportion of women voters. Ms Heide Schmidt, the Liberal leader, hopes to
repeat the performance in forthcoming elections. Some pollsters forecast
that the Liberals could win up to 10 per cent of the vote in the general
election, giving the party 15-20 seats, and making possible a coalition with
the SPO which currently holds 79 of the parliament's 183 seats.
Ironically, it was Mr Haider who precipitated the creation of the Liberal
Forum which is now stealing some of the wind out of his sails. His launch of
an inflammatory anti-immigration campaign in January was the last straw for
a small band of liberals still in the FPO. Most liberals had either been
forced out of the party or left in disgust at Mr Haider's policies. Under
the wing of Ms Schmidt, who gained national prominence and respect as FPO
candidate in the 1992 presidential elections, a small group decided to form
their own party.
The OVP stands to lose most from a liberal breakthrough, though Mr Busek,
says there are no realistic alternatives to the current grand coalition. The
coalition is not popular with all conservatives, some of whom have toyed
with the idea of an alliance with the Freedom party. But Mr Busek is adamant
that an OVP coalition with Mr Haider's FPO is out of the question on
political grounds, while one with the Liberals could not gather enough
support in parliament. The OVP has 60 seats in parliament, and on present
standing looks unlikely to improve much on that score. Mr Busek says the
conservatives will campaign for the maintenance of the coalition with the
socialists as the best guarantee for stability and security.
Ms Schmidt believes another grand coalition is the most likely outcome.
'It's not a good thing (for Austria), but it's the reality.' She says the
coalition failed to carry out necessary reforms. 'Nothing has happened, only
cosmetic changes.'
Mr Franz Vranitzky, the chancellor and SPO leader, dismisses the suggestion.
'There have been more reforms in the past three years than at any other time
(in modern Austrian history), but not all necessary reforms are popular.' He
believes dissatisfaction with the ruling parties is part of an international
trend affecting all mainstream parties.
Before the general election, in June or July, Austrians may have to vote in
a referendum on EC membership - provided negotiations are concluded rapidly
enough. If not, the referendum will take place in 1995. The ruling parties
and the Liberals firmly support membership, with opposition from the Greens,
and an ambivalent attitude from Mr Haider's FPO. But in spite of a cooling
in popular enthusiasm for the EC, membership should not be a major issue in
the election, unless the negotiations turn sour. 'I don't think it makes
sense to speculate. We must concentrate on the negotiations and do our
homework,' Mr Vranitzky says.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Austria (5): State ventures flounder - Ian Rodger
examines industrial policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHATEVER shreds of credibility Austria's nationalised industries retained,
following the financial collapse of the old Voest-Alpine steel and
engineering group in 1985, have been ripped away in the past few months.
Even partially privatised OMV, the previously high performing and much
respected integrated oil and chemicals group, has come unstuck. A forecast
of modest profits made by management at the end of April had to be withdrawn
in early September, when it became obvious that a Sch4.7bn loss for the full
year loomed.
But the worst disaster has been at Austria Metall (AMAG), the integrated
aluminium group within the Austrian Industries combine. Given their heads in
the late 1980s, AMAG managers invested heavily in both upstream and
downstream ventures, leaving themselves with no resources to cope with the
slump that has hit the world aluminium sector in the past two years.
Over the past year, assessments of the scale of the debacle at AMAG have
risen by the month. In the typical Austrian way, these have trickled out by
way of leaks to the press. First, it was Sch2bn, then Sch4bn, then Sch7bn.
The final bill to close down most of AMAG - for that is the only solution -
seems to have topped out during the summer at Sch13bn.
The throughly embarrassed government - both its Democratic Socialist and
Conservative wings - now seeks only to get rid of the albatrosses that still
cling heavily to its neck as quickly and quietly as possible.
'What was an asset for the trade unions and the Democratic Socialist Party
has become a burden,' Mr Ferdinand Lacina, the socialist finance minister,
admits.
Believers in state involvement in industry in Austria are now exceptionally
thin on the ground. Mr Lacina makes no bones about his own crossing of the
ideological Rubicon. 'I have to confess that I really changed my mind,' he
says.
The minister responsible for state industries in 1985, when an
over-exuberant Voest-Alpine trading subsidiary lost Sch1bn speculating in
oil contracts, Mr Lacina has come to believe that the state is inevitably
handicapped as an owner of industry.
'It is not easy for the government to have an arm's length relationship with
these companies. No politician could have assessed the value of AMAG's
investments. But now politicians are blamed,' he says.
It would be difficult to exaggerate the importance of this watershed. State
ownership of industry has been a way of life in post-war Austria, initially
because it was the only way the Russian occupiers, fearful of
re-nazification, would allow the country to recover control of its
production assets.
Thus, virtually every key industrial sector has been controlled directly by
the government or by one or more of the leading banks, which themselves have
been controlled in the public sector.
Gradually, enterprise became part of the infamous Proporz system, by which
the Socialists and Conservatives shared out jobs among their supporters, and
thus a way of life.
Today, while the Proporz system is still in effect at the highest levels of
industry and finance, it has collapsed at most other levels. In a cold world
of free and open competition, competence and qualifications have come to be
seen as more important than political affiliation.
Thus, the political parties have less and less interest in clinging on to
these businesses, regardless of their financial performance.
Privatisation has been a live theme in Austrian politics since the
mid-1980s. An initial wave saw the flotation of significant minority stakes
in Creditanstalt, the former Landerbank, OMV and the utilities Verbund and
EVN. But a nervous Austrian establishment made sure that the state remained
firmly in control.
Hopes for a more substantial push were vested mainly in Austrian Industries,
the vehicle that had been established in 1986 to recapitalise and
restructure Voest-Alpine.
AI had a very good run for a few years, eliminating thousands of redundant
jobs, selling off several non-strategic holdings and emerging into profit
for three years up to 1991. As early as 1989, plans for privatisation were
being prepared, and even a convertible bond issue was launched.
Then suddenly all went sour again; first, because OMV, which had also been
put under AI's wing, tumbled into loss in the first half of last year.
Officials hoped they could preserve AI's potential saleability by putting
OMV back under the direct control of the Austrian state holding company,
Oesterreichische Industrieholding (OIAG). But then came the AMAG debacle.
Now the rush is on to sell off whatever can be sold.
In the past year or so, two sparkling subsidiaries of AI, Voest-Alpine
Eisenbahnsysteme and Austria Mikro Systeme, have been successfully floated
on the stock market, as has a minority of shares of Flughafen Wien (Vienna
airport).
Negotiations are at an advanced stage for a foreign government or integrated
oil company to take a strategic stake in OMV, although putting a valuation
on it has become problematic in the wake of the oil group's latest setbacks.
And a sale of the government's 49 per cent stake in Creditanstalt is thought
to be imminent.
AI itself is being readied for flotation. Stripped of its AMAG burdens and
other non-core subsidiaries, it would be a strong steel and
steel-engineering business that could attract international investment
interest, London investment bankers SG Warburg said last month.
The key, however, is for the government to underwrite the AMAG burdens until
proceeds from the sales of other assets can cover them. That is a hot potato
in Austrian politics, as Conservatives fear that the Socialist-led coalition
government will go back on its promise not to pour any more public money
into the nationalised industries.
'It is very clear that there is a credibility gap,' Mr Lacina says. We well
have to make sure that the guarantee is written very carefully.'
Even when and if all these privatisation projects are completed, much more
needs to be done to untangle the close links between Austrian industry,
banks and government. The national government still owns a tobacco monopoly,
a casino operator and the national telephone and railway systems.
The big banks still have controlling stakes in several leading industrial
companies, although Creditanstalt has recently committed itself to getting
rid of most of its holdings over a five to 10 year period.
Then there is the city of Vienna with vast holdings in a bizarre mixture
including Bank Austria, the country's largest bank, and chains of cinemas
and restaurants. Vienna is still run by old-style socialists and shows no
sign of bowing to the privatisation fad.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (2): The miracle seems to have faded -
After the economic reforms, growth has begun to slow down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Mexican economic miracle is looking less miraculous of late. The
government can claim success in the battle against inflation: it should fall
to 8 per cent or less this year from around 12 per cent last year. It has
also managed to reverse the worrying growth of the current account deficit -
from Dollars 22.8bn in 1992 it should fall to around Dollars 20bn this year.
But this has come against a background of slowing economic growth. After
three years in which the economy expanded by more than 3 per cent, growth
slowed to 2.6 per cent last year and to under 2 per cent this year, falling
short of population growth for the first time since the election year of
1988.
Next year, thanks in part to a modest fiscal stimulus, the government is
forecasting growth of 3 per cent. But this forecast looks at risk if the
North American Free Trade Agreement is not ratified. Without the treaty -
and assuming no big devaluation - higher interest rates will almost
certainly bog down the economy.
Seven years of economic reform then have yielded some results: President
Carlos Salinas this month emphasised that investment had increased in his
administration - from 17 per cent of GDP in 1988 to 22 per cent in 1992 -
and that labour productivity had gone up by 19 per cent in the last three
years.
But there has been no take-off in growth. Some economists suggest this is a
matter of time. Growth has been slow, they suggest, because of the rate in
which the old capital stock has been destroyed by the opening of the economy
since 1985 to the world markets.
'The process of reform has been more profound than previously estimated.
That means that the economy was more inefficient before than anybody
imagined - including the private sector,' said Mr Guillermo Ortiz,
under-minister of finance.
While some economists argue that the rapid exhaustion of the country's old
productive base may suggest that the trade liberalisation was too rapid,
others place more emphasis on what the government has not done rather than
what it may have done too quickly. There remain, says this group,
significant bottlenecks to growth. These include poor infrastructure and a
deregulation process which has yet to reach the state and local government
level. They also blame a rigid labour market, a corrupt and inefficient
judicial system which does not allow the enforcement of contracts and, above
all, the high cost of bank credit.
One pro-reformofficial argues that fundamental reform of the state-run
electricity sector and the railroads is needed in the next six-year
administration. The social security system is 'a time bomb for the next six
years.' He adds: 'If the labour market is not deregulated, social security
and health is not dealt with and infrastructure is not improved, we will
have problems.'
Whatever the case, the weakness of the economy in the face of reasonably
high levels of investment - at least until this year when uncertainty
surrounding Nafta inhibited it - coupled with insufficient levels of
domestic savings, means Mexico will continue to depend heavily on foreign
capital for some time to come. That being so, the room for manoeuvre in
macroeconomic policy in the next administration will not be large, since
international investors can be expected quickly to react adversely to
economic policy of which they disapprove.
The growth slowdown has other causes, slow world growth being one. From this
perspective, some officials argue that Mexico's private sector performance
looks less weak. Non-oil exports growing at an annualised 15 per cent in the
first half of the year compared with world export growth of 0.2 per cent.
Meanwhile, imports grew at an annualised 7.4 per cent rate. This has helped
to bring down the current account this year, although some officials say
that, if next year's higher growth materialises, the current account may
again widen.
Lower inflation may also have had an impact on business. Inflation has
fallen faster than many businesses expected. This has left companies paying
higher salaries than justified by inflation and has increased the real rate
of interest which they are paying for credit. This has squeezed
profitability and led them to reduce production. 'This was the first time in
many years in which it proved costly to many companies not to believe the
government's forecasts,' says one government economist.
The slowdown was worsened further by the behaviour of the banks. Not only
did high real rates of interest curb borrowing, but at the end of March,
says one monetary official, many banks in effect stopped lending to the
private sector - so they could repair the damage caused by bad debt
problems. Since the first quarter, interest rates have fallen faster than
inflation, with interbank rates falling from 23 per cent in February to
below 16 per cent.
With interest rates falling and companies now accustomed to lower inflation,
the government is expecting the economy to pick up in the fourth quarter of
this year. This should be helped, officials say, by the modest fiscal
stimulus agreed in the annual pact between the government, business and the
trade unions.
This year's pact has several novel features: it brings down the annual
salary increase to 5 per cent for next year, but allows for settlements
above that in cases where productivity justifies it. Minimum salaries will
rise by the same amount, but a negative income tax will raise take-home pay
by close to 17 per cent for those on the minimum wage.
The fiscal stimulus will come with the government's plan to balance its
budget next year. This year the fiscal surplus was forecast at 1.7 per cent,
but is now likely, say officials, to turn out at around 1.1 per cent, with
part of the difference accounted for by lower oil prices. 'Because of the
surplus, we'll be able to stimulate the economy without having to worry
about inflation,' says Mr Ortiz of the finance ministry.
If fiscal policy has been conservative, monetary policy has - says the
central bank - been neutral: with an exchange rate target, it can do little
but accommodate the demand for money. Although growth in the monetary base
has been a modest 4.8 per cent in the year to August, below inflation, the
central bank says changes in the cheque clearing system at the end of March
suggest the monetary base has effectively grown close to 10 per cent.
However, to some observers, monetary policy looks tight and for good reason:
the government is anxious to avoid the kind of speculative attack on the
peso that will force its hand on the exchange rate. 'One way to kill
speculation is to dry up liquidity,' said Rogelio Ramirez de la O, of the
economic consultancy Ecanal. The central bank has done this and has
continued ensure that technically speculators cannot attack the peso by
selling it short. Short selling implies the selling of a currency by those
who do not own it.
The exchange rate has been essentially stable since the start of the year
within a band which widens daily. At the end of this year, the permitted
fluctuation will be 9.1 per cent. The exchange rate, widely considered to be
overvalued, is in many ways the Achilles heel of the government's
steady-as-she-goes economic policy in an election year. It looks to some
economists particularly vulnerable if Nafta is not passed.
Officials say they are determined to avoid the financial crises in their
last year of office that plagued the previous three administrations. And
they say (as they obviously would) that they will not use a deliberate
exchange rate depreciation to stimulate the economy. 'We'd rather have zero
growth and no devaluation than 3 per cent growth and a devaluation,' says a
senior government advisor.
To help it withstand a speculative attack, the government also has foreign
exchange reserves of record levels - Dollars 23.02bn at end-October - which
exceed the monetary base. Officials also say that the maturity of the
peso-denominated debt held by foreigners has lengthened in the past two
years - implying greater capital losses for those who wish to sell assets to
attack the peso.
Officials point out that the current account deficit remains more than
financed by capital inflows, as shown by rising foreign exchange reserves
and falling market interest rates. If the financial markets are getting
nervous about the failure of Nafta, there is as yet no obvious sign of it.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Austria (1): New voters hold the key - The coming
year will see a national election, four provincial elections and probably a
referendum on EC entry. Not since the 1950s has the country been faced with
the prospect of such profound change within such a short period of time
</HEADLINE>

AS A rule, things do not happen abruptly in genteel Austria. But people may
well look back in a couple of years and be surprised by how much and how
quickly the country has changed.
By then, Austria could be a member of the European Community and an active
participant in pan-European security organisations and United Nations
peacekeeping efforts.
By then, the cosy political alliance between the Social Democratic party
(SPO) and the conservative Austrian People's party (OVP) may have collapsed,
as a new generation of voters appears to be abandoning traditional
loyalties.
The country's leading industries and banks could be fully privatised and
freed from the stifling practice of having to assign top jobs on the basis
of political suitability. The industrial structure will certainly have
changed, as low value-added businesses are forced to migrate east.
By then, Vienna, a sleepy and marginal city since the collapse of the
Austro-Hungarian empire in 1918, could again be a vibrant centre of a
vigorous central European region.
Not since the 1950s, when it managed to see off the four occupying allied
powers, has Austria faced the prospect of such profound changes within a
short period of time.
The country's new coming of age dates symbolically from the retirement of Mr
Kurt Waldheim as national president in July, 1992. As long as Mr Waldheim,
who concealed his service in a German Wehrmacht unit that was implicated in
second world war crimes, was in office, Austria was diplomatically crippled.
His successor, Mr Thomas Klestil, a former senior diplomat, has moved
rapidly in the past year to re-establish ties with countries that boycotted
Austria, and the government has assumed a higher profile generally in
international affairs.
In June, Vienna hosted the UN human rights conference, and earlier this
month it welcomed leaders from 32 countries to a summit meeting of the
Council of Europe. Also in June, Mr Franz Vranitzky, the chancellor, became
the first Austrian head of government to visit Israel; and he made clear
that this was 'an important and significant signal to the world of how we
Austrians see ourselves and our history.'
In another landmark move, Mr Werner Fasslabend, the defence minister, went
to Brussels last month to discuss Austria, hitherto rigidly neutral, taking
observer status in the Western European Union.
Now the country faces a year of momentous political decisions, with a
national election, four provincial elections and probably a national
referendum on EC entry in prospect.
Both Austrian and EC leaders are publicly committed to completing
negotiations on EC entry by early next year. The idea is that an agreement
could be approved by the European Parliament before that body dissolves in
the spring, and then could be submitted to the Austrian people in a
referendum later in the year.
The timing of the referendum is a delicate matter. Opposition to the EC is
still strong, so if the national election is held before the referendum, EC
entry could become a prominent and divisive issue in the election campaign.
On the other hand, if the referendum is held first and a majority rejects EC
membership, the ruling coalition, which is solidly in favour of membership,
would be crippled heading into the election campaign.
It is by no means clear that the grand coalition can survive the next
election, anyway. Recent elections and polls indicate that the popularity of
both the SPO and the OVP continues to fall, while the three smaller parties,
the right-wing Freedom party, the Greens and the new Liberal Forum, are
gaining ground.
'Anything can happen,' says Mr Erhard Busek, vice-chancellor and leader of
the OVP, junior partner in the coalition. The OVP's vote share tumbled from
41 per cent in 1986 to 32 per cent in 1990, and Mr Busek is resigned to
further losses next year.
But he believes the coalition will survive. 'The combination of the other
parties could not make a government, either in numbers or in ideology,' he
says. The ever-cautious Mr Vranitzky says only, 'Some Sunday night in
October we will see.'
Since the last election, the main political issue in Austria has been
immigration, as people have become more and more anxious about the flood of
immigrants and refugees from eastern Europe. Immigrants and refugees, both
legal and illegal, now account for about 9 per cent of the Austrian
population, and are concentrated mainly in Vienna and other cities.
Mr Jorg Haider, leader of the Freedom party, has won immense popularity by
demanding that the government get tougher on immigrants. His party's share
of the vote in recent provincial elections has risen to nearly 20 per cent,
double its mid-1980s appeal.
However, it looks as if the Haider advance has stopped. His petition
campaign in January, aimed at forcing the government to outlaw immigration,
was soundly defeated. A month later, he was further embarrassed when a few
of his more liberal-minded colleagues defected to set up the Liberal Forum.
In recent months, the government has taken the remaining wind out of his
sails by putting a temporary freeze on immigration, ostensibly because of
the slump in the economy.
The next indication of the strength of the immigration issue and of Mr
Haider's popularity will come in March, when he contests the provincial
election in Carinthia, where he used to be governor.
In spite of the proximity of all these votes, there is as yet little
evidence of a pre-election atmosphere in Austria. Perhaps the rather dull
outlook for the economy has put a damper on political sentiment. In its
latest forecast on October 1, the Austrian Institute of Economic Research
(WIFO) said the economy would contract by 0.7 per cent this year and grow by
only 1.5 per cent next year.
'It does not appear that the bottom of the economic cycle has been reached,'
WIFO reported glumly, pointing to continuing weakness in the vital German
market for Austrian exports.
Another source of disappointment has been dramatic reverses recently in the
nationalised industries. Austria Metall, the aluminium group, looks set
alone to lose a numbing Sch13bn by the time its affairs are restored to
order next year.
The silver lining to these reverses is that the government has at last
become committed to selling off its still vast holdings in leading
industrial and banking groups, and to creating fair and open capital
markets.
The Austrian business community has warmly embraced these policy changes. A
new generation of ambitious, outward-looking managers is emerging, eager to
compete in open markets for both business and investors.
Within a couple of years, it will be interesting to see how well they are
doing.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Austria (2): Inflation still proves stubborn - The
economy: recovery largely depends on Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SUDDEN onset, at the end of last year, of the country's worst recession
for more than a decade took most Austrians by surprise, and caused an
uncharacteristic outpouring of gloomy forecasts.
But while the recession was real enough, causing a 4 per cent decline in
industrial output and an even sharper 8 per cent drop in manufacturing
exports in the first half of 1993, its impact has been far less pronounced
than for most of Austria's OECD partners.
Austria's recession came later, and the country is likely to emerge from it
more rapidly than its western neighbours, though recovery will largely
depend on developments in Germany - Austria's most important trading partner
and its main source of revenues from tourism.
As hopes receded that Austria would somehow avoid the Europe-wide recession,
growth estimates were hastily revised downwards. Gross domestic product was
forecast to decline by around 1 per cent this year, though economists now
believe the economy has bottomed out and that GDP will fall by a more modest
0.75 per cent.
'The decline stopped in the spring, and since then we've been stagnating.
Industrial exports have been worse hit, but construction, tourism and
private consumption have held up,' says Mr Helmut Kramer director of the
Austrian Institute of Economic Research (Wifo).
Several factors exacerbated the downturn. After a rapid rise in exports to
the former communist states, rising competition from low-cost producers in
these countries began to take its toll on Austrian manufacturers, forcing
the government to impose import restrictions on sensitive products such as
cement and fertilisers. Exporters also suffered from the effective
revaluation of the Schilling last autumn, following the devaluation of
several European currencies.
The consequence was a further deterioration in the trade balance, which is
forecast to show a Sch109bn deficit, compared with a Sch106.4bn deficit last
year. Exports will fall by 5.5 per cent and imports by 3.5 per cent, but the
current account is expected to show a small surplus as income from tourism
and services offsets the deficit in traded goods.
Inflation is also proving more difficult to tame than anticipated. Consumer
prices are set to rise by 3.5 per cent this year, after peaking at 4.1 per
cent in 1992, though that included about half a percentage point caused by
changes in indirect taxation. Inflation should fall to around 3 per cent
next year, thanks to moderate wage rises.
A resilient budget deficit adds to inflationary pressures. Lower tax
revenues, caused by the recession and higher spending on social security and
unemployment benefits, will increase it from Sch62bn in 1992 to about
Sch80bn, representing about 3.8 per cent of GDP this year.
Hoped-for relief, in the form of revenues from privatisations, have not
materialised as the process has faced repeated delays. But a renewed crisis
at Austrian Industries, the large state-owned industrial group, is likely to
prompt the government to sell off a large part of it next year.
The government remains committed to its deficit reduction strategy, albeit
at a slower pace, and Mr Ferdinand Lacina, finance minister, hopes to keep
the deficit below Sch80bn next year. This may prove difficult if the
recovery is delayed by external factors. 'We have to be prepared for another
year of weak economic performance. The effects of recession will also be
felt in 1994, but we have to put on the brakes,' he says.
But there will be no shock treatment with dramatic cuts in spending. 'Lower
deficits will be possible when the recovery comes,' Mr Lacina says. Social
programmes to soften the recession's impact will be maintained, and the
government will seek to encourage employment by accelerating planned
spending on infrastructure. 'If you have a high number of unemployed at the
start of an economic upturn, it's not easy to bring (the number) down.'
Better to try to control unemployment before a recovery, even if that means
some additional costs, he suggests.
Nevertheless, unemployment is rising and is expected to be 4.7 per cent of
the workforce by the end of this year, according to OECD measurements, and
around 7 per cent based on the narrower Austrian definition which does not
include the self-employed.
The fear of job losses and competition from low-paid foreign workers, who
now account for 8.5 per cent of the workforce, has encouraged wage
moderation. The example of the metal workers' unions, which recently agreed
to wage rises of 2.9 per cent for 1994, is expected to be followed by other
unions.
Mrs Maria Schaumayer, president of the Austrian National Bank, says low wage
rises, combined with greater flexibility to determine the extent of pay
increases at the level of individual enterprises, will have a significant
effect on small and medium-size companies which are not directly represented
in the national wage negotiations. 'It gives a safety net (for workers),
together with much needed deregulation (for employers),' she says.
Growth is forecast to resume next year with GDP rising by only a modest 1.5
per cent, but Mrs Schaumayer sees three reasons for optimism and a 'velvet
landing'. Private consumption will be encouraged by tax reforms;
construction activity has recovered from its winter lull; and exports are
picking up again. Austrian companies are also increasing their investment
abroad, improving their competitiveness in foreign markets. 'This is an
ongoing trend. Most investments seem to be profitable, and the propensity to
internationalise is rising,' she says.
The tax reforms that will come fully into force on January 1 are expected to
stimulate business and boost consumer demand, hopefully leading to a rise in
investment which is set to decline by around 3 per cent this year. The
reforms eliminate several profit-based taxes, raise the main corporate tax
from 30 to 34 per cent, and simplify other taxes. On average, the overall
level of profit-based taxes will go down by 10 per cent. Officials believe
the relatively low level of corporate taxation should encourage foreign
investment.
Mr Kramer says there has been a steady improvement in the competitive
position of Austrian companies in the open sectors of the economy. 'The
productivity of capital is two percentage points higher in Austria than in
Germany,' he says. But further improvements and restructuring will be
necessary to meet rising international competition and the challenge posed
by low-cost producers in the former communist countries.
Mr Johann Farnleitner, deputy general secretary of the Federal Economic
Chamber, believes the opening up of eastern Europe offers a unique
opportunity. He says Austrian companies will gain competitiveness by
shifting part of their production to neighbouring low labour cost economies.
Already some 8,000 Austrian companies have joint ventures in the region.
Among OECD countries, Austria has the highest share of its trade with the
former communist countries, which account for 7 per cent of its imports and
12 per cent of its exports. Mr Farnleitner believes trade with central and
eastern Europe could grow to 15-20 per cent of total Austrian trade in a few
years' time.
Meanwhile, the recession has encouraged businesses to intensify efforts to
adapt to the new environment, and Austria's bumpy ride at the bottom of its
economic cycle will be made smoother by policies emphasising consensus. 'We
are gradualists. It is more sustainable,' says Mrs Schaumayer.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (1): Reform awaits its reward - President
Salinas denies he has overemphasised the North American Free Trade
Agreement, although he is depending on its passage. But Nafta is no panacea
for the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas would probably have wanted it another way. As he
ends the fifth year of his six in office, the Mexican economy is showing
only sluggish growth and his efforts to secure a free trade agreement with
US and Canada depend precariously on the US Congress.
The North American Free Trade Agreement, which was to guarantee continuity
in economic policy and thereby cement Mexico's stability, has so far only
succeeded in creating uncertainty. The treaty has been identified with the
president so profoundly that its loss would be a severe personal blow.
'President Salinas bet the store on Nafta,' says Mr Jorge Castaneda, an
academic and a critic of the government, writing in the latest issue of
Foreign Affairs, 'and if passage is his triumph, rejection or delay is his
defeat.'
But just as Nafta's passage would be no panacea for Mexico's economic ills,
its collapse - while significant - would not necessarily be disastrous. Good
macroeconomic management - a hallmark of the Salinas presidency - has
lowered the budget deficit and inflation and increased foreign exchange
reserves, all of which should cushion the economy from the worst of the
shocks.
If Nafta does fail, however, prospects for growth will be diminished in the
short and medium terms. Interest rates would probably have to rise - hurting
growth - to ensure that capital flows stayed intact in the immediate
aftermath of a defeat. In the medium term, foreign direct investment and
other flows would likely be lower, suggesting a slower growth track.
Government officials say their immediate reaction to Nafta's failure would
be to allow interest rates to take the strain, and that they are
contemplating no devaluation to speed up growth. Still, big speculative
outflows could endanger this outcome and in any case no government
advertises devaluations in advance.
Mr Salinas denies that he has overemphasised Nafta and says his
administration's other reforms show it is 'not the only thing going on in
Mexico'. Apart from the agreement with the US, Mexico is also negotiating
trade pacts in other parts of the world and expects next year to join the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
If Nafta fails, Mr Salinas says, however, that the chances of another
agreement 'would be out for several generations'. After more than three
years of negotiations, and following the uncertainty over the treaty
generated by the US recession and the change in administration, he adds: 'We
have learned that the worst moment to negotiate a trade agreement is during
a recession and an election.'
The treaty's defeat would affect next year's presidential campaign. Slower
growth would weaken the government by leaving in doubt the overall success
of its economic policies. Meanwhile, a nationalist backlash could well hurt
relations with the US and put pressure on the presidential candidate of the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has held power for
more than six decades.
While the PRI will continue to have significant advantages over the
opposition in the elections, its ability to rig the vote has been
constrained - some political observers say to an important extent - by
electoral reforms pushed through in the Salinas presidency. 'With the new
rules for the election, it makes a different range of scenarios possible
from those we have seen in the past. I don't believe it will be possible to
manufacture elections as in the past. It's not a perfect reform but if it
applies next year, it does imply clean elections,' says Mr Federico Estevez
of ITAM, a private university in Mexico City.
Not everybody agrees: the left-wing opposition Democratic Revolutionary
Party (PRD) has criticised the reform, calling attention to the predominance
of PRI officials on the supposedly independent electoral commissions running
the ballot at federal and state level. Its candidate Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas
describes the changes as 'a backward step'.
With the right-wing PAN opposition not viewed as having a strong
presidential contender for 1994, the anti-government protest vote is likely
to coalesce around Mr Cardenas. This suggests that the elections will again
be criticised, after the fact, as fraudulent by the opposition. The closer
the result is - and it is widely assumed that Nafta's rejection will aid the
opposition - the more these complaints would resonate. This would again
raise questions - as they were raised by Mr Salinas's victory in 1988 -
about the legitimacy of the administration.
'For a democratic election to occur, all major parties in a country must
accept the process and respect the results,' said a report from the Carter
Centre of former US President Jimmy Carter last month. 'Mexico has not yet
reached the point where that is the case.'
Thus, in a continent of elected governments, Mexico's continues to be
coloured by allegations of electoral fraud and authoritarianism. The
uncertainty generated by the election - even when most people assume they
know who will win - indicates not the strength of its authoritarian system
but its weakness.
The power of the Mexican executive was also once commonly seen as a help in
pushing through unpopular economic reforms in the early stage of the reform
process. If that were ever the case, there is increasing doubt about it now.
Some economists in Mexico are beginning to see the power of the executive as
an obstacle to further development.
In a number of areas, flaws that stem from the autocratic nature of Mexican
government are seen as having important economic consequences. The fact that
the judiciary is subordinate to the executive underlines the weakness of the
rule of law, and reinforces the discretionary and arbitrary nature of
judicial decision-making. This not only increases cynicism about the legal
system, it makes problematic the enforcement of contracts in Mexican courts.
Furthermore, it means there is no guarantee that intell-ectually-sound,
well-drafted laws - for example, that on competition policy which came into
force this year - will ever be executed in practice, or that those with
friends in high places will not be able to circumvent them.
The next stage of development 'has to do with creating a proper legal
system, developing the accountability of government and making it possible
for small companies to prosper', says Mr Luis Rubio, head of a development
research group in Mexico City.
The importance of a functioning legal system as a countervailing influence
to government has not been diminished by the Salinas administration reforms
which have reduced the size of the state. Privatisations have enabled the
government to lower its budget deficit to tackle inflation and have helped
it to finance a more effective anti-poverty programme, but they have not
spread economic power. 'I'm concerned about the creation of new vested
interests, a new oligarchy,' says Mr Rubio.
Furthermore, partly because the judicial system does not have a role in
calling government servants to account, corruption in government remains an
important issue, and not one merely restricted to its lower echelons. When
an agent acting for IBM claimed this year that he was asked for a bribe to
secure an air traffic control contract, his allegations were never proved
but he was widely believed.
Some senior government officials believe strongly that the weakness of the
legal system is an important economic problem that will have to be addressed
by the next administration. Meanwhile, the government has begun to address
other economic constraints. For example, bank privatisation does not seem to
have ensured full competition in the banking system, even though there are
18 banks. The high cost of credit is one of the main constraints to the
development of small- and medium-sized business. The government has started
to attack this - in part by increasing competition from banks outside Mexico
 -but nobody believes a solution will be rapid.
Furthermore, while efforts to deregulate at a federal level have been
impressive, there has been much less change in state and municipal
dereg-ulation. Mr Jaime Serra Puche, trade and industrial development
minister, says: 'We have been successful at the federal government level,
but have a lot to do at the state level. At the local level we have not been
that successful.'
Other officials see the labour law and the social security legislation as in
dire need of change. 'The social security system is the time bomb for the
next administration,' said one senior official.
The incomplete nature of reform at a microeconomic level is often offered as
an explanation of why growth has not been faster: growth of less than 2 per
cent will generate this year a current account deficit of Dollars 20bn, 6
per cent of GDP.
A further explanation for slow growth - not necessarily contradictory - is
that the government and the private sector underestimated the inefficiency
of the economy before the it was opened to the outside world.
This has rendered the existing capital stock obsolete far more quickly than
expected: growing against this backdrop is rather like rowing against the
current.
Yet mounting evidence of increased productivity suggests reform has not been
in vain.
Mr Salinas said this month that labour productivity had increased by 19 per
cent in the last three years.
Yet, with or without Nafta, Mexico is still likely to remain dependent on
foreign capital for some time to come. In reality, this leaves little room
for manoeuvre in macro-economic policy for any future government.
'On the economy, there is little that they can tinker with because the
markets will react the minute they perceive that reform is threatened. The
Mexican economy is like a bicycle: if they don't keep pedalling they will
fall off,' says Mr Rubio.
Asked how he wants to end his presidency, Mr Salinas replied: 'I'm working
towards ending my administration with economic growth, with price stability
and with a social consensus that would confirm that it was worth the process
of reform to which we have been committed in the last five years.'
Achieving this will depend in part on Nafta's ratification. History may show
Mr Salinas as having exceeded expec-tations in his pursuit of economic
reform.
Politically, however, he will probably be seen as being more firmly in the
PRI tradition than he was often perceived, certainly outside Mexico.
He has used fully the powers of his office in this most centralised of
states and his concessions to opponents have emphasised, rather than
tempered, the continuing power of the executive.
If, as expected, he follows convention, he will choose his party's candidate
for the elections scheduled for next August.
It seems likely - though not inevitable - that the fate of Nafta will be
decided before he has to make the choice.
While education minister, Mr Ernesto Zedillo, is regarded by some as an
outsider with a good chance, there are three front runners: Mr Manuel
Camacho, the mayor of Mexico City, finance minister, Mr Pedro Aspe, and Mr
Luis Donaldo Colosio, the social development minister.
Mr Camacho is known to favour political reform and is regarded as a
political conciliator: his drawback is that he is regarded, rightly or
wrongly, as likely to frighten foreign capital.
Mr Aspe is seen as ensuring that Mexico remains in the good books of
international investors, but he is viewed in the party as an economic
fundamentalist and therefore somewhat dangerous. Party officials also
suggest he would be the weakest of the main candidates as a campaigner.
Conventional wisdom has it, however, that Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the
social development minister, is the man most likely to succeed Mr Salinas.
Mr Colosio is viewed as Mr Salinas's 'son', the man the president can most
trust.
Mr Colosio is taken as the candidate with neither the drawbacks of Mr
Camacho nor of Mr Aspe, and the one most likely to carry Mr Salinas's style
of government to the new century.

FT  10 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Food retailers dull
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was further depressing news in the food retail sector as Smith New
Court, the stockbroker, reduced profits forecasts for the leading
supermarket groups. In a major review of the market, Smith went further down
the negative track than any other broker so far in suggesting that the
sector will see virtually nil earnings growth in the 1994-95 financial year.
The house, which blamed the recent round of price competition for its move,
was previously looking for earnings growth of 7 to 8 per cent.
Supermarket shares steadied yesterday, although dealers said this was only a
temporary halt, with few signs of buying around. Of the leaders, brisk
trading saw Argyll Group stay at 257p with 10m dealt, J. Sainsbury added 2
1/2 at 368 1/2 p in volume of 6.4m, and Tesco slipped 2 to 184p in turnover
of 7.1m.
A downgrade from Cazenove on First Leisure was said to be responsible for
the shares tumbling 20 to 257p. The broker, which has a policy of not
commenting on market rumours, was said to have cut its forecast from Pounds
38m to Pounds 36m. The market range is Pounds 38m to Pounds 41m.
Forte outshone the market for a second session, with reports of management
changes at the Savoy Group possibly responsible. Forte has a majority of
shares in the hotel group but a minority of the votes. Forte gained 5 at
224p and Savoy held at 790p.
Tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT Industries rose 13 to 491p as the end
of the tobacco price war in the US was marked by a price rise from RJR
Nabisco. Its subsidiary RJ Reynolds Tobacco raised cigarette prices to
wholesalers by 40 cents a pack.
Conglomerate Hanson, which generates much of its profits in the US, was
helped by a rise in the US stock market and also by buying of call options,
derivatives which give investors the right to buy shares at a fixed price
and date and usually indicate confidence that the share price is set to
rise. The shares put on 5 1/4 at 275 1/2 p.
High street bank National Westminster recovered 8 to 547p in spite of an
announcement that Ulster Bank, its Belfast-based subsidiary, was cutting
variable loan rates in the Republic of Ireland, including mortgages, by  1/2
percentage point to 7.75 per cent.
Drugs group Fisons was weak in a generally stronger sector on consideration
of the company's announcement that it had suspended its West Midlands sales
manager following allegations of unethical sales practices.
Analysts said press allegations that some Fisons salesmen had tried to bribe
doctors into prescribing its asthma drug Tilade had only added to the
problems of a group already struggling with a weak product pipeline.
The shares closed 4 off at 143p, with some additional pressure said to have
come from the first half of a large bed and breakfast trade, a deal in which
shares are sold just before the close of trading and bought back first thing
the next day in order to establish a tax loss.
Elsewhere, Glaxo added 6 at 659p, Wellcome rose 8 to 685p and SmithKline
Beecham 'A' rebounded 13 1/2 to 409p.
In spite of further falls in the price of Brent crude, British Petroleum
gained 8 at 360p on heavy turnover of more than 14m shares.
Analysts said UK institutions who had been left increasingly underweight of
the stock because of persistent US buying had taken the opportunity of a dip
in the price to pick up stock.
Shell Transport rose 4 to 724p ahead of third-quarter figures due tomorrow.
Pittencrieff, the oil and gas group, climbed 18 to 454p as the company
announced it had agreed to acquire an additional 24.8 per cent working
interest in the Patricia gas field in Alberta, Canada, and adjoining assets
for CDollars 6.75m.
The share price of FII, the diversified manufacturer, plunged 61 to 280p
after the company warned that forthcoming profits would be significantly
lower.
A profits warning also hit International Foods. The shares fell 19 to 35p
after the company said a downturn in European and UK business and delays in
some big contracts meant that profits for this year would be 'substantially
below market estimates'.

FT  10 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Stores brighten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Store shares were again a positive feature in the market as two leading
brokers suggested that the sector was in for a bright pre-Christmas run. In
hefty research notes, Hoare Govett and NatWest Securities both argue that
the pick-up in consumer spending - indicated by the most recent consumer
spending statistics - will gain momentum into the Christmas shopping period,
with upside seen for selected stocks with exposure to the traditional
seasonal upswing.
While NatWest has some worries about any dampening effect of the Budget
later this month, Hoare Govett is more bullish. Analyst Ms Emma Burdett
said: 'We believe that the Budget will leave the majority of consumers
little worse off and Christmas trading will show a significant improvement
on last year.'
Both houses favour Kingfisher, up 6 at 646p, Dixons, ahead 2 at 282p, and
MFI, 2 1/2 forward at 143p. NatWest also likes Argos, up 6 1/2 at 345p,
while Hoare recommends Sears, ahead 2 at 117p. However, the two brokers
believe the upswing to be relatively short-lived and take a much more
cautious stance on the sector post the Christmas period.

FT  10 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Brewery pressures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With Whitbread yesterday going unconditional on its offer for the remainder
of the Whitbread Investment Company (WIC), made last month, attention once
again focused on the brewing group's investment intentions. The latest talk
in the market suggests that Whitbread has already been in discussions with
the brewing groups it holds stakes in with a view to selling back its
holdings.
Such a move would be in line with WIC's passive role and save Whitbread the
trouble of unloading its substantial stakes into a weak drinks market,
according to dealers. One analyst also suggested that Whitbread was likely
to use its talks with the various regional brewers to strengthen existing
marketing arrangements and to explore new liaisons.
However, Whitbread is only under pressure to reduce its stakes in two groups
 -Boddington and Marston - to comply with the government's Beer Orders and
could yet drip its stakes back into the market at its leisure. Whitbread's
14.9 per cent stake in Morland would be of great interest to Greene King,
which it failed to buy last year and in which it still holds a 29.3 per cent
holding. Intriguingly, Greene King raised Pounds 15m at the weekend through
the PubCo debenture vehicle.
Share prices in the drinks sector trod water yesterday. Whitbread hardened a
penny to 483p, Marston slipped the same amount to 282p, as did Morland to
518p and Boddington to 255p. Greene King steadied at 569p.

FT  10 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Warburg gain reversed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECENT boom in London's financial markets was underlined yesterday by a
surge in profits for SG Warburg. However, the reaction of investors
suggested that confidence in further rises in equity and bond markets may be
coming to an end.
One analyst said: 'All markets have gone their way, but this is a cyclical
business and Warburg will struggle to maintain momentum.' After hitting a
high of 890p in the morning, Warburg's share price closed 20 lower on the
day at 857p.
However, even the more pessimistic analysts were forced to upgrade forecasts
after Warburg announced first-half profits of Pounds 148.8m, against a
market consensus of Pounds 135m and a profit of Pounds 51.2m last time.
NatWest Securities, which had advised clients to take profits when
opportunities presented themselves, has shifted its full-year forecast to
Pounds 275m from Pounds 248m.
Among the more enthusiastic analysts, Mr Martin Green of Smith New Court
said he would be upgrading to above Pounds 300m, while Mr Martin Cross of
UBS also expected to be around Pounds 300m.
Mr Cross said that if first-half earnings were annualised, that would
indicate an undemanding p/e ratio of 11 times. He added that there were no
signs that the present economic conditions, which had done so much for
financial markets, were about to end.

FT  10 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: US inflation news prompts recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON joined in the general sigh of relief throughout Europe yesterday
afternoon when the US Federal bond market rose strongly following heartening
news on inflation on the other side of the Atlantic. After another nervous,
futures-led session, the FT-SE 100 Index reversed an early fall to end 18.4
up at 3,096.0, the day's best reading. The December contract on the Footsie
cleared 3,100 several times but could not move above 3,105.
Having cleared the first hurdle of the week, the London market is now
waiting for the US consumer price index, to be announced today. UK blue
chips responded readily towards last night's market close to gains in the US
dollar and bond markets, the latter quickly reflected in firmness in British
government bonds.
Equities had opened firmly in London, brushing off the setback in Tokyo and
preferring to respond to the steadier trend on Wall Street. But an early
gain of 14.4 on the Footsie was wiped out when a UK securities house,
apparently turning nervous ahead of the impending statistics from across the
Atlantic, sold the December futures contract heavily.
After dipping to 3,072.2, minus 5.4, the market rallied on the US bond
market's favourable response to the welcome news that US producer prices had
fallen by 0.2 per cent in October, compared with fears of a 0.2 per cent
gain.
The US bond market's worries over inflation provided the basis for last
week's shakeout in equities throughout Europe, so London was happy to follow
the advance achieved yesterday afternoon across the leading European
bourses.
Although market volume jumped smartly towards the close, returning a Seaq
total of 775.5m shares, compared with Monday's 557.7m, traders warned that
the mood remained cautious. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, still a softer target
than the Footsie for bearish strategies, finished 0.9 easier at 3,439.8. On
Monday, when the market struggled to resist the overflow from Friday's
sell-off, retail, or customer, business was worth Pounds 1.3bn.
London traders will be watching overnight for the closing reading on Wall
Street, hoping that a strong close on the Dow Average will propel the
Footsie through the 3,100 mark today.
The dollar's strength encouraged blue chip internationals, with oil issues
standing out very firmly, and only Zeneca remaining out of favour among the
pharmaceuticals. BAT Industries found additional strength from confirmation,
in the form of a move by RJ Reynolds, of the US, that cigarette prices are
likely to rise.
The soothing of inflation fears also restored faith in prospects for a base
rate cut in the UK. Store and consumer shares attracted favourable comment
from brokerage houses and regained their poise, while building and
construction issues returned to centre stage.
Market optimists drew support from evident signs of bed and breakfast
activity, where shares are sold for tax reasons with the intention of
repurchase in the next session.
A rush of such deals yesterday suggested that fund managers are confident
that the stock market shakeout has run its course, at least for the time
being. But the near term outlook for London is still vulnerable to
developments on Wall Street.

<TEXT>
DERIVATIVES markets responded strongly to the good news on US inflation but
appeared to be meeting resistance at the close, writes Terry Byland.
Trading volumes remained high and determined selling by one UK house at
midsession proved enough to bring out the stop-loss orders once again.
The official closing reading showed the December contract on the FT-SE 100
Index at 3,097 for a four-point premium to cash, a sorry outcome against an
estimated fair value of 10. Earlier, the contract had moved erratically,
touching 3,105 several times and clearly seeing resistance at that level.
The midsession sell-off took the contract down to 3,072, where it was
virtually in line with the cash market. Volume in the contract rose sharply
to a final total of just over 14,000 contracts. Independent traders were
busy again but so were some of the big UK investment houses, which were
still covering themselves ahead of US consumer statistics due today.
Volume dropped in traded options from 43,626 lots to 30,800, and attention
turned towards individual stock options. At 14,887 contracts, interest in
the FT-SE option fell smartly from 23,750.
The Euro FT-SE option saw 2,973 lots dealt, but Hanson headed the list of
active stocks options with 2,138. Elsewhere, interest was scattered, with
Thames Water (1,507) and Rolls-Royce (1,076) busy.

FT  10 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Twin boost for Euro-insurers in 1993 -
Portfolio gains and rate increases have combined impressively
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Investors who spotted the potential of European insurance shares towards the
end of last year have seen their holdings appreciate impressively over the
past 12 months.
Shares in some companies, such as Germany's Aachener &amp; Munchener (AMB), have
almost doubled, and across the Continent insurance issues have outperformed
local stock markets.
Between September 15, 1992 and November 5 this year, insurance shares have
risen by 57 per cent, a gain of 13.2 per cent relative to the FT-Actuaries
Europe index as a whole, according to figures produced by BZW Securities.
Since the end of June, insurers have continued to outperform, registering a
14.4 per cent rise compared to a relative gain of 2.5 per cent.
Italian and French companies led the way earlier this year but, over the
last four months, German, Swiss and Dutch insurers have performed more
powerfully, with the prices of German companies up by more than 30 per cent
since the end of June.
Third-quarter figures released recently by NatWest Securities show that
insurance stocks in three smaller territories also performed well, with
prices up by 17.2 per cent in Spain, 28.2 per cent in Sweden, and 25.7 per
cent in Finland.
Investment arithmetic has been one important factor. Falls in interest rates
have increased the value of bond portfolios, and insurers have also
benefited from increases in the value of their equity and property
investments.
Mr Bob Yates, an analyst with Fox Pitt Kelton, explains that since insurers
hold large amounts of equities, property and bonds in their technical
reserves, their portfolios tend to be 'highly leveraged'.
In addition, however, insurers have also been helped by rises in premium
rates following two to three years of heavy claims from theft and fire.
In most countries, rates for both personal insurances - such as home and
motor - and commercial lines have risen.
Mr Tom Bennett, an analyst with Banque Paribas Capital Markets, points to
Germany, where motorists, especially in the eastern German states, are
facing rises typically of 50 per cent. Commercial buyers, too, are facing
increases.
'Virtually every day the newspapers are full of reports, with companies
squealing about their rates going up. This has to be good news for
insurers,' says Mr Bennett.
Mr Angus Runciman, an analyst with BZW Securities, says the hardening in
rates has been an important factor in Scandinavia, where insurers have been
forced to take tough action to restore the strength of their balance sheets,
following the turmoil in local stock markets last year.
'The region now comes close to offering a competitive vacuum,' says Mr
Runciman, who predicts that rating discipline should be maintained there
longer than anywhere else in the region.
Reinsurers - such as Germany's Munich Re and Switzerland's Swiss Re - have
been helped by a hardening in international reinsurance markets, where rates
have risen and terms tightened for high level catastrophe covers.
However, the currently bullish trend for insurers may have a limit. Mr
Runciman also suggests that 'the likelihood of lower interest rates will
sooner or later result in reduced streams of investment income'.
There are fears, he says, that having repaired their balance sheets some
companies, especially the French, will be prepared to forgo further premium
rate increases in favour of raising market share.
'It is worrying,' he concludes, 'that even before the publication of (their)
1993 results, there are already suggestions that rates have risen
sufficiently and it is time once again to focus on market share.'

FT  10 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan slides on decline in
telecoms sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES remained nervous at the beginning of yesterday's session, but
expectations of further consolidation in German stocks were not borne out at
the end of the day, writes Our Markets Staff.
On the credit side, bargain hunting lifted Paris after last week's losses,
and unexpectedly low producer price inflation figures from the US gave
sentiment a boost in the afternoon.
MILAN was unnerved by a sharp early fall in Sip, the domestic telephone
operator, and the Comit index finished 10.22 or 1.8 per cent lower at
546.38.
Sip was briefly marked down 10 per cent in early trading before picking up
to finish L156 or 4.7 per cent lower at L3,140. Stet, the state holding
company, lost L170 or 4.4 per cent to L3,699.
Mr Roberto Condulmari of Giubergia Warburg commented that the sector
appeared to have been depressed by reports that AT &amp; T was seeking a pact
with French and German telecommunications groups, and that Italian companies
were not involved, together with EC pressure on the Italian government to
speed the granting of a licence to a second mobile telephone operator.
However, Mr Condulmari doubted that this was enough to account for Sip's
sharp early fall, which he thought was more likely to be the result of an
error in pricing a block of 50,000 shares which were offered by a brokerage.
FRANKFURT's DAX index fell to 2,005.82 during trading, the third session in
a row where the blue chip indicator had dropped to within a few points of
the 2,000 level. However, it recovered to close 12.02 higher at 2,022.83,
and the Ibis indicated Dax rose further to 2,040.74 by the end of the
post-bourse.
Ms Barbara Altmann at B Metzler in Frankfurt said that after the DAX held
again above 2,005, some funds bought futures, and then the impetus moved
into the cash market. The reason was a rally in the bond markets in both the
US and Germany following the US PPI figures.
Turnover rose from DM7.4bn to DM7.8bn. Ms Altmann said that, just as stock
did not appear when the market was falling early in the day, there was no
really big buying during the recovery after hours. Short covering, she said,
was having more effect on share prices.
ZURICH bounced higher, the SMI index adding 51.8 or 1.9 per cent to 2,727.1,
with an already positive tone improved by Wall Street's firm opening.
Mr Frederick Hasslauer of Bank Oppenheim in Zurich said that strong foreign
demand had re-emerged from the US, Britain and Germany for blue chip issues
at their lower levels after the market's recent correction.
Chemical stocks, hard hit last week, were among the main gainers. Roche
certificates added SFr170 or 3 per cent to SFr5,900, matching their record
close. Sandoz added SFr150 or 4.1 per cent to SFr3,850 and Ciba-Geigy
bearers were SFr20 higher at SFr825.
Motor-Columbus added SFr95 or 6.5 per cent to SFr1,550. Kleinwort Benson,
rating the stock a buy, commented last week that the group's radical
restructuring was set for completion six months ahead of schedule, in
mid-1994, and the process was driving a financial turnaround, with the
company now refocused on its energy business. Kleinwort valued the new Motor
Columbus stock at SFr2,020, which implies a rise of 30 per cent from current
levels.
PARIS was also boosted by the release of US data after languishing without
much enthusiasm at the opening. The CAC-40 index finished up 28.10 or 1.3
per cent at 2,112.89. Turnover was a moderate FFr3.3bn.
There was interest in stocks which have been adrift of recent general gains,
while LVMH was helped FFr10 higher to FFr3,551 after Remy-Cointreau, up
FFr8.90 to FFr210.40, announced better-than-expected first half figures.
UAP put on FFr15 to FFr642 helped by the appointment of a new chairman in
the lead up to privatisation, as well as favourable brokers' reports.
AMSTERDAM strengthened on good rises in major issues and in spite of a
further decline in Akzo which shed Fl 4.80 to Fl 180.30. The CBS Tendency
index put on 0.3 to 136.0.
The speciality chemicals group closed just above its placing price of Fl 180
which wasannounced in the morning. Akzo has announced that it will place the
new shares with a total value of some Fl 1.3bn to finance its acquisition of
Nobel industries of Sweden.
Unilever remained strong ahead of results later this week, the stock
attracting buy recommendations in the meantime, and it closed Fl 4.70
stronger at Fl 216.00.

FT  10 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo falls 3% as
profits are taken in JR East
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Nikkei average fell nearly 3 per cent following heavy institutional
selling of JR East and further negative news about the economy, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index tumbled 499.45, or 2.7 per cent, to 18,125.71, having
seen the day's high of 18,661.67 in the morning, before losing ground
steadily throughout the session to register a low of 18,048.50 in the last
hour of trading.
Volume increased to 322m shares from the 242m registered on Monday. Declines
overwhelmed advances by 937 to 100, with 116 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks dropped 39.05, or 2.5 per cent, to
1,531.28. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.24 to 1,236.80.
Large-lot heavy selling of JR East by corporate shareholders depressed
sentiment, the shares closing Y28,000 down at Y451,000. Earlier in the day,
Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister, told a parliamentary committee that
the government had not made any mistakes in the listing. The shares have
lost nearly 25 per cent since trading began on October 26.
Banks were dragged down by Topix-linked arbitrage selling, with Industrial
Bank of Japan shedding Y120 to Y3,220, Mitsubishi Bank losing Y120 to Y2,950
and Fuji Bank declining Y120 to Y2,260.
High-technology stocks were weak on profit-taking: Toshiba slipped Y8 to
Y683, Sharp declined Y20 to Y1,520 and Hitachi retreated Y22 to Y803.
Investors also took profits in large-capital issues, and Nippon Steel, the
day's most active issue, relinquished Y14 at Y317 and Mitsubishi Heavy
surrendered Y10 to Y641.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined for the sixth consecutive day, losing
463.57 to 20,301.24 in volume of 17.8m shares. Roundup
WITH A few exceptions the region's markets reflected the heavy decline in
Tokyo.
SEOUL, however, took its own path and saw its highest level since October
1990, with investors particularly active in large-capitalisation stocks. The
composite index climbed 4.73 to 780.20 in turnover of Won1,020bn.
HG Asia in London commented that the market's recent rise was partly due to
the fact that it had lagged behind recent gains elsewhere in the region. In
addition, they said, good data showing an expansion in exports from the car,
semi-conductor and steel sectors had boosted enthusiasm for equities.
There were also rumours that the timetable for increasing the limit of
foreign investment, from 10 to 15 per cent, might be brought forward, with
domestic investors already taking positions in those stocks that are likely
to be favoured by overseas institutions.
Samsung Electronics went limit-up, rising Won1,600 to Won50,200, and Hyundai
Motor hit its daily upper limit of Won1,300 to close at Won33,400.
HONG KONG was weaker as investors turned cautious after Tokyo's plunge. The
Hang Seng index was finally 89.48 off at 9,088.47 after swinging between a
high of 9,273.17 and a low of 9,059.14.
NEW ZEALAND regained 2 per cent after Monday's sharp fall, but the market
remained nervous in the current uncertain political situation.
The NZSE-40 index finished 43.79 better at 2,090.59.
With the final election result not due to be known until the weekend - votes
from nationals living overseas have yet to be counted - volatility is
expected to remain.
AUSTRALIA eased on afternoon selling, the All Ordinaries index dipping 3.4
to 2,050.8. Turnover amounted to ADollars 408.3m.
BHP shed 4 cents to ADollars 17.20 and, among the banks, NAB fell 10 cents
to ADollars 12.40.
SINGAPORE closed lower after volatile trading, with the Straits Times
Industrial index 15.50 down at 2,053.30.
Singapore Telecom gained 8 cents at SDollars 3.90 ahead of its announcement,
after the market closed, of an 18.8 per cent rise in half-year earnings.
TAIWAN was lower for the fifth trading day in a row amid persistent
profit-taking after the recent rally. The weighted index had rebounded
slightly at the opening but soon fell to finish 23.38 off at 4,172.44.
Turnover was a fairly active TDollars 27.78bn, against Monday's TDollars
28.88bn.
Sentiment was cautious due to the approach of the November 27 local
government elections, but selling was not heavy on the view that the
government would not allow the market to post sharp falls before the polls.
KUALA LUMPUR saw an early rebound interrupted by Tokyo's fall, but the
composite index still closed 16.14, or 1.75 per cent, higher at 937.66,
after a day's peak of 944.89.
The index had fallen 55.54 points over the previous two trading days on
forced selling caused by margin calls.
COLOMBO continued to attract heavy speculative demand, which took the
all-share index ahead 24.21 to 870.73 for a three-day rise of 8.9 per cent.
Turnover was also sharply higher at SLRs208.8m from Monday's SLRs114.9m.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: Dollar volatile on PPI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US dollar was buffeted in volatile trade following the release of lower
than expected US producer prices, writes Conner Middelmann.
Immediately after the announcement that the producer price index fell by 0.2
per cent in October - compared with market forecasts for a rise of 0.2 per
cent - the dollar declined   1/2 pfennig as dealers felt that the inflation
fears which have recently underpinned the dollar were overdone.
But the selling soon fizzled out and the dollar staged a strong recovery in
early New York trading as many dealers covered their short positions. It
closed in London at DM1.6950 - up from Monday's DM1.6850  - and is expected
to test resistance at DM1.70 today. In New York it ended at DM1.6927.
'The move shows that people still want to have dollars and build up
positions,' said Mr Julian Callow, international economist at Kleinwort
Benson. 'The weakness after the PPI number was a good opportunity to buy
dollars at a lower level.'
However, while the long term dollar uptrend is seen intact, some warn there
could be a short term retracement. 'The risk of a correction comes from the
fact that most of the buying has been by short term speculative accounts,'
said Mr Joe Prendergast, chief currency analyst with MMS International, the
market analysis service.
Today's release of the October US consumer price index - expected to have
risen by 0.3 per cent on the month - and Friday's retail sales data are
expected to offer more clues to the dollar's direction.
The Canadian dollar was pressured by fears of rising federal deficits after
a government official was reported to have said that the 1992/93 deficit
would total some CDollars 37bn - above the CDollars 35.5bn forecast - and
that the deficit for the next fiscal year would rise to some CDollars 39bn
to CDollars 40bn, well above the CDollars 32.6bn initially projected.
The Bank of Canada was rumoured to be intervening to support the currency,
which none the less eased to CDollars 1.3069 against the US currency in late
London interbank trading, from CDollars 1.2980 early in the day.
Sterling weakened in the afternoon on stop-loss selling by technical traders
and ended a relatively uneventful session near its day's lows against the
D-Mark and the US dollar. It closed at DM2.4900, down from a previous
DM2.4950, and at Dollars 1.4685, after Monday's Dollars 1.4805.
The Japanese yen weakened against the dollar after the stock market staged
another sharp sell-off and the Bank of Japan's rather generous open-market
operation caused call money to ease slightly. After closing at Y107.63 in
Tokyo, the dollar rose to Y108.15 in late London trading. It finished in New
York at Y107.95.
The Belgian franc was soft after news that the Belgian trade unions had
announced strikes over the country's social plan. It finished against the
dollar at around BFr36.20 in London, compared with BFr35.82 on Monday.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Money Markets: German repo eyed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN short-term interest rate futures firmed slightly as traders hoped for
another small easing at the Bundesbank's allocation today of 14 and 28-day
securities repurchase agreements at variable rates, writes Conner
Middelmann.
Most dealers expect the lowest accepted repo rate to edge down between two
and four basis points. According to a survey of German money market dealers
by MMS International, the market analysis service, the minimum rate on both
tranches is expected to decline by two basis points, to 6.37 per cent on the
two-week tranche and to 6.38 per cent on the four-week tranche.
Two tranches of repos totalling DM81.5bn expire today and many dealers
expect the Bundesbank to make a small net liquidity injection.
The December three-month Euromark futures contract rose 0.02 point to 93.87
and the December contract was up 0.04 point to close at 94.58.
Further slippage in German money market rates is expected to facilitate more
near-term easing among some of the country's neighbours whose currencies
have recently appreciated against the D-Mark, notably France, Belgium and
the Netherlands.
'They are all waiting for the next German rate cut,' commented Ms Alison
Cottrell, European economist at Midland Global Markets. With the Dutch
guilder trading at 112.2020 against the D-Mark and after last week's better
than expected October infla-tion numbers, 'the Dutch must go fairly soon',
she said.
The Bank of France may be a little more cautious given its continuing need
to replenish its foreign currency reserves. The December PIBOR future on
MATIF softened 0.01 point to 93.57.
In the UK money market, the Bank of England announced an early shortage of
some Pounds 1.7bn, later revised downwards to Pounds 1.65bn. It did not
operate in the early round, but allocated some Pounds 1.294bn at the midday
operation. In the afternoon the Bank purchased bills totalling Pounds 236m
and provided late assistance of around Pounds 70m.
The sterling overnight interbank rate was unchanged on the day at around 6
per cent. December short sterling futures finished unaltered on the day at
94.49, while the March contract edged forward 0.01 point to 94.69, both
trading on moderate volume.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lumber prices back on increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a brief summer lull, North American lumber prices have again begun to
soar, with strict timber cutting limitations in US and Canadian pacific
forests promising to collide with rising demand in the US home building
sector.
Traders and timber interests expected the Clinton administration to find
solutions to the forest impasse this year. However, there now appears to be
only a slim chance there will be any easing in US timber cutting
restrictions.
Meanwhile, demand for lumber for homebuilding is rising. Historically low
interest rates inspired a 21 per cent jump in new home sales in the US in
September, with housing starts also climbing.
US builders are completing new homes at a rate of 1.162m units a year, up
from 1.128m a year ago. Rebuilding after the Midwest floods has added to
that demand, and an unusually strong fall construction season has left
lumber wholesalers short on inventory. The result has been a 30 per cent
rise in western wood prices since August, with some analysts forecasting
rallies as dramatic as the panic-driven surge that sent Chicago futures to a
peak of Dollars 493.50 last March.
The January futures contract easily surpassed the Dollars 400 per 1,000
board feet benchmark on Monday, and is nearly Dollars 100 above its high for
all of 1992. Cash prices for western spruce 2 x 4s are also rising, although
so far they have stayed below the spring high of Dollars 475.
However, lumber analysts caution that prices for wood from alternative
sources have already inflated, leaving little slack in the cash markets.
Prices for construction dimension southern pine topped Dollars 495 last
week, well above the March high of Dollars 435.
Mr Laurie Cater, editor of Madison's Canadian Lumber Reporter, said Canadian
wood stocks, always viewed as a limitless back-up to US forest output, are
nowadays less available because of provincial restrictions on timber cutting
in environmentally sensitive areas. Mr Cater and other analysts say the
recent rise in lumber futures prices has been exaggerated by speculation.
However, the supply and demand imbalance is real. Ms Evadna Lynn, senior
forest products analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, said total lumber supply in
the US would be down 4 per cent this year, including a 2 per cent decline in
lumber imports from Canada. Meanwhile, she said, US demand for lumber would
rise from 5 per cent to 7 per cent.
'Obviously we have a very tight inventory situation,' she said.
Last spring's lumber rally added about Dollars 5,000 to the cost of building
an average home in the US, and builders are already building in the lumber
mark-up in their new home prices.

FT  10 NOV 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report
</HEADLINE>

   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIN prices collapsed on the London Metal Exchange yesterday afternoon when
the market broke below the Dollars 4,700 a tonne floor of the current
Dollars 200 technical range, dealers said. Sell stops pushed tin to a low of
Dollars 4,640 a tonne before some bargain-hunting trade buying emerged after
hours. Three-month tin closed Dollars 168 a tonne down at Dollars 4,649.50.
NICKEL capitalised on the recent improvement in sentiment, which has
resulted in less selling pressure when the market moves up. However, dealers
suggest the market remains oversupplied and is still in need of further
production cuts. Yesterday's advance petered out near the Dollars 4,800 a
tonne level once more and three-month prices finished at Dollars 4,757.50,
up Dollars 30. SILVER after a relatively strong performance on the New York
Commodity Exchange on Monday closed in London last night 40 cents up at
Dollars 4.525 an ounce. London SUGAR fell sharply yesterday afternoon in
hectic New York-led fund liquidation. Both white and raw sugar lost ground,
but by late afternoon in London the markets had steadied and prices
recovered.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil hits post-Gulf war low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL PRICES hit a new post-Gulf war low of Dollars 16.40 a barrel for Brent
Blend yesterday. The price later recovered to Dollars 16.55 in late London
trading, but analysts saw little scope for any early sustained rise.
News agency reports said ministers from the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries had begun telephone contacts on ways of shoring up
prices.
A Reuters report said those included a possible appeal to non-Opec countries
to reduce their output as well as the possibility of a cut in the Opec
production ceiling of 24.52m barrels a day.
Analysts noted, however, that any reduction in non-Opec production would
have to include significant cuts in North Sea output, which is expected to
surge by as much as 700,000 barrels a day by next month compared with
September.
'There is no chance that the UK government would go along with any cuts,'
said Dr Leonidas Drollas, chief economist at the London-based Centre for
Global Energy Studies. 'And I doubt that Norway would do it again,' he
added, in a reference to Oslo's decision in the 1980s to close some
production facilities at a time of very low oil prices.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: WHO smoking target attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 10 per cent reduction in smoking, urged by the World Health Organisation,
would lead many tobacco-producing countries in the developing world to rely
more heavily on international aid, according to a report published
yesterday.
The report, entitled Tobacco Trade or Aid?, by the International Tobacco
Growers' Association, examines the impact of a hypothetical fall in demand
of 10 per cent by 1995 on the economies of six developing countries.
The association promotes the interests of tobacco-growing organisations
around the world, including those from the US and Canada as well as Latin
America and Africa.
It concludes that the six countries - Brazil, Bulgaria, Kenya, Malawi,
Tanzania and Zimbabwe - would suffer a collective loss of nearly Dollars
120m from a fall in export volumes of more than 59,000 tonnes.
Malawi and Zimbabwe depend most heavily on tobacco for foreign exchange.
Malawi's tobacco exports last year accounted for 59 per cent of total
exports and contributed 16.7 per cent of gross domestic product. The loss of
10 per cent of projected tobacco export earnings in 1995 would be equivalent
to 6 per cent of the aid it received in 1991, the report says.
For Zimbabwe, the potential loss of Dollars 41m in foreign exchange would
represent the equivalent of 25.7 per cent of its 1992 balance of payments
deficit, and more than half the country's spending on social security and
welfare.
Pointing to the WHO's objective of a fall of more than 10 per cent in
smoking in at least 20 per cent of its member states by 1995, compared with
1988, the report attacks what it calls 'a new imperialism'.
'Denied the dignity of contributing to their own development through foreign
exchange earnings from tobacco, all the countries profiled in the present
study and many other would. . . become more dependent on the largesse of the
aid donor community,' it says.
Last year the association published a report arguing that there were no
sustainable alternative crops that would achieve the same level of earnings
for most tobacco farmers.
The Overseas Development Administration in London said yesterday it was
looking at ways of helping developing countries find sustainable
alternatives to tobacco. Since 1991, ODA policy has been to refuse to fund
or support projects in the tobacco sector.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC set-aside policy not working
say landowners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community's policy of setting aside arable land to reduce
cereal production is not working in many member states and is unfairly
penalising countries like the UK, representatives of Britain's landowners
said yesterday.
The Country Landowners' Association (CLA) cited European Commission figures
obtained from the Ministry of Agriculture showing that the EC grain harvest
this year had fallen by just 1.1 per cent, even though the 1992 Common
Agricultural Policy reforms required arable farmers to leave 15 per cent of
their land idle each year to cut production.
'These figures show there's something seriously wrong with the policy,' said
Mr George Dunn, the CLA's economist.
A Commission official said latest estimates from EC grain producers showed
the overall harvest down 1.4 per cent, with several countries showing an
increase in production. He admitted: 'It's a mess.'
The variations across the EC are huge. The UK cereal crop fell 11 per cent
this year, while Irish output was down 16 per cent and French production
fell by 8 per cent. But output was up 22 per cent in both Denmark and Spain,
and German production rose nearly 3 per cent.
The CLA said some of the variations could be explained by the fact that
states like Denmark suffered very poor cereal yields last year. But the main
problem was the exemption from set-aside of small farmers producing less
than 92 tonnes of cereals a year, it said.
'We'd like to see the (European) Council (of Ministers) seriously
considering reducing the 92-tonne limit so that the burden of set-aside
would be shared more equally,' Mr Dunn said. 'The UK has a large proportion
of large farms and its efficiency in farm structure is working against it.'
The Commission argues that the exemption for small farmers is essential to
prevent them from being driven off the land by falling incomes.
Although Britain opposed the exemption at the time of the reforms, a senior
official said yesterday that it was part of the deal and had to be accepted.
He said the effectiveness of set-aside would be more fairly judged by taking
an average of three to four years' post-reform production compared with a
base period of, say, 1989-1992, rather than by comparing just two
consecutive harvests.
The first year of the five-year rotational set-aside scheme was expected to
have less effect than subsequent years, since farmers initially leave their
worst land fallow.
The CLA said it was studying alternatives to the set-aside policy, which
would move the farming industry towards a free market.
One idea it is pursuing is the 'Tangermann bond', a lump sum payment that
would mark the end of price support. Existing farmers would be entitled to
receive the payment in the form of an annual allowance to supplement their
income for a certain number of years. Alternatively, they could sell it to
other farmers if they wished to leave the industry, the CLA said.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries retreat after disappointing
auction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER rising sharply on good inflation news, longer-dated US Treasuries fell
back from their highs following a disappointing auction of three-year notes.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond, which had been up 1 1/8 in the
morning, was only  23/32 higher at 101 7/16 , yielding 6.139 per cent. At
the short end, the two-year note was unchanged at 99 9/16 , to yield 4.091
per cent.
The October inflation data turned about to be a big, and pleasant, surprise
for the beleaguered market. Analysts had expected the producer prices index
to have risen by about 0.3 per cent but when the figures were released, it
showed a decline of 0.2 per cent. Even better, core PPI, which excludes the
volatile food and energy components, fell by 0.5 per cent. The numbers
immediately raised hopes that today's consumer price index will also be
bullish for bonds.
Prices surged at the long end as soon as the PPI came out, with the 30-year
bond quickly posting a rise of more than one point. The buying, however, was
not particularly widespread, with dealer short-covering contributing to the
gains.
Analysts said trading was not as heavy as might have been expected because
investors were cautious ahead of the afternoon auction of Dollars 17bn in
three-year notes.
That approach proved prescient, because the auction went off poorly, with
weak demand from retail investors and a higher than expected average yield.
When it became clear that the auction would disappoint, longer-dated prices
fell back from their early highs, pushing long-term interest rates higher.
CONTINENTAL European government bond markets bounced back to life, mostly
taking their cue from the US.
Italy was one of the top performers, with the futures contract gaining over
a point. The Liffe BTP contract rose from 113.79 at Monday's close to trade
at 114.90 by late afternoon. Dealers said domestic factors contributed to
the rally.
Traders were focusing on the 1994 budget, as some key clauses were due to be
voted on by the Senate last night.
GERMAN government bonds gained half a point, pulled up by the US news and by
the release of poor retail sales figures, which only confirmed the need for
lower interest rates in the market's view.
Treuhand, the agency responsible for the privatisation of former east German
enterprises, issued a new 6 per cent 10-year bond. Dealers noted switching
out of existing 10-year Treuhand issues into the new bond as investors
searched for longer duration and were lured by the yield pick-up of about 14
basis points over Federal issues.
Western German retail sales fell 1.8 per cent in real terms during September
compared with a year earlier. Mr Julian Callow, economist at Kleinwort
Benson, said the news only highlighted the need for another cut in German
interest rates by year-end.
Less favourable for the bund market was the news that new government
borrowing may rise to over DM70bn next year. Mr Rudi Walther, the chairman
of parliament's finance committee, was quoted as saying new government
borrowing would be DM73bn - DM75bn, which dealers said was higher than
previously expected.
UK gilts gained nearly a point at the long end on the back of positive
inflation news. Initially, the gilt market appeared to be digesting the
favourable producer price data released on Monday, while the release of the
US PPI data helped to give the market an extra boost in the afternoon.
The 8 3/4 per cent 2017 gilt climbed from 116 7/16 to 117 11/32 while
shorter-dated issues gained nearly a quarter point.
JAPANESE paper closed up on the day, having reached a new six-year high as
the weakness in the Tokyo stock market and generally gloomy economic
background boosted hopes of a further easing in short-term interest rates.
The benchmark No 145 issue opened with a yield of 3.445 per cent before
moving to 3.415 per cent - corresponding to the high price of the day - and
closed at 3.42 per cent.

FT  10 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Goldman takes commanding lead in bond
league table
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLDMAN Sachs appeared to have safeguarded its position at the top of the
Eurobond league table yesterday with the launch of Dollars 500m offerings
for BAT Industries and Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and a Pounds 194.6m
securitisation for Standard Chartered Bank.
According to IFR Securities Data, Goldman Sachs had lead-managed Dollars
26.6bn worth of Eurobonds by the end of trading yesterday, giving it a
commanding lead of Dollars 3.4bn over Deutsche Bank, which occupied the
number one slot at the end of last year.
Sales of BAT's and LB Rheinland-Pfalz's bonds were slow due to uncertainty
about the direction of the US bond market. In addition, the rally in US
Treasuries led to a considerable widening in the yield spreads on the
Eurobonds.
The yield spread on BAT's bonds widened to around 79 basis points from 75
basis points at launch while the spread on LB Rheinland-Pfalz's bonds
widened by seven basis points to 29 basis points.
Mr Paul Schminke, director for LB Rheinland-Pfalz's foreign and treasury
activities, said the offering reflected the increasing internationalisation
of the bank's assets.
'At present, we have to refinance these through the money market,' he said.
'The international markets give us better conditions than the money market,
leading to a considerable improvement of the liability side of the balance
sheet.'
Elsewhere, British Columbia the highest rated Canadian province, extended
the maturity profile of the Canadian dollar sector with the launch of
Dollars 350m of 30-year Eurobonds.
This is the first 30-year Eurobond offering in Canadian dollars, although
there have been 30-year Canadian dollar global bond offerings by Ontario
Hydro and Hydro Quebec.
British Columbia's Eurobonds were priced to yield 48 basis points over
underlying Canadian government bonds, somewhat below the current yield
spread of 55 basis points on its 30-year domestic bond.
Lead manager ScotiaMcLoed said the pricing reflected the issuer's view that
European investors would be willing to pay a premium for a long-dated and
liquid issue and that the healthy oversubscription and a rise in the bonds
to 97.70 when they were freed to trade, from a fixed re-offer price of
97.11, justified the pricing.
Late in the day, Pemex, the Mexican state-owned oil company, tapped the
Canadian dollar sector for the first time with a CDollars 100m offer of
six-year Eurobonds. The yield spread of 195 basis points over Canadian
government bonds was thought ambitious in view of the recent widening of
spreads on emerging market bonds in the secondary market.
In the Eurosterling market, the securitisation of vehicle hire purchase
receivables for Standard Chartered was largely pre-placed.

FT  10 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Rautaruukki to raise FM320m
with share issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAUTARUUKKI, Finland's largest steelmaker, is raising FM320m through a share
issue that will strengthen its balance sheet and reduce the Finnish
government's stake from 86.8 per cent to 81.1 per cent.
The offering is an important step in Finland's programme to widen ownership
of state-owned companies, as it is the first time that the state has reduced
its stake in a company by selling part of its rights in an issue.
The issue is also a dry run for further potential share sales at
Rautaruukki. The Finnish government sent a bill to parliament last month
which, if approved, would allow it to reduce its stake in the company to
just over 50 per cent.
Rautaruukki, founded in 1960, has grown to become one of the two biggest
flat steel product companies in Finland and Scandinavia, along with SSAB of
Sweden. It also makes tubes and sections.
The company, which employs 9,000, was hit badly by the steel industry
recession in 1991 and 1992, with total losses after financing items of more
than FM1.5bn.
But Mr Mikko Kivimaki, chief executive, said the timing was right for the
issue. Speaking in London, he said the company had made big improvements in
productivity and delivery times, and its performance would improve
considerably this year.
The issue also takes advantage of better stock market conditions in Finland
and the boost to Rautaruukki's export competitiveness because of the
markka's devaluation.
Finland will invest FM150m in the issue, but 5.8m of the 14.5m new shares
will be sold to the public. Postipankki, the Finnish bank, is lead-managing
the issue, and Merrill Lynch is co-lead manager responsible for organising
the international placement. The third placement agent is Opstock of
Finland.
There is no limit on the amount of shares which can be sold internationally.
The issue is expected to be priced at FM22 a share, compared with a market
price of FM42 for the shares already traded publicly.

FT  10 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Capital flow to developing
countries breaks record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REVIVAL of private capital boosted net capital flows to developing
countries to a record Dollars 165.5bn in 1992, 23 per cent higher than in
1991, according to the latest Financial Market Trends survey by the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
The 51 per cent growth in private capital was dominated by the expansion of
international bank lending (Dollars 38bn), foreign direct investment
(Dollars 29bn) and bond financing (Dollars 13.4bn).
Official development finance from other countries has been in decline, due
to a sharp fall-off in aid from some donors (principally Arab countries and
the former Soviet union).
Most of the increase in capital flow was concentrated on more advanced
countries, while poorer and smaller countries, particularly those in
sub-Saharan Africa, still rely on development finance.
Total external debt for developing countries in 1992 reached Dollars
1,534bn, up around 3 per cent.
The level of borrowing is increasing across all financial markets, according
to the survey.
The OECD notes a 14 per cent rise to Dollars 526bn in borrowing facilities
in the international financial markets for the year to October. As well as
record bond issuance, there has also been a revival of syndicated lending.

FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Kajima writes off Y50bn
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KAJIMA, the Japanese general contractor, will write off losses of Y50bn
(Dollars 462.7m) arising from the liquidation of a wholly-owned subsidiary
active in developing Australian properties.
The decision by Kajima reflects a trend among Japanese construction
companies, which acquired large property portfolios in the US, UK and
Australia in an aggressive expansion during the 1980s.
However the companies, including Shimizu and Kumagai Gumi, found overseas
markets far tougher than they had imagined, and the burden of carrying
loss-making properties has increased as profits from the domestic market
have slipped over the past two years.
The group's net profit forecast for the year to March was revised down from
Y8bn to Y1bn, and the forecast for parent net profit was cut from Y18bn to
Y10bn.

FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Starry-eyed investors await
Italy's telecoms rebirth - Haig Simonian examines speculative interest in
the reorganisation of the state-controlled Stet and Sip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN

<TEXT>
Shares in Stet and Sip, Italy's two leading telecommunications companies,
have gyrated this week as investors grappled with the dilemma of matching
glowing economic prospects with domestic political uncertainty.
Though majority state-owned, the two stocks count among Italy's leading blue
chips. Their prices closely reflect general investor confidence in Italy as
much as the companies' own financial expectations.
However, both groups have moved into focus in recent months. Telecoms stocks
are in vogue among international investors. The Italian companies are
particularly attractive, because long-running and expensive modernisation
programmes are nearing an end, and tariffs are beginning to emerge from the
straight-jacket of state control.
Privatisation has added a new speculative lustre to the shares. Last month,
Lehman Brothers, a close Stet adviser, issued a bullish investment report on
the stock entitled 'A Star is (Re)Born'.
Such enthusiasm is still running ahead of reality. After years of dithering,
disorganisation, inter-company rivalries and plain mismanagement, Italy's
telecoms sector is set for long overdue rationalisation.
No other big European country has such a complex patchwork in the
telecommunications field. Stet, the overall holding company, presides over a
collection of separate companies, some quoted, with activities covering
domestic telephones services (Sip), intercontinental traffic (Italcable),
equipment manufacturing (Italtel) and network services (Sirti). Separately,
ASST, controlled directly by the ministry of posts and telecommunications
until last year, and now renamed Iritel, handles domestic trunk calls and
some international traffic.
Each has is own, sometimes overlapping, responsibilities, board of
directors, buildings and even chauffeurs, adding significantly to costs and
confusion.
The reasons for the profusion are political, based on the need to share out
jobs between coalition parties, all craving for their allocation of top
state-sector patronage.
That is about to change. Under a new project, approved in principle by the
government earlier this year, the separate layers will be rationalised to
create one company, expected to be called Telecom Italia.
The new entity, whose precise structure remains vague, should group all the
telephone services now conducted by Sip, Italcable, Iritel and Telespazio.
The first step is due early next year, when Sip and Italcable are planned to
merge.
While attractive in principle, details of Telecom Italia have yet to be
fleshed out. Still to be decided are the fates of Sip's highly profitable
cellular telephone business, and the outlook for the Italtel equipment
manufacturing side.
Italy now has Europe's third- biggest cellular network, with about 1.1m
subscribers. So far, Sip has a monopoly, although several private groups are
jostling to win the long-awaited mandate to set up a second network. When
that will come about remains uncertain, as do vague suggestions by the
government that Sip's cellular business would be spun off separately.
Italtel's future is also in the balance. Although not expected to form part
of Telecom Italia, which will concentrate on services, Italtel is an
important element in the Stet group.
Executives from Stet and Italtel, which is 20 per cent-owned by AT&amp;T of the
US, have for months been talking with other leading telecommunications
equipment makers to broaden Italtel's ownership structure. The outcome of
the negotiations, designed to broaden the company's access to international
contracts, remains unresolved.
While the broad future of Italy's telecoms sector has been defined, many
gaps remain to be filled. The government and the Iri state holding company,
which controls Stet, have indicated they are prepared to float a majority of
the shares.
Observers remain confused as to whether Stet itself, or the future Telecom
Italia, will be the privatisation vehicle, although the latter seems more
likely. The government is also undecided about the precise structure of the
future telecoms business.
Its continued indecision has been reflected in its failure to appoint
merchant banking advisers for the sell-off.
The delay lies in underlying political differences about privatisation,
which have not yet been resolved. Some ministers are pressing for a UK-style
public flotation. Meanwhile others, led by Mr Paolo Savona, the industry
minister, want to create a 'hard core' shareholding group, in which leading
Italian technology companies, such as Olivetti and Pirelli, would form a
prominent part.
Mr Savona's argument is believed to be based on the claim that only by
linking industrialised companies closely with the telecoms sector will it be
possible to guarantee their future role at the forefront of that sector.
Though apparently protectionist in scope, the aim is more to keep Italian
companies abreast of the latest developments in the increasingly overlapping
telecoms and information technology businesses than to exclude outsiders.
Critics, however, say any attempt to create a privileged position for
domestic companies will damage telecoms privatisation.
Investors will be put off by the idea of a domestic 'hard core', which will
reduce liquidity of the privatised stock. And creating a close link between
the privatised telecoms company and the biggest domestic suppliers could
compromise independence in purchasing and equipment decisions, affecting
long-term profitability, it is argued.
The appointment of advisers on privatising Italian telecommunications will
have to await government decision on just how the sector should be
restructured.
With domestic politics in a particularly volatile state, the decision may be
handed over from the present government of prime minister Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi to a successor formed after the next elections, widely expected early
next year.
Whoever decides will also have to rule on the thorny issue, still being
debated behind-the-scenes, on what role should be reserved for Italian
companies in the shareholding structure of any privatised telecoms concern.
This is the concluding piece in a series on the privatisation of Europe's
state telecommunications operators. The other articles appeared on October
11, 26, 28 &amp; November 4.

FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Genbel to expand securities
trading arm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GENBEL, formerly the investment arm of Gencor, South Africa's second-largest
mining house, has announced a two-pronged reorganisation. It plans to
restructure its core investments and expand its securities trading
operations.
Genbel's repositioning centres around strengthening Unisen, the investment
trading arm. It wants to give the group a more dynamic role than previously,
when it functioned mainly as a long-term investment holding company with a
strong commodities focus.
The restructuring flows from the recent unbundling of Gencor, the company
which helped establish Genbel to help finance Gencor projects. Although
Genbel will retain close ties with its main shareholders - Sankorp and
Rembrandt will, as concert parties, hold 35 per cent of Genbel - unbundling
has given it the opportunity to chart a new course less closely tied to the
fortunes of the Gencor group.
Mr Anton Botha, managing director, said the spur for the group's
transformation to a 'dynamic portfolio holder and securities investment
trader' had been its success, through Unisen, in the trading markets. Over
the last five years, Unisen has achieved an average total return, per annum,
of 38.5 per cent, compared with 23.3 per cent for the Johannesburg stock
exchange's All Share Index.
The aim is to significantly enlarge Unisen's trading portfolio, with the
object of materially outperforming the index over time.
Unisen has had assets of about R200m (Dollars 59.5m) over the last three
years. However Genbel's recent restructuring and the transfer of gold shares
into Unisen has boosted its net assets to about R1bn.

FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Greek building group seeks to
raise Dr5.9bn

<TEXT>
AKTOR, Greece's largest construction company, plans to raise Dr5.9bn
(Dollars 24.5m) in fresh equity through a flotation on the Athens stock
exchange.
The company is to increase its capital base by 25 per cent, the minimum
requirement for a listing on the Greek bourse. It will issue 1.69m new
shares.
The shares, with a nominal value of Dr250 each, will be offered at Dr3,525.
About half the issue is to be placed abroad by James Capel, the UK
securities house.
The listing is being underwritten by Midland Bank and Societe Generale, with
two private Greek banks, Credit Bank and Piraeus Bank.
Aktor is controlled by the Bobolas family, which also owns an Athens daily
newspaper and holds a stake in Megachannel, Greece's biggest private
television station.
The company said 60 per cent of funds raised through the listing would be
used for working capital, while the remainder would cover purchases of new
machinery.
Aktor is one of a dozen local construction companies competing for large
public works contracts in Greece, estimated to be worth Dr1,200bn over the
next five years.
More than 70 per cent of funding for the projects will come from the
European Community under the Delors II aid package for infrastructure
improvements in poorer member countries. The rest, meanwhile, will be
provided from the Greek state investment budget.
Aktor is participating in several big projects being co-financed by the EC,
including construction of a 500km pipeline to carry Russian natural gas from
the Bulgarian border to Athens.
The company forecasts pre-tax profits for 1993 of Dr2.4bn, up from Dr1.01bn
last year.
Turnover is expected to reach Dr10bn, compared with Dr5.1bn last year.
Three other Greek construction companies are being floated on the Athens
stock exchange. Last week, shares in Aegek, seeking to raise Dr1.6bn, were
oversubscribed more than 100 times.
Greece's construction sector is dominated by private family-controlled
companies, which finance most of their operations from private funds to
avoid high interest rates, now at around 24 per cent for working capital.
However, the need to ensure a steady cash flow and invest in new equipment
in order to win EC-financed projects is expected to encourage other
construction companies to join the stock market.

FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Stone Container increases sale
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STONE CONTAINER, the Chicago-based international packaging group, will sell
a larger than expected part of its newsprint business in its stock offer in
Canada and Europe.
Stone has added convertible debentures to the offer to bring the amount
raised to about CDollars 450m from CDollars 300m. On conversion of the
debentures, the public would own 40 per cent of Stone Consolidated, against
about 25 per cent before the changes to the prospectus.
The stock is being offered at CDollars 13 to CDollars 15 a share as part of
a package of shares and debentures.
Stone originally planned a straight Stone Consolidated equity offer. The new
company takes in the Canadian newsprint and groundwood paper mills and the
Ellesmere Port newsprint mill, near Liverpool.
PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines International, says all 139 senior
creditors have accepted its restructuring plan, including a CDollars 700m
debt-equity swap. Junior creditors have already endorsed the plan.
However, it can only go through when American Airlines completes a promised
CDollars 246m equity infusion in return for 25 per cent ownership of
Canadian Airlines. This, in turn, is held up over a dispute on a reservation
system ownership between Canadian Airlines and Air Canada.

<TEXT>
RIO ALGOM, the Canadian uranium, copper, coal and metals distribution group,
was hit by lower copper prices in the third quarter.
Net profit was CDollars 11.6m (USDollars 6m), or 25 cents a share, after a
CDollars 9.4m loss on the sale of its potash mining operation and a CDollars
15m gain on the sale of portfolio investments.
The latest figure was down 28 per cent from CDollars 16.2m, or 36 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenues were CDollars 237m, up 3 per cent.
Nine-month profit was CDollars 22.7m, or 48 cents, down 22 per cent from
CDollars 29.2m, or 63 cents, on revenues of CDollars 712m, up 7 per cent.
The international metals distribution business improved and a lower Canadian
dollar also helped. Rio, 51 per cent controlled by RTZ until June 1992, will
close its last remaining Ontario uranium mine in 1996 as contracts with
Ontario Hydro utility run out.

FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Wall Street bankers keep a wary
eye on the Fed - Patrick Harverson analyses an unprecedented period of
profitability for the US securities industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WINTER is approaching and New Yorkers, already worried about high levels of
crime and unemployment, are just recovering from a dispiriting Mayoral
election race.
Yet, on Wall Street, the city's investment bankers and stock brokers are
still striding out to work every day with a spring in their step.
They have every reason to be confident. Results released in recent weeks
showed that in the third quarter, US brokerage houses and investment banks
maintained the record-breaking pace of profits growth they have set over the
past two and a half years.
Every big publicly-quoted securities firm reported growth in third-quarter
earnings. On average, earnings rose by 63 per cent between July and
September, well ahead of the average 24 per cent increase achieved by US
corporations during the quarter.
As in the previous 10 quarters, Wall Street's profits were fuelled chiefly
by three factors
Low short-term interest rates, which sustained high stock and bond prices
and allowed firms to borrow cheaply and invest the money in higher-yielding
assets, thus boosting net interest income and trading profits;
Heavy corporate demand for securities underwriting services, which kept
investment banking revenues buoyant;
Strong interest among individual and institutional investors in the stock
and bond markets, which translated into high brokerage commission revenues
and asset management fees.
A more recent development was also apparent in the latest earnings data  -
the rising contribution from firms' mergers and acquisitions business.
Over the past year the once-dormant domestic M&amp;A market has enjoyed a
resurgence, and Wall Street firms have earned huge fees advising companies
involved in billion-dollar transactions in the telecommunications, media,
healthcare and banking industries.
The result has been an unprecedented period of profitability for the
securities industry. Yet, while it is well into its third year of record
earnings, Wall Street is aware the good times cannot last for ever.
The performance of the securities industry has always been tied closely to
the fortunes of financial markets and the level of interest rates.
When rates are low and markets strong, Wall Street prospers. When rates
start rising, however, markets can stumble, and the industry's earnings can
shrink quickly.
The downturn in this cycle often hits Wall Street especially hard, because
in the good times the industry has a tendency to lose control of its costs
by paying its employees too generously and by hiring too many extra staff.
This is what happened at the tail end of the 1980s, a period which
culminated in the industry-wide losses of 1990.
Today, however, Wall Street is in better shape to cope with any downturn in
the industry's business cycle. For a start, firms have generally kept a
tight rein on costs.
Although employee compensation (the largest component of industry costs) has
risen with profitability, management has adopted a more rigorous approach to
pay policy.
Bonuses are now more closely related to performance, and firms have been
awarding a larger part of employee bonuses in the form of stock.
As a result, compensation takes up less of firms' net revenues. At the end
of June, compensation expenses accounted for 50.1 per cent of net revenues
at New York Stock Exchange member firms.
By comparison, at height of the last profits boom in 1987, compensation
expenses took up some 56.5 per cent of net revenues.
As Mr Michael Flanagan, securities industry analyst at Lipper Analytical in
New York, explains: 'The industry has taken great steps in controlling
costs. Its cost structure this time around is in a much better shape than in
the past.
'Employees are paid more like shareholders, and management has been very
careful in adding staff during this cycle. The result has been a significant
improvement in productivity and profitability,' he added.
Keeping a lid on staffing levels has been particularly important. At the end
of June, 228,600 people were employed by NYSE member firms, only 9.4 per
cent more than were employed when the industry's employment cycle last hit
bottom, in early 1991.
Mr Flanagan says: 'The underlying theme to employment policy has been to let
revenues develop before increasing staff and overheads accordingly. In the
past, staffing and overhead expenses led revenues.'
Yet, while cost management may have improved, Wall Street remains hostage to
market-related cycles. This is in spite of the progress firms have made in
developing businesses which provide a steady stream of cycle-proof revenues.
Over the past five years, Wall Street has built up its asset management
businesses in the hope that the recurring revenues they generated would
smooth out the bumps in the industry's always volatile earnings stream.
The contribution of asset management revenues to the industry's bottom line,
however, remains dwarfed by revenues from investment banking, proprietary
trading and brokerage commissions.
Industry leader Merrill Lynch, for example, has made some of the biggest
strides in asset management, yet earnings from the business still account
for only 9 per cent of total net revenues (up from 7 per cent five years
ago).
By contrast, proprietary trading profits account for 29 per cent of total
revenues (up from 22 per cent in 1988), commissions for 26 per cent (up from
23 per cent), and investment banking for 17 per cent (unchanged from 1988).
The picture is much the same at other big securities houses. And, those
firms which have mostly ignored asset management or other repeat revenue
businesses, like Salomon Brothers and Morgan Stanley, remain particularly
vulnerable to market-related downturns.
Witness Salomon's Dollars 173m loss on proprietary trading in this year's
third quarter, a loss which dragged group profits down from Dollars 433m in
the previous quarter to just Dollars 20m.
With the US economy recently showing signs of renewed life, the danger for
Wall Street is that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next year
to restrain future inflation.
Higher interest rates would quickly translate into lower trading and net
income revenues, and weaker financial markets, which would result in lower
investment banking and commission revenues. If that happened, there would be
little Wall Street firms could do but grin and bear it.

FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Double-digit rise for Wal-Mart
in third quarter

<TEXT>
WAL-MART, the world's biggest retailer, grew even larger in the third
quarter, as its expansion strategy paid off in a double-digit increases in
sales and profits.
The Arkansas-based discount-store operator posted net income of Dollars
518.7m in the three months to the end of October, an 18 per cent improvement
on profits of Dollars 437.8m in the corresponding period of 1992.
Earnings were 23 cents a share, compared with 19 cents, when adjusted to
reflect a two-for-one stock split in February.
Wal-Mart's sales performance was even more impressive. Revenues climbed 23
per cent to Dollars 16.8bn in the quarter, compared with Dollars 13.6bn a
year earlier.
Same-store sales - an important measure of retailing strength - showed an 8
per cent improvement, against 5 per cent through August.
Wal-Mart continued to push into new markets, as part of a strategy that
enables the company to offer 'everyday' low prices by maximising its buying
power.
In the third quarter, the company opened 56 new Wal-Mart stores (and closed
two), expanded 11 others and opened 16 more Sam's Clubs, which offer deep
discounts to members. The net addition of retail floor space was 10.9m sq
ft.
The company now operates a total of 1,989 Wal-Mart outlets and 326 Sam's
Clubs.
In addition, Wal-Mart is preparing to integrate 91 Pace warehouse clubs
which last week it agreed to acquire from Kmart, the second biggest US
retailer. The move, part of consolidation in the segment, serves to cement
Wal-Mart's dominance.
The results, which were in line with Wall Street's expectations, helped lift
the share price by Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 29 in early trading.
The Limited, the US specialty-store operator, showed signs of recovery in
the third quarter, following a poor performance in the first half.
Net income rose 2.8 per cent to Dollars 82.2m, on sales of Dollars 1.61bn, a
0.3 per cent uptick on the corresponding three months of 1992. Earnings per
share were 23 cents, against 22 cents a year earlier.
The company said several of women's clothing businesses continued to show
weakness, but strong performances by Victoria's Secret, Express, Structure
and other chains helped lift revenues. Overall, The Limited reported a 1 per
cent gain in same-store sales.

THE US Justice Department gave the all-clear on Monday for a merger,
announced in May, between two US metals and mining giants, Colorado-based
Cyprus Minerals and New York-based Amax.
The department cleared the sale of the two companies' molybdenite units. But
to satisfy anti-trust concerns raised by the merger, the companies, along
with others involved in the molybdenite business, were told they are subject
to an ongoing investigation into violations of anti-trust laws.
Molybdenite is a metal used to produce heat-resistant alloys used primarily
in the aerospace and defence industries. Cyprus and Amax produce the metal
as a by-product of other mining operations and both process molybdenite. In
the Justice Department decision, they agreed to sell operations in Idaho and
Pennsylvania.
Amax said the decision makes way for a Friday shareholding vote on the
merger, which will form the second largest copper producer in the US and
give it a dominant presence in the US coal industry. Pending shareholder
approval, Amax will distribute 40 per cent ownership in Amax Gold to
shareholders, spin off its Alumax aluminium unit in a tax-free distribution,
and combine its remaining assets with Cyprus Minerals.

THE FOCUS of the Dollars 10bn takeover battle for Paramount Communications
shifted to legal ground yesterday as Viacom fired off a new anti-trust
complaint against rival bidder QVC Network. QVC independently said a key
challenge for it was winning a lawsuit against Viacom due to be heard next
week.
Viacom, which agreed to a friendly merger with Paramount in September, had
already filed a suit seeking to halt QVC's hostile offer, on the grounds
that it was part of a monopolistic conspiracy by Tele-Communications (TCI),
the cable television group.
Since Viacom filed that suit, TCI has announced a plan to acquire associated
cable programme company, Liberty Media, and itself be acquired by Bell
Atlantic, the telephone company. Liberty Media owns 22 per cent of QVC.
Viacom yesterday amended its suit to include the Bell Atlantic-TCI-Liberty
merger in its complaint, and said the TCI-Liberty-QVC bid for Paramount had
caused it 'enormous damage'. It also named Comcast, a cable company which
owns 22 per cent of QVC, as an additional defendant.
Separately, the Federal Trade Commission, which examines anti-trust issues,
is thought to be near a decision on what, if any, stake Liberty Media can
have in QVC if the company wins its bid for Paramount.

SEGA, the Japanese games company which is challenging world leader Nintendo
with its popular Sonic the Hedgehog games, increased sales and profits in
the first half of the year, but could not escape the effects of recession
altogether.
Sega, which makes amusement hall games as well as video games for home use,
reported a 20 per cent increase in sales to Y200.65bn. from Y167.34bn and a
4.4 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Y28.58bn.
The company said it had seen strong demand for its arcade and home video
games, but it had not been able to avoid entirely the slowdown in
consumption, particularly in Japan where the sluggish economy has affected
job security.
The company said that its commercial games machines had seen a slowdown in
demand as businesses refrained from making new purchases. In the video games
market, consumers have become increasingly selective and competition was
fierce. The Japanese market, in particular, has seen products being
discounted heavily.
Sega said that it expects to increase its market share in the consumer video
games market by introducing Sonic the Hedgehog III, software for its line-up
of 16-bit games machines, hand-held video games and CD-ROM players.
It is forecasting sales for the full year of Y380bn, up from Y346.94 and
pre-tax profits of Y57.5bn against Y55.02 previously.

FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Recession erodes Seiko and
Citizen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE watchmakers, which once seemed set to dominate world markets, are
being slowed as profits are badly eroded by recession and a high yen.
Seiko, Japan's leading watchmaker and a world-renowned brand, plunged into
loss, while Citizen, its main Japanese competitor, saw pre-tax profits
decline 17 per cent.
Japanese consumers have been discouraged from buying new watches by the
recession, and corporate buying of gifts has declined.
Against this environment, Seiko reported a pre-tax loss of Y3.21bn (Dollars
29.7m) in the first half, against a profit of Y1.6bn previously. Turnover
for the watchmaker was 11 per cent down, to Y121.84bn from Y137.41bn.
Sales at Citizen also came under pressure, but the company managed a
moderate increase in turnover, to Y124.23bn from a previous Y123.78bn.
Pre-tax profits, however, were 17 per cent down to Y6.29bn against Y7.58bn.
The outlook remains poor for the watchmakers, and both Seiko and Citizen are
expecting a drop in full-year sales.
Seiko is forecasting a 4 per cent decline in sales, to Y258bn, and a pre-tax
loss of Y4bn. Citizen, meanwhile, is expecting to report a 9 per cent
decline in sales, to Y230bn, and a 41 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to
Y10bn.

AIWA, a medium-sized Japanese audio-visual maker, has outperformed some of
the giants in the electronics industry, writes Michiyo Nakamoto.
The Sony subsidiary has reported a doubling of pre-tax profits, on sales up
6 per cent in the first half of the fiscal year. This was despite the
stagnant market for audio-visual products in Japan and the adverse impact of
a high yen.
Sales were up 6 per cent to Y81.73bn (Dollars 757m) while pre-tax profits
were more than double at Y2.3bn from Y1.15bn a year ago.
The company's mini mini component stereos were an important contributor to
its improved profits. In the US, overall sales were up by 60 per cent on a
yen basis despite a 12 per cent increase in the yen's value, largely on the
strength of the mini mini component stereo.

CHINA Light &amp; Power, one of the stocks on the Hong Kong market most favoured
by foreign investors, yesterday produced slightly worse-than-expected
full-year results when it posted a 12 per cent growth in net profit to
HKDollars 3.5bn (USDollars 2.2bn) from HKDollars 3.2bn in 1992.
Profit was struck on a 10 per cent rise in turnover, to HKDollars 14.7bn
from HKDollars 13.4bn. A final dividend of HK 42 cents a share was declared,
making HKDollars 1.20 for the year - a rise of 15.4 per cent. A bonus
1-for-5 scrip issue was also made.
Analysts said the market had been expecting a rise in earnings of around 14
per cent, and that yesterday's results were 'a little duller than expected'.
They said next year's earnings would benefit from property developments in
the pipeline.
China Light said its sales of electricity to China have been affected by the
austerity measures introduced by the Chinese government to cool the
mainland's economy.
Total sales for the year amounted to 25,598m KW - up 10 per cent on last
year's - but the rate of increase in sales in the coming year was expected
to be lower.

FUJITSU, the Japanese computer and telecommunications group which controls
the UK-based ICL, revised its forecast downwards for consolidated results in
year to March.
The company, which had hoped to break even at the net level, now expects to
report a consolidated net loss.
Fujitsu said that due to the delayed recovery of the Japanese economy, the
rapid appreciation of the yen and the depressed state of the US mainframe
market, it was revising its pre-tax forecast down from Y50bn (Dollars 31m)
to Y35bn.
Sales are now forecast to reach Y3,150bn rather than Y3,280bn as forecast in
May. The company also expects to report a net loss of Y39bn rather than
break-even.
Fujitsu reported a consolidated pre-tax loss of Y24bn on sales of Y1,451 for
the first half. It managed, nevertheless to report a consolidated net profit
of Y44bn.

FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Australian SE put on the spot by
News Corp plan - A look at the dilemma facing the ASX over the thorny
problem of super voting shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PITY the Australian Stock Exchange. Today it is due to release a discussion
document on the thorny matter of 'super' voting shares, an issue which has
arisen in the context of News Corporation's desire to create two classes of
shares with different voting rights. While the paper itself will come to no
firm conclusion - merely outlining the options and asking for formal comment
 -many observers think that the exchange is in a bind.
Since News Corporation's chairman, Mr Rupert Murdoch, first announced the
'super share' plan at the company's annual meeting last month, there have
been no official details of how the scheme would work. Nevertheless, it
seems that existing shareholders would receive the new shares pro rata to
those already held - perhaps one for 10. Each new share would have multiple
voting rights - say, 25 votes.
Whatever the precise mathematics, the multiple voting rights would only
apply to the new shares so long as they were not transfered. In short, Mr
Murdoch - who currently speaks for about 33 per cent of News Corp's equity,
either directly or through the family company, Cruden Investments - could
enjoy creeping control over time, as other investors sold out. He could also
raise money by selling ordinary shares, without risking significant
dilution.
The problem for the stock exchange is that, if it endorses the principles
involved in this scheme, it moves against the trend in some other
international markets. In London, in particular, there has been a steady
effort to weed out differential voting structures, with big companies - like
Hammerson, the property group - making the switch to a one-vote, one-share
system.
Moreover, the stock exchange would have to make super share schemes
available to all and sundry. Already, one corporate lawyer in Sydney says
her clients have been tentatively exploring their options should a green
light given to the News Corp plan.
But if the ASX turns the scheme down, News Corp could move overseas,
delisting from the Australian market in favour of a more tolerant regime. At
the annual meeting, Mr Murdoch noted that 'similar arrangements have long
been in place in many of the great media companies of the US and Europe'.
Although he did not mention specific companies at the time, the statement
would be true of Dow Jones or Pulitzer Publishing.
News Corp's departure would have a significant impact on the Australian
stock market. In terms of market capitalisation, the company accounts for
almost 8 per cent of the All-Ordinaries index. Last month, trading in News
Corporation shares represented 7.62 per cent of the market's total turnover.
Only one company - Broken Hill Proprietary - is more important to the market
on these measures.
The fund management community has not made the ASX's position any easier, by
indicating its qualms over the News Corp plan. The Australian Investment
Managers Group says it has reservations about the principles involved and
will now poll members, in order to deliver a formal submission to the ASX.
Mr Ian Matheson, executive director of AIMG, expects a fairly unanimous
result: 'My feeling is that there is an overwhelming opposition to what is
being proposed,' he said yesterday.
Remarks at the weekend by the California Public Employees Retirement System
(Calpers), the large US institutional investor, also decrying the principles
involved, may be more helpful. At least they suggest that News Corp might
not have a universally favourable reception if it did contemplate a shift to
the US.
Meanwhile, super voting shares will not be the only matter dealt with in
today's discussion paper. The ASX is also expected to look the issue of
'targeted shares' - which are designed to reflect the performance of one
specific division within a company.
In this case, the question arises in the context of New Zealand-based
Fletcher Challenge, which is seeking to create a class of shares which would
be tied to the performance of its plantation, forestry and log trading
businesses in New Zealand and Chile. These, it hopes, would trade on the ASX
as well as the NZSE and the New York SE.
To date, 'targeted shares' have been a US practice, featuring companies like
USX and General Motors. However, even bankers who have promoted their use
there, admit that targeted shares tend to be most useful where a full
'demerger' of the division in question is not possible. To date, companies
which have pursued this road can be counted on the fingers of one hand.
That said, such schemes do raise questions over the allocation of voting
rights - that is, how these should be divided between the different stock
classes. However, their contentiousness fades in comparison with that of
non-transferable 'super voting' shares. There seems little doubt which issue
will give the ASX a bigger headache.

The company said that it has taken an important step in exploring investment

negotiating a number of power station projects in China, including a
long-term co-operation agreement with the electricity authorities in
Shandong province.
In Hong Kong, the company said local sales of commercial and domestic
electricity have shown strong growth (8.2 per cent and 12.8 per cent
respectively) but that sales to industry had fallen by 5 per cent during the
year.

FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: MIM Holdings returns to the
black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIM Holdings, the Brisbane-based metals group, told shareholders yesterday
it had moved into the black in October, after reporting an operating loss of
ADollars 6.9m (USDollars 4.6m), before abnormal items, in the first quarter
of the current year.
The company also suggested asset sales may be on the cards.
It said all the group's investments had been reviewed and the relevance of
some interests to the group's core business questioned.
'You will have noted we have disposed of our shareholding in Evan Deakin
Industries . . . we sold our small investment in Lynas Gold . . . these will
be followed by others,' said Mr Bruce Vaughan, chairman.
Questioned later about the possible sale of coal assets, he said the group
was 'turning every stone over'. 'Maybe coal is a big stone that takes a bit
of turning over. It is being looked at in accordance with all the other
options we are considering,' he said.

accounts

<TEXT>
WESTERN Mining Corporation, the diversified mining group, has revealed that
the presentation of its year-end results has fallen foul of the Australian
Securities Commission (ASC), the country's stock-market watchdog. The
warning came less than 24 hours before its annual meeting.
In a statement made jointly with the ASC, the company noted its preliminary
final statement on September 2, 'dealt firstly with the company's profit
results by reference to equity-accounted profit and group consolidated
profit before abnormals, and subsequently dealt with equity-accounted profit
after abnormals.
'After receiving a complaint, the Australian Securities Commission assessed
the matter and concluded that undue emphasis has been given in WMC's public
announcement to the equity profit before abnormal items of ADollars 165.9m',
it continued.
The ASC is now asking WMC to change the order in which it deals with its
profit results, so that consolidated profits after tax and abnormals become
the first item in public announcements. Last time, this would have shown a
surplus of ADollars 64m (USDollars 42.9m), compared with a loss of ADollars
8.5m in the previous year.
WMC defended the previous prominence given to equity-accounted profit on the
grounds that 'the significance of the company's Alcoa holding should be
identified to shareholders', but said that it would in future meet the ASC's
request.

FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: German stores join merger queue:
A look at the likely marriage of Karstadt and Hertie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT is an open secret that the supervisory boards of Karstadt and Hertie, two
of Germany's biggest retail groups, are finalising details of a merger of
the two companies. The full story is likely to emerge at a press conference
on Friday morning in Frankfurt.
A merger would create a new force in German retailing, combining Essen-based
Karstadt, Germany's biggest department store chain with sales of DM20.6bn
(Dollars 12.1bn) last year and Frankfurt-based Hertie, the third biggest
with sales of DM7bn.
The group will have turnover of DM28bn and 238 outlets. It will eclipse
Kaufhof, Karstadt's Cologne-based rival, as Germany's largest department
store chain, but in terms of sales will be smaller than each of Metro,
Tengelmann and Rewe, three of Germany's privately-owned retail groups.
Both Karstadt and Hertie have the disadvantage of being part of the sluggish
department stores sector.
This segment of the market, which accounted for almost all of the
privately-owned Hertie's turnover last year and 65 per cent of Karstadt's,
has been in decline for decades as consumers have switched their preferences
to specialty retailers and discount stores. The downturn in consumer
spending which is part and parcel of the recession has made matters worse.
Hertie derives 30 per cent of its turnover from just six, well-known stores,
including the KaDeWe - Kaufhaus des Westens - in Berlin. But these flagships
did not give the group any immunity from the long, slow decline of the
department store sector and Hertie spent much of the 1980s battling with
losses. The group has been making profits for the last five years but the
economic downturn has taken its toll and profits dropped to DM16.7m last
year from DM56.6m in 1991.
While analysts credit Karstadt with being well managed, its dependence on
the department stores segment (which accounts for 65 per cent of revenue)
has led some brokers to put the group's shares on their sell list. Earlier
this year, it said that profits in 1993 would probably fall from the DM224m
made last year in spite of a slight increase in turnover.
This is in marked contrast to the optimism shown by Kaufhof, Karstadt's
arch-rival since both were founded about 125 years ago. Kaufhof is
predicting that sales will grow by 10 per cent this year and profits will
rise considerably from last year's level - reflecting the group's moves away
from department stores into the specialty retailing sector.
A fusion of Karstadt/Hertie is unlikely to lead to a sudden spurt in
profitably, but it does open horizons for the combined companies. 'The
merger will give Karstadt an excellent and rare opportunity for long-term
growth in its sector,' said Ms Sabine Blumel at Credit Lyonnais Securities
in London.
The growth is likely to come from rationalisation as the two groups sort out
their stores portfolio so that they no longer compete with one another
directly on the high street.
In addition, there will be scope for further cost reductions as the combined
companies pool their purchasing activities.
This will help Karstadt/Hertie compete more effectively with the Swiss-based
Metro empire. This controls Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus and Kaufhof among an
extensive portfolio of German retail interests and enjoys the purchasing
power which comes with having worldwide sales of more than DM70bn, the bulk
in Germany.
If the depressed background to the department stores sector provides the
main catalyst to the merger, the role of Germany's big banks should not be
underestimated.
Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, and Commerzbank, third biggest, own
25 per cent each of Karstadt. These shareholdings date back to the 1930s
when they stepped in to rescue the group from near bankruptcy.
Germany's big banks are keen to reduce their controversial holdings in
German industry and it seems likely that their stakes will drop to 10 per
cent each as part of the deal.
The most likely structure for the deal, which may value Hertie at up to
DM1.8bn, will involve the banks selling the bulk of their holdings in
Karstadt in return for the shares in Hertie, which is 97.5 per cent owned by
a charitable trust. The banks will then sell on the Hertie shares in return
for cash which Karstadt will probably raise through a mixture of debt and
equity finance.
However the deal is structured, it will have to be approved by Germany's
federal cartel authorities. Analysts say they are unlikely to block it but
may force the combined group to sell some stores in Berlin, where it will
have a high share of the market.

<TEXT>
ASEA Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss engineering group, yesterday
strengthened its position in the market for industrial robots. It is to
acquire the robotics operations of Renault and form a joint venture in
automated vehicle assembly with the French car group.
The two companies said that the 50-50 joint venture would employ about 290
people and have annual sales of about Dollars 80m. After the acquisition of
Renault's robotic operations, ABB's French robotic operations would have
annual sales of about Dollars 60m and would employ about 200 people.
Mr Stelio Demark, managing director of ABB Robotics, said the deals with
Renault were a central element in the company's strategy of shifting from a
product supplier to a partner of industrial groups in the design and
manufacture of automated systems.
He said the joint venture, which will centre on body in white activities -
where cars are assembled and welded together - would give ABB access to
Renault's production line expertise and enable it to offer higher
value-added products and services.
The proposals, which require final approval by Renault employees, would give
ABB its first joint venture project with a car manufacturer, the biggest
market for robotics, and its first direct participation in the assembly
stage of the production line.
The expansion of ABB's French activities through the acquisition of
Renault's robotics division is aimed at achieving economies of scale in what
Mr Demark described as an increasingly competitive market. He said prices
for industrial robots had fallen by between 25 per cent and 30 per cent over
the past three to four years. This prompted Renault to sell its robotics
operations.
Renault's robotics operation, the largest in France, accounts for about 12
per cent of total sales of FFr1.4bn (Dollars 237.3m) from its automation
division.

core area

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VEBA, the German cong-lomerate, yesterday reported a near 12 per cent
decline in pre-tax profits for the first nine months of this year, in spite
of growth in the group's core energy activities.
The group said pre-tax profits dropped by 11.6 per cent to DM1.064bn
(Dollars 665m) on turnover up 0.7 per cent to DM49.59bn in the nine months.
Net profits after tax dropped by 14 per cent to DM453m from DM527m.
Veba saw no improvement in the economic environment in the last quarter of
the year, and no improvement in earnings.
Earnings from electricity grew because of an increase in sales combined with
good capacity utilisation at its power stations. But in chemicals the
earnings position continued to be unsatisfactory, with large losses coming
in particular from the synthetic materials and rubber divisions, the group
said.
The losses reflected the costs of restructuring in the chemicals sector.
Veba said it was cutting 10,000 jobs this year and next, with the bulk of
the cuts falling in its chemicals businesses, with the aim of trimming
DM1.2bn off its cost base.
Earnings from trade and services matched the comparable figure for last year
while the oil sector posted a sharp decline.

FFr2.6bn

<TEXT>
REMY Cointreau, the French wines and spirits group, yesterday said its sales
had risen by 12.2 per cent to FFr2.6bn (Dollars 441m) in the six months
ended September.
The group said it had increased sales in all of its four principal divisions
and forecast that pre-tax profits for the April-September period would be
about 20 per cent higher than the FFr104m achieved in the same period in
1992.
The strongest growth during the first half was recorded in champagne sales,
which rose by 26.3 per cent to FFr252.2m.
The group said its principal brands, Krug, Charles Heidsieck and Piper
Heidsieck, had achieved the increase in sales without lowering prices.
Cognac sales, which include Remy Martin, also enjoyed strong growth.
Turnover in the division increased by 22.4 per cent to FFr1.1bn during the
period. However, the group's liqueurs, wines and spirits sales saw much
slower growth and increased by just 2.5 per cent to FFr727m.
Last year Remy's net profits fell sharply - by 25 per cent to FFr202m - on
the back of difficulties in the champagne market where producers were
severely squeezed by weak demand and high grape prices.

1.8bn mobile radio deal

<TEXT>
NEXTEL, a rapidly expanding US mobile data communications services company,
plans to construct a nationwide advanced digital communications network that
will compete with existing cellular telephone services.
Nextel is buying licences to operate mobile communications services in
several of the largest metropolitan areas in the US from Motorola, the
makers of semiconductors and communications systems, in a deal worth about
Dollars 1.8bn.
Nextel has purchased licences from Motorola covering the use of more than
2,500 radio frequencies in 21 states. These specialised mobile radio
services are used for dispatch of taxis and other vehicle fleets.
In exchange for its radio frequency licenses, Motorola will receive a 20 per
cent stake in Nextel and is providing Dollars 260m in new financing. These
arrangements will result in more than Dollars 500m in financing being
provided by Motorola, Nextel said.
Nextel announced that it had reached a technology alliance with Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone of Japan. NTT has taken an equity stake in Nextel,
purchasing 1.5m shares for Dollars 75m. NTT will assist Nextel in developing
its digital wireless network.
When fully constructed in 1995, Nextel's networks would be capable of
reaching 180m people across the US, the company said. Services will include
mobile telephone, dispatch, alpha-numeric paging and data transmission from
a single mobile telephone handset.
'We view this transaction with Motorola as the capstone of our acquisition
campaign,' said Mr Morgan O'Brien, chairman of Nextel. In recent weeks
Nextel, formerly called Fleet Call, has spent more than Dollars 1bn to
acquire dispatch service licenses in various parts of the US.
Nextel's goal is to upgrade these systems with digital technology developed
by Motorola, which will provide the company with equipment and technical
assistance.
'In the six years of our existence, we have completed 125 transactions,
acquired thousands of frequencies in hundreds of markets and raised more
than Dollars 1.2bn in financing. Now we can turn our full attention to
deploying the nation's first network of all-digital, integrated wireless
communications,' said Mr O'Brien.
Nextel has started offering its integrated digital services in southern
California. The company said its services would cover most of the state
within the first quarter of 1994. New services will be available in New York
and Chicago by mid-1994. For Motorola, the biggest operator of dispatch
services in the US, the sale reflects its decision to offer technology and
equipment rather than provide services.
Motorola recently sold 42 per cent of its dispatch service licences to
CenCall and Dial Page, both dispatch service providers, in exchange for
stock valued at about Dollars 1.2bn.

FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Muramoto creditors warned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NAGOYA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MURAMOTO, the Japanese construction company which last week filed for court
protection with debts of up to Y590bn (Dollars 5.5bn), yesterday warned that
creditors might recover only a small part of their cash.
Leading bank lenders could get half of their loans back, if Muramoto,
Japan's largest post-war financial collapse, was put into liquidation, said
Mr Katsusuke Amano, a lawyer representing the group.
Low priority creditors might retrieve less than 1 per cent of their cash in
the case of a liquidation, warned Mr Amano, who is helping the group to
persuade the courts to agree to a restructure rather than liquidation.
A meeting of about 400 suppliers in Nagoya, one of the main towns in the
region where Muramoto is based, heard that the group owned property and land
valued at about Y300bn in its books. Mr Amano warned the market value was
lower, due to the fall in asset prices which preceded this recession.
Mr Toyohiro Muramoto, group president, presented a ritual apology to the
meeting and begged for suppliers' understanding.
'I could not overcome this situation, but we still hope to keep the company
going,' he said. Suppliers were unsympathetic and questioned Muramoto
executives for more than two hours in a hotel conference room on payments.
Suppliers would from now on be paid in cash, subject to authorisation by
court officials, said Mr Amano. Employees have been asked to continue work
on the group's 535 outstanding contracts. Muramoto has Y10bn of cash in
hand, which should enable it to complete 80 per cent of that work, said Mr
Amano.
Muramoto is awaiting the decision of a court in Osaka, the regional capital,
on whether it should be restructured and turned into a going concern, or
made bankrupt and liquidated. The court's investigators will take three to
six months to make up their minds, said Mr Amano. If allowed to stay in
business, Muramoto would take 10 to 15 years to recover, he said.
Muramoto, Japan's 24th largest contractor, filed for protection from
creditors after banks withdrew support.
Estimates by Teikoku Databank, a leading credit research group, that the
group's debts totalled Y590bn were probably too high, said Mr Amano.
He calculated group debts at Y466bn, of which Y290bn was owned by the parent
company and Y176m by subsidiaries.
The final figure would depend on the results of the court investigation and
the market value of Muramoto's property, he said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES of International Food Machinery dived 19p to 35p yesterday as the
company warned that profits for the year to December 31 were likely to be
'substantially below' market estimates.
The reasons given were:
The company has adopted a more stringent accounting policy for the
recognition of sales;
Two major contracts are unlikely to be completed prior to December 31;
There has been a recent downturn in business in the UK and Europe which has
particularly affected the meat and bakery division;
Various exceptional expenses incurred in the reorganisation of the group and
promotional expenditure in opening up overseas markets have been written
off.
The company came to market in December 1992 with the shares priced at 51p.
In September, when it reported a surge in pre-tax profits from Pounds
292,000 to Pounds 878,000 for the first six months of 1993, the shares rose
by 9p to 80p.

<TEXT>
MERCURY Asset Management, the UK's largest fund management company,
yesterday reported a 42 per cent rise from Pounds 35.5m to Pounds 50.4m in
pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 1993.
The company, which is 75 per cent owned by SG Warburg, also raised its
interim dividend to 4p per share compared with 3p.
Total funds under management rose 11.7 per cent in the period to Pounds
55.5bn, although the increase in net new money, after effects of ris-ing
securities prices, was Pounds 1.1bn.
Mr Hugh Stevenson, chairman, said of that amount roughly Pounds 350m was on
behalf of the company's retail fund management businesses including private
client and unit trust activities.
A further Pounds 500m to Pounds 600m is growth in its core UK pension fund
institutional fund management business.
Operating costs were also up sharply from Pounds 45.8m to Pounds 56.8m,
which partly reflect-ed higher staff compensat-ion costs, the directors
stated.
However, analysts noted that the company's ratio of revenues to funds under
management had slipped marginally to 0.37 per cent against 0.38 per cent.
This reflected the declining fee scales offered to larger sums under
management.
Mr Stevenson said that while the retail businesses were growing more quickly
than the institutional side, which had dominated MAM's stable of clients, he
believed there was further room for expansion in the UK pension fund market.
MAM had also picked up significant new business managing international bond
portfolios for US pension fund clients and had gained new Japanese pension
fund clients.

FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Emerald Energy heads for USM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMERALD Energy is to be introduced to the USM next week in a Pounds 1.7m
share placing which will follow a reverse takeover engineered by Mr Peter
Winton, the former exploration director of Tricent-rol.
Tricentrol made substantial discoveries in the North Sea in the 1980s before
being bought by Arco, the US oil company.
Emerald Energy is based on the Isle of Man. It will place 170m new shares at
1p each through brokers John Siddall and Son, and Walker, Crips, Weddle,
Beck. Trading will begin next Tuesday. Its shares have traded under Rule
535(2).
Mr Iain Alexander, who will take over as chairman, says the bulk of the
Pounds 1.51m Emerald intends to raise will be used to develop US oil and gas
assets acquired from Mr Winton's Cobham Oil and Gas for Pounds 500,000 in
shares and options.
The 46 wells on 4,200 acres of land in west Virginia are located in the
Appalachian Basin, where oil and gas have been produced since the late
1800s.
Many of the wells are not in production, but Mr Winton, who takes over as
managing director of Emerald, says a combination of deepening existing wells
and drilling 120 new ones nearby 'will open up significant reserves'.
Emerald's strategy is to take advantage of the recent deregulation of the US
natural gas industry and the higher prices which have ensued by seeking
additional acquisitions of existing fields whose output can be increased
without big capital investment.

FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Gt Portland Estates declines 4% to Pounds
16m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREAT PORTLAND Estates, which in the summer raised Pounds 95m through a
rights issue, reported a fall of just over 4 per cent in pre-tax profits for
the six months to the end of September.
The group, the sixth largest UK property company, made Pounds 16m, down from
a previous Pounds 16.7m. The dilutive effect of the rights issue and a
higher tax charge pushed earnings per share down to 4.3p compared with 5.6p.
Acquisitions to the value of about Pounds 65m have been made since the
rights issue, including shopping centres in Harlow and Torquay, a Reading
office building, and retail property in Ilford and Sheffield.
In a full year these would add Pounds 6m of income, the directors said,
adding that most of the leases had at least 15 years to run.
Mr Richard Peskin, chairman, said the purchases reflected the board's policy
of expanding and diversifying the company's assets and ensuring 'an extended
period of secure income'. Further acquisitions worth up to Pounds 20m were
expected soon.
He described the result as 'closely comparable' to last year's first half.
The interim dividend has been cut from 3.3p to 2.7p and Mr Peskin expects
the full-year divi-dend to be 8p (10p) as fore-cast in his statement last
June.
The group said that a recent revaluation of 20 per cent of its portfolio,
including most of its core property in the City, had shown an increase of 7
per cent since March. However, the group warned that this was not
necessarily a reflection of the whole portfolio.
Net rental income edged ahead to Pounds 40.13m (Pounds 40m). Mr Peskin said
that rents remained under pressure, particularly in London, but there had
been encouraging signs of a revival in interest. About 5 per cent of the
group's portfolio remains void in terms of both rent roll and total area,
down from 6 per cent at the end of June.

FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: DFS given Pounds 271m valuation - Chairman
and his family will raise Pounds 129m from sale of 47.7% stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GRAHAM KIRKHAM, executive chairman of DFS Furniture, and his family
yesterday raised Pounds 129m when their sale of 47.7 per cent of the shares
in the specialist upholstery retail chain was underwritten at 260p a share.
The remaining 51.7 per cent stake he and his family will have after
flotation is worth Pounds 140m at the issue price, and the whole company is
valued at Pounds 271.1m.
Mr Kirkham will not sell any further shares for a year. He will have a
three-year fixed-term contract with a remuneration package worth about
Pounds 300,000.
He said the length of his contract and his continuing substantial investment
in the shares showed his commitment to the company.
The issue price gives an historic p/e for the year to August 1 of 19.7, on
earnings per share of 13.2p, before non-recurring costs.
Profits included a Pounds 868,000 gain on the sale of land, and excluding
that the p/e would have been about 20 1/2 .
DFS said that had it been quoted, it would have paid a dividend for the year
of 6.4p, giving a notional yield of 3.1 per cent, covered 2.1 times.
The rating is at a slight premium to the stores sector. J Henry Schroder
Wagg, sponsor to the issue, said the pricing reflected investor demand.
Profits before tax and non-recurring items have risen from Pounds 4.7m in
1989 to Pounds 20.8m in 1993.
DFS said it expected to maintain its growth rate, and said current trading
was in line with expectations.
Operating margins should be maintained at last year's 16.3 per cent.
The group, which has 24 upholstery stores and three shops selling dining
furniture, has funded its expansion entirely through cash flow and plans to
continue that policy. It has Pounds 16m of cash.
The flotation comprises a placing of 32.5m shares and a public offer of
17.5m shares.
Applications close on November 17 with the basis of allocation expected the
following day. Dealings are due to start on November 24.
NatWest Wood Mackenzie is broker to the issue.
COMMENT
It is rare in the stores sector, or even in the stock market, to find a
company with apparently assured and rapid growth, and no financing problems.
The only question is whether it is too much of a one-man band. But Mr
Kirkham is still young, and seems as committed as ever to running the
business. The DFS issue should be a success. Analysts are looking for the
p/e to come down to under 18 in the current year which looks attractive.

FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Norcros rises 32% to Pounds 7.36m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORCROS, the building materials and specialist print and packaging group,
yesterday reported higher interim profits mainly reflecting sharply reduced
reorganisation costs and a modest recovery in trading conditions.
Pre-tax profits increased by 32.1 per cent to Pounds 7.36m for the 27 weeks
to September 30, up from a restated Pounds 5.56m in the 26-week first half
last year.
Earnings per share increased to 2.8p (2.4p) and the interim dividend is
maintained at 3.5p.
Operating profits, including contributions from associates, rose to Pounds
12.56m (Pounds 9.01m) on turnover up by 9.57 per cent to Pounds 209.5m
(Pounds 191.2m.)
The results have been prepared on an FRS 3 basis, and comparisons have been
restated accordingly. The main impact of this change was to reduce operating
profits in the comparable period by the Pounds 2.65m reorganisation and
redundancy costs previously shown as extraordinary items.
Turnover from continuing operations increased by 9.58 per cent to Pounds
208.1m (Pounds 189.9m) while operating profits were almost 40 per cent
higher at Pounds 12.1m (Pounds 8.7m).
Pre-tax profits were also boosted by a reduction in net interest costs from
Pounds 6.92m to Pounds 5.2m reflecting lower interest rates and a reduced
level of borrowings following the group's successful rights issue in June.
Net borrowings at the end of September stood at Pounds 76.4m representing
gearing of 44 per cent.
In the core buildings products division turnover increased by 4.7 per cent
to Pounds 83.2m while operating profits grew by 22.8 per cent to Pounds 3.9m
mainly reflecting the lower reorganisation costs.
In the ceramics division turnover rose by 15.4 per cent to Pounds 63.8m and
operating profits jumped 44.4 per cent to Pounds 4.6m. Meanwhile the print
and packaging division increased its turnover by 10.4 per cent to Pounds
51.9m and operating profits by 33.3 per cent to Pounds 5.2m.
The group has also made further progress disposing of its property assets.
During the first half Pounds 5.2m was received from the sale of properties
and, of the Pounds 40.8m balance at the half year, Pounds 17.2m of assets
were under offer.

FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Macmillan's fate known today when final
bids are opened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FATE of Macmillan, the US publisher bought by the late Mr Robert
Maxwell, should be known today after the final bids for the company are
opened.
Price Waterhouse, administrators to the Maxwell Communication Corporation,
are responsible for selling the business, which includes a 50 per cent stake
in the Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing joint venture.
Four companies were invited to submit final sealed bids by 5pm New York time
yesterday.
The four are Harcourt Brace Jovanovich the US publishers, K-111 the US
magazine publisher, Paramount Communications and Pearson, owner of the
Financial Times.
Price Waterhouse said last night there would be no further round of bidding
and that the highest bid submitted would now win.
The sale is likely to be the largest of the US disposals of the former
Maxwell empire and is likely to produce well in excess of Dollars 500m
(Pounds 331m).
Pearson, the only non-US bidder, is particularly interested in the college
and school textbook business of Macmillan.

Spring Ram, the kitchens and bathrooms group, said yesterday it had received
resignations from Mr Ron Farr, chief executive of the group's special
products division, and Mr David Riley, chief executive of the bathrooms
division.
Mr Roger Regan, who was installed as chairman of Spring Ram by disgruntled

announced a change in accounting policy which resulted in heavy losses and
substantial gearing.
Yesterday's announcement marks the conclusion of legal negotiations on the
terms.

<TEXT>
SHARES IN Roxboro, the Newmarket-based manufacturer of specialist electronic

the year to December 31, compared with Pounds 3.1m last year.
Earnings are expected to total 11.6p this year (or 13.3p before exceptional
items). The notional dividend for the current year is forecast at 1.9p.

FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Multitone agrees to bid from Champion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHAMPION Technology, the Hong Kong-based telepaging group, yesterday made a
recommended 143p-a-share cash offer for Multitone Electronics which values
the UK-based paging equipment pioneer at just over Pounds 21.5m.
Champion said it had received irrevocable undertakings in respect of 62.4
per cent of Multitone's issued equity. Multitone's shares closed 8p higher
at 139p.
The deal, once completed, will provide the fast-growing Champion group,
which was listed in Hong Kong in August last year, with additional
manufacturing capacity, and access to the European market for paging
equipment.
Champion, which has a market capitalisation of HKDollars 802.4m (Pounds
70.1m), yesterday reported pre-tax profits of HKDollars 148.8m on turnover
of HKDollars 298.6m in the year to June 30. The group has recorded compound
growth in turnover of 122.3 per cent over the last three years - mainly
fuelled by the market in China but has acknowledged that the supply of
adequate numbers of high quality products is the main limiting factor
affecting it's future growth.
Multitone, which has operations in the UK, continental Europe and Malaysia
and distributes its products mainly in Europe, developed the first radio
pager in 1955 and was one of the pioneers of pager systems.
In the year to April 30 the group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.6m
(Pounds 1.9m) on turnover of Pounds 24.6m (Pounds 23.2m).
Last month it issued a warning saying that it expected to report a small
pre-tax loss in the first half and only a small pre-tax profit for the year.

FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: NMC jumps 52% as US carton side expands
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NMC, the London-based packaging group, yesterday reported a 52 per cent jump
in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.34m for the half year to end-September.
The advance reflected a continuing strong performance from UPC, the core US
folding carton operation, together with a return to profit by the UK
activity.
Basic earnings per share rose from 2.01p to 4.44p and the interim dividend
is being lifted from 0.5p to 1.25p. The directors looked forward to
'continued growth in earnings' in the second half.
Turnover totalled Pounds 64.86m (Pounds 52.12m) of which the US operation
contributed Pounds 57.7m (Pounds 42.98m). The UK figure fell to Pounds 7.18m
(Pounds 9.14m), although Pounds 2.5m of the 1992 figure stemmed from a now
discontinued operation.
Interest charges increased from Pounds 738,000 to Pounds 1.23m and tax from
Pounds 771,000 to Pounds 1.26m.
The US operation benefited from a stronger dollar while the UK side was
expected to continue profitable trading.
The shares put on 4p to 120p.

</HEADLINE>

SHARES in James Dickie rose 16p to 81p yesterday as the USM-quoted
manufacturer of engineering components announced a jump in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 206,000 to Pounds 678,000 for the year to August 31. The figure
last time has been restated in accordance with FRS 3.
Turnover advanced to Pounds 16.5m against Pounds 15.4m.
Mr Joseph Grimmond, chairman, said the result was achieved despite the
group's inability to obtain any general price increase and that in real
terms prices to customers had fallen since 1991.
However, profit margins had increased, he said, which was a measure of the
effort to seek better production methods and control overheads.
A single final of 2p (1p) is recommended from earnings of 8.4p (2.5p) per
share.

FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Leeds Permanent 22% up despite rising bad
debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEEDS PERMANENT, the UK's fifth largest building society, yesterday reported
a 22 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 186.2m for the year to
September 30 in spite of increased provisions for bad debt.
The provisions, which rose from Pounds 105.2m to Pounds 131.1m, reflected a
fall in property values of about 5 per cent in the last quarter of 1992
which increased losses on properties held in possession.
However, provisions in the second half of the year were down by 44 per cent
compared with the first half.
There was also a deduction of Pounds 50.9m from net interest received to
reflect irrecoverable interest on properties in possession and arrears. But
a sharp increase in net interest received - from Pounds 342.1m to Pounds
428m - contributed significantly to the society's improved profitability.
Mr Roger Boyes, finance director, said the increase was largely because of
the society's active Treasury operation, as well as the opportunity for
widening margins as interest rates fell in the aftermath of sterling's
departure from the European exchange rate mechanism last autumn.
He said a 14 per cent increase in management expenses to Pounds 220.4m
reflected in part the depreciation of earlier investment in information
technology.
Mr Boyes confirmed that the Leeds was still looking for other opportunities
after its plans for a merger with National &amp; Provincial, the UK's eighth
largest society, were called off at the eleventh hour last month because of
cultural differences.
The society has also resumed its search for a new chief executive, but it is
now unlikely that anyone will be in place before the end of the year.
Mr John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at UBS, said the results
both set the trend for the building society sector in improved profitability
and capital strength, and confirmed Leeds' 'viability as an independent
financial institution' even though it had lost out on the added benefits of
the proposed merger.
The results were typical for the sector only because in covering the last
quarter of 1992, they included provisions for bad debts which would have
been included in other societies' results for 1992-93.

FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Nu-Swift makes progress on privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NU-SWIFT, the fire protection and property group which is being taken
private, reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 4.3m for the
first half of 1993.
The company said yesterday that 'significant progress' had been made towards
the privatisation. The Yorkshire-based group, quoted on the USM, is 66 per
cent owned by its chairman, Mr Jacques Murray, through European Fire
Protection. Mr Michael Ashcroft's ADT holds 22.8 per cent.
Group turnover fell from Pounds 154.5m to Pounds 152.1m. Turnover from
discontinued operations accounted for Pounds 132.3m, reflecting the
contribution from the US office cleaning and maintenance division which was
sold in June.
Turnover from continuing operations rose from Pounds 18.2m to Pounds 19.7m.
The group said that its fire protection business had 'continued to make a
considerable contribution to profits', with a new production unit in
Yorkshire helping to cut costs. The division contributed Pounds 2.7m to
operating profits, down from Pounds 2.8m last time.
Operating profits from the property investment division rose from Pounds
5.6m to Pounds 6.3m. The group said that while no independent valuation of
its investment property portfolio had been made since December 31 last year,
the board was confident it had more than maintained its value.
It continued to yield gross rental income of more than 10 per cent.
Earnings per share were 7.52p (5.09p). No interim dividend will be paid.
However, the group said that if the privatisation talks were terminated,
with no subsequent offer to shareholders, the board 'will recommend a
special interim dividend for 1993.'

FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Anglian Water flat at Pounds 100.5m - Sales
increase sharply, boosted by 8% price increase in April
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLIAN WATER, one of the largest privatised water companies, was yesterday
quietly optimistic about its full-year outlook in spite of reporting
virtually flat pre-tax profits of Pounds 100.5m for the six months to
September 30.
Mr Chris Mellor, finance director, said the group was confident it 'might
show some improvement on the full year'. Analysts pencilled in forecasts of
Pounds 190m for the year to March 31, against Pounds 185.4m last year. The
shares closed 3p down at 491p.
Mr Mellor also indicated that Anglian intended to launch a concerted
lobbying effort following last week's consultation document on pricing
regulations in the water industry. Mr Ian Byatt, the industry regulator, has
indicated he wants to cut the rate of return enjoyed by water companies from
7 per cent to about 5 per cent.
'It is something we don't see adding up,' Mr Mellor said. Anglian, was
committed to spending some Pounds 2bn between 1995 and 2000, including
installing compulsory metering in more than 1.3m homes.
Such investment levels would require 'a rate of return which enables us to
finance the business on a sustainable basis,' Mr Mellor said.
Anglian's profits were achieved on a sharp rise in sales from Pounds 286.3m
to Pounds 341.4m. The increase was partly due to an 8 per cent price rise in
April, which accounted for Pounds 22m of sales, and also to the inclusion
for a full six months of Nordic Water.
Nordic Water, which was purchased in February for Pounds 38m and broke even
in the first half, offers design contracting and equipment supply services
to water companies in Europe and North America. Mr Mellor said Anglian
expected Nordic to return a profit in the second half, and cover its
interest costs for the full year.
In the core water business, Anglian showed a Pounds 2.7m increase in
operating profit to Pounds 118.7m. The advance was held back by a 7.5 per
cent decline in measured income, or sales to industrial customers.
'Companies under cost pressure are generally looking to cut back on water
consumption,' Mr Mellor said.
The start-up costs of Anglian Water International resulted in a Pounds 2.2m
loss, leaving an operating profit for the group of Pounds 116.5m (Pounds
114m).
A 49 per cent increase in debt to Pounds 423.8m reflected the rise in
capital expenditure from Pounds 147.2m to Pounds 178.9m. Investment was
budgeted at Pounds 380m for the full year. Gearing was 23 per cent.
The dividend was raised by 7.4 per cent to 7.3p, while earnings rose from
31.7p to 32.2p.

FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Norwegian tanker group for market valued at
Pounds 212m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BONA Shipholding, a company set up to run the tanker interests of Norwegian
shipping group Leif Hoegh, plans a stock market listing which will raise
Dollars 120m of new capital and value the company at about Dollars 320m
(Pounds 212m).
Bona, a Bermuda-registered company which was set up last year, already has
interests in 12 oil-bulk-ore vessels, tankers and product carriers and has
placed orders and options for a further three tankers.
It plans to issue between 11m and 15m new shares at about Dollars 10-Dollars
12 a share in a move which would reduce Leif Hoegh's stake from 76 per cent
to about 42 per cent.
A pathfinder prospectus is to be issued at the end of November with pricing
likely to follow in the second week of December.
The Bona issue will be the sixth share offering to be announced by a
shipping company in the past six months and signals a reawakening of
investor interest in the sector, said Mr David Freud, a director of SG
Warburg, which is handling the listing and share offer.
Warburg will offer 85 per cent of the new shares to international investors
while the remainder will be offered in Norway by Den norske Bank. The shares
will be listed on the Oslo stock exchange and also traded in London and in
the US to qualified institutions under Rule 144A.
More than half of the world's tanker fleet is more than 15 years old and
tougher safety standards could lead to many more vessels being scrapped over
the next few years.
By separating its tanker interests from its other activities Leif Hoegh will
avoid distorting its balance sheet and will distance itself from the risks
inherent in far tougher environmental legislation introduced in the US in
the wake of the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
Bona's chairman is Mr Rudolph Agnew, who is also chairman of TVS and a
former chairman of Consolidated Gold Fields. Mr John Smadal, a former
president of Leif Hoegh, is chief executive.

FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Profits warning clips 61p off FII shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in FII plunged 61p to 280p yesterday as the shoe manufacturer and
scientific instrument supplier issued a profits warning just one day before
its annual general meeting.
FII said yesterday that it expected a Pounds 1m loss in its science and
technical division, following the unexpected cancellation of a contract and
the separate recall of one of its major products. The result would be a
substantial reduction in profits compared with last year's Pounds 3.48m.
Analysts had been expecting full year profits of about Pounds 5.3m.
The future strategy relating to the science and technical division was now
under consideration.
However, the company sought to reassure investors with an optimistic
statement over trading in its other divisions and in the second half. As a
result, its dividend policy would remain unchanged, FII said.
As one of the main suppliers of shoes to Marks and Spencer, FII has been
unable to pass on the sharp increases in raw materials costs following the
devaluation of sterling. The increase in costs was partly to blame for a 19
per cent tumble in annual profits to Pounds 5.2m.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTE and Savoy yesterday postponed a decision on who should take over the
chairmanship of the Savoy group when Sir Anthony Tuke retires in May next
year.
The Savoy board, which met yesterday, is believed to have discussed the
issue briefly, but without reaching any conclusion.
Forte is thought to be opposed to either Mr Giles Shepard, Savoy's managing
director, or Mr John Kemp-Welch, joint senior partner at Cazenove, becoming
chairman. Forte is believed to favour Sir Michael Richardson, chairman of
Smith New Court.
Both sides would like to see Mr Willi Bauer, a former Savoy general manager,
becoming chief executive of the group.
Forte owns a majority of Savoy shares and a minority of the voting shares.
Neither party would comment on the meeting.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Take-up of Costain rights only 28%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 83.9m rights issue by Costain Group, the troubled UK construction
and mining company, was supported by only 28 per cent of the group's
shareholders.
This left most new shares with institutions which underwrote the
fund-raising.
The 5-for-4 rights issue at 30p per share will cut Costain's heavy
borrowings and underpin its US coal mining business. Costain shares, which
peaked at 366p in 1987, closed unchanged yesterday at 29 1/2 p.
The company said that the take-up was lower than it would have preferred but
the nature of the issue meant that it was always likely sub-underwriters
would receive more shares.
Sir Christopher Benson, chairman, said: 'The sub-underwriters include
several large institutions which have reiterated their support as
shareholders in the group.'
Robert Fleming, which had a 7 per cent stake in the group, will see its
stake rise to about 17 per cent, making it the largest shareholder.
Mr Peter Seabrook, fund manager with Robert Fleming, said the outcome was
disappointing but not surprising. His institution was taking a long-term
view of Costain as a potential recovery stock.
There was some criticism about Mr Peter Costain continuing as the group's
chief executive when it announced in September its second rights issue
within two years. An issue in 1991 raised Pounds 77m.
One institution said last night that the key decision to support the
refinancing, and Mr Costain, had been taken when the sub-underwriting was
agreed. Mr Seabrook said: 'Mr Costain's position will continue to be
addressed - but in due time.'
The group ran into trouble after investing heavily to expand its
housebuilding and commercial property operations as the UK property boom was
peaking in the late 1980s. It has since sold these as well as its profitable
Australian coal mining operations.
Borrowings have remained stubbornly high. The rights issue will enable
Costain to reduce net debt as a proportion of shareholders funds from 132
per cent to 45 per cent. This compares with gearing of 450 per cent at the
start of this year.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Plans for new Lloyd's trust scrapped on fears of lack of
capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS TO launch a Lloyd's investment trust were scrapped yesterday,
indicating that the appetite of institutional investors for new Lloyd's
corporate capital schemes may be reaching its limit.
Lazard Brothers, Cazenove and Octavian Group, one of the largest Lloyd's
agencies, issued a pathfinder prospectus to raise capital for the Nelson
Lloyd's Trust last Thursday.
But yesterday Nelson announced that 'in current market conditions there
could not be sufficient assurance that the company would be able to raise
the initial target capital of Pounds 60m on which its investment and
underwriting strategies were based'.
Mr Nigel Rogers of Octavian said 'institutions have set aside a certain
amount of money but there is not a bottomless pit'. Nelson had 'come a
little bit late in the day. Today was the day we set for responses. Some
were good but it was clear we were not going to meet the target figure.'
The withdrawal follows other setbacks for backers of Lloyd's funds. HCG
Lloyd's Investment Trust and CLM Insurance Fund scaled down the amount of
capital raised, because of difficulties in obtaining sufficient 'good
quality' capacity on Lloyd's syndicates.
Last week Johnson Fry, the financial services group, abandoned plans to
launch a 'fund of funds' to attract retail investors after raising only
Pounds 8m of its Pounds 15m target.
Even so, over the past two weeks 10 funds have raised more than Pounds 500m
from institutional and retail investors. The biggest trust, the London
Insurance Market Investment Trust (LIMIT) sponsored by James Capel and
Samuel Montagu, successfully placed an issue for Pounds 280m with
institutions last Wednesday.
At least five other investment companies and trusts plan to raise up to
Pounds 650m in launches over the next few days.
One Lloyd's agency, the Hiscox Group, which has already launched one
investment trust, is so confident about prospects that yesterday it unveiled
plans to raise a further Pounds 25m for a second trust.
The new trust, Hiscox Dedicated, will provide capacity only to the four
syndicates managed by Hiscox Syndicates, the group's managing agency.
Charterhouse Tilney will support the new fund.

FT  10 NOV 93 / A common theme for twin dips in markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Global investment strategists are on red alert. Two of the world's biggest
securities markets, in US Treasury bonds and Japanese equities, have hit
trouble. The 30-year Treasury long bond yield flipped up from 5.78 per cent
on October 15 to 6.21 per cent last Friday, a correction proportionately
almost as severe as the 9 per cent tumble in the Nikkei Dow over the past
three weeks.
The Tokyo stock market generally shows scant correlation with markets
elsewhere, so we can probably put the timing of these twin dips down to
coincidence. There is a common underlying theme, though, in that both
markets have been sustained by low short-term interest rates that may have
encouraged investors to lose sight of the underlying realities.
My own view is that the longer-term outlook for US Treasuries is still fair,
although there may be a turbulent period in the immediate future.
Yesterday dollar bonds were rallying. Japanese equities, I guess more
pessimistically, are embarking on the fourth substantial downwards leg of
Tokyo's extended bear market.
From almost 7.5 per cent in January, the Treasury long bond yield has been
declining all year - until mid-October. The bull market in bonds has been
sustained by two main factors, the profitable yield curve play for the
banks, funding themselves off a 3 per cent money market rate, and the search
for yield by investors.
As far as the latter are concerned, it seems that the fall in returns below
6 per cent began to cut off the demand: net sales of mutual funds investing
in bonds fell from Dollars 15.4bn to Dollars 11.8bn between July and
September.
As for the banks, the question has always been how abruptly the freakishly
steep yield curve up to five years will be flattened by a rise in short-term
rates: US Treasury bond investors can pick up 150 basis points of yield at 3
years, UK gilt-edged buyers almost nothing.
Forecasts of the date of the first tightening by the Federal Reserve have
recently varied between the end of next year and the end of next week. The
latest evidence of a strengthening of the US economic recovery has
encouraged a rush for the exit. If up to Dollars 300bn of Treasuries must
find new buyers the yield adjustment could be quite sharp.
Certainly, the first quarter-point rise in US short rates will be regarded
as just the first step of many.
Over in Tokyo we have the mirror image of this problem, the appearance of
further evidence that the economic problems of Japan are dire.
Much of the huge expansion of industrial capacity in the 1980s at a more or
less zero cost of capital has turned out to represent massive waste. The
underlying, but largely hidden, bankruptcy of much of the property and
construction sector - and by extension, much of the financial system - is
gradually emerging into daylight.
Myths of the skilful official manipulation of the Tokyo stock market have
been devalued by the disruptive announcement of a new Nikkei 300 index and
the bungling of the JR East privatisation.
The bulls had been relying on potential support from very low bond yields,
based upon the ratio between JGB yields and company earnings yields on the
convenient assumption that profits will soon start to 'normalise'. But we
are now in the 1990s, and I believe that to draw conclusions from the
historical levels of various yield ratios during the 'bubble' period of the
1980s is a worthless exercise.
An unfortunately-timed example was the advice from Warburg Securities three
weeks ago that the moment had come to move back into Japan. This was based
inter alia upon a bond yield-related measure described as the
'cross-holdings adjusted earnings yield gap', and on hints of 'official'
support below 20,000 on the Nikkei.
The common theme in Japan and the US has been the low level of short-term
interest rates. But the difference has been in the economic circumstances.
So the JGB market has brushed aside the problems of equities in Tokyo, and
Wall Street equities have only suffered minor damage from the correction in
Treasury bonds.
Forget the historical ratios, look at the prospective fundamentals.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Warburg trebles pre-tax profits: Details of revenues show
big contribution from marketmaking and proprietary trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SG WARBURG Group, the UK-based investment bank, yesterday reported pre-tax
profits for the six months ended September 30 nearly trebled to Pounds
148.8m from Pounds 51.2m in the year-ago period.
Earnings per share rose to 89.9p from 24.7p.
The group for the first time also provided a breakdown of the sources of its
revenues, detailing the very significant contribution which marketmaking and
proprietary trading had made in the first half of the year. Analysts said
the figures, which had not been expected in such detail, were partly
responsible for knocking the Warburg's share price down 20p to 857p
yesterday in spite of its report of record six-month earnings.
The group also raised its interim dividend to 6p per share from 5.25p.
Warburg said fees and commissions provided revenues of Pounds 302.5m, up 42
per cent on the six months ended September 1992. Of that, 'perhaps less than
10 per cent' were advisory fees earned on Warburg's two largest
international equity offerings; the Pounds 5.4bn stake in British Telecom
sold on behalf of the UK government and the demerger of pharmaceuticals
company Zeneca from ICI.
'Everyone tends to overstate the profitability of the trophy transactions,'
said Lord Cairns, Warburg's chief executive, noting the heavy costs
associated with the BT and Zeneca offerings.
Marketmaking and proprietary trading revenues were Pounds 140.6m, up from
Pounds 39.8m.
Group operating costs also rose significantly during the period, with
personnel costs up to Pounds 224.5m from Pounds 146.1m in 1992.
Return on capital for the investment banking division - exempting Warburg's
75 per cent stake in Mercury Asset Management - was 25 per cent pre-tax,
Lord Cairns said.
Of the Pounds 1.26bn in regulatory capital employed by the group, Pounds
1.05bn was deployed in investment banking.
Lord Cairns said the group would be devoting greater capital in future to
developing its derivatives business, expanding on its recent acquisition of
KC-CO, a Chicago-based firm. 'We have a significant amount more to do,' he
said.
Geographically, Lord Cairns said that all regions 'contributed to
profitability', but declined to elaborate.

FT  10 NOV 93 / AT&amp;T reassures EC about expansion plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN TELEPHONE &amp; Telegraph, the US telecommunications group seeking to
establish itself in Europe, moved to reassure potential EC partners
yesterday by downplaying the likelihood of aggressive competition in their
home markets before the end of the decade.
Mr John Foster, AT&amp;T's Europe director, stressed that outside the UK,
telecoms competition was set to be low key for 'years' after the European
Commission's 1998 deadline for the liberalisation of internal EC voice
telecommunications traffic.
'A lot of people assume that the world changes on 1 Jan 1998,' said Mr
Foster. In fact, there would be an 'extended period' of transition. 'It will
be a matter of years before competition is developed at all fully.' He drew
a parallel with the position in the US, where MCI, now the second largest
long-distance carrier, took nearly two decades to establish itself as a
strong competitor to AT&amp;T.
Mr Foster declined to comment on current negotiations, but AT&amp;T is known to
be in talks with France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom about a possible
link-up to create an international network for multinational companies. The
French and German state telecoms companies are believed to have drafted an
agreement to merge their European and transatlantic business services, with
a view to a possible partnership with AT&amp;T.
The two companies already have a joint venture - Eunetcom - to serve the
'outsourcing' market among multinationals. A stronger Eunetcom, allied to
AT&amp;T, would give their international ambitions greater credibility.
Mr Foster said AT&amp;T's priority was to find a suitable European partner for
its Worldsource venture in the next few months. Worldsource, launched in May
with KDD of Japan and Singapore Telecom, is targeted at the market for
one-stop telecoms services among the world's leading 2,500 transnational
companies.
Some of the Commission's advisers are concerned at the threat posed by AT&amp;T,
and are keen to see European operators form closer ties.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Gore fights for Nafta as Congress vote nears: Perot attacks
trade pact in ill-tempered TV clash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US vice-president Al Gore said early today that the North American Free
Trade Agreement would create 'hundreds of thousands' of jobs in the US but
if it did not work the pact could be ended by giving six months' notice.
Mr Gore strongly defended the Nafta pact with Mexico and Canada during a TV
debate, marked by testy exchanges, with Mr Ross Perot, the Texan billionaire
who ran as an independent candidate in last year's presidential elections.
Mr Perot is one of the most strident opponents of the free trade pact, which
faces a crucial vote in the House of Representatives next Wednesday.
Answering Mr Perot's charges that jobs would be lost to Mexico, Mr Gore said
that 22 out of 23 studies had shown that Nafta would create more jobs in the
US. 'We know this works. If it doesn't work, we give six months notice and
we are out of it,' Mr Gore said.
President Bill Clinton's Democratic administration is pushing hard for
congressional endorsement of Nafta, which would create a free-trade zone of
more than 370m people. Mr Clinton negotiated environmental and labour
protection safeguards to add to the basic pact negotiated by his Republican
predecessor, Mr George Bush.
But even so, labour unions and environmentalists fear the pact will shift US
jobs abroad and cause ecological damage, especially in border regions.
The TV confrontation was marked by frequent interruptions and sharp attacks
by each participant on the other's personal integrity. Mr Gore said that
opponents of the Nafta were confusing 'the bad trade deals in the past with
this one, which is the first time we've been able to get one that's even
steven.'
Mr Perot retorted by arguing for a 'social tariff' to be imposed on Mexican
goods because of the much lower standard of living of Mexican workers.
'Livestock in this country and animals have a better life than good decent
Mexican workers,' the acerbic millionaire said.
The administration's efforts to build support for Nafta ahead of the House
vote appeared to be bearing fruit yesterday as half a dozen wavering
Democrats announced their support for the pact.
In a further move, the Ways and Means committee, which controls tax and
trade legislation, passed the bill implementing the trade agreement by a
surprisingly wide margin of 25-12.

FT  10 NOV 93 / US bond market rallies on producer price fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH EVIDENCE that faster economic growth is putting little upward pressure
on prices helped to restore confidence in the US bond market yesterday after
heavy selling of bonds and shares last week.
The US Labour Department reported yesterday that the producer price index
fell 0.2 per cent last month and rose only a marginal 0.2 per cent in the
year to October.
The figures were much better than generally expected. Most analysts were
looking for an increase in producer prices of about 0.2 per cent.
Bond prices rose sharply, partly reversing sharp recent declines. In late
New York trading, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up 21/32 at 101
7/16 , yielding 6.139 per cent.
Wall Street share prices ended the day down, reversing an earlier rally in
blue-chip issues. The Dow Jones industrial average finished at 3,640.07,
down 7.83.
Analysts, however, were keenly awaiting today's consumer price figures,
which are not expected to be as favourable as the wholesale price data.
The consensus forecast is that consumer prices will rise about 0.3 per cent,
although about a third of that increase will reflect a 4.3-cents-a-gallon
increase in petrol taxes, which took effect last month. The year-on-year
increase is expected to be less than 3 per cent.
The 'core' producer price index, which excludes the volatile food and energy
components, fell 0.5 per cent last month and was up only 0.1 per cent in the
year to October. However, that largely reflected a 3.9 per cent drop in
seasonally adjusted car prices, a one-off decline associated with the
introduction of new 1994 models. Excluding cars, core producer prices were
roughly flat last month.
Mr Stephen Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley, the New York
securities firm, said: 'In a productivity-led recovery, faster growth does
not have to lead to higher inflation.'
He noted that wholesale prices had fallen at an annual rate of 3 per cent in
the past six months, reversing an apparent rise in inflation early this
year.
The bond market had been wrong to panic last week at signs of more rapid US
growth, he said.
Other analysts were more reserved about inflation trends. Mr Jim O'Sullivan,
economist at JP Morgan, the New York bank, said: 'This was probably the last
of the great news on inflation.' He said several special factors had
artificially reduced wholesale prices in recent months.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Old boy network loses its hold on top boardroom jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORMER grammar school boys have taken over Britain's boardrooms from the
public school old boy network, according to research by the London School of
Economics.
Half the chairmen of the top 50 UK companies by turnover were educated at
state schools, while a further six went to 'top' grammar schools which were
once state-funded via direct grants and are now independent.
In 1979, only 14 chairmen had been state-educated. Only 15 of this year's
chairmen went to fee-paying public schools, compared with 29 in 1979.
Professor Leslie Hannah, of the LSE, who announced the figures in an
inaugural lecture to the Foundation for Manufacturing and Industry, claimed
the shift signalled the end of Britain's 'anti-industrial culture',
following many decades of domination of industry by the public school elite.
He said: 'The trend favourable to business is now firmly established, with
continuing success in business recruitment of first-class honour graduates
apparent in all recent decades. It seems that not only has there been a
revolution at the top in the boardroom, but that revolution is firmly rooted
in evolutionary cultural and educational change.'
The shift has also been sudden. The apparent changes in the last decade are
more substantial than those recorded in previous studies of the business
elite over all previous decades of this century taken together.
Mr Nigel Rudd, chairman of Williams Holdings (and educated at Bemrose
Grammar School, Derby), who chaired Prof Hannah's lecture, said this sudden
shift was attributable to the grammar schools created after the war.
'The reason is that people in the grammar schools of the 1940s and 1950s
were extremely well educated. There's certainly an anti-industry culture in
the British upper classes, or at least there has been.'
A similar, but less drastic, shift is also visible at the level of higher
education, according to the LSE figures. While Oxford and Cambridge
maintained their old positions, providing between a quarter and a third of
top businessmen in all the years surveyed, Prof Hannah pointed out that the
two universities had become meritocratic, with a broadening admissions base.

FT  10 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Anglian Water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's solid interim figures aside, the stock market has decided
Anglian will be among the losers from the forthcoming regulatory review. The
12 per cent slide in its shares over the last month is rougher treatment
than that meted out to its peers. The low rate of return on new investment
suggested by Ofwat last week is especially bad news for Anglian, which has a
large capital spending programme. Its low interest and dividend cover
relative to others in the sector leave little room for manoeuvre if faced
with tough price limits in the second half of the decade.
The snag with such a firm conclusion is that many elements of the review
have been left open by the regulator. Ofwat has said that it will squeeze
water companies' profits down to its target 5-6 per cent rate of return on
capital over a period of 10 years. But the speed of convergence will be
tailored for each company. Anglian might thus expect more leniency than
Welsh, which has an embarrassment of riches. Anglian's relatively weak
balance sheet certainly demands softer treatment, although the regulator has
given little away about how far it believes each company's financial ratios
might be stretched. Without more information on that score, picking winners
and losers remains a matter of gut feel. Anglian has charms of its own, such
as an unregulated engineering business which should cover its costs this
year. After the latest bout of derating, it can also boast the highest yield
in the sector.

FT  10 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Great Portland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The 7 per cent rise in the value of a batch of Great Portland Estates'
properties since March provides encouraging confirmation of the property
recovery. Having been one of the first companies to reflect the severity of
the downturn in 1990, Great Portland is now among the earliest to
demonstrate the speed of the upturn. Yet it would be alarming if it were
otherwise, given the surge in property shares over the past year. If
anything, the suspicion is that Great Portland's revaluation may well
understate the upturn in investment-grade property in central London. The
market certainly presumes other companies will soon report double-digit
rises in asset values.
However, Great Portland's reduced interim dividend and static rental income
are a useful reminder that many property balance sheets remain stretched and
the underlying market fragile. Investors have not worried much about such
niceties while chasing the yield available from property shares and in the
direct market itself. But the first signs are emerging that the yield
obsession may be beginning to fade. Leading property shares have been groggy
since the wobbles in the US bond market hinted that long gilt yields may be
close to their floor. When that appears more certain, attention will switch
to companies offering better prospects for rental growth. Ironically, it
could then be the weaker companies, such as Great Portland, which boast low
rental bases and empty space which find particular favour.

FT  10 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: US bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When the US bond market sneezed last Friday, many of the world's financial
markets looked in danger of catching cold. It is thus natural that
yesterday's US producer price figures should have a soothing impact further
afield than Wall Street. Price rises in energy and building materials were
expected, but in other respects output prices remain reassuringly weak.
Especially weak areas such as car prices feed directly into retail prices -
albeit in a more diluted form - so the chances of a nasty shock from today's
data must also have receded.
If a sustained retreat in US bonds now looks unlikely, so does another bout
of bullishness. The latest batch of figures cast little light on whether the
recent spurt of economic activity can be sustained into next year. Job
creation holds the key. A recovery led by productivity gains threatens
little by way of inflation, but holds the promise of few new jobs. Financial
markets will have to wait for the next set of employment figures for further
evidence in that regard.
In the meantime, US bonds look caught between a lingering fear of inflation
around the next corner and hard evidence that it was not lurking around the
last. The final few weeks of the year could be choppy, and not just in US
treasuries.

FT  10 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Warburg opens its book
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The truth can sometimes disappoint as SG Warburg found to its cost
yesterday. Its decision to break down its source of profits was laudable but
the revelation that over half the Pounds 197m increase in first-half group
operating income came from trading prompted a 2 per cent fall in its shares.
The argument is that earnings from trading are by nature unreliable. The
more Warburg becomes dependent on them, the lower the quality of its
earnings stream. Fear of a similar bad reaction should not deter others who
disclose even less. For example, outside investors cannot know for sure what
truth underlies Schroders' astonishing share price performance. Living under
illusion may be comfortable: it is also dangerous.
Those who wish to carp can find other faults with Warburg. It is reticent
about the extent to which the contribution from Japan has improved and about
the degree to which the Pounds 91m increase in fee income reflected one-off
contributions from Zeneca and BT3. Its cost base has risen sharply -
investors must have faith that spending can be pruned easily if revenue
turns down again. Mercury Asset Management appears closer to saturation of
the UK institutional market, though it is moving forward apace in private
client business. Group net return on capital is still only 20 per cent.
Such a low return is hardly satisfactory if this is indeed an earnings peak.
Yet to quibble on that score too may be to miss the point. US investment
banks boast higher returns but they are also more highly geared. Warburg has
surplus capital and could afford to gear up too. But if that produced a
still higher return based on increased proprietary trading, the market could
scarcely complain about the quality of earnings. Higher return and higher
risk go hand in hand. The task for Warburg is to convince it has got the
equation right.

FT  10 NOV 93 / UK trade figures delayed by setbacks to new EC system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK is facing three years of incomplete trade figures after difficulties
with the European Community's new system of measuring intra-community trade.
The Central Statistical Office said yesterday it was delaying publication of
complete visible-trade figures for the first eight months of this year
because lack of data had made it difficult to seasonally adjust the figures.
The delay marks a further setback for Intrastat, the EC's VAT-based system
for measuring trade, which was introduced at the beginning of the year to
coincide with the single market.
Teething troubles with the system were expected to last six months, until
the middle of this year. Statisticians now say that the latest difficulties
may mean it is three years before Britain has a reliable and complete series
of statistics on its trade with the rest of the world.
The CSO said it needed another two days to 'reassess seasonal and constant
price adjustments made under the new system now in use throughout the EC'.
The CSO wants to make the next set of figures - the last set before the
Budget - as accurate as possible to avoid large revisions after the
chancellor has made his statement.
The switch from a customs-based system of measuring intra-EC trade to one
based on VAT returns has been beset by problems since its introduction in
January.
Last month, Eurostat, the EC's statistical office, said publication of
up-to-date figures was being hampered by a slow rate of reply by companies,
in particularly small companies.
The UK has been quicker to produce monthly figures than other member states,
although its plan to produce monthly figures by the end of July proved too
optimistic.
The latest setback comes as government officials from France, Germany, the
UK and the Netherlands meet in The Hague today to discuss problems with
Intrastat.
The absence of trade figures comes at a peculiarly difficult time for the UK
with economists unclear about the robustness of the UK recovery.
Some economists are now wondering whether the unreliability of export and
import price figures have led to an underestimation of the level of output
in the UK.

Legal, decent, honest and truthful - it's tough going for advertisers to
stick to the Advertising Standards Authority's strictures. But now the four
commandments have tripped up a church; the ASA's latest report, unveiled
today, records that a complaint has been upheld against the Peniel
Pentecostal Church of Brentwood, Essex.
According to its ad in a local newspaper, guest speaker Archbishop Benson
Idahosa had 'raised eight people from the dead'. Following a complaint from
a member of the public, the ASA concluded that the advertisers were 'unable
to provide substantiation' for the claim.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK-Brazilian relations have warmed considerably in almost four years since
the sociable Paulo Tarso Flecha de Lima arrived as Brazil's ambassador to
London. Tarso - who was appointed to the London post by now disgraced
President Fernando Collor - is leaving at the weekend for the US where he
becomes ambassador to Washington.
The outgoing ambassador is given much of the credit for persuading the
British government, in the absence of a formal extradition agreement between
the two countries, to start unprecedented special extradition proceedings
against Paulo Cesar Farias, probably Brazil's most wanted man.
Farias - who fled Brazil and was living in London - was allegedly at the
centre of a big corruption ring whose discovery eventually brought down
Collor. However, since a warrant was issued for Farias's arrest last Monday,
Scotland Yard appears to have seen neither hide nor hair of Farias.

Life at the great Euro-show in Strasbourg will be markedly duller when MEP
Madron Seligman checks in his dispatch box next June. Seligman, who hails
from the engagingly-named Sussex village of Nuthurst, regularly added a
little colour to proceedings at the European Parliament by sporting a pink
carnation furnished gratis by the Alsacian city fathers.
Never a shrinking violet, Seligman, who entered the Guinness Book of Records
for the size of his majority in the 1979 Euro-elections, was on Monday
evening reminded of an early piece of self-publicity.
Speaking at Seligman's 75th birthday party, fellow Balliol College alumnus
Sir Edward Heath recalls playing the organ at his friend's wedding.
Confronted at the last minute with a sheet of music, Seligman in D, Heath
duly sight-read the unfamiliar opus. Nearing the end, the bride was nowhere
in view, so he returned to the top. The congregation finally heard Seligman
in D 11 times.
Well, those Euro-MPs do go on.

Still on the subject of political patronage, bets are starting to be laid on
who is going to get the chairmanship of the Housing Corporation, one of
Britain's biggest quangos.
Chairman Sir Christopher Benson is moving to the Schools Funding Agency in
April and yesterday the government announced that one possible successor,
deputy chairman Sir Norman Wakefield, was stepping down later this month.
Given that the Housing Corporation spends about Pounds 2.3bn - making it
Britain's biggest house builder - its budget could come under attack in the
next round of government cuts. Even so there are plenty of big names in the
trade with time on their hands.
Sir Eric Pountain steps down as chairman of Tarmac in a few months, and Sir
Clifford Chetwood, the ex-chairman of Wimpey, or Sir Nigel Broackes, the
founder of Trafalgar House, would fit the bill on past form. It's the sort
of post which in olden days would have counted towards a peerage.
Of the existing board members, solicitor David Kleeman's name has been
mentioned. But as is indicated by Sir Norman's imminent departure, the job
is likely to go to an outsider.

Have you noticed that despite Edouard Balladur's attempts to appear
even-handed in his reshuffle of France's public sector chairmen, socialist
business leaders seem to have landed the most difficult jobs?
Take the highly respected Jean Peyrelevade, adviser to Pierre Mauroy's
government in the early 1980s. He was not best pleased at being removed from
the top of Union des Assurances de Paris to make way for Jacques Friedmann,
a Gaullist and confidant of the French prime minister. His reluctance is
easy to explain. The in-tray he inherits from Jean-Yves Haberer at
loss-making Credit Lyonnais is brimming with problems, from real estate
losses in France to the debt-burdened MGM studios in Hollywood.
Haberer, himself a socialist appointee, is paying the price for his costly
expansion strategy. His move to Credit National - a much smaller institution
than Credit Lyonnais - is regarded as a demotion. Foreign shareholders in
the bank are also disgruntled because they were not properly consulted.
Even Haberer, however, may consider himself lucky. Christian Blanc, a friend
of socialist leader Michel Rocard, and Balladur's choice as the new head of
Air France, has this week started to wrestle with the airline's workers. His
task - to return the carrier to profitability without involuntary job cuts -
could be the public sector's most poisonous chalice.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Personal View: Europe cannot afford to miss Asia boat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR FUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For those of us living in Hong Kong, at the heart of the Asia-Pacific
region, these are heady times. Every statistic shows the region as the most
dynamic in the world, and likely to stay that way for the decade ahead.
The latest report of the Asian Development Bank predicts that the region's
developing economies will achieve average annual gross domestic product
growth of 7 per cent this year, compared with less than 2 per cent for
developed countries. China, whose GDP growth has averaged 9 per cent over
the past decade, is tipped to grow a further 13 per cent this year, and 10
per cent next year.
Pause a moment and think what that means for Asia's potential as a consumer
market: an economy of 1.2bn people - about a quarter of the world's
population - growing at about 10 per cent a year.
A new age of consumerism is emerging in Asia bringing breathtaking
opportunities for trade and investment. To illustrate the point:
By 2000, the economies of Asia will together be larger than those of Europe
or North America, and will be home to two-thirds of the world's population.
The number of affluent Asian households, with an annual income of Dollars
30,000 or more, will rise by 50 per cent, to 50m homes. Average incomes in
Hong Kong and Singapore equal the European average, and are already higher
than those in the Irish Republic, Greece and Portugal.
Asia's imports from Europe amounted to Dollars 129bn in 1991 - Dollars 21bn
more than US imports of European goods. The region is already the largest
buyer of Europe's food, chemicals, machinery, and textiles and clothing.
For its extraordinary potential to be realised, Asia needs the full
engagement of companies from all regions, especially the advanced industrial
economies. Indeed, Asia would not be where it is today, at the heart of
international trade, without immense investment from countries outside the
region.
But is Europe going to play the same role in Asia in the years ahead that it
has played in the past, or will it look inward to the single European market
as it struggles with recession? We see executives preoccupied with forging
links with the emerging economies of east and central Europe. Will these
priorities keep investment and management attention out of Asia - or at
least on the margins - at a time of unparalleled opportunity?
I raise this because I feel uneasy about forecasts suggesting that the
economies of east and central Europe will, within the decade, emerge from
their transition from command economies. Hong Kong's experience as mainland
China's principal joint venture partner in economic reform suggests that the
transition will take longer. China's transition, while comparatively smooth,
has not been free of economic and political difficulties. But by
capitalising on a range of advantages, it has been able to put perestroika
ahead of glasnost and motivated hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurial
overseas Chinese to invest in their home provinces. Hong Kong on its border
has acted as a funnel for potential investors, an efficient entrepot, and as
a base for Chinese companies to learn the ways of market economies.
If solutions to Europe's complex economic problems are to take years to
unfold, can European companies afford to bury themselves in long-term
prospects if it means neglecting opportunities to profit now from buoyant
growth in Asia?
Opportunities in Asia may no longer exist once Europe has put its house in
order. The US, for example, is hosting a meeting of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum in Seattle next week, which is intended
to forge closer economic links between the US and wider Pacific region. The
US has unveiled an export promotion programme intended to boost annual
exports from almost Dollars 700bn at present to Dollars 1,000bn by 2000,
with Asia as an important target for growth. Unless European companies move
quickly there is a real possibility of missing the boat in Asia.
In raising the alarm my motives are not entirely philanthropic, because we
in Asia will also pay a price if European companies are not fully engaged in
the region. As leaders in innovation and high-tech production in many
sectors, we need the stimulus Europe's companies would bring.
In short, we need Europe's companies in Asia. Hong Kong can provide a
principal gateway to a new economic alliance between east and west.
The author, who is chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, will
be speaking at a conference in London today on the future of Hong Kong

FT  10 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Talking about Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG'S has been among the most successful economies of the postwar era.
With its combination of free markets, open trading, rule of law and small
but socially responsible government, its prosperity is the clearest
advertisement for enlightened capitalism. Income per head will, by the time
of its transfer to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, exceed that of Britain, its
present guardian. British ministers who meet today to map out policy on Hong
Kong are discussing a valuable jewel.
It is pointless to dwell at this stage on the fact that Britain's approach
to Hong Kong has been inconsistent and that the attempts of Mr Chris Patten,
its governor, to broaden democracy came far too late. Mr Patten staked out a
principled position a year ago of modest expansion of the electoral
franchise. Britain must consider the best way to pursue this goal, which
appears to command majority support in Hong Kong. Mr Patten is right to
insist that Hong Kong's economic success will be undermined unless, in line
with China's 'one country, two systems' principle, it has robust and
independent institutions. If it does not, the legal system and press freedom
will quickly be poisoned. These are worth fighting for, however belatedly.
Action plan
The British negotiators who have sat through 15 rounds of talks with
intransigent Chinese officials may feel that there is little to be gained
from further discussion. But on the point of their departure to put this
view in London, they have had, in the words of a senior Hong Kong official,
their 'cloak tweaked'. The hint of an offer from Beijing to agree on the
easy parts of Mr Patten's proposals may be nothing more than an attempt to
prolong talks with no actual intention of concluding them. It may prevent a
clear-cut decision today, but it does not stop ministers from planning
future courses of action based on Beijing producing, or failing to produce,
further evidence of willingness to negotiate.
Britain has three options: to carry on talking, to cause the talks to be
broken off, or to try to pursue a course in between. Each carries risks. A
clear intention to keep talking whatever happened would reduce whatever
leverage Britain held over China virtually to nothing. The Chinese, knowing
that their principal objective of sovereignty has been achieved, could
happily filibuster away Mr Patten's proposals until they could not
practically be put into effect. China's objections may in any case be so
fundamental that no agreement is possible, particularly if its real
intention is to keep some of Hong Kong's more vocal democrats out of
post-1997 politics. However, while talks continue, it remains possible that
China will decide that they should be brought to a successful conclusion.
Middle course
China's latest suggestion opens the possibility of a middle course which has
short-term attractions: to put some of the Patten proposals into law with
China's acquiescence while still negotiating on the most difficult points.
It may win a little time, but carries the same risks of endless talks.
The dangers of the third option, a rupture of talks, are greater. China
insists that it will simply dismantle whatever electoral arrangements are
made without its agreement. It may take other reprisals. Hong Kong would go
through a damaging period of uncertainty. One cause of such uncertainty
would be the attitude of LegCo, which must legislate electoral arrangements.
It may well opt not to upset China.
Allowing LegCo to decide how far to go would, however, allow a measure of
choice within Hong Kong about its future. If China then tore up what it had
decided, people in Hong Kong would at least know where they stood and could
plan their futures accordingly.
The point at which London should pull out of talks has not yet been reached.
But the option must be retained - and it may have to be exercised soon. It
remains in China's strong interest to secure a smooth transfer of Hong Kong.
China is itself the biggest investor in the territory. It knows that its
actions in Hong Kong will be closely watched in Taiwan, upon which it will
next set its sights. China agreed to hold talks on Mr Patten's proposals. It
should show that its continued participation means something.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Wintry whiff of discontent: Labour relations in Europe are
not all gloomy, but there are some ominous trends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Striking Air France workers wearing masks block runways at Orly airport in
Paris. Beefeaters at the Tower of London go on strike in protest at
government plans to shake up the civil service. Workers in Italy and Germany
take to the streets against government economic policy. In Spain and Belgium
unions threaten to wreck social pacts designed to create jobs.
The events of the past fortnight might indicate that Europe is heading for a
winter of industrial protest. But a closer examination reveals a less
threatening and more confusing picture - one that nevertheless cannot be
ignored by Mr Jacques Delors and other European Community policymakers
seeking a blueprint for lower unemployment and greater competitiveness.
Much of the recent disruption has been limited to the public sector. Even
here, nationwide protests have involved at most one-day stoppages. In none
of the countries mentioned has there been any significant unrest in the
private sector.
While public sector action is likely to continue sporadically, token
protests must be viewed in the context of a continent deep in recession,
with most governments pruning public spending in their efforts to contain
large budget deficits. 'What requires explanation is why strikes are so rare
despite painful industrial restructuring and strong downward pressure on
European wage rates,' says Mr Peter Reid of the British Engineering
Employers Federation.
The presence of 18m unemployed in the EC is part of the answer. The Air
France dispute was about job security not pay. Similarly, protests in Italy
and the UK have been primarily about jobs. And I G Metall, the German
engineering workers' union, says this year's crucial pay round is about
employment first and pay second.
Another part of the answer is to be found in the fragmentation of Europe's
labour movements. The collapse of the Soviet Union has accelerated the
decline of communist-led union federations in Spain and France. In France,
the communist CGT no longer holds the majority of seats on the workers'
committee at its one-time stronghold at Renault. Other former communist
federations such as the CGIL in Italy have changed strategy and supported,
for instance, the end of the scala mobile which linked pay to inflation.
Meanwhile, the non-communist union federations - Christian democrat,
socialist or social democrat - are often linked to parties that see no
virtue in public ownership for its own sake and in many cases recognise the
need to introduce more flexibility into labour markets. In Spain, for
example, it is the ruling Socialist Workers party that is trying to remove
some of the formidable obstacles to sacking workers.
Finally, domestic and international competition has made industrial action
in the private sector increasingly counter-productive. 'Unions are no longer
targeting the means of production but are aiming at high-profile protests,
such as closing down motorways,' says Mr Denis MacShane a leading
international trade union official.
Despite these developments, the rumblings from Europe's weakened workers
underline three ominous trends:
The problems of union decline. Weak unions are no guarantee of industrial
harmony. France, the centre of the most eye-catching recent disruption, has
the lowest rate of unionisation in the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development. But Mr Michel Giraud, labour minister in the
centre-right government, says he would like to be able to consult with
stronger unions, because they would be more receptive to compromise.
Unionisation is denser in the French public sector than in the private
sector, but the loose hold that union leaders have over the rank and file,
even in the public sector, prevented an early conclusion of the dispute at
Air France.
In many other EC countries, union strength is declining in the workplace
even when they still have an important influence in national politics. In
France and Spain, unions have concentrated on political lobbying and have
gradually withdrawn from the messy business of representing real people with
real concerns over job security and pay. At local level, the vacuum left by
weak unions is being filled by ad hoc, and often aggressive,
'co-ordinations' - growing fast in Italy and France. The just-in-time
strike. Traditional strike action may be going out of fashion but a short,
well-directed industrial blow can cause more damage than in the past. The
closure of Orly airport by a few Air France workers illustrated how
vulnerable modern economies can be to small-scale direct action.
This is a French tradition - the word sabotage comes from the French word
for wooden clog, which workers used to throw into their machines - but it is
not peculiar to France. In Italy recently, employees of Enichem, the
state-owned chemicals company, carried out a violent occupation of their
Crotone plant. The result was that the government shelved a plan to close
the plant.
Just-in-time manufacturing techniques, which drastically reduce stocks, have
exacerbated manufacturers' vulnerability. Two years ago fewer than 200 Arab
workers at a Renault plant in Cleon, northern France, stopped making car
engines and within days the entire Renault operation had come to a halt.
New technology also allows small groups of workers to inflict
disproportionate damage. In the UK in 1989, strike action by a handful of
computer operators stopped all local tax collection in Birmingham.
New social contracts under threat. Most worrying, recent protests indicate
that some EC governments might have to push through jobs and competitiveness
packages without organised labour's support.
In both Spain and Belgium important sections of organised labour appear
determined to reject 'social pacts' which would create jobs, but also hold
down wages for three years. In Spain the government's proposal includes an
overhaul of costly dismissal procedures and in Belgium a reduction in
employers' social security payments.
Such hostility bodes ill for Mr Delors' job creation plans. Next month he
should publish a consultative paper arguing that over the long term the
proceeds of European economic growth should be shared more widely and not
appropriated by those in secure jobs.
European unions fear his proposals could mean tax cuts for employers but
wage cuts and longer hours for employees, with no guarantee of higher
employment. One EC official said: 'It's not much good sharing out growth if
there isn't any.'
At European level the unions are likely to be offered the trade-off of
legislation on European works councils - forums for informing and consulting
workers in multinational companies. This is a low-cost item for companies
but passionately desired by unions, which view it as a step towards
Europe-wide bargaining.
At national level, or company level, trade-offs are more problematic for the
unions. But the idea of reducing working time with a corresponding cut in
pay - thus leaving unit labour costs broadly unchanged - is attracting
growing political support.
For instance, Volkswagen, Germany's problem-hit volume carmaker, is
promoting the idea of work-sharing to avoid mass lay-offs. And a recent
opinion poll in Germany found that half the population would work a four-day
week for a reduced income.
The European Commission and the French government also back the idea; the
latter has just passed legislation to reduce companies' non-wage social
costs if they cut the working time of existing workers by 15 per cent and
hire at least 10 per cent more workers.
However, many leading industrial employers doubt that work-sharing is
compatible with holding down unit labour costs. Equally sceptical, Air
France workers reflected the reservations of many by rejecting a pay cut to
save jobs.
Organised labour in Europe does not have the veto power it once did. But the
events of the past few weeks suggest that it remains a factor to be reckoned
with, at least in those countries where its rights are enshrined in law. If
governments across Europe want union support for innovative plans to cut
unemployment, they still have some persuading to do.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Private phones in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE YEARS ago British Telecommunications was the odd man out of the
European telecommunications industry. State ownership of national telephone
operators was the norm and the UK government's privatisation of BT was
considered eccentric.
But over the coming five years private ownership is likely to become the
norm. Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Denmark have all announced plans
to sell shares in their telecommunications carriers. France is expected to
do the same, though France Telecom is not on the Balladur government's
initial privatisation list. Even Greece's socialist government, which
campaigned against the privatisation of OTE during the recent election, has
not totally turned its back on some form of private ownership.
The motives behind the trend to private ownership are mixed. A belief in the
greater efficiency of private enterprise and the benefits of competitive
markets - the prime motive behind the BT privatisation - is sometimes a
factor. The Netherlands, for example, is encouraging the country's railway,
cable television operators and electricity utilities to join forces to
compete with a privatised KPN.
But in most countries financial considerations are often decisive. By
selling stakes in the phone companies, cash-strapped governments can both
plug their fiscal deficits and attract private capital to finance expensive
network investments. The need to continue investing vast sums in eastern
Germany was the factor which finally persuaded Germany's opposition last
week to remove its veto on privatisation of Deutsche Telekom.
Forming alliances
Yet another motive for privatisation is a perceived need to respond to
global competition by forming alliances. Such alliances are easier to cement
if the partners are privatised and so can take stakes in one another. The
current collaboration talks between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom may
lead to share swaps.
In general, privatisation is likely to be beneficial. In the UK, it has
spurred BT to greater efficiency, delivering lower prices, better quality
and increased choice. But there are also dangers. First, most governments
are not opening up their markets at the same time as privatisation but
waiting until they are forced to by the European Commission. Since this will
not happen until at least 1998, monopolistic operators could lack the
incentive to change their cultures.
Second, many governments want to keep substantial shareholdings so they can
still influence key decisions. But too much political interference will
compromise the efficiency and dynamism which would flow if management were
free to manage in the light of commercial objectives. In so far as wider
political objectives, such as the provision of universal service, need to be
safeguarded it is preferable these are imposed transparently by an
independent regulator.
Disturbing desire
Third, several governments are showing a disturbing desire to use alliances
to block global competition. That seems a motive in the Franco-German talks
and the parallel discussions between the duo and American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, the US giant.
There should certainly be no ban on restructuring an industry which has been
artificially fragmented on national lines. The creation of trans-European
networks could abolish the 'frontier effect', under which the price of
international phone calls is three times that of national calls, and give
users the benefit of one-stop shopping. But it is important that competing
networks emerge from the restructuring process, not a pan-European or
transatlantic cartel.
These dangers can be overcome, but only if both governments and the
Commission have a clearer focus on liberalisation. At a national level, the
priority should be to open up markets at the same time as privatisation,
while establishing vigorous regulatory bodies to ensure that competitors
gain fair access to monopoly networks. At the European level, the need is to
discriminate between anti-competitive alliances and those which enhance
competition. The Commission will also need to be more ambitious about its
liberalisation plans. That way, privatisation will achieve its full
potential.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Bank governor's advice to industry
'nonsense'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr STEFAN SZYMANSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Eddie George's comments on the rule of business in fighting
inflation ('Bank governor tells businesses to hold margins', November 4)
left me wondering quite how he imagines the world to be organised outside
the confines of Threadneedle Street. 'If we can persuade you that we will
deliver sustained non-inflationary growth, I would hope we might see
businesses seeking to generate profits through higher volumes and less
through higher margins.'
What is this nonsense? What does the Bank of England produce, manufacture,
distribute or retail which will generate growth in gross domestic product?
The Bank does not produce anything which measurably adds to GDP. It is
companies that produce goods and services which are sold to satisfy the
needs of consumers.
And they are being told not to change their prices. In a market economy
competitive companies change prices all the time in order to maximise their
profits, maybe by introducing better quality goods, maybe exploiting
temporary opportunities which are then competed away by rival companies
entering the market.
Any first-year economics undergraduate knows that prices are the primary
signalling device of a market economy; interfere with this and you prevent
competition from working effectively. Perhaps Mr George is concerned by the
lack of competition in British industry, but then he should speak to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission rather than issue Canute-like exhortations
to industry.
Of course, perhaps Mr George did not mean his comments to be taken
seriously. If so, he has succeeded. Stefan Szymanski,

FT  10 NOV 93 / Bottom line on assets and liabilities: A look at the openly
contested battle for the top job in UK accountancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Brandon Gough, chairman of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, let it be
known early last year that he would be standing down in April 1994, he could
not have envisaged the upheaval that would ensue.
Since then, a hotly contested and distracting election battle has brewed in
the fight for the top seat in the UK's largest accountancy firm. Ballot
papers naming the four candidates are being sent out to all 700 UK partners
today.
'Everywhere you go in or out of the firm, whatever you're doing, the subject
comes up,' says one Coopers' partner. 'A chairman greeted me at an AGM like
an old friend the other day, and his first question was how the race was
going.'
A partner from a rival accountancy firm adds: 'Suddenly everybody there has
got involved in politics. There is so much canvassing that no one is doing
any work.'
At stake is a five-year term as the head of a fast-changing organisation
which last year generated Pounds 553m in fees, and employs 9,800 staff in 36
offices around the country. The chairman also has considerable influence in
Coopers' separate international network, which has more than Dollars 5.3bn
in billings, 4,500 partners and 67,000 staff in more than 730 offices
worldwide.
'The job of the leader is to get 700 highly talented, highly egocentric
partners to go broadly in the same direction most of the time,' says one
partner. Those vying for the post are:
Adrian Lamb. Partner in charge of the regions, and previously a regional
partner for the south and east regions of the firm with a number of
prestigious audit clients. His image is that of a quiet consensus-builder.
Alan McFetrich. An executive partner who was national managing partner at
Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells before it merged with Coopers in 1990. He has
worked outside the firm on secondment to government, but has relatively
little client contact now. He has a reputation as a tough, single-minded
administrator.
Peter Smith. Head of Coopers' City office in London, with many financial
service clients. Described by one partner as 'closest to Brandon's command
and control approach'. He has an image as a relative traditionalist in his
attitude to management. Richard Stone. Head of corporate finance, and
previously head of the firm's insolvency practices in London and Birmingham.
The only candidate not part of the firm's current senior management team. A
drawback is his reprimand by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales late last year for a breach of ethical guidelines in
accepting the appointment as administrator to Polly Peck International when
Coopers had undertaken other work for the company and its chairman, Mr Asil
Nadir, now a fugitive in northern Cyprus.
Coopers has done its best to keep the election debate private. Candidates
have been urged not to speak to journalists, and many other partners loyally
remain silent when the subject is raised.
By contrast, the election process has been unusually open, pitting the four
candidates against each other in open competition. Traditionally, the senior
partner or chairman in a British professional firm has tended to be just
that: the longest-serving partner, who assumes the job almost automatically
before retiring. Where that has given way to a search among rivals, a small
group has generally been established to 'take soundings' and select a
consensus candidate in secret.
For instance, at KPMG Peat Marwick, the UK's second-largest accountancy
firm, all partners formally voted on Mr Jim Butler's replacement as senior
partner in April. But there was only one candidate, and the ballot papers
were all numbered, which raised fear of reprisals against those who might
have contemplated voting 'no' to Mr Colin Sharman.
Brandon Gough himself did not endure a public process at Coopers &amp; Lybrand
before taking up his position in April 1983. He says he was one of four
candidates considered by a nomination committee, which then 'culled' the
others. Five years later, he says, 'there was not much stomach for a
competition', and his term was automatically renewed. It was extended for a
further year following management changes as a result of the merger with
Deloitte.
If Gough had prevailed, his successor would have been chosen behind the
scenes. But in an unusual display of power, the partners - who are also the
firm's shareholders - exerted their ownership rights.
The firm's 'partnership deed' decrees that the governing board - 13 partners
selected by the chairman - is responsible for determining the process to
select a new chairman. Early last year it got to work. It proposed,
according to Gough, that a nomination committee be chosen, to include all
members of his board who were not themselves standing as candidates. It said
this committee would identify one partner to 'emerge' as winner.
Coopers' partners were not convinced. Their objections culminated at their
annual meeting at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham last
December. The dispute led to revised proposals for a 35-member nomination
committee elected from among all the partners, which would draw up a
shortlist of four - all of whom would be seen and voted on by the entire
partnership.
The first few months of this year were spent electing from a list of about
80 candidates those who would sit on the committee. Each represents a
constituency of other partners.
In July, invitations were sent out for potential candidates for Gough's job
to submit their nominations and supporting manifestos. By the end of August,
16 had been received. Through two days of internal presentations, the
committee whittled the list down to four. 'It was one of the most ghastly
processes and procedures ever devised,' says one partner who was involved.
In the past two weeks, the four have been on the hustings together, giving
15-minute presentations and then responding to partners' questions: twice in
London, once in Birmingham and once in Manchester. Here they have laid out
their vision of the firm's future: including proposals for reorganising
internal management, simplifying the regional structure and boosting the
firm's international activities.
Given that the election is by single transferable vote, and administered by
the Electoral Reform Society, the process leading to a result on November 23
seems open and fair.
Some insiders say the choice is between administrators and leaders; or
between those who believe the firm should respond to clients' needs against
those who will allow it to be driven by the services it has traditionally
offered. Many partners say they will be swayed by performance on the
hustings, or by the management team each candidate has publicly proposed. As
Gough says, the job is that of 'a steersman, not the oarsman'.
Some tensions still run deep from the Deloitte merger three years ago, which
may persuade former partners of that firm to support McFetrich. Those linked
to London or the regions may opt for Smith and Lamb respectively as the
candidates they know best.
For Stone, the principal challenge is whether his image has been tarnished
by Polly Peck. A few weeks ago the nomination committee received a memo from
Sir Christopher Foster, a senior Coopers' partner and consultant to the
government, suggesting that eyebrows in Whitehall might be raised were Stone
appointed.
In response, Sir Tim Bell, Mrs Thatcher's public relations adviser, wrote in
support of Stone that the Polly Peck issue would be a 48-hour wonder, which
would not damage the firm's reputation with clients, including the
government.
Whatever the outcome, many partners will be glad when it ends. 'The process
has been dreadfully over-democratic,' says one. 'But it is useful after a
big merger to show 700 people that democracy can work. Whether it's going to
produce the right result is a different matter. I'd have thought we won't
necessarily get the best man.'

Sir, David Richardson in 'Farmer's Viewpoint' (November 9) refers to 'the

FT  10 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Smith's muddle a sign of Labour's
Euro mess
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALAN SUGAR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Last Friday John Smith signed the Labour party up to a European
manifesto which includes, among other things, a compulsory maximum 35-hour
week for industry. This created uproar in the media and throughout industry
in general, so much so that by Saturday morning he was saying that he did
not really mean it after all.
Are we to understand that Mr Smith doesn't read what he signs? Or, perhaps
he simply doesn't understand what he is signing. I would be very worried if
one of my Amstrad blokes did deals on that basis. I would be even more
worried if he knew what he was doing when he signed and then went back on
his word 24 hours later. Surely, if someone signs a manifesto they do so
committing themselves to all points within it. Does Mr Smith think he can
pick and choose? Maybe he read it in a hurry rushing from one strike-bound
Air France flight to another. I mean, let's be fair, ground staff at Charles
de Gaulle only wanted to work fewer hours, and be guaranteed jobs for life.
The other 'brain wave' in the manifesto is the promise that taxes on
business will be 'levelled up' across Europe. Imagine how disastrous this
would be for Britain. Has Mr Smith thought of the reasons why Japanese and
American industry flock to the UK? Apart from all of the advantages of
grants etc that we have to offer, it is because the UK has the lowest level
of corporation tax anywhere in the EC. If you make corporation tax standard
across Europe our Japanese colleagues will be building factories in the
sunny south of France; and if there is no tax break they might as well enjoy
the weather.
The level of corporation tax we have in the UK is accepted by business as
reasonable and, thus, the attention of industrialists is focused on
productivity and profit. It would be horrific to consider businessmen
turning their attention to running three sets of books as the Italians and
Spanish have done for years.
Will Mr Smith please tell us whether putting business taxes up is part of
Labour's European policy, or is this another thing that he did not realise
he had signed?

FT  10 NOV 93 / Home and away: Refugees and other displaced people pose a
growing problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every single day in 1992 nearly 10,000 people around the world were forced
to leave their countries, bringing the total number of refugees to 18.2m by
the beginning of this year. An even larger number - at least 24m - have been
forcibly displaced without technically becoming refugees, since they are
still inside their own country's borders. Add the two figures together and
you get the population of a fair-sized country.
The de facto ruler of that country is the UN high commissioner for refugees
(UNHCR), Mrs Sadako Ogata. The size of her 'government' has doubled since
1989. At last count she had a staff of 3,703 people - 810 at her Geneva
headquarters, 2,893 deployed in 106 countries across the world -
administering a budget of Dollars 1.4bn.
UNHCR's finances are almost as precarious as those of the people it is
trying to help. Less than 5 per cent of its annual expenditures are covered
by the UN regular budget. All the rest comes from voluntary contributions,
mainly from national governments. Every new emergency triggers an appeal for
funds.
This system has its merits: it decreases the risk of UNHCR developing into a
large permanent bureaucracy with little to do, as has happened with some of
the UN's more autonomous specialised agencies. But it does make it very
directly dependent on the goodwill of the main donor governments, whose
priorities do not necessarily coincide with the interests of the refugees.
Partly for this reason, there has been a marked shift in UNHCR's emphasis
over the last three years. In the past its main focus was on the right of
asylum. Now it has broadened its approach. Both in northern Iraq and in the
former Yugoslavia it found itself supporting displaced people within their
country of origin in an effort to prevent them from becoming refugees, at
least in the technical sense. Drawing on those experiences it has devoted
more and more resources to preventive work, seeking to identify root causes
of refugee problems, to be better prepared to cope with them and, where
possible, to propose solutions.
In short, from a lobbying-cum-placement-agency it has developed into
something close to a full-fledged government, supplying its clients with a
full range of services and dealing with other governments on their behalf.
The report Mrs Ogata published yesterday on 'the state of the world's
refugees'1, the first of its kind, is a kind of policy statement.
Clearly she is right to draw attention to the causes of the problem and to
advocate that as far as possible they be dealt with at source. Yet many
independent observers are uneasy about the extent to which UNHCR is now
taking on political tasks, and fear that it is failing in its traditional
role of upholding the right of asylum.
Prof Gil Loescher, for instance, a leading expert in the field who is
himself a member of UNHCR's advisory board, nonetheless argues in a new
book2 that 'UNHCR's dependence on voluntary contributions forces it to adopt
policies that reflect the interests and priorities of the major donor
countries'. He cites the example of aid levels per Afghan refugee during the
1980s, which were more than three times higher in pro-western Pakistan than
in anti-western Iran; and the 1991 Gulf crisis, when international aid to
Iraqi refugees in Iran was much lower than to those in Turkey and elsewhere.
Similarly, it is clear that the operation in the former Yugoslavia, where
nearly 4m people are now dependent on UNHCR relief, is in essence an
exercise in containment, designed to keep those people where they are.
Without it, at least a third of them would probably be spreading across
Europe, doubling the number of asylum seekers. Yet even as it is, west
European governments are spending an estimated Dollars 7bn a year on
processing asylum applications.
Western Europe is becoming a fortress, guarded by a moat of impoverished but
'safe' countries which asylum seekers have to pass through, and to which,
under currently prevailing doctrine, they can therefore be sent back
unexamined. UNHCR is critical of this policy, but its criticism is muted by
the need to retain support of donor governments.
Meanwhile, as Barbara Harrell-Bond, director of the Refugee Studies
programme at Oxford, points out in the latest issue of War Report3, the
relief programmes in host countries like Slovenia and Croatia are based on a
model 'which serves to marginalise refugees and displaced persons as
dependent minorities'. They inevitably become the object of growing
resentment among the indigenous population, rather than being encouraged to
support themselves and make a useful contribution to the host economies.
It is true that host governments prefer this model, hoping it will encourage
the refugees to go home as soon as possible. But they may well be mistaken
about this. According to Ms Harrell-Bond: 'Experience suggests that the
first people able to return home are those who have succeeded in securing
themselves and in saving up for rebuilding their lives on their return.'
They are going back in Cambodia, Afghanistan and Mozambique, where
cold-war-related conflicts have been or are being resolved. But where
conflicts reflect ethnic divisions, as is more and more often the case, the
chances of restoring ethnically mixed populations to their homes are much
slimmer. We have to face the fact that many refugees will never be able to
return. They must be allowed to find new homes, and helped to rebuild their
lives in a new homeland.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Queens Moat valuations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CLIVE LEWIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Lex column's comment on the Queens Moat House issue (November 2)
fairly draws attention to the case for a review of valuation procedures. I
agree. I said so publicly in July and then put in hand a special review
under the chairmanship of Michael Mallinson, formerly property director of
Prudential Portfolio Managers. This brings together both valuers and their
clients, to ensure that the service is properly tuned to market needs. The
question of companies publishing their valuation criteria is an important
element in this.
The review team welcomes evidence from any quarter, recognising the
importance of a dialogue with our customers on these important issues.
In putting this in hand, I have made no instant judgment on any individual
set of valuations. In the current controversy, the chairman of our assets
valuation standards committee has - as you report - asked for sight of the
relevant valuation certificates.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: A bad democratic idea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Lord BARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan (Economic Viewpoint, November 4) concludes: 'The main
case for an independently accountable (my italics) central bank is not that
it can magically bring price stability at a zero cost. It is the case for
having one body clearly responsible for monetary policy, which could not
then be blamed on some amorphous amalgam of politicians, officials and
central bankers as at present.'
He goes on to argue: 'Moreover, it is a good democratic idea that fewer
decisions should be taken by a central government, constantly looking over
its shoulder at its parliamentary majority, and that more should be taken by
other bodies accountable in other ways.' He destroys his own case by not
giving us any definition of 'accountable' other than that other bodies
should be 'accountable in other ways'.
The real case against him, however, is that no government would, or should,
give up responsibility for its central, and essential, control of the
economy. For monetary policy is about very much more than price stability.
It goes to the very heart of economic policy, and cannot be left to another
quango with an ill-defined form of 'accountability'. That would not be a
'good democratic idea'. It would be a very bad one.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Arts: Modern dance in dire straits - Alastair Macaulay finds
the Rambert still adrift while London Contemporary Dance Theatre is facing
possible closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is British contemporary dance flourishing? So it has been recently claimed.
The facts suggest a far more alarming situation. For the last
quarter-century, the nation's two largest modern-dance troupes have been
London Contemporary Dance Theatre (16 dancers at present) and the Rambert
Dance Company (17 dancers). Today, both are in conditions of intensive care.
Rumours were flying this last weekend that London Contemporary Dance Theatre
was about to announce its closure. The company, which reached a peak of
glory during the 1970s under the artistic direction of choreographer Robert
Cohan, has always exemplified rare standards of sheer dance technique. But
it has been seeking a satisfactory new artistic director since the
mid-1980s. The crisis is the more acute since it affects the London
Contemporary Dance School, which feeds the company with dancers and is among
the world's leading centres of modern-dance training.
The Rambert, which became a basically modern-dance troupe in 1966, has
changed identity several times. Until the 1980s it presented a more
histrionic or theatrical kind of dance expressionism, led by such
choreographers as Glen Tetley and the gradually emerging Christopher Bruce.
During the 1980s, however, it became a more pure-dance troupe, with higher
standards of dance technique and musicality. In December 1992, the board of
directors of the Rambert sacked its artistic director, Richard Alston. His
work for the company as both choreographer (since 1980) and coordinator of a
revised repertory and important artistic collaborations (since 1986) had won
several awards; and the board's decision caused huge shock-waves, which have
still not subsided.
There seems little doubt that the reasons behind the board's act were
primarily financial. The company had fared poorly at the box-office (both on
tour and in London).
As from next year, however, a new Rambert is expected to emerge. The new
artistic director is to be Christopher Bruce - yes, Bruce of Rambert's
pre-Alston days.
Bruce has signed to begin work in April 1994. He has made certain
conditions: that the company be increased from 17 to 25 dancers, that its
orchestra be increased in size, and that a full-time musical director be
appointed. His plans are to give the company an international repertory - a
sort of 20th-century Masterpiece Dance Theatre - with works not only by
himself but also by such foreign choreographers as Jiri Kylian, Ohad
Naharin, and the late Martha Graham.
These plans are startlingly ambitious and yet thoroughly reactionary. In
modern-dance terms, 25 dancers is an astonishingly large company. (Compare
it with the leading American modern-dance companies. Merce Cunningham, Paul
Taylor, Twyla Tharp, Mark Morris all have less than 18.) As for the choice
of choreographers, Bruce, Kylian, and Naharin, though popular, are scarcely
on the cutting edge of dance; and Graham is dead. And does the new Rambert,
as is rumoured, plan to dance ballets as well as modern-dance works? It is
unlikely that a company based in the work of Bruce, Kylian et al. could do
them justice. And will such a company be popular? The new Rambert, we are
told, will give more than 100 performances a year. When touring round
Britain, it will give six or seven performances per week. (This at a time
when most ballet companies have grown scared, for box-office reasons, of
giving much time to anything other than such full-length ballets as Swan
Lake.)
When people talk of the recent success of British contemporary dance, they
are chiefly referring to a number of our smaller dance companies - DV8,
Adventures in Motion Pictures, Second Stride, the Cholmondeleys, and the
groups of Siobhan Davies, Michael Clark and Shobana Jeyasingh. These troupes
are almost all shaped around one choreographer. LCDT and the Rambert are,
however, repertory companies; and this is part of their long-term problem.
You can build a ballet repertory company because there are plenty of
choreographers who can employ the same ballet vocabulary. But there are many
different modern-dance techniques. Both LCDT and the Rambert have had to
keep adjusting their basic styles of dance training.
Yet the Arts Council has agreed to the formation of the revised Rambert, and
has given notice to London Contemporary Dance Theatre that it cannot
currently support two companies on such a scale; or, rather, that London
Contemporary Dance Theatre must reduce its size and reconceive itself, or
close. The company gives a London season later this month - probably its
last London season in its present form. The latest news is that LCDT will
continue, but on an altogether smaller scale.
The ironies of this situation are many. It is dismaying to find how many of
these decisions have been made, not by artists, but by boards and
administrators: chiefly non-dance people, shaping the dance world to their
will. London Contemporary Dance School trains dancers to a very high level
of technical accomplishment: a level that is actually far more virtuoso than
suits many of the choreographers on the international new-dance scene.
Alston, the first important choreographer to emerge from the School and
widely considered to be the finest dance-maker in Britain today, is one of
the few choreographers who demands a high level of technique; and yet he
remains a freelance choreographer without a company. (He has returned to
LCDT, for which he made his earliest works in the 1970s, to create The
Perilous Night for the forthcoming season.)
Similar problems are to be found in many other countries. Dance today is
simply in a dire state: a subject to which I will return. There will be more
to say about both the Rambert and LCDT in the near future. At present, the
situation must be watched with the greatest concern.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Arts: A season of excellence from the BBC - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What a tremendous season the BBC is having. Tonight BBC1 completes its
unmissable series, Thatcher: The Downing Street Years. BBC2 screens the
second episode of The Buddha Of Suburbia a four-part serial which, at least
in its opening episode, was so much more subtle and telling than My
Beautiful Laundrette that it is difficult to believe it was written by the
same person. On Tuesdays BBC1 brings us the most powerful popular drama
series for many years, Between The Lines, and last week's episode was one of
the best yet. On the same night the same channel screened Michael Frayn's
charming programme about Prague, 'Magic Lantern', in the Omnibus slot. The
first in a new season of 'Performance' on Saturday was a production of
Suddenly Last Summer which made you see the 1959 Hollywood version with Liz
Taylor for the travesty it really was; and on Sundays BBC2 is offering a
compelling series about the teaching of drama, Theatre School, followed
later by Stendhal's Scarlet And Black on BBC1.
In other words the BBC, an organisation still accused of being inefficient,
over-expensive and ripe for privatisation, is currently giving us an
outstanding series about recent politics; a contemporary drama serial about
multiculturalism and social mores that is better than its creator's previous
work which we were assured was the most glorious flower of the British film
industry; a police series which meshes the ethical questioning of Law And
Order with the entertainment of Hill Street Blues; a highly personal travel
documentary combining information and entertainment in just the the way we
have always been told British broadcasting should; a splendid version of a
Tennessee Williams play with a magnificent performance from Natasha
Richardson; an exemplary modern documentary series; and exactly the sort of
classic literary adaptation that even the BBC's fiercest critics seem to
agree it does better than anyone else.
What is there in all the rest of television put together - ITV and Channel
4, satellite and cable - which can hold up its head in such company? So far
as I can see, back in Britain just two weeks and still sampling the autumn
season's new series though with little expectation now of any great
surprises, just one ITV series from Granada: Cracker, in which Robbie
Coltrane does everything that a good actor should when he is given a peach
of a part. He gobbles it with glee, allowing the juice to run everywhere.
Superb though his performance is, however, even this series has some small
queries hanging over it: can writer Jimmy McGovern prevent Coltrane's
character, an offbeat police psychologist named Fitz, tumbling into self
parody; and, given that another series has already been commissioned, can he
invent enough varied stories to justify Fitz always having a central role?
Trying to talk someone out of a crisis is all very well, but every week?
In Thatcher we have become used to the former prime minister talking herself
out of innumerable crises as her account of her years in office progresses.
The absolute consistency with which 'we' (as in 'We have become a
grandmother', included tonight) claim all the credit for the successes while
blaming others for the failures, has been breathtaking. Her account in
today's programme of the parting of the ways between her and two of her
chief ministers, Nigel Lawson and Geoffrey Howe, is staggering in its
egocentricity. This incident provides a perfect example of the way that the
television version scores so heavily over the book (Harper Collins, Pounds
25). At 914 pages the book is about twice as long as it ought to be, yet it
is fairly easy reading. However, if you watch the television series first
and then read the book you cannot but be struck by the two-dimensional
nature of the printed version which, of course, supplies only the Thatcher
line on events.
In Denys Blakeway's television version the Thatcher words are often
virtually identical to those in the book, but there are two crucial
differences. First, the screen allows you to see how the lady's eyes gleam
or narrow as she delivers them, and that can double the impact or even
change the meaning. Secondly her words are often modified by an immediate
reaction from somebody else. Tonight, for example, she suggests that when
Lawson claimed to be resigning because of her preference for advice from
Alan Walters, his real reason was the realisation that he had been
responsible for inflation. In the book Thatcher's assertion stands
unchallenged, but on television Lawson promptly pops up to denounce this as
ludicrous.
This series confirms something I have been suspecting for some years: that,
far from being the vulgar magic lantern which book academics would have us
believe, television can actually be a better medium for history than print,
once you are dealing with the modern world in a period when there are news
archives to be raided (as Blakeway does, naturally) and many of the key
witnesses are still alive to be interviewed (as in this instance, where the
cast list is astonishing: everyone from Reagan and Gorbachev to Ingham and
Powell). Fifty years from now, who will turn first to the book if, instead,
they can turn to this engrossing, far more revealing, and better rounded
television series?
You could hardly find a bigger contrast than that provided by Between The
Lines, a drama series which has faint echoes of so many previous series from
Z Cars to The Sweeney, though we may eventually conclude that this is the
best of the lot. Watching last week's episode, written by Rob Heyland and
directed by Roy Battersby, was a particularly fascinating experience for any
fan of film noir who had watched Huston's 1950 movie The Asphalt Jungle on
BBC2 on Sunday night. The received wisdom is that the old hard-boiled black
and white American thrillers set a benchmark for crime drama which has
rarely been matched subsequently, either in cinema or on television. Yet
Between The Lines told a story of bungling and departmental rivalry (between
MI5 and Special Branch) which was far more subtle and complex than any of
the film noir classics.
It did so within a framework in which all the detail was hugely satisfying,
from the wicked comedy of the scene where the Home Office bigwig's
assumption of a no-smoking policy was promptly ignored by all and sundry, to
the nice ambiguity of the relationship between our hero, Tony Clark of the
police's internal security division (Neil Pearson), and Angela Berridge from
the Home Office (Francesca Annis). There has been a marked reduction in the
activity which earned this series its alternative title of Between The
Sheets, but it looked as though Clark, despite his deep distrust of the
Ministry, was about to show his Achilles heel again, and probably a good
deal more of his anatomy. As sheer entertainment this production rated very
high, but it also had a serious question to ask about who should guard the
guardians. If our security bodies will, indeed, lie in the competition to
predominate, how on earth can the private citizen, or even the ordinary
policeman, know whom to trust? There were hints of Kafka's world here, all
the more effective for being contained within a classic bit of television
crime drama.
Who should take the credit for this outstanding showing from the BBC? The
new channel controllers, Alan Yentob and Michael Jackson? Most of this
season's series must have been commissioned before they came to power. John
Birt then? Perhaps so; he has been wielding influence at a high level long
enough for his appointments and ideas to have started having their effect on
screen. But caution is advisable. Swings and roundabouts have always been
the most important constituent in the contest within British television. It
may be that ITV really is abandoning the high ground of programme quality in
its pursuit of audience quantity, and that we are witnessing the first
evidence of an important long-term change. On the other hand, the seesaw has
swung wildly in the past and could easily do so again. Still, there is no
mistaking the BBC's superiority at this moment.

If your father had been a Nazi war criminal would you agree to go to Israel
to discuss the subject with the children of holocaust survivors? Some did
and Timewatch was there to record the confrontation (BBC2, 8.00).
ITV also offers a heavyweight subject in its two-hour drama documentary
Fighting For Gemma (8.00). Gemma D'Arcy, whose father worked at the nuclear
plant in Sellafield, developed leukaemia, and solicitor Martyn Day became
convinced there was a causal link between the plant and a high incidence of
blood cancer.
Provided the other parts of The Buddha Of Suburbia are as funny and telling
as the opening episode, BBC2 will have brought us something far better than
'My Beautiful Laundrette' , also written by Hanif Kureishi. This tells you
more about the experience of being regarded as an alien, though born in
Bromley, than half a dozen 'race' series (9.25).
Political history will surely never be the same again after Thatcher: The
Downing Street Years, which ends this evening with Lady T. giving her
version of her departure from office (BBC1, 9.30).

FT  10 NOV 93 / Arts: Karetnikov's 'Till Eulenspiegel' - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few modern operas can claim a more tortuous genesis than Nikolai
Karetnikov's Till Eulenspiegel, which has just received its stage premiere
at Bielefeld in north Germany. Karetnikov, born in Moscow in 1930, comes
from the post-Shostakovich generation of Soviet composers who experimented
with new techniques and fell foul of the Communist authorities.
Till Eulenspiegel was hardly calculated to win official approval. A two-act
Singspiel completed in 1985, it is a parable of Soviet repression and the
indomitable human spirit. The work first reached the West two years ago, in
a recording made piecemeal with help from off-duty members of the Soviet
Cinema Orchestra and scraps of tape from the cutting-room. Today, the only
obstacles to its performance in Moscow are financial. And so - with an irony
that suits Karetnikov's style - Till Eulenspiegel has been premiered far
from the people to whom it would mean most.
Initial reactions to the recording were ecstatic. Gramophone went so far as
to hail it as 'one of the most powerful operas of recent times'. John Dew's
Bielefeld production hardly supports that verdict. Till Eulenspiegel comes
across as a good allegorical yarn - easy-to-follow, singable and
entertaining, but not strikingly original.
Karetnikov and his co-librettist, the film director Pavel Lungin (Taxi
Blues), used a novel by the 19th century Belgian writer Charles de Coster as
their source. Till is more than the endearing prankster depicted in the
Strauss tone poem - he becomes an uncompromising fighter for justice and
freedom.
The setting is Flanders under the Hapsburg empire and the Spanish
inquisition. Till is exiled for making fun of a monk, his father is burned
as a heretic, his mother is murdered and he himself is nearly executed. From
first to last, death and freedom form two sides of the same coin - no more
so than in the final scene, when Till dies of poison and is mysteriously
resurrected.
Woven into the fabric of the story are bizarre clips of the Spanish court
and a role-call of stereotypes - a fishmonger who informs on his fellow
citizens, a fortune-teller, a quartet of prostitutes and Till's alter ego, a
vagabond named Lamme. All are wrapped into a polystilistic theatrical idiom
embracing mystery-play, pantomime, ballet, burlesque and satirical drama -
while running the musical gamut from renaissance song and baroque recitative
to Orthodox chant, Sprechgesang and 12-note variations. Karetnikov emerges
as a musical chameleon, a virtuoso impersonator, but lacking Schnittke's
ability to mould his influences into something more personal.
Dew's production, designed by Thomas Gruber and Jose Manuel Vazquez, matches
the parodistic quality of the score, without losing sight of the pain and
violence beneath the surface. The stage is a 20th century prison of wire
mesh, divided into three playing areas to keep pace with the quick changes
of setting. No scene outstays its welcome, though some would have benefited
from a more identifiable sense of place.
The biggest drawback is the positioning of the orchestra behind the stage,
from where - despite amplification - Karetnikov's subtle accompagnato makes
a sketchy impression. Give or take some predictable lapses of coordination
with his cast, Geoffrey Moull conjures an idiomatic range of sound. In the
baritone title role, William Oberholtzer is more worthy than charismatic.
The Bielefeld ensemble provides versatile support, with excellent
contributions from Susan Maclean as Till's fiancee Nele and Ulrich Neuweiler
as Lamme.

FT  10 NOV 93 / People: Willett returns to retail life at Littlewoods
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bob Willett has been appointed managing director of Littlewoods stores, the
chain store division of the private retail and football pools group.
Willett, 47, resigned as chief executive of Gateway, the trading subsidiary
of Isosceles in October last year when the heavily indebted food retail
company was in the throes of a financial restructuring. He had come in for
criticism as Gateway had missed trading budgets. He had had a three year
contract at Pounds 195,000 a year.
He first joined Gateway in 1987 from Owen Owen, the department store group,
where he was operations director. He started as non-foods director and
became marketing director a year later.
When David Smith launched a leveraged bid for Gateway's parent Dee
Corporation in spring 1989, Willett and three other Gateway directors
supported the bid and were suspended by then chairman Alec Monk. After
Smith's Pounds 2.1bn bid succeeded, Willett returned as chief executive of
Gateway.
He survived the departure of Smith in autumn 1991, when the group was
already having difficulty meeting its onerous debt commitments, only to fall
a year ago.
After leaving Gateway, Willett attempted to buy a retail business with
venture capital backing - rumoured to be the Mark One chain of budget
fashion shops - but he has now returned to big store life.
Willett takes over from Bryan Mayoh, who has filled the MD's position at
Littlewoods chain stores for the past few months - a position which had
previously been vacant since the departure of Bill Huntley who moved to head
Littlewoods' home shopping division three years ago.
Mayoh has been promoted to managing director of Index, the catalogue
shopping division, to succeed James Higginbotham, who is recovering from
major heart surgery.
Mayoh began his career at Littlewoods in the mid-1980s in the computer
section of the group management services department. He became director of
management services, and then moved to the home shopping division as
director of credit and collections.
Higginbotham, managing director of Index since October 1988 during which
time the chain grew from 75 stores to its present 126, is expected to return
to work next spring, to head a group project designed to improve
Littlewoods' operating efficiency and profits.
Littlewoods also recently created two new directors' posts. Janet Rubin, who
has held senior human resources positions in Burton group, Kingfisher's B&amp;Q,

FT  10 NOV 93 / People: Rowland changes his power base
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Chris Rowland, former electricity analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, has
returned to the City after failing to persuade electricity generators
National Power and PowerGen to sell him plants they no longer wanted.
He has been recruited by Merrill Lynch to cover European electric utilities
including the two UK generators. It is just eight months since he quit his
BZW job to set up Cabah Energy with the aim of operating the generators'
discarded units. But Rowland refuses to blame the generators for his lack of
success. 'I failed to make offers which were attractive enough to the
generators,' he says.
However, his return to the City will reinforce the view that the generators
will fight hard against calls that they sell off plant. National Power has
publicly expressed strong reservations about selling off plant it wants to
close, although it has indicated it is willing to talk about less marginal
stations providing the price is right.
Rowland, 38, one of BZW's longest serving analysts before he quit, said
yesterday that even if National Power's and PowerGen's plant became
available he would no longer be interested. 'The competition would be too
great.'

FT  10 NOV 93 / People: Knox coaxed over the fence
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the first week of October, Patricia Knox, assistant city editor of the
Evening Standard, published the results of a wide-ranging survey on what the
financial community felt about the stock exchange's future which began 'Down
but not out - that is the current condition of London's much-criticised
Stock Exchange'.
Shortly thereafter the headhunters were on the phone, and yesterday Knox was
appointed chief press officer of the stock exchange, a post that has been
vacant since Gill Ackers joined financial pr company Brunswick in early
August.
Knox, a 46-year-old Canadian with a degree in English and French from the
University of Minnesota, has spent the past 17 years at the Standard. 'At
least I know why the press has sometimes got cross or has misunderstood the
exchange,' she says of her move to the other side of the fence.
The stock exchange has had a turbulent year, coming in for fierce criticism
over the Taurus fiasco and losing its chief executive as a consequence. But
it has finally found a replacement for the latter, a City figure who will be
identified tomorrow . So does Knox know who her future boss will be? 'No,
that would be tempting the Chinese Walls a bit too much, wouldn't it?'

FT  10 NOV 93 / Jobs: To boldly go beyond perceived limitations - Lucy
Kellaway on a communications course which has made strong men weep but
merely left her blinking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSIDE each of us is a good communicator. No matter know inept, gauche,
bumbling or autocratic we are, we could become user-friendly managers with a
little guidance and a bit of effort.
It is an attractive view, one that is being peddled by a new breed of
consultants specialising in communications courses. Communication, they say,
matters more than ever. In the old days, everyone was told what to do and
expected to get on with it. But now that corporate hierarchies have been
abandoned and workers empowered, it is essential that people get along with
each other.
But do these courses work? Can we really emerge from them more personable
and persuasive than when we went in?
To find out, I joined an intensive session designed for a female executive
at BZW by Harley Young Associates, which specialises in corporate cultural
development. HYA's communications course, run by ex-actor Philip Hynd, has
attracted some startling testimonials. One manager, on returning to his
office after the seminar, surprised the receptionist by remarking on the
fine bunch of flowers on her desk. It was not just that he had learnt the
art of small talk: he had never noticed the flowers before. Peter Horne of
Apricot, for which HYA carried out a whole programme of cultural change, not
only softened his manner but even shaved off his moustache.
Grown men, unused to confronting their emotions, had been known to break
down and weep during the HYA course. One manager felt that he had been
peeled apart like an onion into different layers, and requested an extra
day's training in order to be put back together again. The course literature
promised to make us understand the effect we have on others, go beyond our
perceived limitations, and to question our habitual reactions. It pledged to
'unlock and direct human energy', translating it into achievement.
The first step was a questionnaire, sent out in advance, in which we had to
rate our skills at such things as 'being authentic', 'being appropriate' and
'building rapport', and then list the personal and professional cycles of
behaviour patterns that we most wanted to change.
The training day, held at BZW's London office, started with each of us
reading out the questionnaires.
'It is not clear what 'being authentic' means', I began. This was wrong.
According to Hynd, our 'facilitator', good communicators do not say things
that are subjective as though they were objective truths. They always say 'I
think' or 'I feel' unless stating a fact, and certainly never say 'you' or
'one', when they could say 'I' or 'me'.
The BZW woman groaned at the video camera, which was stealthily recording as
we spoke. Apparently, her reaction was telling. The facilitator said it was
typical of a deep insecurity inside us all. Even the most senior managers
have a sense that they are not good enough, and to avoid being found out
take on defensive patterns of behaviour. If these 'work' they are repeated
so often they become subconscious.
To break the mould, we were asked to dig into our earliest memories and
recall times when we were reprimanded unfairly, and then re-experience how
we felt about it. From these tales of classroom misdemeanors, significant
patterns started to emerge. We were told that the way people react to early
traumas divides them into two camps: some deal with their own feelings of
inadequacy by seeking approval, while others control their own emotions and
the people around them.
It turned out that my formative experiences in the playground and at my
mother's knee had made me a controlling person. The fact that fellow
controllers are Robert Maxwell and Lady Thatcher did not make me feel any
better about it. Control people have all the answers, never show their
feelings, are dogmatic and arrogant, will not argue unless they can win, and
withdraw rather than lose face. Approval seekers - a category shared by my
coursemate as well as John Major and Richard Branson - turned out to be not
much better. The tell-tale signs are constant smiling, and an earnest,
sycophantic manner. Approval seekers are pushovers, and may seem to be
behaving in a kindly way but always have a hidden agenda.
The point of this exercise was to make us aware of the tricks we play, and
thus give us the choice of whether to go on playing them. The problem is
that if you do not (as I did not) accept the diagnosis, it is harder to
change your ways. The facilitator seemed quite unmoved by my dissent; he
said failure to recognise controlling tendencies was a classic
characteristic of control people.
He then asked us to think of an event in the next week in which we would
have behaved in our bad old ways, and then choose a different course of
action that might run against the grain, but be more likely to get results.
Then we had to choose each other as mentor to talk through the event both
before and after.
More than a week has gone by. My BZW partner has not called on my help to
get her through her meeting with a bully at which she planned to be more
assertive. I have not called on her either. It is all very well letting your
hair down during a course, but telephoning someone you don't know days later
for their advice on how to behave is asking too much.
The next stage was about energy. We all (control freaks and sycophants both)
spend too much time suppressing our real feelings, and the act of
suppressing is as strong and exhausting as the feeling itself.
So how do you channel unwanted feelings into wanted ones? The first step is
easy: you breathe. We sat there taking deep breaths and trying to become
more aware of how we were feeling then (which in my case was faintly
irritated). A few large lungfulls of air, and I was feeling much the same.
The other techniques were not practical to sample then and there, but we
were given the following useful tips.
Spend more time with people who have lots of energy.
Take a walk around the office.
Tidy up.
Tie up loose ends in both tasks and relationships.
Break a habit, do something differently.
Keep agreements; tell the truth.
When unexpressed feelings are trapped within us, the message is likely to
reveal itself subconsciously through our bodies. We are likely to reveal our
thoughts by the way we wiggle our feet even if the words coming out of our
mouths are perfectly neutral.
To get acquainted with our own body language, each of us had to repeat
phrases like 'You are really covert in your communication' and 'Would you
book me a ticket by credit card?' and then watch the result on video.
Our facilitator thought that my eye contact was a bit too much: I should
blink more often. He said that my way of pulling my chin back and holding my
head on one side seemed to be saying 'You are stupid and you better sort it
out'.
These home truths would have been easier to dismiss were it not for the
sensible nature of the advice he was giving to my course mate. Her habit of
going into a fake cockney voice was much better discarded, as was her
frequent raising of eyebrows.
We went over the same phrases again for the video's benefit, this time
without our habitual gestures.
I could see that my course mate looked better eyebrows down. She assured me
that my self-conscious blinks and thrusting chin were also an improvement.
The problem was how to stay that way: once the training day was over it was
all too easy to slip back.
If you go along to a communications course out of curiosity (as I did) or
because your employer wishes it, you are likely to emerge unscathed. For the
first day or two afterwards I blinked when I remembered to. I now do not
even do that.
Rereading this article, I notice it is riddled with illicit use of the third
person, but do not feel inclined to go back and alter it. Perhaps that is
just what one would expect from a closet control person.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Business and the Environment: Rapeseed fuels the energy
debate - A diesel mixture is being used to power vehicles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNA KOCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More than 300 diesel vehicles are being driven on French roads powered by a
'green' fuel which Jacques Delors, president of the EC Commission, believes
will become accepted throughout the EC.
Produced from rapeseed oil, the fuel - known as Diester, a trade name
derived from ester (an organic compound) - reduces pollution and provides an
income for Europe's agricultural community. Many Elf service stations,
particularly in the Paris region, provide a mixture of regular diesel fuel
and up to 5 per cent of Diester.
It is this mixture of fuels which Delors says will become the EC standard.
Diester is intended to run any vehicle with regular diesel engines - its
main use is with municipal vehicles. The fuel does not affect their
performance, longevity or maintenance. Tests show that this is true for
engines running on a mixture of fuel containing up to 30 per cent Diester.
At present, French authorities do not foresee a higher percentage of Diester
in the fuel and French automotive manufacturers do not plan to develop
special engines, says Luc Schorter, general manager of Ouroumoff, the
Paris-based consulting engineers.
Ouroumoff built France's first Diester factory at Compiegne, north of Paris.
Its client for the FFr50m (Pounds 5.8m) pilot plant was Robbe, a company
specialising in non-food uses of vegetable oils and owned by Sofiproteol, a
French financial institution.
While Diester benefits the environment by helping to alleviate the
greenhouse effect and levels of acid rain caused by diesel exhaust fumes,
Schorter also stresses the agricultural factors.
'It is a very intelligent solution for the farmers,' he says. Land lying
fallow because of EC 'set-aside' rules can be cultivated for non-food
purposes.
In the medium term, rapeseed destined for Diester production could produce
an annual 500,000 tonnes of Diester, or 4 per cent of French diesel fuel
consumption. Schorter believes this level of production will be reached in
five years and continue to increase.
Today, however, Diester would not be economically viable without government
help. A subsidy of FFr1,000 per hectare is available to farmers growing
rapeseed for conversion to Diester. Also, Diester is not subject to the same
tax imposed on other diesel fuels and petrol. Even so, the price will not
fall to that of regular diesel for at least two years because of the
limitations of production technology.
In Diester production, a chemical reaction takes place in which rapeseed oil
is combined with methanol in the presence of an alkaline catalyst. At the
Compiegne factory, which Delors inaugurated earlier this year, a process
known as Esterfip, developed by the French Petroleum Institute (IFP), is
employed.
According to Schorter, it is not difficult to make Diester. Financed in part
by the EC, the plant built by Ouroumoff has a capacity of 20,000 tonnes a
year.
Schorter says if Diester is to be priced the same as ordinary diesel fuel,
plants must be able to produce at least 100,000 tonnes a year.
For this, continuous production is vital. The IFP has developed and is
testing such a process; others are also trying.
Schorter forecasts that within five years, France will have five factories
making Diester, each with an output of at least 100,000 tonnes. They will
operate in different regions, the first coming on stream in 1995.
Government subsidies for Diester will decline as the more cost-effective
continuous process plants start up, but the question of what to do with the
rapeseed husks left when the oil has been squeezed out and with the
glycerine by-product remains unanswered.
Meanwhile, to satisfy a growing demand for Diester, the Compiegne factory
plans to double output to an annual 40,000 tonnes.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Business and the Environment: Lithuania's pressure cooker -
A look at attempts to improve standards at the Ignalina nuclear power plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The factories which built the equipment for the world's two biggest nuclear
reactors stand empty along the road through Lithuania's national forest.
Disused construction cranes peer over the birch trees, pointing the way to
the Ignalina nuclear power plant.
Their job is not finished and probably never will be. Two RBMK, light water,
gas-cooled or 'Chernobyl-type' reactors were built at Ignalina before public
unrest and environmental pressures stopped work on the third plant in the
mid-1980s. A fourth was planned, but not begun.
Since Lithuania's independence two years ago, alarm over safety at the
Soviet-built power station has prompted western countries to increase their
safety efforts.
The work is being led by Sweden, just across the Baltic Sea. The Swedish
government has paid SKr70m (Pounds 5.8m), with another SKr53.2m due next
year to improve the reactors and train workers ahead of a total shut-down,
likely to be some years off.
Much of the Swedish aid addresses the safety concerns voiced by the plant's
management in a report last February by the International Atomic Energy
Agency. These can be met by hardware purchases such as a better steam
pressure relief system.
ABB Atom, the nuclear energy division of Asea Brown Boveri, the
Swiss-Swedish engineering group, has been contracted to provide a robotic
tool to descend into the reactor cavity's high-radiation areas and improve
the steam pressure relief system.
In the chain reaction that heats water to boiling point, fuel rods
containing uranium dioxide are used; the mixture of steam and water goes to
a steam separator and then to the turbines, producing electricity. The
danger is that if too much radioactive steam is released, the reactor cavity
 -about twice the size of those in the west - could burst.
Normally, when pressure valves break, the steam is channelled to a
condensation pool. But Ignalina can only withstand a rupture of four valves,
below western norms. If more break, there is a risk of contamination. So ABB
Atom will help install a new pressure relief pipe connecting the reactor
cavity to a condensation system.
Even bigger than the risk of contamination, however, is that of fire. Its
consequences, the IAEA says, could be 'severe'.
Vattenfall, Sweden's state power company, has contracts to provide
extinguishers, masks, a fire and hydrogen alarm system and improve the
sprinkler system to prevent overheating.
But none of this equipment can be delivered until the Lithuanian parliament
approves a law under which the country accepts liability for nuclear
accidents. This is expected to happen next year.
However, other projects are running more smoothly. Engineers from another
ABB unit, ABB Tekniska Rontgen-centralen, are performing tests at the
reactors, including inspection of the 1,661 water-cooled fuel channels.
It has developed an ultrasonic scanner to spot welding defects in the
channels' upper sections. These cracks pose no immediate threat. But, says
Peter Schaub, an ABB engineer: 'All defects are dangerous in a nuclear power
plant. We have to help the plant people understand that defects are not
acceptable.'
The scanner has detected hundreds of so-called 'weld root defects', which
have been fixed. Yet the whole process could take years. Cracks develop over
time and frequent inspections are needed. Thus the plant only operates one
reactor at a time, allowing inspectors work at the other.
There have been many changes at Ignalina since 1986. Control systems have
been upgraded, fuel channels loaded with extra absorbent rods to enable them
to withstand more heat and shut-down speed accelerated. To minimise risk
even further, the plant only operates at 1,300MW, below its capacity of
1,500MW.
'We've done everything to prevent another Chernobyl,' insists Viktor
Shevaldin, the plant director. But not everyone shares this optimism. Two
Danish Euro-MPs touched off a flurry of disquieting press reports in
Copenhagen about Lithuania's 'Chernobyl-to-be' by vividly describing safety
problems at Ignalina and calling the ABB Atom efforts inadequate.
Certainly, the decade-old plant, with its gigantic twin reactor and turbine
halls, looks far older than its years. Paint is peeling and machinery seems
outdated. A radiation monitoring machine for workers has not been turned on.
A 1cm crack in the cooling system almost caused a significant accident last
year; faulty valves, similar to those held responsible for the 1991 accident
at Sosnovy Bor near St Petersburg, were inexplicably found in the reactor
this summer. A turbine cooling pipe broke last month.
Structurally, the problems are serious. The Swedish moves are only the first
in the improvement programme at Ignalina. Tord Sterner, vice-president for
nuclear services at ABB Atom, says other necessary work includes the
installation of an emergency feed water system, modernisation of the control
systems and the updating and replacing of more equipment.
Yet there are limits to what can be achieved. Unlike western plants, for
example, the reactor building cannot be encased to help withstand a
potentially disastrous steam release during an accident. 'You cannot make it
as safe as European reactors because that's the way it was built,' says
Morten Sondergaard, an EC Phare (aid for eastern Europe) programme
consultant at the Lithuanian ministry of energy.
Away from the reactors, spent fuel is stored inside water pools, which are
almost full. Germany's Gesellschaft fur Nuklear-Behalter has won a contract
to put the spent fuel in dry storage containers designed to last 50 years.
The Lithuanian government is today expected to approve the contract with
GNB, which outbid Ontario Hydro of Canada.
Another problem is security. A 7m-long, spent fuel shell, full of
radioactive material, disappeared from the plant this summer. Also causing
concern since the break-up of the Soviet Union is morale among Ignalina's
5,000 employees, mostly Russian. Lithuania has granted them citizenship, but
the IAEA and Shevaldin fret about the trickle of migration back to Russia.
Closing the plant would solve these problems. Initially, western governments
thought the reactors could be decommissioned quickly. Then they realised
what this would cost. 'You can demand that the plant be shut down,' says Jan
Nistand, director of the Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate, which handles
the Swedish bilateral aid programme. 'But only if you have alternatives to
offer.'
There are few. Without Ignalina, most Lithuanians, already with no hot
water, would live in the dark. The plant supplies 85 per cent of the
country's electricity needs. No other country in the world depends so much
on nuclear power.
Moreover, half of the electricity produced in Lithuania is exported to
neighbouring Latvia, Belarus and Russia's Kaliningrad region. Facing similar
pressures, the Ukrainian parliament has reversed its earlier order to close
Chernobyl by the year's end.
Decommissioning could cost as much as building a new plant. As a result,
western governments prefer to fund short-term patching-up operations to put
them at ease before shut-down; the Swedish inspectorate expects this to be
possible in eight or 10 years, when the pressure tubes will have to be
replaced.
Only Sweden has a substantial bilateral programme at Ignalina - or, indeed,
at any Soviet-era nuclear power station. Instead, the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development co-ordinates multilateral aid for the former
Soviet bloc's problem plants. It is considering a grant to purchase
equipment for Ignalina.
At Ignalina, Shevaldin has few kind words for the EBRD. 'The Bank won't give
us the money directly. It'll stay somewhere in the west. We'll never see it.
Only with Sweden do we have real work'. He also brushes aside any talk of
shut-down and asserts - contrary to the view of western experts - that
Ignalina will be open another 30 years, the life expectancy of the younger
reactor.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Management: Building a better rocking chair - Lucy Kellaway
meets Robert Fritz, America's eclectic guru
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The publicity announcing the arrival in Britain of Robert Fritz, the latest
management guru from the US, describes him as composer, film maker, author
and management consultant, in that order.
He has just finished making a psychodrama for television about a boy who is
injured in a car accident, suffers brain damage and finds his relations with
the outside world changed forever.
With that sort of background one would expect a pretty alternative view of
management. At the very least he might be relied upon to be a devotee of new
theories of corporate creativity.
Yet this ex-clarinetist looks like a Wall Street banker and says firmly that
he is 'not interested' in creativity. He deplores the fashionable
psychological theories which suggest managers need only get themselves into
a creative 'mindset' and all their bad old ways will be changed overnight.
What matters, he says, is not creativity but creating. In order to create
something it is necessary only to know what the goal is, and what steps to
take to get there.
This is his battle cry: that companies, like composers or film makers, need
to have a clear idea of what they are there for and what they are trying to
do.
'It sounds so simple. Everyone tells you: we do that,' says Fritz. Yet his
contention is that they do not. He has trawled round companies asking them
where they want to go and has discovered that most have no idea.
'Their first reply is usually a combination of ideals, vague statements that
don't mean anything and solutions to problems they haven't named. Very
seldom do you find someone who knows what they are after.'
Fritz argues that companies must first understand how they generate wealth.
He says that if you ask most chief executives they only have a hazy idea.
From this lack of clarity stems all sorts of problems. Companies may have
several conflicting goals that vie for attention, with the result that it
oscillates between them. Fritz calls these companies 'rocking chairs'.
The behaviour that follows comes in many forms. The recent 'downsizing' by
corporations is a good example. Companies have never stopped to work out
what their capacity costs them, and so can find themselves in a cycle where
they over-expand when times are good and contract too much when times get
hard.
Another common 'rocking' pattern is between centralising and decentralising
decision-making. Companies want to grow and to do so they decentralise
decision-making. This leads to a loss of control and a desire for stability,
which in turn makes them centralise decision-making. After a while the
company decides it wants to grow and the process starts all over again.
The answer, says Fritz, is for companies to recognise their desire both for
growth and stability at the outset and work out which one is most important.
They should pay attention to what he calls the structure of their
organisation.
Structure, as he conceives it, describes all the relationships in the
organisation; the reason for the rocking chair is poor structure. The
company might have conflicting goals, it might have reward systems that
conflict with company values. For example, many companies try to encourage
teamwork or to get different departments to work together, but persist in
handing out rewards based on the performance of the individual or the
department.
Whatever the structural flaw, it must be sorted out before any new
management idea has a hope of working.
Fritz's favourite image is that of a car that pulls to the left. 'If you
want to go straight you must pull to the right. But most advisers will say
that if you want to go straight you must steer straight. If you do that, it
will not work.'
His point is that if you do not understand the structure, you will never get
anywhere.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Management: Here, there and everywhere - The lives of 3M's
managers have been transformed by a Europe-wide reorganisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until last Easter Claire-Noelle Bigay worked solely within France, as a
national marketing executive for two lines of medical products from 3M, the
US multinational which makes things as diverse as computer discs, video
tape, road signs and Post-it notes.
Now the 29-year-old Bigay spends more than a third of her time travelling
outside France as one of six members of the new European 'core team' for one
of those product lines, surgical tape. Her immediate colleagues are two
Britons in the UK, a Dutch woman in Germany and a Belgian and an Italian
both based in Brussels - the latter is the team 'co-ordinator'. They all
communicate in English.
Apart from dashing around France, where Bigay still spends two-thirds of her
time, mostly in direct contact with local customers, the country she visits
most is Germany, where she has a second European responsibility:
transferring to her local German counterpart her product expertise. Her
German is as fluent as her English.
Bigay is one of about 1,000 managers at almost every level within 3M in
Europe, many of them in their late 20s and 30s, whose lives have been
transformed this year. As part of a radical reshaping of the company's
European organisation, they have been given permanent and/or project
responsibilities across national borders.
The reorganisation, which took effect in January, has several unusual
characteristics. These make it more far-reaching yet also more subtle than
the ways in which most other multinationals are adapting themselves to the
emergence of cross-border customers and distributors, the consequent need
for faster European decision-making and other aspects of the slowly emerging
'single market'.
Unlike other companies which have pulled back from their initial enthusiasm
for spawning 'Euromanagers' able to operate with ease across national
boundaries, 3M is breeding them like rabbits. This is in character with the
internationalism of its top management.
'For a US company, 3M has done a remarkable amount since the 1970s to make
international experience a key to top careers,' says Christopher Bartlett,
an Australian-born professor at the Harvard Business School. Bartlett's
writings with Insead's Sumantra Ghoshal on 'transnational' organisations had
a direct influence on the shape of 3M's new European structure.
The reorganisation consists of two main steps. 3M has taken them together,
whereas most other companies have done so in sequence, sometimes over a
decade.
First, in the interests of greater cross-border effectiveness and faster
decision-making, 3M has shifted most strategic and operational
responsibility away from its national subsidiaries (the geographic side of
its organisation), and centralised it in the hands of 19 product divisions,
each with Europe-wide responsibility.
It calls these European 'Business Centres' to distinguish them from their
counterpart 'groups' and 'divisions' in the US. But each European and
American entity reports to the same global boss - all but one of them based
in the US.
Second, the residual geographic responsibilities - now confined primarily to
support services such as staff development, logistics, information
technology and finance - have been shifted from the smaller countries to
several of 10 new European 'regions'. Three cover France, Germany and Italy,
but the Nordic, Iberian and central European countries are now combined, as
are the UK and Ireland.
Unlike many other companies which have made such a change, 3M has given the
regional heads equal rank to the EBC managing directors. It is also
retaining full-time country managers in most countries. The purpose is to
ensure that 3M's geographic managers not only represent the company in their
local communities but - a point 3M stresses - they retain enough persuasive
power with the EBCs to ensure that these continue to be responsive to
national differences.
The risk for any type of Euro-organisation is that it will lose touch with
local customers. As Livio DeSimone, 3M's Italian-American chairman and chief
executive, says: 'You need the right blend of global direction and local
responsiveness.'
Thanks to a lengthy period of cross-border consensus-building since 1982,
the change has been accomplished remarkably quickly.
3M originally planned to create the EBCs gradually over three or five years.
But because of the enthusiasm of the EBC heads and their wish to secure the
best possible teams and minimise the insecurity of less senior staff, it was
completed in only 14 months.
Many companies lay false claim to the fashionable 'transnational' label when
almost all their international divisions are still based in the same
country. But 3M has spread its EBCs across five: Belgium (where its
long-standing European head office is based), Britain, France, Germany and
Italy. This principle of dispersal has also been applied within many EBCs,
and inside the 33 smaller European Business Units beneath them, by locating
the members of each management team not all on one site, but across Europe.
Thus the tapes and adhesives EBC is based in Belgium under a Frenchman, with
two of his four immediate subordinates located in France and Germany.
This arrangement has minimised the need for costly and disruptive staff
relocations across Europe. Doug Hanson, 3M's vice-president for Europe, says
that fewer than 40 managers have had to relocate. The intention was always
to distribute the EBCs around Europe, in order to use 3M's existing sites
and resources. But he says: 'We originally thought we wanted everyone within
an EBC located together.'
That would have involved massive relocation. 'After discussion, we decided
that with modern communications and people's wish to stay in their home
country, this wasn't necessary.'
The location of each EBC and its constituent business units was decided on
the basis of 'where it made most sense', insists Hanson, rather than through
internal political wrangling or even-handed 'corporate citizenship' towards
each main country. This is less implausible than it sounds, since 3M already
had a reasonably balanced pattern of sites across Europe, including
production bases for the whole region designated in the 1960s.
'Where we had a big manufacturing site, we located the EBC there,' says
Harry Hammerly, Hanson's boss, who now oversees all international operations
and corporate services from 3M's headquarters in St. Paul, Minnesota.
Thus chemicals went to Antwerp, printing products to Italy, traffic signs
and safety products to Brussels and computer discs to France. 'We were very
careful not to locate an EBC in a country because the right leader for it
was of that nationality,' Hammerly adds. EBCs in several countries are run
by people of other nationalities, including a Briton in Germany, an Italian
in France and a German in Italy.
The main exception to this pattern was with abrasives, where Hanson says the
relative size of existing operations made the EBC's location 'a toss-up'
between France, Germany and the UK - which won, under the best man for the
job, a Briton. But 'he has been careful not to select Brits to shore himself
up', says Hanson. Two of the three business units beneath the abrasives boss
are outside the UK, in France and Germany.
As Hanson says, this type of 'network', is by definition 'less tidy and
controllable than traditional forms of organisation'. It also requires new
approaches to co-operation and teamwork.
A second article will examine how 3M managers are adapting to the new
organisation.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Coal-fired station expected to close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL POWER, the UK's largest electricity generating company, is expected
today to announce plans to close its Staythorpe power station in
Nottinghamshire, underlining the decline in demand for coal.
The decision to shut the coal-fired station will accompany National Power's
half-year results in which Mr John Baker, chief executive, is likely to
emphasise the sharp fall in the company's share of the electricity market.
The results will be the last before Professor Stephen Littlechild,
electricity industry regulator, decides whether to refer National Power and
PowerGen, the second-largest generator, to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission over recent price rises in the electricity wholesale market.
Evidence of a decline in National Power's market share will add weight to
the generators' argument that competition is growing more rapidly than had
been expected and weakening their opponents' case for a referral.
The competition is being provided by improved performance of nuclear
stations and the construction of gas-fired power stations run by independent
generators.
Ironically the Staythorpe closure is next to a site for which National Power
has recently received planning permission to build a much larger 1,500MW
combined-cycle gas-fired station.
National Power was last night unable to confirm the closure ahead of today's
announcement, although workforce representatives were told of the decision
yesterday evening. The closure is not expected to take effect immediately.
The plant employs more than 100 people and has a capacity to produce 350MW.
Its closure is a setback for the Nottinghamshire coalfield which is thought
to supply most of the coal which Staythorpe burns in order to make
electricity.
Staythorpe's closure announcement would be the second in six months,
following the news in June of a shutdown at Thorpe Marsh in South Yorkshire
with the loss of 200 jobs. That announcement accompanied financial results
for the full year.
The City expects National Power today to unveil pre-tax profits of Pounds
210m to Pounds 220m for the six months to September 30 against Pounds 201m
for the same period last year. However, analysts will be as eager for news
on the company's progress in cutting jobs and on the company's decline in
market share.
The jobs total is expected to have fallen below 7,000 against 7,400 in March
and 17,000 prior to privatisation in 1990.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Jobs and prices warning over VAT on food
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIG job losses and price rises in many consumer products would result if
value added tax were extended to all food and drink, the industry warned
yesterday.
The Food and Drink Federation, which represents manufacturers, said that if
VAT were applied at the standard 17.5 per cent rate to the 80 per cent of
food and drink products now zero-rated, retail prices would rise by more
than 2 per cent and 31,000 manufacturing jobs would go. Its members would
suffer a 0.9 percentage-point drop in their average profit margins, and
retailers' profitability would be depressed.
The federation's warning is part of its campaign to persuade Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, not to extend VAT in the Budget. If VAT were
extended to all food and drink at an 8 per cent rate, 8,000 jobs would be
lost and profit margins would be reduced by 0.8 percentage points, the
federation said.
It added that estimates by accountants Price Waterhouse showed that, in the
event of a 17.5 per cent extension, about 40 per cent of the higher costs
due to a change in VAT treatment would feed through into higher prices, and
the remainder would be absorbed by manufacturers and retailers.
Half the impact on manufacturers would be absorbed by shedding jobs, one
third through gains in general efficiency and 17 per cent in a 0.9
percentage-point fall in average profit margins.
About 380,000 people are employed in food manufacturing.
Tax incentives for investment in training and manufacturing are among the
measures businesses in north-east England most want to see in the Budget,
says a Price Waterhouse survey.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Three Yorkshire pits face closure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Frickley Colliery (above) one of three South Yorkshire pits facing closure.
British Coal yesterday told unions that the amount of Yorkshire coal burnt
at power stations would be 3.5m tonnes less than expected this year. The
company said it wanted further talks on Frickley, Hatfield and Bentley,
starting on Friday with Frickley. Meetings on Bentley and Hatfield will
follow on Tuesday and Friday next week.
The announcement was made at the end of a two-and-a-half-hour meeting
between management and unions at Allerton Bywater, West Yorkshire, at which
all 17 pits in the northern group were discussed.
British Coal, which operates 30 pits, started pre-privatisation closures
last week by announcing the shutdown of Calverton, Nottinghamshire.
Bentley employs 450 men, Frickley 740 and Hatfield 260. Hatfield lost Pounds
8.3m in the six months to the end of September and Frickley Pounds 1.8m.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Car sales rise of 4% forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK NEW CAR sales are expected to rise by 4 per cent to 5 per cent next year,
the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said yesterday. This would
mean a 1994 total of 1.85m, after an increase of more than 11 per cent this
year to between 1.77m and 1.78m.
Motor industry leaders warned, however, that the economic recovery remained
fragile and needed 'nurturing'. They expressed concern that any significant
increase in taxation in the Budget later this month would halt the recovery
in its tracks.
'The last thing we need as an industry or as an economy is a greater tax
burden,' said Mr Geoffrey Whalen, SMMT president and managing director of
Peugeot Talbot.
In spite of the rise in domestic demand, most carmakers in the UK had been
forced to cut production because of the steep fall in new car sales in
mainland Europe. The drop in west European car demand had caused 100,000
cars to be lost from UK production schedules, Mr Whalen said.
UK car output was still expected to rise to 1.35m this year - its highest
level since the mid-1970s - from 1.29m in 1992, mainly because of the
substantial capacity added by the Japanese carmakers Nissan, Toyota and
Honda.
Output next year was expected to reach about 1.45m.
Marketing campaigns are also expected to increase in intensity. 'With the
markets in continental Europe still suffering, manufacturers across the
Channel are switching their attention to Britain in an effort to keep up
their own production,' the SMMT said.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Howard aims to end bail abuse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VIEWS of victims of crime will be sought before bail is granted to the
accused as part of a crackdown on bail abuse in England and Wales.
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, yesterday unveiled a five-point plan
to tackle the problem, which is expected to be included in the Queen's
Speech later this month as part of the Criminal Justice Bill.
Mr Howard said he planned to give police powers to attach conditions to bail
 -at present police have to apply to a magistrate to have conditions
attached to bail.
The proposal received a mixed response from magistrates, with some arguing
strongly that bail conditions should be left to the judiciary.
Mr Howard said that the balance in the criminal justice system had tilted
too far towards the offender and against the victim and that strong action
was needed to prevent offences being committed on bail.
He said he also proposed to accept the recommendation by the Royal
Commission on Criminal Justice that, where appropriate, the views of victims
should be sought before bail was granted.
There were 43,000 breaches of police bail last year and one in 10 people on
bail committed further offences.
Mr Howard's other proposals include:
Giving police power to arrest without a warrant people in breach of police
bail.
Giving courts power to recall defendants and revoke bail if relevant new
information comes to light or there is a change of circumstances.
Removing the presumption in favour of bail for those charged with serious
offences allegedly committed while on bail.
Excluding bail for those charged with murder, manslaughter or rape, or with
a previous conviction for any of those offences.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Talks on salmon output curb halted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWEGIAN salmon farmers, blamed in Britain and Ireland for driving down the
price of salmon by flooding the market, have ended their talks with Scottish
and Irish salmon farmers on creating a network of producer organisations
aimed at controlling production.
Their move is in retaliation for attempts by Scottish and Irish farmers to
obtain EC sanctions against Norway.
Yesterday the Norwegian farmers urged their government to implement measures
to curb over-production and called on other salmon-producing countries to
limit output.
The UK government is believed to be on the point of making a formal request
to the European Commission to impose limits on imports of Norwegian salmon
into the EC.
Salmon prices have fallen drastically in the past few weeks to levels last
seen in 1991, when the EC temporarily imposed a minimum price on imported
Norwegian salmon.
Norway, which had forecast output of 120,000 tonnes this year compared with
140,000 tonnes last year, is set to produce 170,000 tonnes. The surge is due
to a sharp reduction in losses from disease.
The Norwegian fish farmers' association is urging its government to
introduce an immediate limit on the weight of salmon that may be taken from
licensed salmon cages.
Most Norwegian farmers have decided not to feed their fish for seven of the
last nine weeks of this year, curbing growth and reducing projected output
by 15,000 tonnes.
Yesterday the Norwegian association pointed out that salmon output is set to
grow faster in Scotland and Ireland than in Norway. An EC report says that
Scottish output will rise 27 per cent to 46,000 tonnes and Irish output by
23 per cent to 12,000 tonnes compared with the Norwegian growth rate of 20
per cent.
The Norwegian farmers' termination of discussions on setting up producer
organisations brought an angry reaction from the Scottish Salmon Growers

FT  10 NOV 93 / Angus Maude: former minister: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD MAUDE, formerly Angus Maude, died last night at the age of 81. He was a
prominent Conservative politician who began his working life as a financial
journalist.
Lord Maude was educated at Rugby and Oriel College, Oxford then worked in
the 1930s as a financial writer for The Times and the Daily Mail.
He served as a soldier in the second world war and was a prisoner of war for
more than three years.
He won South Ealing for the Tories in 1950 and became director of the
Conservative Political Centre in 1951.
In 1956 he rebelled against his party's policy on Suez. In 1958,
disenchanted with the party's leadership, he resigned to edit the Sydney
Morning Herald.
In 1963 he won the by-election for Lord Profumo's Stratford-upon-Avon seat.
He held that seat until 1983.
He clashed in the 1960s with Sir Edward Heath, then leader of the
opposition, and resigned as frontbench spokesman on colonial affairs.
Baroness Thatcher appointed him paymaster-general, responsible for
government information, after her first general-election victory, but he
resigned in 1981.
He leaves a widow and three children including former Tory junior minister
Mr Francis Maude.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry yesterday criticised the government
for being too prescriptive in the detailed running of Training and
Enterprise Councils, while failing to give them strategic leadership.
The CBI's criticisms are contained in a policy document on employer-led
Tecs, which administer government-funded training programmes in England and
Wales.
The report expressed broad support for Tecs, which spend Pounds 2bn of
public funds, but highlighted up to 50 areas where the CBI believed there
was need for reform.
Proposals included:
A review of the contracts between the government and Tecs, and
simplification of the administrative requirements Tecs imposed on suppliers.
Funding of Tecs through an intermediary council, rather than directly by the
department of employment.
A clearer government statement of the role of Tecs.
More local accountability, with codes of practice.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Tory concern at lone-parent plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BACKBENCH Tory MPs yesterday expressed concern over the suggestion in a
leaked document that the government should cut social security benefits to
single parents.
The proposal, discussed recently by a cabinet committee, caused a storm in
Whitehall yesterday after the leak of the discussion document on ways to
tackle 'the burden on public expenditure caused by lone parent families'.
The document, written by senior Whitehall officials, outlined possible lines
of action to reduce the number of single parent families, most of which are
headed by women. They included reducing social security benefit, increasing
emphasis on sex education and transferring some financial responsibility for
the children to their grandparents.
Another suggestion was that the age of consent be reduced from 16 to 13, so
that GPs could prescribe contraceptives.
It emerged yesterday that the document had been discussed by EDH, the
cabinet committee on home and social affairs. The meeting, chaired by Lord
Wakeham, the Lord Privy Seal, probably took place on September 21 and was
attended by Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary.
A discussion at this level suggests that the government is close to making
formal proposals to parliament. An official said the committee had rejected
the idea of reducing the age of consent as 'nonsense'.
Mr Lilley yesterday tried to defuse the row over the document, claiming that
his first concern was to look after the interests of the children concerned.
But he admitted that the government was looking at ways to cut some of the
costs of supporting this social group. 'We believe that people should
support each other, particularly that parents should support their children.
The taxpayer should only become involved when they don't have the money to
do so.'
Some Conservative backbenchers said they would resist any proposal to cut
benefit for lone parents. Mr David Shaw, MP for Dover and a member of the
Commons Social Security Committee, said that this would hurt the children of
the parent.
Ms Teresa Gorman, Conservative MP for Billericay, and Mrs Emma Nicholson
(Devon West) also criticised the targetting of single women for benefit
cuts. 'It ill-behoves men to make these judgments on single women,' said Ms
Gorman. 'Most of us - but for the grace of God - might have found ourselves
in their position.'

FT  10 NOV 93 / Civil servants to discuss ending ban at GCHQ
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, is to meet civil service union
leaders today to discuss the possibility of ending the ban on union
membership at GCHQ, the government's listening base at Cheltenham.
The discussions, which come nearly 10 years after the membership ban imposed
by Baroness Thatcher, have been called in an attempt to secure an
arrangement that will save the government from censure by the International
Labour Organisation.
The ILO has threatened to single out Britain as the first industrialised
democracy to breach its convention on freedom of association.
In preliminary talks earlier this year the unions revived a proposal -
rejected by Lady Thatcher in 1984 - of representation at GCHQ in return for
a no disruption agreement.
'We would still want to talk around that,' said Mr Barry Reamsbottom,
general secretary of the Civil and Public Services Association, one of the
five civil service unions involved in the talks.
A no-disruption compromise was worked out at the time of the original ban in
1984 between Sir Robert Armstrong, then cabinet secretary, and Mr Bill
McCall but it was dismissed outright by Lady Thatcher.
She believed that industrial action at GCHQ, particularly during the 1981
pay strike, had undermined national security.
The government is understood to be unwilling to give way to the return of
union membership at this stage but would like some agreement surrounding the
staff federation, which does not have official union status.
Mr Clive Brooke, general secretary of the Inland Revenue Staff Federation,
said there were some 'intractable'' problems to be resolved.
He said ministers did not want to be singled out by the ILO. 'They are
embarrassed that it is on the agenda again and because of the possibility of
a public condemnation.'
The Cabinet Office said yesterday: 'The ILO asked us to talk seriously to
the unions and we are talking seriously.'
A march and rally has been planned in Cheltenham on January 29 to mark the
10th anniversary of the ban.

FT  10 NOV 93 / BAA to help set up US-style discount malls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAA, the airports operator, has formed a joint venture with McArthur/Glen,
the US property developer, to build six US-style 'factory outlet malls' in
the UK at a cost of about Pounds 40m.
The venture expects to announce its first two UK sites within a few months,
as well as two sites in France. Further UK sites will be developed over
three years. If these and the French developments are successful the venture
will expand into the rest of continental Europe.
'Outlet malls will prove a very interesting addition to UK retailing,' said
Mr Barry Gibson, BAA's retail director. 'You only have to look at what is
happening in the food sector to see that British consumers are saying they
want value for money.'
Factory outlet shops sell surplus and end-of-season stock from branded
manufacturers at prices about a third lower than in high streets. Although
there are more than 1,100 such shops, malls where the shops are grouped
together are relatively new to the UK.
Along with warehouse clubs, factory outlet malls have been one of the
fastest-growing sectors of US retailing in the past 10 years. The clubs  -
also coming to the UK - are sheds in which goods are sold cheaply to
fee-paying members.
The malls and clubs will put further pressure on existing UK retailers,
already facing growing competition from discount retailers.
BAA, which runs shopping centres at its seven UK airports and owns Lynton,
the property developer, says the venture combines its own retailing and
property development skills with McArthur/Glen's experience in the US, where
it has 17 malls.
While the venture favours out-of-town sites about 20 or 30 miles from
population centres for its 150,000 sq ft malls, Mr Gibson said he was aware
the government's new planning guidance favouring town centre and
edge-of-town sites could make it difficult to obtain planning permission.
But he said agreement was near on the first two sites, and he was confident
others could be found.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Director is jailed for five years: Pounds 2.1m tax fraud
conducted through 'phoenix' companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPANY director was yesterday jailed for five years for his part in a
Pounds 2.1m tax fraud through 'phoenix' companies. The sentence is believed
to be the most severe custodial penalty yet imposed for contrived
liquidations.
The 3 1/2 -year investigation spanned more than 16 companies in four linked
phoenix operations. The prosecution said the liquidations, involving a
number of City and West End employment agencies, were contrived to avoid
tax.
The case follows calls by the Confederation of British Industry for reform
of insolvency legislation to prevent 'reckless' directors from leaving
behind a 'trail of debt' while continuing to trade in phoenix companies. It
also prompted warnings by Customs and Excise that the use of phoenix
companies is increasing.
Phoenix companies are businesses which fold only to rise again, often under
a slightly different name in the hands of the same directors and management.
Debts, usually unpaid tax, are left in the original company, leaving
creditors to claim from an empty shell.
The new company often buys the stock of the first company at big discounts
and continues to trade with its customers who may not know they are dealing
with a new company.
In addition to the jail sentence, Mr Christopher Tarpey, of Swiss Cottage,
north London, was disqualified from being a company director for 12 years.
He was ordered to pay the tax authorities Pounds 106,000 in compensation. A
Middlesex Crown Court jury had found him guilty on eight counts of cheating
the Inland Revenue under common law.
Two other men, Mr Kevin Nolan and Mr Paul Cressey, also from the London
area, both of whom pleaded guilty, were also jailed for 18 and 15 months
respectively.
They were both barred from being company directors for five years.
One of the agencies, Sandhurst Recruitment Services (SRS), traded as Legal
Staff. It was set up in September 1985 and liquidated in October 1989, with
Crown debts of Pounds 270,862.
A second company, this time registered as Legal Staff, was set up in April
1988, and took over the business of SRS. It also traded as Legal Staff from
the same London address. It was liquidated in November 1990 owing Pounds
191,244 in tax.
A third company, Dulagood, set up in November 1990, also traded as Legal
Staff from the same address but did not accrue a tax debt because the
principals were arrested in December of that year.
Customs and Excise said the prosecution, which it led with support of the
Inland Revenue, is the most recent evidence of an increase in contrived
liquidations.
It said: 'Phoenixism is on the increase and has been on the increase for a
number of years now. The amount of Crown taxes lost by this means of fraud
is of great concern to the revenue departments.' The sum ran into millions,
Customs added.
The CBI said yesterday: 'CBI members report a regular incidence of phoenix
companies. Experience has clearly shown that current legislation is not
effective and does not appear to be enforced.'
The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday published proposals to reform
aspects of company insolvency law, but they do not affect contrived
liquidations. It said it believed the present law was adequate although all
legislation was constantly under review.

<TEXT>
LONGER academic years and a move away from the honours degree system were
urged by the Royal Society yesterday as part of a package of reforms for
higher education.
But the society ruled out making graduates pay for their tuition, a measure
which has been proposed by several university vice-chancellors in the last
few months. Instead, it suggested the state should also pay tuition fees in
full for part-time students but that student maintenance costs should be
funded by a graduate tax.
The Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals welcomed the proposals.
Among the society's other proposals were:
Some universities should concentrate on teaching and move towards a longer
academic year.
Honours classification should be replaced with a detailed account of
assessment throughout the course.
Qualifications such as certificates and diplomas of higher education should
be introduced, to be finished in less than three years.
New modular courses, allowing students to move from university, or to shift
between work and education.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Whitehall fights a war of words: A look at the Ministry of
Defence's campaign to stave off cuts in its budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIR CHIEF Marshal Sir Michael Graydon, chief of the air staff, is not a man
given to dramatic public statements. So when he accuses the Treasury of
running a 'disreputable' campaign to discredit the services, Westminster
sits up and takes notice.
Addressing the Air League on Monday, Sir Michael accused the Treasury of
portraying the military as 'fat, inefficient and poorly organised' in order
to lay the groundwork for swingeing defence cuts in the Budget.
Sir Michael named no names, and he apologised yesterday - after pressure
from the Ministry of Defence - for any embarrassment he may have caused
ministers.
But his outburst raises a series of questions about the role of the
Treasury, the service chiefs and their political masters at the defence
ministry in the Budget debate.
Defence sources pointed the finger of blame squarely at Mr Michael Portillo,
the steadfastly rightwing chief secretary to the Treasury, who has argued
strongly for public spending restraint.
Mr Portillo last night denied any involvement in Treasury leaks. But
officials were pointing out that there was nothing unusual about this year's
public spending round, which followed much the same course of leak and
counter-leak as those of previous years.
If battle was joined with greater verve than is usual, it was because the
defence budget is one of the few big areas which could be cut to keep public
spending within the agreed control total of Pounds 254bn.
In the event, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, fought off demands
for cuts of up to Pounds 1bn this year, and settled for a reduction in the
defence budget of Pounds 1.3bn over three years.
The agreement was preceded by a great deal of horsetrading, during which the
Treasury drew journalists' attention to various military inefficiencies
which could be exploited to yield savings.
These ranged from the comic to the dramatic. One minister, for example,
suggested that worthwhile savings could be achieved if the services gave up
their separate facilities for making false teeth.
The defence chiefs seem to have been most upset by suggestions that there
were too many senior officers - particularly in the navy, said to have more
than 40 admirals who never go to sea.
But while the Treasury was quick to exploit some of these suggestions in its
campaign for spending cuts, the defence chiefs are making a mistake in
identifying Mr Portillo, or his civil servants, as sources.
The story that most angered the service chiefs - the revelation that lower
ranks had borne the brunt of reductions in staffing since 1970 - was based
on freely available information published by the defence ministry.
Much of the other material which upset the forces came from a cabinet
minister from another department who has thought deeply about defence issues
but has no contact with the Treasury.
In short, there was no organised Treasury campaign to undermine the defence
forces. But there was a behind-the-scenes campaign by the defence department
to mobilise backbench Conservative opinion against the proposed cuts.
That campaign, which culminated in a threatened rebellion by Tory MPs, was
clearly assisted by a much-publicised visit by Sir Michael and the other
defence chiefs to complain about the potential impact of cuts in spending.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Airlines face 60% rise in insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL airlines are facing increases of about 60 per cent in the cost
of insurance cover.
The rises follow several years of weak trading performance by aviation
insurers, with claims from accidents and other losses regularly exceeding
premiums - a trend highlighted by a possible claim for more than Dollars
100m (Pounds 66m) after a China Airlines Boeing 747 plunged into Hong Kong
harbour last week.
The rises should signal improving prospects of profitability for
underwriters at Lloyd's of London, a leading market for aviation insurance.
'Underwriters have lost money for a number of years,' said Mr Matthew Day,
of Willis Corroon Aerospace, a leading buyer of airline insurance.
Three out of four airlines renew covers in the last quarter of each year.
Rates vary according to the claims record of each airline during the past 12
months. But according to figures published by Willis Corroon, many airlines
that renewed their policies on October 1 paid steep increases.
Increases ranged from 147 per cent for hull cover and 110 per cent for its
liability risks paid by one Asian airline to 31 per cent for hull and 54 per
cent for liabilities for a smaller European airline.
Premiums for hulls range from 0.14 per cent to 0.6 per cent of value and
liability premiums range from 0.2 per cent to 1 per cent of 'revenue
passenger kilometres', a measure of the airline's passenger traffic used by
insurers.
After the increases, total premiums for 1993 are expected to be Dollars
898m, said Willis, against Dollars 579m in the same period of 1992. Large
claims have so far cost insurers about Dollars 300m (a figure which is
understood to exclude the recent Hong Kong crash) although the market has
also been hit by a large number of partial and 'attritional' losses (when
aircraft are damaged, not destroyed).
As part of the trend towards a tighter market, insurers have also pressed
airlines to accept higher deductibles (the amount paid by the insurance
buyer).
The ability of underwriters to impose increases reflects the withdrawal from
the market of a number of insurers, including syndicates at Lloyd's, earlier
this year.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Birmingham's budget attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIRMINGHAM City Council has been told by its own advisers to shift its
spending priorities from the provision of international facilities, such as
its convention centre, to a crash programme on improving education.
The Birmingham Education Commission, set up by the council to advise on
future educational needs in England's biggest local authority, said
yesterday: 'Birmingham can be proud of its international facilities. But the
state of its school buildings brings shame to the city.'
Since fiscal 1989-90, the city council has spent Pounds 236m less on
education than the government, in its standard spending assessment, assumed
it would. This period covered the opening of the convention centre, indoor
sports arena and an extension to the National Exhibition Centre.
The commission is suggesting the council should spend Pounds 300m more than
its standard spending assessment figure over the next five years.
The council yesterday welcomed the report and Ms Theresa Stewart, the Labour
leader, promised that school repairs would be 'a priority in our budget
planning process'.
Britain's economic performance lags behind that of its European competitors
because of insufficient craft training, says a paper published by the
National Institute of Economic and Social Research, John Authers writes.
Professor Sig Prais, of the institute, says 64 per cent of Britain's
workforce has no vocational qualifications. In Germany this figure is only
26 per cent, and in Switzerland 23 per cent. Britain's deficiency is most
marked in 'intermediate' craft qualifications, at the level of City and
Guilds Part One and above, and BTec national diplomas.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEGAL challenge by 70 pensioners to a Pounds 150m 'gift' to Lucas
Industries, the automotive and aerospace components company, from its
pension fund failed yesterday when a High Court judge ruled the payment was
lawful.
The payment, made in 1990 and approved by the pension fund's trustees and
the Occupational Pensions Board, was made to deal with the potential tax
liabilities of the fund's large surplus. The pensioners had challenged the
legitimacy of the trustees' actions.
Mr Justice Vinelott said both the payment and the trustees' actions were
proper. The payment had been accompanied by automatic increases in benefits
to members who were represented on the board of trustees.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Mercury launches charge cards
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPETITION in the fast-growing market for telephone charge cards was given
a boost yesterday with the launch of a range of cards by Mercury
Communications, the main competitor to British Telecommunications.
Mercury said its cards offered 'substantial savings' on long-distance
tariffs compared with BT's Chargecard. It also offered new features such as
the capacity to call from abroad without using an operator.
Charge cards allow customers to use pay phones and private handsets other
than their own and charge the cost to their home account, or that of their
company.
Mercury's long-distance charge card tariffs are generally lower than BT's
standard tariffs, but BT last week made sharp cuts in its weekend tariffs
for long-distance charge card users. BT also claims to have charge card
agreements with more international operators than Mercury.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Vauxhall workers vote to strike
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WORKERS AT one of Vauxhall's main car plants, Ellesmere Port, near
Liverpool, have voted narrowly in favour for a strike over pay. But it is
unlikely to go ahead without support from other plants and other unions,
David Goodhart writes.
Members of the TGWU general union at the plant voted 911 to 848 for a strike
but by 1,259 votes to 547 for industrial action short of a strike.
Mr Tony Woodley, TGWU national secretary, said the company's offer failed to
reflect record profits and big improvements in productivity. The offer is
for a 2.5 per cent rise now with another 3 per cent next autumn plus a 1 per
cent lump payment and a further 1 per cent if inflation reaches 4 per cent.
Union officials say privately that workers at Vauxhall's other large plant
at Luton, Bedfordshire, are much less likely to support industrial action.
The Luton plant is not producing cars at the moment because of weakness in
the European market
Members of the AEEU craft union, who are expected to start balloting on the
offer at the end of next week, are also much less likely to support
industrial action.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Names warned of higher losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN a thousand Names whose assets support syndicates managed by Sturge
Holdings, one of the largest Lloyd's agencies, have been told by members'
agents that their losses for 1990 and 1991 could be worse than feared.
Names on syndicate 428, a small marine syndicate that specialised in
reinsurance business, face losses of between Pounds 29.4m and Pounds 45.6m -
between 100 per cent and 155 per cent of the syndicate's capacity (the
amount of premiums it can accept) for the 1990 year.
Losses were estimated at Pounds 27.1m (92 per cent of capacity) in June when
managers published their 1990 result. Syndicate accounts were left open
because of continuing uncertainty over claims.
Mr Johnston Brown, group secretary at Sturge Holdings, said the Sturge
managing agency had not altered its own estimates of losses for syndicate
428 given to Names in June. He said members' agents were taking a more
'pessimistic' view.
Syndicate 428 had been affected by large numbers of smaller 'attritional'
claims, many of which had not emerged until late last year. The syndicate's
performance could be the subject of a 'loss review' by Lloyd's, Mr Brown
said.
Lloyd's examines the circumstances surrounding syndicate losses when these
exceed 100 per cent of capacity. So far several loss reviews have been
conducted.
A total of 1,358 Names on syndicate 428 face a further loss of between
Pounds 23.98m and Pounds 31.98m (75 per cent to 100 per cent of capacity)
for 1991.
Names on the larger marine syndicate 209 also face 1991 losses, estimated at
Pounds 49.58m to Pounds 52.88m (75 per cent to 80 per cent of capacity).

Mercury said its cards offered 'substantial savings' on long-distance

Charge cards allow customers to use pay phones and private handsets besides

The new Mercury Calling Card comes in three forms, allowing users to charge
different types of call to their account. Premier Service allows national
and international calls to be made within and to the UK.
Mercury's long-distance charge card tariffs are generally lower than BT's
standard tariffs, but BT last week made sharp cuts in its weekend tariffs
for long-distance charge card users. BT also claims to have charge card

FT  10 NOV 93 / CBI urges wide reform of Tecs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry yesterday criticised the government
for being too prescriptive in the detailed running of Training and
Enterprise Councils, while failing to give them strategic leadership.
The CBI's criticisms are contained in a policy document on employer-led
Tecs, which administer government-funded training programmes in England and
Wales. The criticisms will be discussed at the CBI's annual conference in
Harrogate next week.
The report expressed broad support for Tecs, which spend Pounds 2bn of
public funds, but highlighted up to 50 areas where the CBI believed there
was need for reform.
Proposals directed at the government, Tecs and in some instances Local
Enterprise Companies included:
A thorough review of the contracts between the government and Tecs, and a
parallel exercise to simplify the administrative requirements Tecs imposed
on suppliers.
Funding of Tecs through an intermediary council, rather than directly by the
department of employment.
A clearer government statement of the role of Tecs.
More local accountability, with codes of best practice to ensure greater
local involvement.
The report also gave an implicit warning to the government that it should
not strip Tecs of their responsibility for Youth Training. The Department
for Education has sought to transfer more than half of Youth Training's
budget to its further education colleges.
The CBI said the government's new emphasis on Tecs' enterprise role should
'not be interpreted as making training a secondary priority, but should
require a new balance to be struck'.

FT  10 NOV 93 / World Trade News: British Telecom to invest in satellite
services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBAI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH TELECOM is investing about Dollars 200m (Pounds 132m) in financing
new satellite telecommunication equipment on board commercial airliners to
position itself in the emerging market for aircraft satellite communication
services.
The BT investment reflects the growing interest of international
telecommunication companies in new airline satellite communication systems
which, together with new satellite navigation systems, are expected to
revolutionise commercial air transport over the next 20 years.
'The introduction of new satellite navigation and communication technology
is expected to be as significant for the airline industry as the transition
from the turbo-propellor aircraft to the jet in the 1950s,' Mr William
Fromme, director of the air navigation bureau of the International Civil
Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the aviation arm of the United Nations, said
yesterday at a Financial Times conference at the Dubai Air Show.
Mr Fromme said new satellite telecommunication and navigation systems were
expected to improve sharply safety and airspace management and provide
significant economic advantages to airlines. But according to the
International Air Transport Association (Iata) studies one of the biggest
pay-offs would for telecommunication companies because of the increased use
of satellite telecommunications on board aircraft.
Apart from BT, the US Comsat satellite telecommunication group and Teleglobe
of Canada are already committed to substantial investment of airborne
telecommunication technology and equipment.
So far, about 300 aircraft have been equipped with satellite communication
packages. The cost of installing this equipment on board is about Dollars
500,000 per aircraft.
With many financially strapped airlines reluctant to financethis new
communication equipment, telecommunication companies appear increasingly
interested because of the expectation of long-term revenue flows.
'Up to now, many people appear to have underestimated the potential revenues
from on-board personal services like communications, information and
entertainment,' Mr Fromme said. Studies have suggested that airline
passengers could spend between Dollars 20 to Dollars 40 a year each on
onboard communication services.
Emirates, the Dubai-based airline, estimates that passengers could spend up
to Dollars 100 a year each on on-board electronic shopping facilities.
Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic Airways also sees onboard electronic
shopping and entertainment as providing an increasing source of revenue for
airlines to offset continued pressure on fares.

FT  10 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Gatt deal may enrich world by Dollars
270bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A GATT agreement could enrich the world by as much as Dollars 270bn (Pounds
178.8bn) by the year 2002, according to a study published by the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development yesterday.
This is the highest estimate yet of the overall benefits that could flow
from a successful conclusion of the seven-year Uruguay Round negotiations.
It is larger than the Dollars 213bn welfare gain estimated in a joint
OECD-World Bank study in September because it calculates gains from cuts in
non-tariff as well as tariff barriers in industrial goods trade.
Presenting the report, Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the OECD secretary general,
said: 'I would not bet on this figure (Dollars 270bn), but the important
thing is that all (economic) models lead to the same conclusion that a Gatt
accord would be a substantial net benefit to world welfare.'
The OECD study was launched on Canada's initiative, with strong backing
coming from some other Anglo-Saxon countries and reluctant acquiescence from
France.
Meanwhile, France's prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, said he had no
faith in claims that mere signature of a Gatt accord would relaunch the
world economy, or in 'fantasy growth figures, which some people promise us',
or in fear that a Uruguay Round failure would make world trade any more
problematic than it had been in the past seven years.
He also confessed alarm at the current North American Free Trade Agreement
debate in the US, in which some Americans were demanding further
reinforcement of their country's means of unilateral commercial retaliation.
The French premier told a conference in Paris he expected Europe's partners
to make 'the leap' necessary to unblock the negotiations before the end of
this year.
Mr Balladur refrained from dismissing, as many of his ministers do, the
December 15 deadline for the Uruguay Round as an American date set only for
the convenience of the US Congress. He now appears to regard that deadline
as real.
Mr Peter Sutherland, the Gatt director general, said that Gatt's
participants faced a clear choice.
'They can either update and strengthen the multilateral system, or they can
stand by and watch the centrifugal forces of economic nationalism tear it
apart, and their future along with it,' he said.
The Gatt director did not believe any government would be 'so perverse, so
blind to its own interests, as to set out deliberately to destroy the
Uruguay Round'. But it would only take 'a little more delay and indecision
to produce exactly the same result'.
Andrew Hill adds from Brussels: A high-level Commonwealth trade mission
yesterday issued a strong warning to the US, EC and Japan not to endanger a
world trade deal by delaying a conclusion or re-opening issues which had
already been settled.
Ministers from four Commonwealth countries spoke to Sir Leon Brittan, the
EC's chief trade negotiator, on the second day of an eight-day mission.
They told journalists after the meeting that they were increasingly
optimistic the Round could be concluded before the December 15 deadline.

THE frenzied lobbying over the North American Free Trade Agreement yesterday
abated slightly as the major players awaited the next event in the campaign
for passage: the television debate between Vice- President Al Gore and
former presidential candidate, Mr Ross Perot, writes Nancy Dunne in
Washington.
Leading up to last night's event were no fewer than three debates scheduled
on or around Capitol Hill between various congressmen, senators, and
economists. The Nafta and Beyond Commission staged a meeting on its impact
on the US economy, while a House government operations subcomittee called
witnesses on Mexico's refusal to extradite a suspect accused of sexually
molesting a five-year-old girl.
USA*Nafta, the business lobby, announced new television commercials
featuring Mr Bill Gates, Microsoft founder, saying: 'Our manufacturing
productivity is so much better here, we won't have to move jobs to Mexico.'
The opposition released a letter from Mr Ralph Nader, the consumer crusader,
accusing President Clinton of failing to make improvements to Nafta which he
promised on food and truck safety, democratising procedures, and safeguards
for workers and farmers.

FT  10 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Europe baulks at Hollywood's onslaught -
Solution of audiovisual row may be in sight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW areas of the world trade talks in Geneva have aroused as much public
passion as US demands for more access to the European market for films and
television programmes.
European film makers and broadcasters claim that Hollywood is intent on the
destruction of their industry and, with it, Europe's cultural identity.
Americans counter with accusations of censorship and cultural elitism.
Yet in the shadow of this war of words, US and European Community
negotiators appear to be groping towards a solution acceptable to both
sides. Although the details have not been worked out (and could still sink
the deal), the basic idea is to preserve existing protection for the
European audiovisual sector while preventing restrictions being tightened in
the future.
The chances of a deal came a little closer on Monday when, at the EC foreign
ministers' meeting, France appeared to drop earlier objections to making
audiovisual services part of any Uruguay Round accord. Sir Leon Brittan, the
EC's trade commissioner, has consistently argued that including the sector
in the world trade talks would give the EC greater protection against
unilateral action by the US to force further market-opening moves.
Although 116 nations are taking part in the Round, which is due to end on
December 15, the audiovisual issue is essentially a bilateral argument
between the US and EC. At its centre are longstanding US objections to the
European Community's 1989 broadcasting directive, which from 1981 has
required EC-based television channels to allot at least half their
broadcasting time to European-made programmes 'wherever practicable' (not
counting news, sport, games or advertising).
Washington is also unhappy about subsidies for European film makers,
especially as US movies contribute a big chunk of the funding through a film
levy. In France, the only EC nation which still has a sizeable domestic film
industry, subsidies of all descriptions run to FFr2.1bn (Pounds 240m) a
year.
The European audiovisual industry believes that this support is essential to
counter competition from cheap US imports, which have already recouped their
costs in the huge domestic market. Even so, sales of US films and television
programmes to Europe have soared in recent years.
In 1991, US productions accounted for 81 per cent of EC cinema screenings,
over 70 per cent of European box-office takings, and 54 per cent of all
dramas and comedies broadcast on television. US audiovisual exports to the
EC were Dollars 3.6bn (Pounds 2.4bn) last year, against a paltry Dollars
288m in European sales to the US.
Washington is evidently in no position to complain that it has insufficient
access to the European market. US negotiators even concede that films and
television programmes may require different treatment from trade in goods or
other services such as insurance or accountancy.
But, at the same time, they want assurances that no new restrictions will be
imposed on European sales of what is now America's second largest export
industry (after aircraft). The US film and television industry has a
turnover of more than Dollars 40bn a year, directly or indirectly supports
5m jobs and has a 40 per cent share of the rapidly expanding world market.
The EC proposal, now being drafted, aims to secure special protection for
audiovisual services in recognition of their 'cultural specificity'. The
Community's schedule of initial commitments under the framework services
agreement, setting out what it is and is not prepared to do in opening
services markets to foreign competition, will preserve existing broadcasting
controls and film subsidy arrangements.
In the short term the EC would seem to be in a strong position, especially
as the US has lost part of its negotiating credibility by deciding to remove
ocean-going shipping from its own services schedule. Japan and some other
nations such as Mexico favour the US stance, but the EC has solid backing
from most of the rest of western Europe, Canada, Australia and India.
In the longer run, however, Europe may lose the battle of the quotas to the
new technologies. Before long European consumers will have hundreds of
domestic and foreign channels to choose from on satellite and cable. At the
same time financial and creative links between Hollywood and Europe are
steadily increasing. If filling quotas in the future will be difficult,
policing them may be well nigh impossible.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Peso falls as Nafta vote nears in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S peso came under heavy selling pressure yesterday as foreign and
domestic investors became increasingly nervous over prospects for the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
The exchange rate fell at one time almost to its lowest permitted level of
3.31 pesos to the dollar, 5.1 per cent below the opening rate of 3.15. At
the close the rate was 3.27 pesos, 3.8 per cent down on the day.
The decline came after the central bank decided it would no longer intervene
to stabilise the currency at the previous informal limit of 3.15 pesos.
Government officials said this was done to make speculation more difficult
because there is now a greater chance of appreciation of the currency.
Uncertainty has mounted in the past week ahead of the scheduled vote on
Nafta in the US House of Representatives on November 17. Nervousness
increased last night ahead of the televised debate on Nafta between US
vice-president Al Gore and Texan billionaire Ross Perot.
'The market is very nervous about Nafta and the debate between Gore and
Perot,' said Mr Antonio Gonzalez of Estrategia Monetaria, an exchange rate
house in Mexico City. 'By letting the exchange rate rise to the upper band,
the central bank is raising the costs of speculation.'
Mexico's peso is allowed to float within a band, currently between 3.056 and
3.309 to the dollar, the floor of which devalues fractionally every day. The
peso, remarkably stable throughout the year, started weakening last
Wednesday, when foreign and domestic investors began to sell the currency to
lock in gains made over the year on Mexico's high-yielding government paper.
'The risk is that if Nafta does not pass the peso will break out of the
band,' said Mr Ashwin Vasan, who manages global bond portfolios at
Oppenheimer Management in New York. 'There is a 20 per cent chance this will
happen.'
A devaluation would be a serious blow to President Carlos Salinas's
administration, which has made price stability and a strong currency the
centrepiece of policy.
Mexico's central bank bought government paper in the secondary market
yesterday, pushing up overnight interest rates to 18 per cent from 14 per
cent the day before. The stock market closed up 1.3 per cent, after falling
sharply on Friday and Monday.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Courteous Christopher shows a glint of steel: US secretary
of state forces his deputy out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR WARREN Christopher, the US secretary of state, is a man with the blandest
of demeanours who normally moves with all deliberate speed. Only last week
he was telling angry members of congress critical of his stewardship of
foreign policy that they should not mistake his courtesy for a lack of
resolve.
On Monday night, culminating weeks of deliberation, he acted out of his
public character by forcing the resignation of Mr Clifton Wharton as his
deputy in the state department. Mr Wharton, as his bitter resignation
statement made clear, did not go willingly.
The glib interpretation of Mr Christopher's action, taken with the full, if
reluctant, approval of President Bill Clinton, is that the administration
needed a scapegoat for its foreign policy difficulties.
This hardly holds water, for Mr Wharton, previously a university president
and pension fund manager, was never a key player in the foreign policy team.
Apart from minding the fort while Mr Christopher was away, his main duties
were bureaucratic and not exactly central to the continuing problems in
Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti that have brought the administration so much
grief.
Closer to the truth is the recognition that the 'team' is not functioning
optimally. With the president expressing confidence in its leading lights -
Mr Christopher, Mr Les Aspin, secretary of defence, and Mr Anthony Lake,
national security adviser - changes had to be made lower down.
The relationship between Mr Christopher and Mr Wharton had apparently become
personally difficult, or, as the State Department spokesman put it, 'had
everything to do with his view of the job and the secretary's view of the
job.'
According to this view, Mr Wharton, lacked the diplomatic experience to
become a heavy hitter on the team.
Mr Christopher places great emphasis on team play, both within the State
Department and in its relationships with other key departments. He has
reportedly been concerned that though inter-agency co-operation has not been
bad (Haiti excepted) it had not always succeeded in presenting Mr Clinton
with agreed and coherent policy options.
He also thought access to the president was not what it should be.
Whether a new deputy secretary of state can contribute to improved internal
systems remains to be seen. Much will depend on who gets the job and how
soon a successor can be in place.
Extensive background checks and congressional approval can both take time.
Two prominent victims of these agonisingly slow processes are Mr Stephen
Solarz, former congressman still waiting FBI approval before being nominated
as ambassador to India, and Mr Morton Halperin, targeted by right-wing
Republicans opposed to his defence department appointment.
Still, Washington was buzzing yesterday with likely names for the Wharton
position. Internal candidates, some difficult to move from their present
jobs, include Mr Thomas Pickering, ambassador in Moscow, Mr Strobe Talbott,
ambassador-at-large to the former Soviet states, and Mr Winston Lord,
undersecretary for Asian affairs.
Mr Peter Tarnoff, in charge of political affairs and ranking third in the
department, does not figure on most putative short lists, mostly because he
was rebuked earlier this year for a speech he had given pointing to the
limitations on US foreign involvement.
In the private sector wings, but with clear qualifications, are Mr Michael
Armacost, ambassador to Japan until earlier this year, Mr Don McHenry,
former ambassador at the UN and Ms Rozanne Ridgeway, previously in charge of
European affairs at the state department.
Mr Clinton has emphasised the need for diversity in his appointments.
Of the above only Mr McHenry, who is black, and Ms Ridgeway meet the
criteria, which may, however, be waived in the pursuit of the right
candidate.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Ruling on harassment reaffirmed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Supreme Court yesterday opened the door wider for employees to win
lawsuits alleging sexual harassment at work.
The court reaffirmed its previous ruling that sexual harassment could be
proved by a hostile or abusive work environment, and overturned lower court
decisions which also required an employee to prove severe psychological
injury as a result of the harassment.
In a unanimous decision issued yesterday, the court reinstated a case
brought by Ms Teresa Harris against her employer, Forklift Systems, in
Tennessee.
Ms Harris complained that Mr Charles Hardy, Forklift's president, had
subjected her to sustained verbal harassment, suggesting, for example, that
she retrieve coins from his trouser pockets or go to a motel to negotiate a
rise in pay.
A lower federal court had agreed that Mr Hardy's behaviour was vulgar and
offensive, but said Ms Harris had not shown that her psychological
well-being was seriously affected.
By making it clear that psychological harm was not an indispensable
condition for proving sexual harassment, yesterday's ruling broadens the
possibility for employees to bring harassment suits under a federal law
known as Title VII.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Venezuelan rights undermined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUMAN rights violations have increased in Venezuela since 1989 to such an
extent that they call into question the government's commitment to protect
them, the London-based Amnesty Internat-ional says in a report published
today, writes Stephen Fidler.
Security forces have 'often responded with excessive and arbitrary force' to
demonstrations protesting against worsening economic conditions.
Two military coup attempts last year led to a suspension of certain rights,
including the rights to freedom of expression, assembly and peaceful
demonstration.
Journalists have increasingly been harassed, attacked and even murdered by
the security forces.
Criminal suspects, particularly in poor areas, are routinely tortured. Trial
proceedings are constantly and arbitrarily delayed, often far beyond legal
limits.
Meanwhile, those who violate human rights escape unpunished, the report
says.

FT  10 NOV 93 / CIA knew of BNL loans to Iraq, says ex-banker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Christopher Drogoul, the former Atlanta banker at the centre of America's
arms-to-Iraq scandal, yesterday alleged in congressional testimony that US
government officials, including those working with the Central Intelligence
Agency, were aware of billions of dollars of Iraqi loans he extended on
behalf of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro.
The former BNL Atlanta branch manager, who was brought to Washington
yesterday morning from prison in Atlanta, also named for the first time BNL
executives in Rome who he said knew of and approved his Iraqi dealings.
BNL Rome has denied repeatedly it knew of, or authorised any of, Mr
Drogoul's secret loans to Iraq.
The House banking committee has spent the past three years probing whether
or not the BNL Atlanta loans, which helped finance Baghdad's nuclear and
chemical weapons projects, were part of covert aid to Iraq by the Reagan and
Bush administrations. Yesterday Mr Drogoul claimed the BNL Atlanta branch
'was no more and no less than a tool of the US government.'
Mr Drogoul cited a dinner he attended in Washington with Iraqi and US
government officials weeks before the November 1988 presidential election.
He said he heard the Americans tell the Iraqis to sign up quickly for more
US loan guarantees because 'if Dukakis defeats Bush, the Democrats will cut
you off.'
Mr Drogoul also said that in a 1989 meeting with Iraqi central bank
officials he was told not to worry about his lending 'because we have been
working with the CIA and US intelligence for a number of years'.
Mr Drogoul has agreed to plead guilty to three minor charges instead of
facing a trial that could have earned him life in prison. He said the Rome
office knew his Iraqi lending was maintained off official books and named Mr
Giacomo Pedde, the former BNL director-general, and Mr Angelo Florio, former
head of BNL's foreign division, as having known and approved of his Iraqi
lending. He said he would make documents available shortly, including
letters from US companies to BNL Rome.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Clinton tougher on plutonium production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has stiffened his opposition to the production of
plutonium even for civil purposes, in a move that could pose yet another
challenge to the UK's controversial Thorp nuclear fuel reprocessing plant.
In a letter to members of Congress, Mr Clinton said continued production of
plutonium, even for civil purposes, was 'not justified on either economic or
national security grounds, and its accumulation creates serious
proliferation and security dangers'.
The statement marks a step forward from the Clinton administration's
non-proliferation policy issued in September.
In that document, the White House said only that it would 'seek to eliminate
where possible the accumulation of stockpiles of highly-enriched uranium or
plutonium, and to ensure that where these materials already exist, they are
subject to the highest standards of safety, security and international
accountability'.
Thorp, which has been built in Cumbria by British Nuclear Fuels at a cost of
Pounds 2.8bn, is expected to produce about 60 tons of plutonium over the
next decade if a British government review allows it to start up.
Opponents of the plant have argued that this addition to the already large
global stockpile of plutonium can only increase the risk that weapons-grade
nuclear material might end up in the hands of terrorists or rogue
governments.
Congressman Pete Stark, the California Democrat who has led US opposition to
the start-up of Thorp, said that Mr Clinton's letter sent 'a clear message
that the US does not want this plant to begin operation'.
British officials, however, said they had received no representations from
the US administration about Thorp.
Mr Clinton says in his letter that he has not called for a ban on all
production of fissile nuclear material because this would breach existing US
commitments and could lead to confrontation with Russia and the US's allies.
Congressional aides said, however, that the US's commitments are not to
Thorp itself but to its biggest customers, Japan and Switzerland.
'We have no existing commitment to support Thorp,' a congressional staff
member said.
Mr Clinton says non-proliferation policy is one of his top priorities, but
the administration's position appears still to be evolving as it seeks to
unravel some of the entanglements which have been created in recent years.
The administration must walk a tightrope between curbing the spread of
plutonium or highly-enriched uranium, which could potentially be made into
bombs, while at the same time not imposing such a tight rein that it hampers
other countries' peaceful nuclear programmes, possibly even provoking some
to drop out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is due for
renewal in 1995.
'We have a lot of sympathy for the US's non-proliferation goals, but the US
has to prove itself a reliable partner,' one European official commented.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Refugees total up by 10,000 a day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD refugee numbers increased by 10,000 a day last year, according to a
report published yesterday by Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for
Refugees, Overall refugee numbers have risen from 2.5m in 1970 to 18.2m at
the start of this year.
The report, 'The State of the World's Refugees', says the numbers refer only
to those who have become internationally recognised refugees by crossing an
international border. At least 24m are 'displaced persons', who have fled
their homes but are still within the borders of their own countries. Taking
those into account, 'roughly one in every 130 people on earth has been
forced into flight'.
Increasingly, UNHCR is involved in trying to protect internally displaced
people as well as transnational refugees (operations in northern Iraq and
Bosnia are best known examples). But its concept of prevention, outlined in
the report, goes further. While insisting on refugees' right to asylum
(UNHCR's traditional focus), the report recognises 'the climate of
receptivity for refugees has cooled in many asylum countries'.
The causes of refugee movements must now be addressed, it says, or the
foundations of international protection could be 'overwhelmed, if only by
sheer numbers of claimants'.
UNHCR has adopted a strategy of 'comprehensive response' which, instead of
simply protecting refugees after they have fled, seeks to address all the
problems which cause them to flee, and which make it difficult or impossible
for them to go back. Examples described in the report include the 'plan of
action' for Vietnam, the 'success story' in Cambodia and the 'integrated
approach' in Tajikistan.
This strategy emphasises 'the need to strengthen the state's responsibility
for its own citizens', with human rights 'the link between state
responsibility and the international agenda'. State of the World's Refugees,

FT  10 NOV 93 / Ozawa claims he is misunderstood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN DENYING allegations he accepted illegal donations, Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the
powerbroker who cobbled together Japan's coalition government, yesterday
portrayed himself as the misunderstood reformer, unfairly perceived to be
most comfortable in the murky shadows of the political backroom.
'I am always supposed to be in the backroom. I am said to be hiding behind
the curtain,' said Mr Ozawa, smiling as he deflected allegations that he
regularly received Y5m (Pounds 31,000) from Kajima, the construction company
at the centre of Japan's latest political scandal.
Mr Ozawa admits receiving Y5m last year before defecting from the Liberal
Democratic party but says he did not violate political funding laws that he
wants toughened as part of political reform. But the case has rekindled
public doubts about a politician who thrived in the old system, and is
leading the charge for the new.
'People should not read too much into my actions,' he said. 'I am secretary
general of the Japan Renewal party and I was the LDP secretary general. I
don't have a ministerial position, but I can say what I like in this
position.'
The fresh allegations have distracted attention from the political reform
debate, which Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa fears is veering off course.
Mr Hosokawa has indicated he will resign if four bills containing the
reforms are not passed this year, and the harsh spotlight on Mr Ozawa has
not helped the cause.
LDP officials said yesterday they wanted a 'thorough' debate on the current
batch of scandals and would like to call witnesses from the Ministry of
Construction. Mr Ozawa could also be called to give evidence to parliament.
The LDP's new-found concern about corruption is cited by Mr Ozawa as a sign
that it is trying to find excuses for not agreeing to political reform. He
says 'the contents of their stomachs' do not match LDP officials' public
statements on reform.
'Leaders of the LDP say they are in favour of political reform, but their
real feelings are different. They have 21 complaints but basically these are
technical matters, and I find their opposition quite mysterious,' Mr Ozawa
said.
LDP faction leaders fear the new system of proportional representation and
single seats will undermine the old system of patronage cultivated under
multi-seat constituencies, which encouraged competition and corruption
within the party. But Mr Ozawa says he is confident that younger politicians
will defect from the LDP if reform is brought to a parliamentary vote next
week.
'Political reform will definitely be decided this year. If we want a happy
new year, then we have to conclude negotiations by then,' Mr Ozawa said. If
things don't go according to plan and the LDP is able to block the bills'
passage, then 'we will ask for the judgment of the people,' meaning that
another election will be called.
'Of the LDP's 21 complaints, 80 to 90 per cent could be solved in an hour,'
Mr Ozawa said. There are four 'real problems': redrawing boundaries; the
division of seats between candidates selected through local constituencies
and proportional representation; whether voters should have one or two
votes; and the banning of corporate political donations.
'We are willing to make concessions, so there is no reason not to reach
agreement,' he said, denying that the Social Democratic party, formerly the
Japanese Socialist party, a coalition member, is also opposed to the
reforms. There are a few doubters in the SDP, he suggests, but not enough to
undermine the legislation.
'Having democracy doesn't mean that everyone has to agree,' he said,
referring to the Japanese love of consensus. 'It is a part of democracy to
make a decision. We have been discussing reform for five years, and the time
has come to make a decision.'

FT  10 NOV 93 / Tokyo planners reverse forecast of an upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Economic Planning Agency yesterday said there was little evidence of
an upturn in the economy, reversing its previously optimistic assessment
that the country was 'poised' for recovery.
The agency, responsible for setting Japan's growth targets, has said for six
months that recovery was imminent, but its November report pointed to
falling retail sales and capital spending as signs of continuing economic
weakness.
Agency officials said yesterday housing starts rose 10.6 per cent in
September, compared to a year earlier, but most other sectors are still in
decline, including industrial production, and the economy is 'generally
sluggish'.
The EPA had said earlier this year the economy was 'bottoming', but
indicators have continued to show a weakening of economic activity, which
the agency has blamed on the appreciation of the yen and an unusually wet
summer.
There is concern within the government that the sudden fall in Tokyo stock
prices in the past week will hurt business and consumer confidence, which is
particularly weak. New car registrations in October were 6.8 per cent lower
than a year earlier and slipped 11.7 per cent from September.
An EPA survey found capital investment in the year to the end of March was
likely to fall 9.9 per cent on last fiscal year, as most Japanese companies
are looking to reduce, not expand, production capacity.
Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, said the EPA's gloomier forecast was
not reason enough to consider another stimulative package for the economy.
He said public works spending would rise in coming months and demand for
private housing would remain strong.
EPA officials concede their target of 3.3 per cent growth in the year to
March is well out of reach, though the agency has yet to release a new
estimate. It has described the official estimate as 'a high target to
encourage effort' rather than a reflection of likely growth.

the Korean peninsula as officials warn that time is running out for North
Korea to resolve the nuclear inspection issue.
The meeting, headed by President Kim Young-sam, will analyse military
developments in North Korea, South Korean defence measures, and ways to
resume talks with Pyongyang and possibly break the nuclear issue deadlock.
The conference comes amid reports from the US and Japan that North Korea is
massing forces along its border with South Korea, and a warning from
President Bill Clinton that the US would defend South Korea if it is
attacked.
But the US said on Monday it had not detected any unusual military movements
by the North Koreans, who normally station two-thirds of their army along
the frontier with South Korea.
Seoul is concerned that military tensions will increase over the next few
weeks if the UN Security Council considers imposing economic sanctions on
North Korea for violating nuclear safeguards. The US has said it could refer
the nuclear issue to the UN Security Council 'within days'.

CHINA yesterday called for a new approach to Sino-US relations, describing
next week's summit between the presidents of the two countries as a possible
turning point in the vexed relationship.
Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, said the leaders' gathering at the
Asia-Pacific Co-operation Forum to be held in Seattle from November 19-20
was an opportunity for the two sides to put their relations on a more
businesslike basis.
Presidents Clinton and Jiang Zemin are due to meet on November 19. It will
be the first meeting between leaders of the two countries since before the
Tiananmen Square massacre of June 1989 ended high-level contacts.
Mr Qian's remarks, in which he stressed the need for relations to be placed
in a longer-term perspective, point to China's wish to set nagging problems
over arms proliferation and human rights in the context of the broader
relationship.
Chinese officials believe a preoccupation with human rights is stopping
relations between Beijing and Washington reaching their potential. Officials
have voiced strong objections to the US linking human rights and trade
issues, especially the renewal of China's Most Favoured Trading Nation
status.
But Mr Clinton is certain to make the point forcefully that China must
continue to improve its human rights record to ensure MFN renewal. US
officials, including Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, have stepped
up their warnings to the Chinese that MFN cannot be taken for granted.
The World Bank has estimated that loss of MFN, with its preferential tariffs
and quotas on a whole range of items, would cost China Dollars 7bn-Dollars
15bn (Pounds 4.6bn-Pounds 9.9bn) annually in lost sales to the lucrative US
market.
Mr Clinton said earlier this year when he extended MFN for another 12 months
that a further extension would require 'overall, significant progress by
China' in human rights.
The US also wants improvements in the treatment of prisoners in Chinese
jails. It is seeking 'access to Chinese prisons by international human
rights organisations' such as the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC). China has always opposed inspection of its prisons, claiming this
would constitute 'unwarranted interference'. But Mr Qian indicated a
possible softening.
Steps taken recently by the Clinton administration to improve relations
include the despatch of senior officials to Beijing. Mr Mike Espy,
agriculture secretary, is the first cabinet official to visit there since
the change of administration.

<TEXT>
MR Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation,
yesterday invoked the European Community as a model for securing peace and
stability in the Middle East.
On the second day of his visit to Brussels, Mr Arafat combined an upbeat
assessment of the prospects for peace between Israel and her Arab neighbours
with a fervent plea for financial and economic aid for the occupied
territories, which he said needed more than Dollars 13bn for development and
another Dollars 10bn in foreign investment until the year 2000.
He held talks with the Belgian King and European Commission, and gave a
speech to the foreign affairs committee of the Belgian parliament.
Throughout, he was accorded the status of a head of state.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, made clear that Brussels regards
the newly created Palestine National Authority as a quasi-government in
Jericho and Gaza, the two areas due to win local autonomy under an agreement
with Israel. The PNA would be the European Union's chief interlocutor in the
urgent task of channelling aid, he said.
Mr Delors said European financial aid should be concentrated in three areas:
infrastructure; creation of a Palestinian security force, and emergency food
aid. Long-term plans for creating a zone of stability would have to wait.
Mr Arafat was a model of self-control throughout an hour-long news
conference until asked if the absence of his pistol suggested an effort to
cultivate an image of peace. 'What will convince you if the agreement in
Washington (with Israel) is not enough?' he cried. 'We have made a
breakthrough. We are paying the price of peace with the price of our blood.'
The PLO leader criticised 'extremists on both sides' for prolonging the
Arab-Israel conflict. But he declined to support calls for an early lifting
of the Arab boycott of Israel.

FT  10 NOV 93 / UK faces hard choice on Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   HONG KONG, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN a British cabinet committee overseeing policy on Hong Kong meets this
morning, it will face a choice: to keep talking to China about the colony's
political development in the hope of an agreement, or to go it alone with
Governor Chris Patten's plans for expanded democracy.
In 15 rounds of talks in Beijing over six months, there have been few signs
of progress. But with Mr Patten's oft repeated warning that he will soon
have to start putting electoral arrangements into law in time for elections
next year and in 1995, China has hinted it may be prepared to agree to the
less contentious aspects of his proposals.
An offer to settle on issues such as the voting age and local government
elections has not been formally made. But officials indicated yesterday that
it would probably be enough to prevent Britain from deciding to break off
talks immediately.
However, ministers will demand that the next round of talks, scheduled to
begin in Beijing on November 19, produces concrete evidence from the Chinese
side that it wants to reach an agreement. 'It's essential that China does
something in the next round of talks,' a senior Hong Kong official said.
Before that meeting, Britain will inform the Chinese government of the
outcome of today's deliberations, which will be chaired by Mr John Major,
the prime minister, and attended by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, as
well as Mr Patten.
Officials said China's latest move raises the possibility that some
electoral arrangements could be put into law in Hong Kong while discussions
on the most contentious issues continue in Beijing - though it is not known
whether China would accept this.
This would provide some extra time for negotiations, though Mr Patten has
repeatedly said the electoral plans must be put to legislators soon in order
to be ready in time and that this is a matter of weeks, not months.
Officials in Hong Kong say the talks can only survive beyond the next round
if Beijing can hold out the prospect of a workable deal on the main parts of
Mr Patten's plans for broadening the franchise in 1995 elections to the
60-strong Legislative Council (LegCo), the colony's law-making body.
This means allowing broader voter participation in 30 'functional
constituencies' which represent business and professional groups, and a
democratic structure for an election committee which will elect 10 LegCo
members. Britain is also insisting on a 'through train' - that LegCo members
elected in 1995 would serve through until 1999.
Mr Patten has made clear that he regards avoiding what he calls 'rigged'
elections in the functional constituencies to be of paramount importance.
Officials fear that failure to expand the franchise would provide China with
an easy method of controlling LegCo and that it would lose any semblance of
an independent legislature.
However, China has made equally clear its opposition to such changes. Mr Lu
Ping, director of its Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said: 'We want no
change. That (functional constituencies) was an idea given to us by the
British and we accepted it. We want it to be done exactly as it was done
before.'
For Britain to go it alone - to seek to have electoral arrangements passed
by LegCo without an agreement with China - would be a painful choice. It
would mean ditching the policy of trying to ensure that arrangements survive
the transfer of sovereignty from Britain to China in 1997. China has
threatened to overturn anything Britain does to Hong Kong's political system
which does not have its blessing.
Breaking off talks would also mean Hong Kong's hopes of building its new
airport and developing its container port facilities would be put on hold.
Although Mr Patten's personal popularity is still high, there is little
consensus within the community about the appropriate course of action for
the British cabinet to take. Hong Kong wants more democracy, but it also
wants tranquil relations with Beijing.
Past words and deeds of Chinese officials suggest that they are sensitive to
opinion in Hong Kong as well as to the timetables set out by Mr Patten. Next
week's talks in Beijing could indicate whether they will remain so.

Mr Yassir Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, said
yesterday Jordan and Israel would sign a 'friendly agreement' within the
next few days, Our Foreign Staff writes. Mr Arafat, on a visit to Brussels,
told a news conference: 'Jordan is going to sign, within a few days, a
friendly agreement with Israel.' He gave no further details.
Jordan's prime minister Abdul Salam al-Majali said in Amman, however: 'We
already have our agenda with Israel and a full agreement is a long way off.'
Jordan has consistently denied secret meetings with Israeli officials since
it signed its peace agenda with the Jewish state on 14 September in
Washington.

<TEXT>
JORDAN'S Moslem fundamentalists yesterday retained the largest bloc in
parliament following Monday's multi-party elections but suffered a decline
in the number of seats they hold.
Voters elected 16 candidates to the 80-member parliament from the
fundamentalist party, the Islamic Action Front, (22 in the 1989 elections).
Turnout was 68 per cent of the 1.2m voters who collected their voting cards.
The result is a victory for King Hussein who urged the electorate to show
moderation in choosing their representatives. It vindicates the king's
policy of accommodating Moslem fundamentalists in the political system
rather than excluding them as in Algeria and Egypt. The king said the
elections made Jordan 'an example for others near and far'.
The new parliament, due to convene early next month , consists of mainly
tribal and centrist MPs without party affiliations. It is likely to offer
strong support to the government in all policies including the peace
process, which is rejected by the Islamic Action Front. It will also include
Jordan's first woman parliamentarian, Ms Toujan Faisal, an activist branded
by fundamentalists as an apostate.
The fundamentalists will have less lobbying power in the new parliament, but
the elections were not all bad news for the Islamic Action Front. Its
candidates had particular success in Jordan's main non-tribal urban areas of
Amman and Zarqa, where high unemployment and poverty makes them perfect
breeding grounds for radicalism.
One of the Front's candidates standing in Zarqa, Mr Bassam Emoush, received
the highest number of votes. (9,316). The Islamic Action Front took three of
the four seats designated for Moslems in Zarqa, the biggest of Jordan's 20
voting districts. In Amman's poverty-stricken First and Second Districts,
Islamic candidates dominated the polls.
More surprisingly, in the Third District of Amman, which is home to Jordan's
intelligentsia and bourgeois elite, a popular fundamentalist and member of
the Islamic Action Front, Mr Ibrahim Zeid Kilani, topped the ballot with
9,131 votes, followed by the former prime minister, Mr Taher Masri, who
received 8,789.
Most other parliamentary seats went to independent tribal candidates in
rural areas where a vote for the tribe is more important than a vote for
Islam or any other ideology.
Out of the 15-or-so political parties standing, aside from the Islamic
Action Front, few candidates won seats under party banners. Political
parties were legalised in 1992 after a 35-year ban.
A plethora of parties registered for the elections, but most were
ill-organised, lacked any coherent policies, and failed to be taken
seriously by the voting public.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Yeltsin outlines a new order for his country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'RUSSIA needs order', President Boris Yeltsin told the Russian people in a
television broadcast last night. But he continued: 'Not the terrible,
repressive order of Stalinist camps: Russia urgently needs firm,legal
order.'
The draft constitution, published today, is his attempt to give it that
basis. It is certainly not a Stalinist order (though the Stalinist
constitution on paper was a model of democratic practice), for it is careful
in defining the rights and duties of the levels of government which exist
now or should be elected. But it is certainly firm.
It has been plain for some weeks that this was to be a constitution for a
strong presidential state, with much of the US and French systems about it.
As it turns out, it is stronger than either, largely because the figure of
the president is unambiguously the source of the country's central powers.
The two houses of the federal assembly, or parliament, are limited in
crucial areas by the overriding powers of the president. These allow him:
to be head of state and of the armed forces;
to set the general direction of internal and foreign policy, announced
yearly in a state of the nation address;
to name the prime minister and insist on keeping him even if parliament
objects;
to name the senior military commanders without parliamentary approval, and
name and head the security council, which has a wider range of powers than
purely security.
If his government is challenged by a vote of no confidence against it in
parliament, he can keep it in office for three months and then sack the
parliament rather than the government, if the vote is repeated.
He can veto any law passed by a simple majority in the lower house, and then
require a two-thirds majority for it to be passed. And though he himself can
be impeached for treachery or very serious crimes, these do not include
breaching the constitution - and need, again, a two-thirds vote.
He needs the lower house's approval for appointment of the chairman of the
central bank and the upper house's approval to appoint the chairmen of the
main law courts. But all of these chairmen are then guaranteed independence.
Finally, in a last section dealing with the 'transitional situation', he
absolves himself of his pledge to run for re-election next June by laying
down that he must serve out his term till June 1996.
He also limits the length of the parliament to two years. forcing it to be
re-elected in 1995, and gives ministers the right to be deputies, thus
increasing his government's power in the legislature.
Deputies have the right to initiate and to pass legislation - which can be
vetoed by the president. But they do not, apparently, have the right to
consider, much less block, presidential decrees, which can be issued by the
president and must only conform to the constitution.
Presidential decrees have been the backbone of the new legislation passed
since the abolition of the old parlaiment in September: it seems likely that
the tradition will continue.
Nevertheless, in an evident effort to mark a complete break with the Soviet
past, the constitution is replete with rights, There is no state ideology or
religion; no primacy given to any organisation; and there is a provision for
an ombudsman for human rights, to be elected by the state duma - albeit with
undefined powers.
It is the charter for a strong president - but it is assumed he will also be
a liberal one.

<TEXT>
THE Yugoslav federal government last night devalued the dinar by 98.65 per
cent in an attempt to stop the monetary system collapsing. The new dinar is
pegged at 700,000 to USDollars 1.
But the move was unlikely to shore up the currency as the devaluation fell
short of the recent sharp drop in the dinar on the black market.
Stores in Belgrade yesterday closed after frantic shoppers bought up
whatever remained on the shelves.
Inflation last month was 2,000 per cent. The national mint worked non-stop
printing dinars to cover the cost of the wars in Bosnia and Croatia. Serbia
had also been hard hit by 17 months of UN sanctions and the breakdown of
trade ties.
Meanwhile, efforts to revive the moribund peace process in Bosnia yesterday
failed to stop a surge in violence as a mortar attack on a school in
Sarajevo killed three children and their teacher and wounded at least 20
other children. Three people died in shelling elsewhere in the city.
In Mostar, Croat tanks demolished a famous bridge, built in 1566 and which
embodied the heritage of the southwestern town.
'It was a shot in the heart and soul of every inhabitant of Mostar,' a local
Moslem leader told Bosnian radio.

FT  10 NOV 93 / EU convergence guides Greece's economic path
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON, ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MS VASSO PAPANDREOU, one of the chief standard-bearers of the Greek
Socialist party, said yesterday that 'international competition' left Greece
with no choice but to improve economic convergence with the rest of the
European Union.
She presented the pragmatic and more market-orientated face of Greek
socialism during a visit to London, saying that the new Athens government
would press ahead with a modified version of the hotly disputed
privatisation programme.
However, Ms Papandreou, EC commissioner for social policy between 1989 and
1992, said Greece was very unlikely to meet the Maastricht convergence
criteria for participation in economic and monetary union by 1999.
But, she added: 'We have to converge, with or without Maastricht.'
Although not in the new government of Mr Andreas Papandreou (to whom she is
not related), which took office four weeks ago, she retains strong influence
in the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok).
In the October 10 election, Ms Papandreou, running in Athens, won more votes
than any other candidate for parliament.
But political rivalries prevented the prime minister from offering her a
cabinet post.
In recent weeks, Ms Papandreou - a previous deputy technology minister and
once one of the most radical of Mr Papandreou's followers - has shown more
realism than other senior Socialists about Greece's budget deficit.
The government borrowing requirement is forecast to reach 14.9 per cent of
gross domestic product this year, against a target of 7.9 per cent.
Declaring the priority was to 'stabilise the economy', Ms Papandreou said
yesterday the government would take tough action to curb expenditure and
raise revenues.
Pasok has already abandoned its pre-election pledge of 'no new taxes'. A
revenue package is under discussion in Athens, including price rises for
tobacco and alcohol.
The government is preparing legislation designed to reduce tax evasion,
particularly by businesses and the self-employed. The average Greek doctor,
lawyer and civil engineer declares an income equivalent to that of a primary
school teacher.
The government has formally halted the privatisation programme of the
previous conservative administration. But, above all because of financial
pressures, Ms Papandreou said the state would sell off stakes of 20 per cent
or more in public sector telecommunications and energy companies on the
Athens stock market.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Europe offers Russia trade concessions: EU to present
package to Yeltsin tomorrow after all-night negotiations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Union yesterday agreed to wide-ranging trade concessions to
Russia as part of its drive to secure a new trade and political pact with
Moscow before the parliamentary elections in December.
The package will be presented to President Boris Yeltsin tomorrow at a
one-day meeting in Moscow which Brussels views as a useful show of support
for the forces of democratic reform in Russia.
The Belgian presidency of the European Union, accompanied by Mr Jacques
Delors, president of the European Commission, will attend the summit.
It was agreed after an all-night negotiating session in which member states
were torn between the political goal of backing Mr Yeltsin with the pain of
offering economic concessions which could hurt European industry still
trapped in recession.
After intervention by Sir Leon Brittan, chief trade negotiator, ministers
came down in favour of a compromise.
Sir Leon's new negotiating mandate offers marginal concessions in terms of
improving market access for cheap Russian imports such as steel and
aluminium, but it does modify the use of the draconian weapons which
Brussels can deploy against alleged unfair traders.
Thus, Russia will no longer be labelled a 'state trader' or 'command
economy' such as North Korea or China, but as an 'economy in transition'.
Officials hope this will meet Moscow's demands to be treated more as a
capitalist than a Communist country.
The chief advantage of the new trading status is that Russia would be less
liable to automatic anti-dumping suits. In future, the Commission will have
to prove 'substantial injury' to European producers, and to consult Russia
before imposing levies.
Similarly, the EU has agreed to tighten up on the use of so-called
'safeguard clauses' which can be invoked to protect European industry. Under
the new mandate, Europe must show that Russian goods are both under-priced
and that there has been a significant surge in imports.
A final concession is to offer Russia 1998 as the date when the Union and
Russia will decide on whether to create a common free trade zone. The aim is
to underscore Europe's long-term willingness to lower trade barriers,
despite worries that state subsidies have created artificial prices in
sectors such as energy.
In Moscow, Mr Alexander Shokhin, the Russian deputy prime minister who has
negotiated the agreement with Sir Leon, said yesterday that no substantial
barriers remained between the two sides.
Two of the touchiest issues - on the EU demand to include a standard clause
on human rights, and on the right of foreign creditors to seize Russian
property abroad - were settled only after reference up to President Boris
Yeltsin and Mr Delors, he said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REFORM of Italy's much discredited intelligence services had to be carried
out before the end of the year, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister,
told parliament yesterday.
The tight timetable underscores the government's concern about the damage
being caused by an ever widening scandal over embezzlement of intelligence
funds and a deliberate campaign by members of the intelligence community to
denigrate ministers as well as President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.
The scandal took a new turn yesterday when Mr Alessandro Voci, head of the
domestic intelligence service (Sisde) from August 1991 to July 1992,
resigned as special administrator of the dissolved Rome city council
following allegations of involvement in misusing Sisde funds.
Mr Ciampi proposed last month to merge domestic intelligence (Sisde) with
military intelligence (Sismi) in a single body controlled directly by the
cabinet office and answerable to parliament. But he is handicapped because
the shake-up of so sensitive an area requires a broad political consensus
and was not part of his brief when he agreed to become premier in May.
The reforms risk provoking a controversy with the Christian Democrats who
have controlled the interior ministry - responsible for domestic
intelligence - since 1946. This is the only portfolio to have been held by
one party throughout the post-war era.
Mr Ciampi revealed that funding for the intelligence services had been
L696bn (Pounds 289m) in 1992, of which L359bn was on a secret unaccountable
basis. This year the budget is expected to be L724bn.
Until now, these funds have been spent without any accountability, and more
than 14 former Sisde employees are now accused of having syphoned off money
for their own purposes.
An equally serious allegation being investigated by Rome magistrates is that
part of these secret funds were used to supplement senior officials'
expenses. Two former interior ministers and Mr Nicola Mancino, the current
minister, are due to give evidence to magistrates today on this issue.
A further allegation is that secret funds have been used to pay kidnap
ransoms at politically sensitive moments, although the law formally forbids
such payments.

FT  10 NOV 93 / VW may agree to suspend managers

<TEXT>
SEVERAL top Volkswagen managers may be ordered temporarily to stop work if a
legal compromise between the German automotive group and rival Adam Opel is
approved by the two companies' boards later this week.
Prospects of a deal, which could end one of the legal battles between the
groups, emerged after private negotiations in the back room of a Frankfurt
court yesterday.
An open-court hearing, called to consider an appeal from Opel, the General
Motors subsidiary, that seven former GM group employees should be banned
from working at VW for a year, was adjourned after presiding judge, Mr Heinz
Traub, recommended that the two sides should look for a compromise.
An earlier attempt by Opel to win a temporary banning injunction was turned
down because, the court decided, the seven had been drawn to VW by the
'charisma' of Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, a former GM executive who
defected to VW in March.
Further evidence has since emerged to support Opel's claim that Mr Lopez and
colleagues systematically poached key GM group employees. Volkswagen is
still bound by a separate injunction not to continue this practice.
Under orders from Judge Traub to keep strictly silent or risk endangering
the outcome, neither company would discuss yesterday's deal.
It is believed that three or four of the seven, including Mr Jorge Manuel
Gutierrez, head of VW production and Mr Lopez's closest colleague, may be
suspended if the companies' boards approve before the end of this week - a
deadline set by Mr Traub.
Criminal investigations into suspicions that Mr Lopez, Mr Gutierrez and
colleagues stole secret GM data before leaving for VW, are continuing. A
probe into possible perjury by Mr Lopez is also under way.

<TEXT>
Rome police have uncovered yet more wealth accumulated by Mr Duilio
Poggiolini, the senior health ministry official from whom more than L200bn
(Pounds 83m) in assets has been seized because it is alleged they originated
from bribes, writes Robert Graham in Rome.
The latest haul included some 60 modern paintings and L10bn concealed in a
large living room pouff in one of Mr Poggiolini's Rome apartments.
The find follows the arrest last week of Mr Poggiolini's wife on charges of
assisting her husband in collecting bribes from pharmaceutical companies.
Her arrest also led to a scare that she had been involved in allowing
suspect plasma to be sold. However, the health authorities this week
discounted suggestions that infected plasma had been on sale.
In another development police announced they were stepping up the search for
Mr Oliviero Prunas, deputy chairman of the state-controlled Banca di Roma.
He is wanted for his alleged involvement in the Enimont affair, the
politically sanctioned sale in 1990 at an inflated price of
Ferruzzi-Montedison's stake in its joint chemicals with Eni, the state oil
company.
Mr Prunas is the third banker linked to the Enimont affair which produced
kick-backs totalling L150bn.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Hans van den Broek, the European Community's external political affairs
commissioner, has threatened to resign if he fails to secure concessions in
a long-running power struggle with Sir Leon Brittan, the EC's chief trade
negotiator.
Sir Leon and Mr van den Broek are at loggerheads over who has management
responsibility for the EC's overseas delegations. Mr Van den Broek, a former
Dutch foreign minister, claims he was promised exclusive management rights
over the delegations as part of a delicate power-sharing agreement brokered
by Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, last December.
A senior aide to Mr van den Broek said last night this agreement risked
being reneged on. The aide said Mr van den Broek considered the matter a
point of principle.
Some officials have suggested that Mr van den Broek has sought wider
management responsibilities in a bid to expand his bureaucratic empire.
'He's looking for soldiers,' an official said.
The matter is set to come to a head today at a full meeting of the
Commission in Brussels.
Sir Leon and Mr van den Broek have been battling over division of
responsibilities since they took up their posts 10 months ago. Part of the
problem lies in the decision to split the external affairs portfolio
previously held by Mr Frans Andriessen, the long-serving senior Dutch
commissioner who left Brussels last December.
But Commission officials said Mr van den Broek had become progressively
disenchanted with his present position which includes the ill-defined
responsibility for political relations and the lead role in the enlargement
talks with Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway, which have applied to join
the European Union by January 1 1995.
By contrast, Sir Leon has revelled in his high-profile position as chief
negotiator responsible for negotiating in the Gatt world trade talks because
he enjoys statutory legal powers under the Treaty of Rome, an EC official
said.
The ratification of the Maastricht treaty - which includes provisions for a
common European foreign and security policy - appears to have tipped Mr van
den Broek's hand toward demanding more powers, specifically
co-responsibility for appointing Brussels civil servants in any of the 110
offices overseas. At present, Sir Leon shares the power of patronage with Mr
Manuel Marin, the Spanish commissioner for development aid. However, Sir
Leon enjoys the lead management role since the vast majority of the EC's
offices engage in trade-related work.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community car industry will have to sacrifice jobs, cut working
hours and introduce new training methods and working patterns if it is to
compete with US and Japanese manufacturers, the EC's industry commissioner
said yesterday.
Mr Martin Bangemann told a Turin conference on the future of the EC car
industry that the Commission would encourage training and re-training, and
back technological innovation to help improve the competitiveness of the car
industry.
Mr Bangemann also called for the development of an EC-wide computerised
road-pricing system, which would replace toll-kiosks on main European
highways, and help reduce congestion and pollution. 'We do not abolish
frontiers in Europe just to see ourselves forced to stop every few
kilometres to pay a toll,' he said in his speech, the text of which was
released in Brussels.
The Commission has just submitted to member states a draft of its latest
report on the state of the EC car industry. Industry ministers will discuss
the study at their meeting on November 18 and Commission officials said
yesterday they expected several weeks of fierce political debate about how
the EC should respond to the industry's problems. A final report is likely
to be adopted in early 1994. In his speech yesterday, Mr Bangemann urged the
industry to invest in new plants with the aim of creating a European 'lean
production' system as productive and cost-efficient as the Japanese
equivalent.
But he added that there would also have to be changes to the internal
organisation of companies and to their relationship with outside partners,
component manufacturers and the sales network.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, German economics minister, is in Brussels today to cajole
the EC's industry and competition commissioners into agreeing plans for the
future of Ekostahl, the east German steelmaker.
The Treuhand privatisation agency wants Riva, the private Italian
steelmaker, to buy 60 per cent of Ekostahl, and invest in the construction
of a hot-rolling mill.
But Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, is understood to be
insisting on further cuts in capacity at Ekostahl to offset the addition of
the new mill. Mr Van Miert and Mr Martin Bangemann, who is in charge of
industry policy, are keen to limit state subsidies to publicly owned
steelmakers.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Banker whose wink is as good as his nod
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CENTRAL bankers are supposed to indicate their thoughts by barely
perceptible movements of their eyebrows. With Mr Andrew Crockett - appointed
yesterday as the new general manager of the Bank for International
Settlements, the central bankers' bank, it is the eyelids that are
important.
Mr Crockett, international director at the Bank of England, has the
appearance of a self-effacing though well-dressed don. And he likes to give
a sly wink when communicating economic policy asides to people who are
outside the generally closed circle of international monetary officials.
Mr Crockett, 50, takes over at the Basle-based bank at the beginning of next
year at a time when the future of the 63-year-old bank is clouded, partly by
a number of impending changes at the top of the organisation, and by to what
degree the BIS will shed its somewhat introverted image to take on a bigger
role in influencing international economic policy.
Mr Crockett will also have to carve out a relationship with the new European
Monetary Institute, due to be set up next year in Frankfurt as a precursor
to the proposed EC central bank, where his predecessor, Mr Alexandre
Lamfalussy, will be the new head.
Born in Glasgow, Mr Crockett joined the Bank of England in 1966 after
studying economics at Cambridge and Yale. He did a 17-year stint with the
International Monetary Fund before returning to the Bank in 1989 as
international director - one of the top four positions in Threadneedle
Street after governor and deputy governor. He is the first Briton to head an
important international monetary organisation.
At the IMF, Mr Crockett's most important job was preparing the Fund's
twice-yearly world economic outlook. Here he built up a reputation for
careful analysis. Mr Flemming Larsen, the Fund's assistant research
director, says of Mr Crockett: 'He has an amazing ability to convince people
of points he wants to convey even when they are controversial.'
This skill should come in useful when Mr Crockett takes over the job of
writing the BIS's highly regarded annual review of the world economy which
next comes out in June. In the debate about how Europe will move forward in
monetary integration after the currency crises of the past 18 months, Mr
Crockett has suggested that different countries could try to build economic
convergence by keeping inflation within targets which are set domestically
but are broadly compatible.
Mr Crockett takes over the chairmanship in Paris today of working party
three, a secretive group of central bank and treasury officials which meets
under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development.
As for the future style of the BIS under Mr Crockett, much depends on who is
chosen to replace the three top officials - assistant general manager, Mr
Remi Gros, head of administration, Mr Giampietro Morelli, and chief
economist, Mr Horst Bockelmann - who are due to retire over the next two
years. According to one view, Mr Crockett is likely to start by beefing up
the economics department which, some observers feel, could build on its good
international reputation by specialising more on specific issues such as
banking behaviour and currency flows.

<TEXT>
MR ANDREW Crockett, appointed yesterday as general manager of the Bank for
International Settlements, said the BIS would probably intensify its
research efforts on the problems associated with financial derivative
instruments and on eastern European monetary issues.
Mr Crockett, executive director of the Bank of England with responsibility
for international affairs, expects to succeed Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy on
January 1. Mr Lamfalussy is to become president of the European Monetary
Institute (EMI) in Frankfurt, the precursor of a European central bank.
Speaking at a press conference following the monthly BIS governors' meeting
in Basle, Mr Crockett said he foresaw no diminution of the BIS's activity
once the EMI began to operate.
The BIS operates officially as a central bank for 33 central banks, holding
on average 10 per cent of their reserves. But its significant roles are as a
centre for research on financial trends and issues and as a forum for
central bankers to discuss them.
'I would see the creation of the EMI as an opportunity for the BIS to
refocus its activities on the global context,' he said. He cited commercial
banks' capital adequacy, the very rapid expansion of derivative products and
problems arising from the rapid evolution of payment settlement systems.
'There is no doubt that derivatives is a subject that has attracted a lot of
attention. It would not surprise me if we refocus our activities to devote
more resources to that. My concern is to make sure that the staffing and
analysis and statistical research is adequate for the governors' needs.' Mr
Crockett also signalled a greater effort by the BIS to serve its many
eastern European central bank members. 'I think there is an important role
for the BIS in serving the needs and interests of these countries as they
emerge towards integration with the rest of Europe.'
He acknowledged that many western European central banks could well reduce
their deposits at the BIS as European monetary union progressed.
'Obviously, once European economies reach stage three, they will not have
the same need to hold reserves, some of which they deposit at the BIS. So it
is not unreasonable to expect their deposits with the BIS to diminish.'
Mr Crockett made clear that he fully supported the process of European
monetary union. 'I have been associated in the past four-and-a-half years
with a lot of activity, including Maastricht.
'I am very committed myself to the work that has gone on in Europe.
'I believe in the process of monetary integration, but of course, that has
to take place in a realistic context and taking account of the realities,'
Mr Crockett said.

BLOOD products from a second German company have been recalled from 64
hospitals because of suspicions that the products may contain the HIV virus,
as Germany's largest medical scandal widens.
Haemoplas, a company based in Lower Saxony, is suspected by local
authorities of failing regularly to test its blood products for HIV, the
virus which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (Aids).
All hospitals and medical centres in the country using the products have
been ordered to send them back to local authorities.
Meanwhile, the state prosecutor's office in Koblenz said it had found two
HIV-infected blood samples among the 2,000 tested so far from UB Plasma, the
company that caused nationwide panic after it revealed it had not properly
tested its blood products for HIV.
The prosecutor's office said it needed to check up to 20,000 blood products
from UB Plasma, a process which could continue well into next year.
The revelations have caused tens of thousands of worried Germans to
telephone local hospitals and medical centres to ask for advice or seek an
Aids test.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Draft constitution gives Yeltsin supreme powers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S draft constitution, published last night, establishes the president
as the supreme authority in the country and guarantees, for the first time,
the right to own and sell land.
The draft, which will be put to a national referendum on December 12, also
establishes the central bank as independent of all levels of state power.
President Boris Yeltsin, in a television address last night, said the
constitution was designed to lay down a 'firm, legal order' for a democratic
state.
It marked a break with the Soviet past and with the period of 'dual power'
between presidency and parliament which ended with the banning of parliament
in September.
The draft establishes the president as the supreme authority in the country,
giving him the right to override the decisions of the two-chamber
parliament, issue decrees and be impeached only after a lengthy process of
voting and reference to the courts.
The president also proposes candidates for the chairman of the central bank,
all key judges and the prosecutor general.
It establishes all 89 'subjects of the federation' - the republics, regions,
districts and two main cities (Moscow and St Petersburg) - as equal in their
rights and subject to the laws and decisions of the federal authorities.
It sets out civil and social rights for all citizens of the federation,
enshrining in law rights to belief, travel and assembly. 'The right of
private property is secured by the state,' it says.
In a final section on the 'transitional situation', it lays down that the
president must serve his full term until June 1996 - thus cancelling Mr
Yeltsin's promise to stand for election in June - a decision that he
announced at the weekend and which has attracted fierce criticism.
The draft constitution will be enshrined in law if 50 per cent of those
voting in the referendum support it.
The constitution has already attracted criticism from the liberal end of the
political spectrum. Mr Garry Kasparov, the world chess champion and a
candidate of the pro-Yeltsin group Choice of Russia, said: 'It is obviously
temporary, it cannot serve the country in the longer term.'
In a front-page editorial in Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Mr Valery Tretyakov, the
Moscow daily's editor, said the constitution would be approved in the
referendum but that 'it is a constitution for presidents in general and for
President Yeltsin in particular'.
Mr Yeltsin, in a pre-emptive move yesterday against the attempt by the
Sverdlovsk region to upgrade itself to the status of the Urals Republic,
cancelled the region's declaration of republican status - only to have the
regional leader, Mr Eduard Rossel, proclaim he would stand for election as
governor of the republic, also on December 12.
The Central Electoral Commission also urged the leadership of the North
Caucasian republic of Chechnya to take part in the elections.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Peace talks at risk, warns Molyneaux
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Major-Reynolds Northern Ireland peace initiative could collapse because
of the Irish government's apparent willingness to negotiate an IRA
ceasefire, Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist party leader, said
yesterday.
Mr Molyneaux's warning followed a meeting with Mr John Major, the prime
minister, at which he confirmed that the UUP was willing to keep the door
open to a further round of talks.
However, it further complicates the peace process, which has shown signs of
stalling in recent days because of growing tension between London and Dublin
on the ceasefire issue.
The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, also
tried to block the talks yesterday by declaring he would 'never' negotiate
with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. After a separate meeting with
Mr Major, he said he had told the prime minister not to waste his time
listening to 'the blarney and the lying from Dublin'. He said Mr Major had
told him that if the Anglo-Irish initiative failed, the government would
reconsider DUP proposals for an internal settlement based on power-sharing
devolution.
Mr Paisley's continued hostility to the Anglo-Irish initiative is a
disappointment to the government, which had hoped that public pressure for
peace would moderate the DUP approach.
However, Mr Molyneaux's growing suspicion of Dublin's motives is potentially
a far more serious blow to the peace process because of the UUP's much
greater support among Ulster protestants. Mr Reynolds appeared to be
'drifting away' from the terms of his joint statement with Mr Major in
Brussels two weeks ago. 'The position which has been put forward by Mr
Reynolds is causing such unease that it may in fact block sensible progress
within Northern Ireland,' he said.
The Irish prime minister's focus on an early cessation of violence had
caused 'a great deal of unease, confusion and instability in Northern
Ireland'. Mr Reynolds was 'at least contemplating some kind of link up with
the Hume-Adams talks, which can only mean an unacceptable series of
concessions to terrorists'.
A survey in today's Guardian shows that 59 per cent of 1,400 people polled
in mainland Britain believe the IRA or Sinn Fein should be allowed to take
part in peace talks.
Some 44 per cent thought their participation should be conditional on ending
the campaign of violence, while 15 per cent believed they should
automatically be involved.

FT  10 NOV 93 / Mirror in move to end rift with press watchdog
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DEAL that could end the crisis over the Princess of Wales pictures and
pave the way for Mirror Group Newspapers to return to the Press Complaints
Commission appeared to be taking shape last night.
Lawyers acting for MGN met commission officials as senior figures in the
newspaper industry tried to prevent the breakdown of press self-regulation
and the imposition of statutory controls.
Mr David Montgomery, chief executive of MGN, has made it clear he will enter
into negotiations on returning to the regulatory body if Lord McGregor of
Durris, commission chairman, withdraws remarks criticising the Daily Mirror
and advocating a readers' and advertisers' boycott.
Three MGN titles quit the press watchdog on Monday after Mr Montgomery
accused Lord McGregor of exceeding his powers and behaving unfairly. MGN is
angry that Lord McGregor appears to have prejudged any possible complaints
on the Mirror's use of pictures of the Princess exercising at a gym.
It is believed that senior figures such as Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of
News Corporation, and Sir David English, chairman of Associated Newspapers,
have given informal undertakings that attacks on the Daily Mirror by their
publications will cease.
Last night a spokesman for the Mirror said other newspapers had promised to
end the 'dog eat dog' criticism of its use of the pictures. In today's
edition an editorial says the 'abusive campaign' had pilloried the paper
before any hearing.
Lawyers for the Princess of Wales yesterday issued two writs, against MGN
and the L A Fitness Club, where the unauthorised pictures were taken. The
writs made it clear the Princess wanted the illicit pictures and negatives.
Mr Montgomery was advised by at least one senior newspaper executive that
MGN should apologise to the Princess and make a payment to charity.
MGN has received undertakings that controversial remarks by the press
watchdog will not be repeated. Lawyers Theodore Goddard wrote to Lord
McGregor arguing that 'it is not, as I am sure you will accept, the role of
the commission and its chairman to call for penalties to be imposed on a
newspaper in circumstances where no proper or indeed any inquiry has been
made into the case'. The lawyers added that Lord McGregor had exceeded his
powers in urging a boycott.
The regulatory body will meet today as planned, but will not discuss the
pictures because the matter is 'sub-judice', Lord McGregor said last night.

FT  10 NOV 93 / DTI plans reform of insolvency procedures: Companies may win
extra protection from creditors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES in financial difficulties would be able to gain powerful
protection from creditors trying to recover their money, under proposals
issued by the government yesterday.
They would be able to gain a 'breathing space' of 28 days, renewable for up
to three months, while they tried to put together proposals acceptable to
creditors representing at least 75 per cent of the company's debts.
Banks - which generally take priority over other creditors - would also be
bound by this moratorium and would be required to give seven days' notice to
companies of their intention to appoint receivers, under the suggestions
circulated by the Department of Trade and Industry.
The moves, in the report of a working party set up in November last year to
consider changes to insolvency law, represent a modest shift towards the
principles of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in the US.
Mr Neil Hamilton, minister for corporate affairs at the DTI, said: 'The
proposals aim to create workable and affordable rescue procedures. We need
to ensure these are fully utilised whenever a lifeline can be thrown to a
company in danger of sinking.'
The DTI report covers proposed reforms to company voluntary arrangements
(CVAs) and administration orders, which were introduced in the 1986
Insolvency Act but are acknowledged to have failed to live up to
expectations. In the past three years, there have been just 296 CVAs and 447
administrations, but more than 66,000 liquidations.
The recommendations met with widespread initial support. Mr Richard Brown,
deputy director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: 'It
certainly seems as if the DTI is aware of the problems faced by companies.'
The DTI's proposals suggest company voluntary arrangements should be subject
to relatively low-level monitoring by a supervisor, who should be in a
regulated profession but need not tbe an insolvency practitioner.
They say the company should possibly have access to new lenders to help
restructuring who would have priority over existing creditors. Shareholders
would lose the right to approve CVAs.
The document also suggests changes to administration procedures which would
allow a professional adviser to be appointed for 28 days without having to
report to the DTI on the conduct of directors. An appendix even suggests
that in an administration all debt should be converted into equity, while
preserving the rights of priority creditors.
Banks and other creditors with debts secured against assets would lose some
power under the proposals. But the British Bankers' Association said it
'would give a cautious welcome if companies can be restructured to continue
to pay their debts'.
Mr Colin Bird, a partner with accountants Price Waterhouse and chairman of
the technical committee of the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency, said:
'The DTI has made a very good attempt at understanding the issues.'

FT  10 NOV 93 / Director sentenced to five years
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A company director was yesterday sentenced to five years in prison for his
part in a Pounds 2.1m tax fraud through 'phoenix' companies, in what is
believed to be the most severe custodial penalty yet imposed for contrived
liquidations.
The prosecution follows recent calls by the Confederation of British
Industry for a reform of insolvency legislation to prevent 'reckless'
directors from leaving behind a 'trail of debt' while continuing to trade in
phoenix companies - businesses which fold only to rise again, often under a
slightly different name in the hands of the same directors and management.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Australia (5): Seat-belt warning is on - Airlines
are experiencing turbulent conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURBULENCE has been a world-wide feature of the airline industry since the
start of the 1990s. Australia's aviation sector has been no exception -
although some of the bumps been peculiar to the region.
First, on the domestic front, there has been the fall-out from deregulation.
Liberalisation of the Australian airline industry took effect in October
1990, when route licensing restrictions and pricing constraints were removed
for internal flights. Almost immediately, the two existing domestic carriers
 -Ansett and Australian - confronted a new competitor in the shape of
Compass, a start-up airline. Domestic air fares fell dramatically; cuts of
as much as 70 per cent occurred on some routes, although the official
estimate for the reduction in 'average fares' stood at around 30 per cent.
Compass, however, was a short-lived incarnation. It failed first in December
1991, when lessors repossessed its aircraft, only to be reborn under new
management in August 1992. Compass Mark Two died in March this year, when
the receivers were called in, and the airline wound up.
Three years on, then, deregulation has scarcely delivered what its
proponents hoped for - and, with other fledgling airlines failing to take to
the skies, recriminations surfaced in the wake of Compass' collapses. On one
side, management was accused of negligence. On the other, there were
allegations that government had reneged on a promise to protect new
entrants; that domestic facilities were too congested to accommodate
competitors; that more government-sponsored travel needed to be directed
towards new carriers, and so on.
In the short-term, the net result of this messy experiment has been to
recreate a duopoly situation - against a background of fairly weak, and
extremely price-sensitive, demand for air transport.
According to the Department of Transport, domestic revenue passenger
kilometres rose by 28.5 per cent between 1990 and 1991 when fares were
tumbling, and then by just 3.24 per cent in 1992.
Air fares, meanwhile, have increased - but only modestly. The Price
Surveillance Authority calculates an increase of about seven per cent,
during the June quarter which followed the second Compass collapse. 'Fares
are still about five per cent lower than in the same period last year, and
23 per cent down in real terms on the pre-deregulation levels of September
1990,' says its chairman, Mr David Cousins.
Airline executives support this sluggish picture. 'Traffic is slow-growing
and people only respond to very low pricing,' comments Rodger Robertson,
director of corporate planning at Qantas.
But in spite of deregulation's failure to generate new domestic carriers,
matters have not returned to the pre-1990 status quo. Last year, the
government made a new attempt to 'revolutionise' the sector. This time, it
talked of creating a common aviation market in Australia and New Zealand,
while effectively doing away with the long-established divide between
international routes, serviced by Qantas, and domestic routes, handled by
Australian and Ansett.
After some angst, the revised policy paved the way for government's sale of
Australian to Qantas, and the beginnings of a privatisation process for the
merged entity.
Evidence of this tie-up is now clearly visible to any traveller: Qantas food
has been appearing on internal flights for some months, for example, and the
Australian name vanished from ticket counters and the like this month. On
the privatisation front, meanwhile, British Airways came in as a 25 per cent
shareholder in February, buying its stake for ADollars 665m.
But the Qantas-Australian flight plan has not been trouble-free.
Integration, notoriously difficult in the airline industry, has been slower
and more costly than some had hoped. Qantas, although reporting a slim
ADollars 32.9m profit after financing charges, took a ADollars 446.4m hit
for costs and write-offs related to the merger in the year to end-June.
Moreover, in August this year, John Ward, Qantas' veteran chief executive
quit - and was replaced by James Strong, a Qantas director and former chief
executive of Australian, who formally took up the reins this month. Finally,
the next stage in the privatisation process, originally due to take place
this autumn, has been delayed until the 1994-5 financial year.
Meanwhile, over at Ansett, the first international flight took off in
September, to Bali, and the airline - owned jointly by TNT, the transport
group, and Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation - has also accumulated
rights to other parts of south-east Asia. Ansett, it should be noted, is not
be the only new recipient of international route authorities. The
International Air Services Commission has a clear policy of favouring new
entrants in the international arena and that, in turn, has meant route
awards for the likes of National Airlines, on the freight side, and for
Australia-Air International, a untried passenger carrier.
But on the trans-Tasman front, matters are largely in abeyance.
Synchronising operating procedures, such as customs and immigration, between
Australia and New Zealand has proved no simple task, and government
negotiations are continuing. In the meantime, Ansett has decided against
flying trans-Tasman routes at this stage. It will review its position when
it gains access to more city pairs in November, and has a better grasp of
the operational details of the single market.
To an extent, the consolidation seems to be improving profitability. Ansett,
for example, managed to deliver a ADollars 59.5m operating profit in the
year to end-June, compared with a ADollars 91.2m loss last time round,
although there was still a bottom-line deficit. Qantas also traded
profitably in the first quarter of 1993-4, compared with a loss in the same
period a year ago.
Nevertheless, all the upheavals have produced additional capital
requirements, in an industry which has already been drained by
fare-discounting, at home and abroad, and by recessionary conditions. Both
TNT and News Corporation have made clear that they would like to bring a new
partner in at Ansett at some stage.
Finally, there is the issue of foreign competition and bilateral
relationships. On the one hand, some recent retrenchment - for example, by
Houston-based Continental Airlines and Germany's Lufthansa - may ease
conditions for remaining players. But two other large US carriers, United
and Northwest, have had furious spats with the Australian authorities this
year, over frequencies and traffic restrictions on Japan-Sydney portions of
their US-Australia route authorities. Such rumpuses are a clear reminder of
everyone's determination to claw out the maximum possible profit, in a
generally depressed industry sector.

THE EXPANSION in university student numbers has been fuelled by extra women
taking places to read arts courses, statistics published yesterday show.
'Old' universities - which excludes those that have gained university status
in the past two years - expanded by 33 per cent in the four years to
1992-93.
Women made up 47 per cent of full-time undergraduates compared with 41 per
cent 10 years earlier. But only 22 per cent of academic staff were women (14
per cent a decade earlier).

FT  09 NOV 93 / Further fall in inflation rate of goods leaving factories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RATE of inflation for goods leaving factories fell for the second
consecutive month in October, indicating that price pressures in the economy
remain subdued as manufacturers hold down prices.
Output prices rose 0.2 per cent in October to stand 4 per cent up on a year
ago. This compares with 4.2 per cent in September and 4.3 per cent in
August, and prompted some economists to suggest that producer output
inflation has passed its peak.
But the underlying measure rose for the sixth successive month. This index,
which excludes volatile prices of food, drink, tobacco and petrol, rose 3.2
per cent in the 12 months to October, compared with 3 per cent in the 12
months to September. It has risen every month since April, when the annual
rate was 2.2 per cent.
The Central Statistical Office said the seasonally adjusted rise in the
underlying index in the latest three months was equivalent to an annual rate
of increase of 3.6 per cent.
There was a sharp fall in input-price inflation. Prices of industry's raw
materials and fuel rose 0.9 per cent in the 12 months to October compared
with 3.8 per cent in September. The steep fall was mainly due to the
year-on-year comparison.

protest

<TEXT>
THE Confederation Generale du Travail, France's communist-led trade union
group, said yesterday that it planned to hold a day of action on November 18
to protest against the planned merger between Renault and Volvo.
The union, the largest at Renault, described the merger as 'packaging, which
is being used to achieve a privatisation opposed by the workforce'. It
called for a demonstration in Paris and a stoppage by Renault workers.
The statement by the CGT coincides with opposition to the merger from some
Volvo shareholders. They are demanding clarification of the French
government's plans to privatise the merged group and oppose the retention of
a golden share by the French government after privatisation. Their demands
forced Volvo to postpone until next month a vote on the merger proposal.
Mr Daniel Sanchez, the CGT's representative at Renault, said the fears of
the Volvo investors were justified. Unlike Swedish shareholders, however,
which want a firm commitment to privatise the group, the CGT is opposed to
the sale of the French government's stake.

CANADA'S two national rail systems plan a merger or track-sharing agreement
for east of the Manitoba border as soon as the first quarter of 1994.
Canadian National and Canadian Pacific, reacting to domestic rate
competition and pressures to reduce their unit costs to US levels, have
already begun small-scale track sharing and plan to close down or sell
unprofitable lines in the east.
They are also modernising their links between Ontario and the US.
Mr William Stinson, chairman of Canadian Pacific, said in Toronto he was
confident the government would approve the broad rationalisation they are
planning.
Future ownership and management of the system in eastern Canada has yet to
be decided, he said, but added: 'But I don't see any room for government
ownership in the rail business longer-term.'

THE RUSSIAN government has awarded Gama Industry of Turkey a Dollars 17m
contract for the first phase of repairs to the White House in Moscow, the
parliamentary building blasted by tanks and gunfire during the anti-Yeltsin
rebellion a month ago.
Gama started work on the building within days of the rebellion ending on
October 4 but it only recently secured a contract.
'We started work with only a verbal agreement. There was no time to talk
about price and money, they wanted the work done quickly so we went ahead,'
Mr Ergil Ersu, Gama's managing director, said. 'It was in front of the whole
world's eyes, so we had to go ahead and trust our client.'
About 200 Gama construction workers were already in Russia working on other
projects.
Within a week, a further 500 had been flown from Turkey along with equipment
and tools. The company is repairing damage to the low-level section of the
White House.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND is set on maintaining good relations with the International Monetary
Fund with a view to achieving further reductions in its Dollars 47.2bn
foreign debt, Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the head of the new centre-left
government, said yesterday.
His statement to parliament commits the government to following stringent
monetary policies acceptable to the IMF, which is unlikely to agree to any
appreciable increase in next year's budget deficit over this year's target
of 5 per cent of GDP. Mr Pawlak said policies would aim 'at reducing
inflation'.
The coalition government, elected on September 19 and formed out of the
post-communist Left Democratic Alliance (SLD) and Mr Pawlak's Polish Peasant
party (PSL), needs the IMF's approval for a 20 per cent reduction in the
Dollars 30.6bn debt owed to the Paris Club of western government creditors.
This was promised in 1991 as part of a 50 per cent debt reduction package
agreed on condition that Poland remained in favour with the IMF. The
commitment led Mr Pawlak yesterday to announce a markedly
lower-than-expected pensions increase next year, in spite of previous
demands from the government's own trade union supporters for rises.
At the same time Mr Pawlak told the western banks grouped in the London
Club, who are owed Dollars 12.3bn by Poland, that the new government would
continue, like its predecessors, to look for a reduction 'comparable' to the
Paris Club agreement.
This is being resisted by the banks.

BULGARIA'S economy could tip towards hyper-inflation unless the government
makes urgent spending cuts and introduces structural reform, a key minister
was quoted as saying yesterday, Reuter reports from Sofia.
The finance minister, Mr Stoyan Alexandrov, issued a warning to his fellow
politicians after data showed that the budget deficit had exceeded its
annual limit two months before the end of the year. 'If we do not take real
measures in the real economy the worst could happen,' Mr Alexandrov told the
weekly newspaper, 168 Hours. He was expected to repeat the message in a
report to the cabinet, proposing wage and recruitment freezes in the state
sector and strict social spending limits to hold down inflation.
'The reality is alarming and the prospects even more so. The tragedy is that
we do not have any money,' Mr Alexandrov told the paper. 'We are on the
verge of hyper-inflation and that could come even in the next few weeks.'

FT  09 NOV 93 / French workshare scheme progresses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French Senate yesterday approved a conditional form of state aid to
reward companies which agree to cut the working hours of existing employees
in order to reduce the country's lengthening dole queues.
The Senate amendment to a new five-year employment bill must return to the
national assembly, which rebuffed a not dissimilar plan last month. Since
then, however, the government has swung behind the workshare scheme, making
full parliamentary approval likely.
Worksharing as a palliative to unemployment is increasingly in vogue, both
in the EC Commission where it is expected to figure in the white paper on
jobs, and in France, where unemployment reached 11.8 per cent in September
and is forecast to hit 12 per cent by the year's end.
Support has been growing among centrist French politicians for a fairer
share-out of work than the present division, in which the 11.8 per cent of
the potential workforce has no work at all, while the remaining 91.2 per
cent are nominally fully employed for 39 hours a week.
Free-market liberals in the government's parliamentary majority oppose
worksharing as merely adding to business costs.
The plan would reduce welfare charges for companies which reduce working
hours by at least 15 per cent, and hire at least 10 per cent more workers.
The companies would pay 40 per cent less in welfare charges for new
employees in the first year of the scheme, and 30 per cent less in the
second and third years.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Slide in markets on hold as dealers await US figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SLIDE in financial markets last week was put on hold yesterday, as
dealers awaited the next set of important US economic data today, but
however the underlying tone remained nervous.
US Treasury bonds again appeared weak yesterday, but most other bond and
stock market prices were little changed, prompting speculation that US
market domination over economic fundamentals in other markets may be
weakening.
Dealers remained concerned, however, that today's US producer prices data
for October could trigger a further sell-off.
Last week, signs of an acceleration of economic growth in the US prompted a
bout of profit-taking in the US and European bond markets, as the end of a
record year for many investors approaches. The bond market weakness also fed
through into the world's stock markets.
The US long bond lost further ground yesterday morning but the US stock
market shrugged off the downward trend in bond prices, as cyclical stocks
helped push indices modestly higher.
By midday, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/8 at 100 1/16 ,
yielding 6.23 per cent. The short end of the market, however, was moving
ahead, with the two-year note up  1/32 at 99 15/16 , to 4.14 per cent. At
1pm, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 8.66 higher at 3,652.09.
Attention was largely directed at today's report on wholesale prices and
tomorrow's data on retail prices. Both sets of data are expected to
reinforce fears that inflationary pressures in the US economy are building.
European bond markets were mostly little changed, though the UK gilts market
managed a  1/4 point rally, on the back of encouraging inflation data.
The FT-SE 100 index ended 8 points down at 3,077.6, while Germany's Dax
index fell 1.75 points to 2,010.8 and France's CAC-40 index rose 3.78 points
to 2,084.79.
Stock market analysts fear that a reassessment of investment strategies by
US fund managers could cause a reversal of the heavy flow of funds into the
European stock market this year. Trading was light, as many investors and
traders chose to stay on the sidelines until a clear direction has been
established.

FT  09 NOV 93 / RAF condemns Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEAD of the Royal Air Force last night made an extraordinary verbal
attack against what he claimed was a campaign to discredit the armed
services prior to public expenditure cuts.
The outspoken declaration by Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon, chief of
the air staff, reflected bitter resentment in the armed forces at the
prospect of a further expenditure squeeze.
Sir Michael appeared to point the finger at Mr Michael Portillo, chief
secretary to the Treasury, who is a leading government critic of
inefficiencies in the forces.
Breaking the normal rule of discretion for service chiefs Sir Michael
complained that a 'disreputable' campaign had been conducted to discredit
the RAF as well as the other services.
'We know who has instigated it,' he said in a speech to the Air League in
London. He blamed the campaign on 'the same people who basked in the
reflected glory of the Gulf war'. In particular he objected to 'silly and
dishonest' comparisons that had been drawn between the number of senior
staff in the RAF and those in the Israeli air force.
Every air force appeared to have more personnel for each combat aircraft
than Israel, which had in effect been at war since the 1950s, he said.
'I say to those detractors: stop undermining the services,' Sir Michael
said.
The RAF, which is already reducing its personnel to well below the 75,000
level foreseen in the 1990 Options for Change review, now faces significant
further cuts, particularly in its support branches.
Government public-spending plans, due to be announced in the Budget on
November 30, include a reduction of about Pounds 1bn in defence spending
over three years. The largest reduction will come in 1996-97 and it implies
similar reductions over the remainder of the 15-year period of the Ministry
of Defence's long-term planning cycle.
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Conservative chairman of the Commons defence committee,
last night joined the row with a strong defence of Sir Michael, Philip
Stephens writes. Sir Nicholas, speaking on BBC television, accused the
Treasury of 'deliberate and misleading leaks' in its determination to force
through defence cuts.
He said the leaks, almost certainly from senior Treasury civil servants, had
probably been sanctioned by ministers. Sir Nicholas, who has threatened a
Tory backbench rebellion if spending cuts bite too deeply into the defence
budget, said he wanted Treasury officials to appear before his committee to
answer the charges.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US increased pressure on Japan yesterday to bring down its trade
surplus, urging Tokyo to cut income taxes substantially so that consumers
have more money to spend on imports, Reuter reports from Washington.
Administration officials repeatedly hammered Japan for failing to do more to
spur growth and open its markets to imports. Nearly half of the annual US
trade deficit is with Japan.
'I am concerned that Japanese growth appears to be slowing and Japanese
demand for foreign products is increasing less rapidly than had been hoped,'
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bensten said in a statement.
US officials pin hopes on reform of Japan's tax system. A Japanese advisory
panel is expected to issue a report on tax reform in mid-November.
Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman told a Senate finance sub-committee:
'Strong fiscal action through a stimulative tax programme could be the key
to reviving growth.'

FT  09 NOV 93 / Beijing to back sweeping reforms

CHINA'S TOP policy-making body, the Communist party Central Committee, will
meet this week to endorse sweeping reforms of taxation, banking and trade.
Chinese officials are describing this plenary session as the most important
since the history-making Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of 1978
at which the reform drive was launched.
Confirmation that the Central Committee would convene on Thursday came in an
article in a Beijing-affiliated Hong Kong newspaper, Wen Wei Po, which
forecast Chinese leaders would 'take important and breakthrough reform
measures'.
This latest Central Committee session coincides with an intense debate
within the leadership over steps to cool an overheating economy which is
expected to grow by about 13 per cent this year, the same as last year.
The session is certain to feature spirited discussion between those
advocating continued stern measures to combat inflation, and others wanting
more liberal credit policies to save faltering state industries further
hardship.
Taiwan yesterday refused to concede its right to prosecute suspected
hijackers from mainland China, despite pressure from Beijing to send
hijackers immediately back for trial under mainland Chinese law, Dennis
Engbarth reports from Taipei.
A Zhejiang Airlines Airbus 300 turboprop airliner was hijacked to Taiwan
yesterday, the second act of air piracy in less than three days and the
sixth this year.
Paradoxically, the two latest hijackings took place as talks were under way
in Xiamen between nominally unofficial representatives from Taiwan and China
which are aimed at resolving a series of disputes.

FT  09 NOV 93 / US foreign policy official resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Clifton Wharton last night said he was resigning as deputy secretary of
state, the first change in the US foreign policy team since President Bill
Clinton took office.
Mr Wharton, a former university president and head of the largest
educational pension fund, held extensive weekend talks with Mr Warren
Christopher, the secretary of state. Announcing his decision last night, Mr
Wharton said in a written statement: 'In the past two weeks it became
unmistakeably clear that I was being subjected to the classic Washington
practice of sustained anonymous leaks to the media.'
The son of the first black American ever to attain ambassadorial rank, Mr
Wharton was mostly engaged in administrative affairs, including the
reorganisation of US foreign aid programmes.
But with the administration's conduct of foreign policy under fire on
several fronts, Mr Christopher has reportedly been pressing for a stronger
team, with elevation of an articulate and possibly experienced diplomat to
serve as deputy believed on his agenda.
The foreign policy triumvirate of Mr Christopher, Mr Anthony Lake, national
security adviser, and Mr Les Aspin, defence secretary, have all been subject
to direct criticism. The secretary of state himself, according to the New
York Times, has even suggested recruiting someone along the lines of Mr
David Gergen, counsellor to the president, to ensure foreign policy
dissemination is co-ordinated properly.
Several internal candidates exist. They include Mr Thomas Pickering,
currently ambassador to Russia, Mr Strobe Talbott, who has proved
particularly effective as ambassador-at-large for the former Soviet states,
and Mr Winston Lord, the mandarin now serving as undersecretary for Asian
affairs. Outsiders from the extensive Washington foreign policy
establishment also cannot be excluded.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Swedish museum suffers Dollars 60m art theft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPORTANT paintings and sculptures by Picasso and Braque were stolen from
the Museum of Modern Art in Stockholm on Sunday night in Sweden's biggest
art theft. The museum's curator, Mr Bjorn Springfeldt, valued the works at
more than Dollars 60m (Pounds 40m) but they are so well known that they
could never appear again on the open market.
The thieves climbed through a hole in the roof, without setting off security
alarms. The eight works taken were the most important in the museum, and
included versions of some of Picasso's greatest images, including 'La
Source' of 1921, and 'La Demoiselle' (1929). A bronze sculpture of 1941,
'Femme Boisgeloup', was also stolen. The two paintings by Braque were 'Le
Chateau de La Roche-Guyon' of 1909 and 'La Nappe Blanche', painted in 1928.
Old Master paintings, including a Vermeer, were taken in 1990 from the
Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston in the greatest art theft of
recent years. They have never resurfaced.

<TEXT>
MOSLEM forces yesterday fired two shells on a Croat-held munitions factory
in Vitez, central Bosnia, as Croat officials warned the attacks could prompt
'a catastrophe'.
Faced with a string of Moslem victories, the Croat authorities said the
latest Moslem offensive would cause 'a horrific explosion and an
unprecedented catastrophe for the wider area of Bosnia-Hercegovina'.
It was said to be the first direct hit on the vital munitions factory in
Vitez, the headquarters of British United Nations soldiers, and follows the
fall last week of Vares, 25 miles to the east, to the Moslem government's
forces.
The Croatian Defense Council (HVO), the Bosnian Croat army, admitted in a
statement it had joined forces with the Bosnian Serbs, their former enemies,
to surround the Nordic UN battalion near Vares on Sunday.
The two-hour encirclement helped the Croats retake several villages, which
the HVO statement cited as proof of UN support for Moslem forces, Belgrade
radio reported.
In Sarajevo, UN soldiers yesterday escorted the first of 1,500 Serbs, Croats
and Moslems to be evacuated from the besieged Bosnian capital as part of an
agreement postponed for nearly one year.
Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the UN envoy, is due to meet Mr Alija Izetbegovic,
the Bosnian president, in Sarajevo today to consider possible steps to
revive the peace talks.
Meanwhile, Sarajevo radio said Serb forces pounded the Moslem enclave of
Gorazde, a UN-designated 'safe area' in south-eastern Bosnia.

US data
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The slide in financial markets last week was largely checked yesterday as
dealers awaited the next set of important US economic data today, but the
underlying tone remained nervous. In London, the FT-SE 100 index ended eight
points down at 3,077.6, while Germany's DAX index fell 1.75 to 2,010.8 and
France's CAC-40 index rose 3.78 to 2,084.79. In the US, Treasury bonds again
appeared weak, but most other US bond and stock market prices were little
changed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 4.47 higher at 3,647.9. In
Tokyo the Nikkei average rose marginally on bargain hunting, closing higher
for the first time in five trading days at 18,625.16, up 34.7 points. World

FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Australia (10): The picture is rather cloudy -
Satellite television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMILIA TAGAZA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of Australia's subscription television remains murky as the
government desperately tries to clear the mess created by its bungled
bidding process for the licences for satellite-delivered services.
In April this year, the government awarded the rights to two licences to
industry dark horses. Bidding was strictly on a highest-price basis, and the
two newcomers defeated the race favourite, the powerful consortium led by
Rupert Murdoch, the media baron, Kerry Packer, and Telecom.
The winning bidders were UCOM Pty, which offered ADollars 177m (Dollars
120m), and Hi Vision, which tendered ADollars 212m (Dollars 144m).
Australia's subscription television policy allows for three
satellite-delivered services. The two licences are for four-channel
operations. The third licence has been reserved for the national Australian
Broadcasting Corporation.
The media industry gasped at the very high prices offered by the winners.
Speculation had the rich Murdoch-Packer consortium and the US Continental
Cable group offering less than ADollars 100m each. The government, on the
other hand, immediately realised the folly of its decision and that it had
been out-foxed by two industry upstarts.
The two winners had put up unrealistic and purely speculative bids to
guarantee that they got the winning spots. They have also put in cascading
bids so that they remained in the game as the licences were re-awarded to
the 'next highest bidders'.
To contain its embarrassment, the government quickly revised the bidding
rules. It required the next highest bidders to pay a non-refundable five per
cent deposit within three days of winning. The patch-up job was obviously
amateur and calls for the head of Senator Bob Collins, the communications
minister, grew louder. Only the intervention of the prime minister, Mr Paul
Keating, saved the day for the beleaguered minister.
As expected, the two winners failed to produce the cash for their original
bids. Bidding cascaded and in August, after six rounds of failed bids from
the same parties, UCOM paid a five per cent deposit on a price of ADollars
97m for the first licence, ADollars 80m less than its original tender. A
company associated with UCOM, New World Telecommunications, also paid a
deposit for Hi Vision's bid of ADollars 117m, ADollars 95m less than the
original figure.
The deposits should have provided some relief to the government. However,
they have raised yet another problem, that of media cross-ownership. The
Trade Practices Commission, the competition watchdog, is now examining
whether UCOM, having paid for HI-Vision's deposit, has breached competition
laws. Under the government's subscription television policy, a company that
holds one licence is allowed to have no more than two per cent interest in
the company holding the other licence.
Mr Albert Hadid, the controlling shareholder of the UCOM group, said that
UCOM's cross-ownership of the two licences would be within the law. He
promised that Australia's first subscription television would start
operating by July next year. Mr Hadid has the financial backing of the
Lenfest group, a small Pennsylvania-based cable TV operator.
Meanwhile, the Murdoch-Packer-Telecom group has abandoned all interest in
satellite-delivered services. It is now putting up plans for an alternative
cable network for limited residential markets.
The government had previously put all its weight behind satellite
subscription television. It has argued that cable and microwave-delivered
services would not provide a national coverage. But with the satellite
service merely crawling into reality, the government seems prepared to
review the merits of other methods of delivering subscription television.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (19): Small hotels can often fit
the bill - Gillian Upton looks at the alternative to staying at the big
chains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN UPTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME world-weary business travellers appear to be deserting the big,
impersonal hotel chains for smaller, cosier counterparts that offer more
personalised service.
In the main, the companies with huge volumes of business are staying loyal
to the big, international hotel chains because of their preferential rates
(small hotels generally do not offer corporate rates), and ease of booking
through one-number reservations for worldwide coverage.
But for frequent independent travellers, those with an eye on costs or with
a smaller travel budget and therefore less buying muscle, these small hotels
fit the bill. Your custom would represent a substantial portion of business
for a 50-room hotel and therefore you would be a name and not a number in
such an establishment.
Rates hover in the Pounds 120 to Pounds 130 price bracket a night, compared
with a larger hotel charging around Pounds 200 a night; no small saving over
a couple of nights' stay. While corporate rates are not always openly
disclosed, some small hotels offer 'special arrangements' on volume of bed
nights. That enables individuals or companies to trade down in a
surreptitious way, as it will be seen as 'moving across' more than anything.
Such 'boutique' or 'townhouse' hotels, as they are sometimes known, have up
until now been exclusively found in Europe but the concept is spreading much
farther afield now.
Central London boasts more than a dozen such estabishments, all claiming to
offer the recognition, service levels and ambience in a 50-room-or-less
property that is often lacking in hotels with over 250 guest bedrooms.
One experienced traveller's comment: 'It's home from home' sums up the
general reaction to these smaller hotels. They are proving particularly
attractive to women business travellers, who feel more comfortable in
smaller establishments, many of which are managed by women.
Of course, these smaller hotels may lack an enormous lobby, a business
centre, health club and the choice of half a dozen food and beverage
outlets, but personal service makes up for many of the so-called
shortcomings.
London's oldest, small hotel is probably the Capital, its 1970s facade in
Basil Street, Knightsbridge, giving no clue to its more tasteful interior.
It has only 48 rooms, a bar and restaurant, and a thoroughly good concierge.
It is one of the more expensive small hotels; single rooms start from Pounds
184.
Much cheaper is the Egerton House (singles from Pounds 110 plus VAT) in
Egerton Terrace, Knightsbridge, which offers 30 bedrooms. While there is no
bar (only a breakfast room), guests can serve themselves from a drinks
cabinet.
Smaller still is the Fenja with just 14 rooms (no restaurant) in Cadogan
Gardens, Knightsbridge, and with rooms costing from Pounds 130. No bar,
again, but each room is stocked with decanters of spirits together with
mixers and soft drinks.
Still in Knightsbridge, rates at the 28-roomed Beaufort (Beaufort Gardens)
start at Pounds 115. There is no restaurant but a 24-hour self-service bar
adjacent to the drawing room.
Lack of a restaurant at 22 Jermyn Street (comprising 13 suites and five
studios) has been overcome by the nearby restaurant, Green's, offering
dinner in your room from its elaborate menu. The hotel does, however, serve
breakfast and has a 24-hour room service menu. Rooms start from Pounds 145.
Outside London, there are also some good small hotels. The 40-bed Old
Parsonage in Oxford, Etrop Grange in Manchester, 42 The Calls in Leeds and 1
Devonshire Gardens in Glasgow all come to mind.
Across the Channel, Brussels has had its own boutique hotel, the Stanhope,
for two years. Some 50 rooms have been shaped from a terrace of three period
houses on the western side of the EC capital and decorated like an English
country house, with much trompe-l'oeil and swathes of fabric in evidence.
The hotel has two boardrooms and fax machines are available on request.
Rates are from BFr9,500 for a single.
Similar in style is the Montgomery. Breakfast is the only regular meal
served but room service is available around the clock, in guest bedrooms or
in the library. Each bedroom comes equipped with a fax machine. Rates from
BFr9,000.
A townhouse-style property has turned up in Singapore in stark contrast to
the modern glass and steel skyscraper hotels for which the island state is
known. The Duxton is a 50-room hotel built from eight trading houses and
located near the Tanjong Pagar metro. There is no business centre, pool or
garden, but a French restaurant, bar, pavement cafe, secretarial services
and airport car transfer make up for them. Standard rooms start at SDollars
230 and are bookable through TRI Hotel Marketing.
Mr Colin Rainbow, commercial director of pan-European travel agency chain
Wagons-lits, says that such hotels will 'inevitably give you a more personal
service. It's a big difference from being number 42 in line at the Hilton in
New York with 18 check-in desks.'
Nonetheless, industry observers believe the townhouse hotel sector in the UK
has grown 300 per cent over the past three years, albeit from a very small
base. 'The hotel market is being redivided and the big hotels are finding it
difficult,' claims Mr Nigel Massey, managing director of the Massey
Partnership, a marketing and public relations agency which specialises in
small, privately-owned hotels.
'The Franklin ran at 84 per cent occupancy in its first year, the Old
Parsonage at 75 per cent,' says Mr Massey. 'They represent a return to
traditional hotelkeeping, where bookers can talk to the owner of the hotel.'
The big chains do have their own, smaller 'hotel within hotel' in the shape
of their executive floors, with separate entrance, check-in, lounge,
complimentary breakfast and canapes. These go some way to redress the
balance between large and small hotels.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (20): Maxims that should be obeyed
 -Traveller's Tale / David Munns talks to Michael Skapinker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR David Munns has visited Japan three times this year and Australia twice.
He has been to Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Nashville, Miami and New York. He
has just spent seven days in Spain, Holland and France.
Mr Munns, in charge of the marketing of pop music at PolyGram International,
the London-based recording company, estimates he spends between 30 and 40
per cent of his time travelling.
He has only had one frightening flight, when the aeroplane could not land in
Nashville because of a storm. He has never been mugged. He has lost his
luggage only once.
He puts not being mugged down to common sense. He learns his way round the
cities he visits and he never walks down dark alleys.
Losing his luggage was the result of disobeying two of his travel maxims.
The first is to reduce the stress of travelling by always using the same
airline - British Airways in his case. When he lost his luggage, he was
flying to Bali with Garuda, the Indonesian state airline.
His second rule, broken on that occasion, is to travel with hand luggage
only. Mr Munns reckons he can live out of a carry-on bag for 10 days.
Another means of reducing stress is always to use the same car firm to take
him to Heathrow's Terminal Four. The drivers know him and his routine. The
firm is near his home and the cars do not get lost in the traffic.
Somewhat inconsistently, he does not like having a driver meet him when he
arrives at his destination. Looking out for a sign with his name on it is
irritating, he says. He prefers to hop in a taxi, except in Tokyo, where the
airport is too far from the city centre. There, he uses a driver.
He tries not to work on aeroplanes, or at least not the sort of work one
does with pen, paper or laptop computer. 'I will take something along if
I've got to do it, but I don't store up things to take along,' he says.
Instead, he does work of the more relaxing sort. As a senior executive of a
recording company which has ambitions in the film business, he watches the
in-flight movie and listens to music on his Walkman.
He eats a full meal before he gets on a flight. He does not like to wait,
stomach rumbling, for the airline meal to arrive.
He flies first class on long flights and if he is travelling overnight.
Otherwise, he goes business class. He flies from London to New York business
class because it is a day-time flight. He flies back to London first class
because it is a night flight and he can get some sleep.
Jet lag worries him less than it used to, but he has not entirely conquered
it. Nevertheless, he likes to start working the moment he arrives, rather
than giving himself time to recover.
He tries to visit cities when one of PolyGram's artists is performing there.
He stays in the same hotel as the performer. He is thinking about making
greater use of video conferencing, but in the music business there is no
real substitute for watching artists perform live and talking to them
face-to-face, he says.

FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (18): Agents can lead to travel
savings - Jim Kelly finds that companies are starting to take a more
professional attitude to costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIM KELLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS TRAVEL, after buildings and salaries, now ranks as the third
largest cost facing most companies. In continental Europe it accounts for
4.8 per cent of costs, while in the UK it takes a solid 6 per cent.
The need to cut those costs in a recession, combined with the necessity of
competing in an increasingly global economy, has led many com- panies to
seek the services of a professional business travel agent.
The business travel and expense management industry, or T&amp;E as it has become
known, has responded through the concept of 'partnership' with its clients.
Annual European expenditure for the industry is now estimated at Dollars
141bn.
The shape of the T&amp;E market in Europe illustrates the pressures which have
made most large companies decide that they need some form of outside help in
cutting travel management costs.
American Express, one of the principal players, recently published a survey
of T&amp;E in Europe based on phone interviews with 15,000 companies and 3,500
personal interviews. Companies were chosen from a range of sectors and had
to have 10 employees who regularly travelled on business. The results
illustrate a volatile and competitive marketplace. The survey concluded:
'Europe now ranks as the foremost business travel market in the world.'
In Europe companies spend an average Dollars 1,500 per employee on travel.
Nearly two-thirds of all companies have a written travel policy. One in five
companies has recently switched travel agent, prompted by better prices
elsewhere or poor service.
Though 38 per cent did have a 'travel manager', the job was largely left to
office secretaries. Nearly three-quarters had an appointed travel agent. In
France, Germany and the UK the level of satisfaction with T&amp;E was seen to be
dropping.
While most companies expressed the traditional needs from T&amp;E, of securing a
comfortable reliable service, there was a growing interest in maximising
travel rebates and reducing expenditure - especially in France and the UK.
'In general, the 1993 report reveals an increasingly professional attitude
to the management of business travel and related expenses within European
companies, together with a more intensive pursuit of value for money in the
whole area of T&amp;E,' says American Express.
Within the UK nearly 70 per cent of companies have recently taken
initiatives to control T&amp;E spending: one in 10 had an 'inplant' desk of the
travel agent on the premises. Three-quarters have at least one appointed
travel agent. However, the report notes that: 'It is still normal for
individual travellers or their secretaries to make the travel arrangements.'
The T&amp;E business appears to be growing again, at least in the UK. A recent
survey by the University of Surrey and Thomas Cook Travel Management showed
that overall spend was set to increase, while downgrading continues,
resulting in more travellers in the air.
Many medium to large companies now believe business travel agents can
deliver savings, cut bureaucracy, and help mould an efficient travel policy
from within the company.
But how to choose one? If you have a large business it is best to invite
bids after deciding exactly what you want them to deliver. Today in T&amp;E the
agent can offer services ranging from getting your aircraft tickets to
pledging to cut your costs from inside the business.
Where to start? The Guild of Business Travel Agents provides a
'good-housekeeping' seal of approval and has 37 members with a combined
turnover of Pounds 3.86bn - about 60 per cent of which is in T&amp;E and the
rest in leisure. The Guild of European Business Travel Agents is expanding
and members have a combined turnover of Dollars 10.6bn.
Both guilds produce profile booklets. Membership in the UK ranges from the
big multiple travel agents with specialist skills in T&amp;E, such as Thomas
Cook and Hogg Robinson, to the major independents, including Ayscough Travel
and Gray Dawes Travel. The guild's members account for 75 per cent of
business house air traffic booked through agents.
Mr David Reynolds, secretary of the GBTA, says that many more smaller
companies are now realising the benefits of T&amp;E: 'They don't want to get
stuck in a queue behind someone who can't make up his or her mind about a
holiday in Majorca.' He also sees an emphasis on professional
qualifications: guild members now have 800 staff with City and Guild
qualifications and 50 managers. Next year an MBA in T&amp;E will be offered at
Brighton University.
An example from the independent sector and one of the big multiples shows
how far T&amp;E has come in edging closer to the decision-making core of many
companies.
Mr David Whittaker, joint chairman and managing director of The Travel
Company, a T&amp;E specialist, and a director of Talking Point, a subsidiary
specialising in conference and incentive events, is proud of the corporate
'partnership' which has been struck with SmithKline Beecham.
For three months after the T&amp;E deal was signed, there were daily meetings
with the clients. The Travel Company has 30 dedicated staff with SmithKline
Beecham. The present spend on T&amp;E through The Travel Company is Pounds 15m a
year. The company boasts state-of-the-art technology and offers software
which can allocate rebates and basic money savings to individual management
groups within the company - a powerful tool for driving incentive-based
efficiency.
'It works like a dream,' says Mr Whittaker.
Thomas Cook, one of the leading multiples with specialist skills in travel
management, claims it was the first agency to take the partnership principle
seriously. It has over 40 travel management centres in the UK and more than
80 implanted locations in companies.
Rank Xerox is one company served by Thomas Cook Travel Management. It
records a total air fares saving since employing TCTM of Pounds 4m for
UK-based staff. Booking errors fell by 2 per cent.
Thomas Cook says that partnership cuts both internal and external costs,
improves quality, improves strategic advantage and generates growth for both
parties. Services are also tailored for smaller companies. Mr Bill Kirkwood,
director of sales and marketing, says: 'Thomas Cook Travel Management has
signed Pounds 30m worth of new business from the smaller market over the
last year.
'Our price guarantee, Fair Fares, was one of the key factors in gaining this
level of interest.'

FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Business Travel (17): Seamless service will cut
waiting - Janina Stachura looks at trends in the car rental market

IT MIGHT not be exactly a bargain basement sale, but for the cost-conscious
business customer looking for a good car rental deal there is everything to
play for in a fiercely competitive industry.
This is a sector in which it probably costs less to hire a car than it does
to rent a dinner suit for the evening. It is dominated in the UK business
arena by six big league players - Avis, Europcar Inter-rent, Hertz, Budget
and Eurodollar.
The big boys have not shown to be wanting in an industry which has not
avoided the bruising effects of recession as companies looking to cut costs
have limited business travel.
For the big corporate customer hiring a luxury Mercedes to the one-man band
business person on a tight budget, all that is required is a little shopping
around.
Broadly speaking, the business car rental market is divided into domestic
and international with three segments - the independent business traveller,
small businesses and corporate customers - and special deals can be
negotiated within each to suit individual requirements.
Mr Neil Summerville, Budget's vice-president of franchise operations, says:
'In general, we have done our selling to most of the major business users.
They have a pre-arranged deal before they get to the desk.
'Independent business users can benefit from our all-inclusive programme -
there is something for them as well - even though they don't have the buying
power of some big companies.'
Rates cover more than rental. Additions offer anything from unlimited
mileage and loss damage waiver to 24-hour cover by a motoring organisation
in case of breakdown.
Avis has a customer travel magazine with information varying from a guide to
the dashboard of the particular car that you are driving to city and route
maps.
Hertz has an 'en route' service for some customers which includes driving
directions, medical and legal help, regional tourist information and even
weather and traffic conditions.
Mr Stephen Jones, Hertz UK marketing director, says that the recession has
served artificially to depress prices. 'Consequently we don't have a lot of
scope in pricing terms and are seeking to be competitive in service terms,
offering value-added services which are different from other companies.
He says there has been a move toward what he describes as the integrated
service concept with combined packages involving car rental companies,
airlines and hoteliers.
Alliances have been forged with airlines to offer a wide variety of services
in addition to car rental to customers.
Hertz UK, for example, has teamed up with British Airways to offer customers
services ranging from the opportunity to get a free flight by collecting
airmiles to their very own BA check-in counter at Hertz in Heathrow Airport.
Avis has partnerships with more than a dozen airlines, including British
Midland and Virgin Atlantic, to offer customers 'that little bit extra'.
They can earn points towards airmiles, win an African safari or try a spot
of ballooning.
Mr Dale Morley, Avis UK director of sales and marketing, says links with
airlines' loyalty programmes provide a range of benefits for passengers and
have proved successful in the US.
Avis has close ties with British Midland and Virgin. 'Across Europe there
has been an increase in penetration of customers quoting loyalty programmes
when they rent with us,' says Mr Morley.
'For the business traveller who has to make the journey anyway, it is
attractive to find that he or she can earn airmiles not only from the
airline but also from the car rental company and an affiliated hotel.'
New technology has meant you can arrive at a location, see your name on an
indicator board and just pick up your car without even having to see a piece
of paper, let alone sign one.
This seamless service has been made possible by specialist systems which are
seen by some industry watchers to be the key to future success in the
marketplace.
Avis has invested as much as Dollars 1bn in a system whose heart is in the
US. Known as Wizard, it has integrated reservation, rental and billing
systems in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Europe.
Mr Morley says: 'Nobody wants to wait for a car very long; the business
renter wants to get into the car and drive away. The last thing he wants is
to wait at a car rental counter. As an all-service provider we have to
acknowledge this.'
He sees new technology and the ability to turn it into service benefits and
seamless service as the way ahead for the industry.
