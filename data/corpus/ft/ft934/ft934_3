FT  23 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For once the news from Lasmo is not entirely bad. It has managed to sell a
chunk of its Liverpool Bay assets to PowerGen for what appears to be a full
price in today's depressed oil market. Since it will also have to spend
Pounds 56m less developing the field, the deal will cut its gearing by a
useful 15 percentage points or so. That will reduce the constraints on its
balance sheet as development spending rises to its peak in 1995. Lasmo can
live more easily with low oil prices between now and then. And while its
Markham field interest remains for sale, the company will be under less
pressure to accept a fire-sale price.
Yet the market's indifference to the announcement - its shares rose just 1p
to 114p - is a reflection of the fact that selling off such valuable assets
is a mixed blessing. PowerGen is matching the 25 per cent premium for the
dollar value of the reserves which it paid to Monument Resources for a
smaller stake last month. It evidently recognises the worth of Liverpool
Bay.
Lasmo's future share of this lucrative project will be smaller and it is
also sacrificing existing cash flow from the Ravenspurn field amounting to
some Pounds 18m. Nothing in yesterday's announcement changes the basic fact
that Lasmo's large debts make it more highly geared to the oil price than
most of its peers. The more a weak oil price prompts divestments now, the
less it will earn later.

FT  23 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Awash with cash
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Worries about weak institutional cash flow this year look, in retrospect, to
have been thoroughly misplaced. Overseas investors have proved enthusiastic
buyers of UK bonds and equities, while domestic institutions have been
surprisingly flush with cash. Yesterday's figures show cash flowing into
institutional coffers at a rate of Pounds 14bn a quarter. The total net
inflow for the year looks likely to exceed Pounds 50bn, against consensus
forecasts of around Pounds 30bn.
The difference is accounted for by stronger than expected sales of
single-premium savings products by life insurance companies and a stampede
into unit trusts. Savers escaping the dwindling returns on cash are the
cause. If interest rates fall again in 1994, sales of equity savings
products might gather further momentum at the expense of bank and building
society deposits. With pension funds also enjoying stronger inflows, as
company contribution holidays come to an end, institutional liquidity could
be on an upward trend.
Third quarter figures suggest institutions themselves may have been taken
aback by the appetite of retail investors. Around Pounds 4bn short-term
assets were accumulated over the summer, around half of that amount by life
insurance companies, while purchases of gilts and equities actually
declined. Some institutions may have been deliberately building cash
reserves to move into property. The more likely explanation is that strong
inflows and rising markets caught them flat-footed. The build-up of cash in
the summer may then have fuelled the bull market of the fourth quarter.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Cazenove partner tipped to head Stock Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The joint senior partner of Cazenove and Company, one of London's most
discreet and successful stockbroking firms, is the leading candidate to
become the next chairman of the Stock Exchange.
Mr John Kemp-Welch, a member of the exchange's board, has been approached by
other board members to fill the post. It is likely to be vacated next year
by Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, who has been chairman since 1988.
'He is clearly the front runner,' said a board member. 'He has indicated
that he is interested, though a formal decision has not been taken either by
him or us.'
Mr Kemp-Welch, who yesterday refused to comment, is due to retire as joint
senior partner of Cazenove on April 30.
Cazenove adopted a unique strategy among leading securities firms when the
stock market was deregulated in 1986 by remaining an independent
partnership. It never publishes financial results, but it is believed to
have been more consistently profitable than any other London securities
firm.
It has about 200 publicly quoted UK companies as clients, including an
unrivalled number of the UK's biggest companies.
Mr Kemp-Welch, 57, who was educated at Winchester, has a reputation for
being tough and single-minded. His father, Mr Peter Kemp-Welch, was also
senior partner of Cazenove.
A member of White's Club in London's St James's, he lists his recreations as
'shooting, farming, cricketing, the hills of Perthshire'.
A board member said that Mr Kemp-Welch was unlikely to commit himself to
taking the post until nearer the time of his departure from Cazenove. He
also pointed out that Sir Andrew had not decided exactly when he wished to
stand down. 'Andrew wants to go in his own time. He wants to make it
abundantly clear that his departure is unconnected to the Taurus debacle,'
the board member said.
Last spring, the exchange cancelled its Taurus project to computerise its
share settlement and registration processes, at a cost to itself and its
member firms of several hundred million pounds. Mr Peter Rawlins, the Stock
Exchange chief executive, took responsibility and resigned.

FT  23 DEC 93 / The folly and the lively: Clay Harris rates this year's
corporate greetings cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Slime does not spring to mind as the most tasteful object to feature on a
corporate Christmas card, but UK biotechnology company Xenova has carried it
off. Its photograph of a mould growing on a decaying log in a South American
rain forest illustrates one source of its drugs in development.
Xenova's card succeeds because it passes three tests of effective corporate
communication in the festive season: it is imaginative, visually attractive,
and it says something special about the sender.
Each bad card, however, as Tolstoy might have said on opening his holiday
post, is unhappy in its own way.
Let us first award the annual blasphemy prize. The winner shows three wise
men being greeted at Skipton Building Society with: 'You've heard about our
Royal Sovereign then, have you?' There is obviously no holiday from
promoting this savings product.
Jollity at the expense of suffering also strikes a false note. Royston
Investments, a futures fund manager, urges recipients to 'start 1994 with a
billion' and encloses a 1bn dinar note from Yugoslavia.
And Ofwat, the water industry regulator, cosily pictures itself as Santa
Claus, addressing the halo-ed companies in its charge: 'Have you all been
good boys and girls?'
Anthropomorphic cartoon animals are another bete noire. Reindeer tend to
suffer the most, nowhere more than on the card from Nomura International's
corporate communications department in London, which has the poor creatures
playing golf. The crowning insult is Nomura's logo visible through the
cut-out cup.
Other victims of logophilia include Norwich &amp; Peterborough Building Society
and Everest double glazing.
There is an emerging, and deplorable, tendency towards adorning cards with
drawings by children, sometimes the progeny of an employee, sometimes the
winner of a school contest. Most of these efforts belong nowhere more public
than fridge doors of doting parents.
Some genres are so hardy that they will survive any amount of scorn. Certain
public relations consultants, venture capitalists and stockbrokers feel
obliged to send their own group pictures or caricatures in 'humorous'
situations. There is nothing to do but groan.
Leeds Development Corporation has the naffest card. 'We'll give you
something to toast this Christmas,' it says on an early 1960s-style photo of
the hands of two businessmen holding brandy glasses in front of an open
fire.
And the British National Space Centre is rather heavy-handed with its view
of the earth orbited by the words Observation, Communication and Science.
But scientists, in general, had a good year. Three organisations plumped for
colourful abstract images of their daily work. The Agricultural and Food
Research Council shows gene sequence analysis for detecting pathogens in
food, the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory features an image of an ice crystal
in the nuclear physics lab, and the European Space Agency gives an
'impression' of background radiation in the earth's environment.
All these are no more than pretty pictures using bright artificial colours.
They have little scientific relevance, but they identify the sender's
business and they're eye-catching and that is enough.
To some eyes the Financial Times's own card succeeded on the same terms. A
reproduction of the FT's 1951 card, it features a variant of the 'Walking
Newspaper' designed by Abram Games. Just old enough to have a retro look, it
also served to commemorate the paper's centenary on pink paper. Some in the
office debating society, however, felt it was too commercial.
Even that criticism could not be made of a striking black-and-white panorama
of the sledging masses on London's Primrose Hill, which was sent both by the
Barnfather public relations agency and the London Clearing House, a provider
of settlement services.
The best religious/traditional card this year is an angel of peace from a
1480 altarpiece, sent by the PR firm Cardew, which flooded the City with
cherubim in 1992.
But for secularists, the winner is a stark photograph of frozen leaves from
North West Water.
In these politically correct days, senders cannot be too careful. BMW's card
in the US shows a couple cruising along in a convertible with New Jersey
plates, an image that smacks of smug nouveaux riches, the unintentional
equivalent of an Essex joke. The humorously challenged are already crying:
'Hey, that's Joisey-ist]'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What kind of company can spend eight months looking for a new chief
executive only to decide it doesn't need one after all?
Judging by the 5 per cent jump in merchant banker Kleinwort Benson's share
price yesterday, the stock market has fallen for its odd excuse that it
didn't want to risk breaking up a 'winning team' by bringing in an outsider.
Instead, the job of managing a business of 2,800 people is going to be done
by a new 'senior management structure' consisting of an executive chairman,
a deputy chairman, two vice-chairmen, two joint chief executives of
investment banking and the chief executive of investment management.
The press release contains no mention of the finance director, operations
director and the directors in charge of banking and the balance sheet.
Nevertheless, Lord Rockley, the new chairman, assures Observer that they
will continue to play a key role.
The failure to find a chief executive wouldn't matter so much if Kleinwort
had done its shareholders proud. But since Big Bang, its shares have
underperformed the market by 40 per cent while Schroders' and Warburgs' have
outperformed handsomely.
It would be nice to think that Kleinwort's management might be subject to
the same sort of awkward questioning as any other business in a similar
state.

You are female and prefer to turn up to your workplace clad in Doc Marten
boots, shorts and T-shirt, with an earring through your nose. Who will
employ you? Well, the Bank of England for one. Which all goes to prove what
a sexist institution it is.
That at least is the opinion of Peter James, a clerk in the dividends
department of the Bank's Gloucester outpost, who feels sufficiently
aggrieved to take his case to an industrial tribunal. He is supposed to wear
a suit, while the distaff side is merely required to look neat and
businesslike.
But he got no sympathy from chief registrar Derek Bridger. 'I think women
can look neat and businesslike in probably a wider variety of garments than
(can) men.'
No stuffed shirt, he.

Despite his departure as US defence secretary, Les Aspin's finger is still
hovering over the button. Which diplomatic plum will he collect as his
consolation prize?
According to the semi-official word from chief of staff Mack McLarty, Aspin
can choose between the US embassies in Beijing or Moscow. Theoretically,
Beijing's incumbent, Stapleton Roy, would then be free to take over the
vacant job of deputy secretary of state. On the other hand, if Aspin fancies
Moscow, that would release Tom Pickering, the senior career diplomat, to be
number two in Foggy Bottom.
However, Aspen may not have the field to himself. The name of Vernon Jordan,
the civil rights lawyer, golfing pal of the president and all round fixer is
being discreetly mentioned - his presence on the presidential flight to
Moscow next month could be significant.

Eat your heart out Dominic Lawson. The editor of the Spectator, the
bumptious English weekly that claims a circulation of around 48,000 copies,
could be forgiven for going green about the gills. Its near name-sake, the
American Spectator, is enjoying much greater influence.
A far right Washington-based monthly, it was started by editor Bob Tyrrell
in 1967 as The Alternative, an off-campus rag out of Indiana University. But
it has no connection with the English paper, least of all in the circulation
stakes, where the readership has exploded from 30,000 to 201,000 in the past
20 months.
The secret seems to have been some sizzling investigative pieces - on Anita
Hill, David Koresh, the Clintons' tax returns, and now, in the January
issue, on the First Couple's sex life. The right-wing foundations that back
the (still loss-making) outfit may be pleased, but aren't the lawyers
getting nervous? Observer glanced at the masthead to discover that it avails
itself of the no doubt more than able legal counsel of Solitary, Poor,

FT  23 DEC 93 / An intruder scares the Old Lady: The growth of the secondary
debt market in London has split the financial community
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the many indignities suffered by Mickey Mouse since he moved to the
loss-making EuroDisneyland theme park near Paris, the most galling is this:
people doubt the colour of Mickey's money. The FFr20.3bn of Euro Disney bank
debt is being quoted at discounts of up to 70 per cent on the newest capital
market in London.
Euro Disney is the latest company to have its debt quoted in the secondary
loan market, which has sprung up over the past two years. In this market,
banks trade debt in troubled companies at a discount to investment funds -
often based in the US - which buy it cheaply, hoping it will rise in value
if there is a corporate restructuring.
The market is small as yet. An estimated Dollars 1bn was traded in London in
1992, and Dollars 2bn this year, compared with UK industrial and commercial
debt of Pounds 245bn. Yet the implications of banks selling debt are
profound. 'The effect on the City will be as great as Big Bang was for the
equity markets,' says Mr Robert Tyrwhitt-Drake, who heads Bankers Trust's
secondary debt trading operation in London.
The emergence of this secondary market has shaken some of the companies
involved. US companies are used to dealing with competing creditors when
trouble strikes. But UK groups are accustomed to a more protected
environment in which debt restructurings are handled by a familiar set of
banks, occasionally herded by the Bank of England.
They now face a different world, in which debt may be held by US high-yield
funds, known as 'vulture funds'. Such funds may have held debt for only a
few weeks, and want a 'quick exit' as the price rises. They may feel no
obligation to follow the Bank of England's 'London Approach' under which
creditors are expected to reach a compromise on the relative merit of their
claims.
There are several reasons for the new market's growth:
Foreign banks expanded in London during the 1980s by taking Pounds 5m to
Pounds 10m participations in syndicated loans. Selling the loans - sometimes
at 95 per cent of the face value - has been the fastest way to withdraw from
London and concentrate on their home markets. Many poor loans made in the
1980s have now been written down to a fraction of their face value. This
means banks can make a notional profit even when they sell at a discount.
'If a bank holds a loan at 20 per cent of face value, it will sell at 65
cents on the dollar,' says Ms Alex McLeod, managing director for asset
trading at Continental Bank, the US commercial bank, in London.
Banks embroiled in a large number of debt restructurings involving
relatively small loans have sought to escape through debt sales or swaps.
'It is extremely awkward and consumes a lot of management time to be
involved in lots of problem cases,' says Mr David Harrison, senior manager
for corporate banking at Lloyds Bank.
As banks have grown more willing to sell debt, buyers have come from the US
market in search of bargains. Buyers have largely been US funds, although a
handful of UK funds has now joined them.
Some companies whose debt has been sold doubt whether the market is as large
as many practitioners claim. Eurotunnel's Pounds 6.8bn of bank debt is
widely quoted, but Mr Graham Corbett, its finance director, says Eurotunnel
debt trades can be 'counted on the fingers of one hand'.
He says that companies with big projects need to deal with banks who
understand the complexities of such finance. This is hard for Eurotunnel
anyway because 65 banks lend it money. 'I would like a smaller syndicate so
we could spend more time discussing issues with them,' says Mr Corbett. 'You
don't have that relationship with someone who is trading your debt.'
Companies in administration after collapse have different reasons to hope
their debt is not traded. First, because the price of distressed debt can
swing wildly depending on the latest twists in a restructuring, buyers can
disrupt the work of administrators by their constant thirst for data. Mr
Mark Homan, a joint administrator of Maxwell Communication Corporation, says
there has been 'one hell of a clamour for information' from funds holding
debt.
Second, banks and insolvency experts are afraid of funds deliberately
upsetting an orderly restructuring to make financial gains. They cite US
cases where funds have allegedly forced other creditors to buy out their
stake at a premium by threatening to block restructuring proposals.
This obstructive behaviour may be unpopular with banks, but it is seen in
the US financial services industry as part of the cut and thrust of
corporate restructuring. The City of London, led by the Bank of England, has
a different view. Under the London Approach the Bank discourages commercial
banks from appointing receivers too quickly, urges them to share information
and wants all creditors to try to reach a common agreement.
The potential for this arrangement to be undermined by debt trading has led
the Bank to be ambivalent over London acquiring a new capital market. Mr Pen
Kent, the Bank director in charge of relations between the City and
industry, says that although the debt market could bring liquidity, the
destabilising of the London Approach would be 'too high a price to pay'.
He argues that Chapter 11 proceedings in the US tend to be longer than UK
restructurings. Because the latter are voluntary and need the unanimous
agreement of creditors, he believes they must be fast in order to work. 'If
creditors are just running around trying to sell debt to each other rather
than working on a solution, it could be that a company will simply run out
of time (to be rescued),' he says.
Yet some secondary debt brokers argue that the London Approach simply
protects banks at the expense of other groups of creditors such as
bondholders. They argue that the Bank is struggling to maintain a cartel
that does not always work in the interests of troubled companies. Mr
Tyrwhitt-Drake of Bankers Trust says the Bank has had a 'protectionist
approach that has created false markets'.
The funds insist they do not impede restructurings. Mr Christopher Cooke,
managing director of Kingsway Debt Managers - one of the few UK funds buying
distressed corporate debt - says his fund is no more hostile than a bank.
'We would not do anything unfriendly,' he says. 'We are not trying to take
control, or force asset sales.' Mr Gary Klesch, a debt broker and analyst,
says that funds have 'no interest other than increasing the value of their
stakes by helping the company involved to do better'.
Mr Tyrwhitt-Drake says that funds can be more imaginative than banks because
they are more at ease with complex capital instruments. 'Funds are prepared
to look at a company's whole capital structure, and that is very valuable,'
he says. He believes that the London Approach 'will not last five years'
given the competitive pressures exerted by debt trading.
If the approach to troubled businesses changes, then all European companies
that encounter similar problems to those facing Euro Disney could see a
brisk reaction not only from equity markets, but from their banks. Mr
Corbett of Eurotunnel admits to being 'very torn' between his instinctive
belief in markets, and his worries about debt trading. He will not be the
last finance director to be so torn.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Monetary tests apres le deluge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After the summer currency upsets that forced an emergency widening of
fluctuation bands in Europe's exchange rate mechanism, French monetary
policy has entered a period of relative calm. The French franc's recovery
this month to pre-crisis levels against the D-Mark represents a modest
success for the now independent Bank of France.
The Bank has been able to make steady cuts in interest rates without
damaging the franc's rally from its undervalued levels in August. However,
the French authorities should resist the temptation to order any triumphant
hoisting of the tricolor. France is heading towards the presidential
election in 1995 at a time of low growth and 3m-plus unemployment. The
economic and political strains that caused the midsummer pressure on the
franc have abated. It would be unwise to conclude that they will not
reappear.
Three-month French interest rates, at about 6 1/2 per cent, are now only 0.3
point above rates in Germany - 5 1/2 points below the levels at the start of
the year. Ten-year French bond yields are down to 5.7 per cent, 0.05 point
above German levels, representing a fall of nearly 2 1/2 points since
January. However, the French inflation rate is only 2 per cent, and still
falling. French interest rates are thus still far too high to allow
satisfactory recovery. Achieving further sustainable interest rate cuts,
perhaps another 2 percentage points at the short end of the market, is an
essential objective for next year.
Competitive problems
According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,
France is weathering its worst two-year period for growth since 1945. French
gross domestic product is forecast to rise just 1.1 per cent next year after
a 0.9 per cent contraction this year. The rising French trade surplus
appears to indicate that French exporters have only limited competitive
problems. However, according to the OECD, French manufacturers in 1993
suffered a greater fall in export market share than any other industrialised
country in Europe apart from Germany. The likelihood of a weaker D-Mark in
coming months could give a modest economic stimulus to France and other
countries linked to the D-Mark, by increasing opportunities for interest
rate cuts. However, as long as France remains bedevilled by the key
structural problem of inadequate employment creation, economic navigation
will remain arduous.
In its ERM policies since the summer, France has managed to fulfil a number
of interrelated objectives. Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister,
has reinforced his grip on policy. Indeed, the general applause given to Mr
Balladur's successful manoeuvrings over the Gatt deal has been one of the
factors behind the franc's recent firmness. Released from its unsustainable
obligation to defend the previous narrow bands, the Bank of France has been
able to repay its unprecedented foreign exchange debts built up at the high
point of the crisis on July 30. By maintaining the central D-Mark/franc
parity, France has kept alive the possibility of clinching the Maastricht
goal of economic and monetary union later in the 1990s.
Chief headaches
It is precisely in the link between European and domestic policy, however,
that Mr Balladur's chief headaches lie. After the breakdown of Franco-German
monetary co-operation during the summer, rebuilding confidence between Bonn
and Paris will be difficult. The French and German authorities are sensibly
avoiding any talk of a speedy formal return to narrow bands. However, their
evident fear that such a move would encourage now-quiescent currency
speculators to return to the fray underlines their limited faith in the
ERM's underlying strength.
To achieve Emu, re-establishing French economic policy credibility is a
necessary, but not sufficient condition. It will also require a degree of
political consensus with Germany which was not evident during the summer.
Successive French governments, however, regard Emu as an objective for which
they are ready to make large sacrifices. For the time being, the mix of
policies followed in Paris since the summer storm seems to offer France the
best chance of eventually bringing the prize into reach.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Leading Article: No deal in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The agony of the Bosnian Moslems continues. Their position has been
compared, by various people at various times, with that of the Czechs in
1938 or that of the Palestinians in and after 1947.
The Czechs were put under intolerable pressure, by people who claimed to be
their allies, to accept the amputation of their national territory as the
only alternative to a hideously destructive war. They accepted, only to find
that within six months the state was destroyed anyway. The Palestinians,
asked by the international community to accept partition of their country on
ethnic lines, refused - only to suffer defeat after defeat and be told each
time, in the name of realism, that they must make do with an even smaller
fragment of territory than they had previously rejected.
The Czech analogy is an indictment of the west for appeasing aggressors. The
Palestinian one is intended, usually, as a hard but necessary lesson for the
Bosnians themselves: to take what they can get, before it is whisked off the
table.
But the actual position of the Bosnians, and the moral position of the west,
is worse than either analogy suggests. The Czechs in 1938 were only asked to
give up that part of their territory whose population was predominantly
German; and the western powers had the excuse that the alternative was a war
they were not yet ready to fight, though they were preparing for it. The
Palestinians in 1947 were at least offered a territory on which a more or
less viable state could have been built; moreover their adversary was
prepared to accept the deal in good faith, and could reasonably have been
expected to respect the partition had they agreed to it.
Military power
None of those conditions apply in Bosnia today. The Bosnian government has
already lost the greater part of its national territory, including many
areas where Moslems were in the majority until the fighting started. The
west has ample military power to defeat the aggressors, should it choose to
do so. The territory now on offer to the Moslems is too fragmented to be the
basis of a viable state. And they have no reason whatever to believe their
adversaries, especially the Serbs, would implement the agreement in good
faith if they accepted it.
The Serbs have done a deal with the Croats, in a cynical attempt to exploit
the latest peace plan of the European Union, which suggests that sanctions
on Serbia might be gradually lifted if the Moslems were given a state
comprising one third of the country, as they had demanded in September. On
paper the deal does offer the Moslems that percentage, but the map of the
proposed territory makes no sense, whether demographic, economic or
military.
Lamentable record
The Moslem enclaves in eastern Bosnia would be completely isolated, Sarajevo
virtually encircled by the Serbs and cut off from its suburbs, and the
Moslems would no longer have the access to the river Drava in the north that
they were previously promised. Moreover the deal was negotiated by the
president of Serbia, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, not by the Bosnian Serbs. Even
if Mr Milosevic reached it in good faith, his previous record in imposing
concessions on the Bosnian Serbs is lamentable, and his authority has now
been further diminished both by the loss of his own parliamentary majority
and by the re-election of a Serb leader in Croatia whom he had previously
deposed.
The EU, it should be stressed, has not endorsed this offer. The Serbs must
realise that they have to improve it drastically, and be prepared to
implement it, before there can be any question of lifting sanctions. At the
moment they have once again turned the world against them by stepping up the
bombardment of Sarajevo, and interfering with relief supplies, in a blatant
attempt to put pressure on the Moslems. Yet Nato, which back in August
threatened air strikes on Serb positions if the 'strangulation' of Sarajevo
continued, seems further than ever from taking any action. Instead, the
British and French governments have been adding to the pressure on the
Moslems by hinting they may withdraw their troops in the spring if no
agreement is reached. This can only encourage the Serbs in their
intransigence.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Clouds spoil a starry horizon: Hollywood has had a bumper
year of hits, but competitors are catching up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Movie of the Year', trumpeted the front cover of Newsweek. 'The most
demanding and emotionally overpowering American movie in years', said New
York magazine.
Schindler's List, the true story of the rescue of 1,200 Jews from the
Holocaust by a raffish German industrialist, opened in US cinemas last week
to superlative reviews, capping a year of extraordinary achievement for
producer-director Steven Spielberg, Hollywood's master showman.
Jurassic Park, his film about dinosaurs rampaging through a theme park which
opened in the US and Europe last summer, has taken more than Dollars 860m in
worldwide box office receipts so far, making it the most successful movie of
all time, breaking Spielberg's own 1982 record of Dollars 700m with ET. Now
Schindler's List is bringing him the artistic recognition that a succession
of blockbuster adventure films has not achieved, and it might even win him
his first 'best director' Academy Awards Oscar.
Spielberg's remarkable year is one of several factors making the mood in
Hollywood more optimistic this Christmas than for several years - even
though the industry still faces some formidable challenges.
First, 1993 has been a good year at the box office. US cinema receipts are
likely to be some 10 per cent higher than in 1992, thanks in particular to
Jurassic Park (from Universal Studios), but also to hits such as The
Fugitive (Time Warner) and The Firm (Paramount).
Despite a relatively weak Christmas film line-up, the US gross could top
1989's record Dollars 5bn, and several leading studios are planning
significant production increases in 1994.
The US box office - which has hovered just above or below 1bn admissions a
year since the 1960s - now accounts for less than 20 per cent of Hollywood
revenues, thanks to the growth of the video rental market and showings of
films on TV. However, US cinema receipts are still an important, though not
infallible, gauge of how well films will do in the video market and
overseas.
Second, the industry has been electrified by the Dollars 10bn takeover
battle that has raged for the past three months around Paramount
Communications, owner of one of the last big Hollywood studios not
affiliated to a multinational or multi-media conglomerate. It will be the
most important shift in Hollywood ownership since two takeovers by Japanese
electronics groups at the start of the decade - Sony's Dollars 3.4bn
acquisition of Columbia Pictures and Matsushita's Dollars 6bn takeover of
the MCA group, which owns Universal Studios.
The Japanese bids were based on the theory that entertainment 'software',
such as films and records, and 'hardware', or the equipment on which they
are displayed, were becoming increasingly interdependent. That argument
remains unproven, though America's rapidly advancing communications
revolution - bringing the promise of multi-media, interactive, home TV-based
entertainment - makes it look rather more plausible.
The battle for Paramount - between cable company Viacom and television
shopping group QVC Network - has already produced bids well in excess of
what most Wall Street analysts think the company is worth, as did the
Japanese deals before it.
The bidders are gambling that the price of scarce Hollywood assets will
rise, because of the central role the industry is expected to play in the
multi-media revolution, bringing with it many new television channels. 'The
demand for content is going to be astronomical,' predicts one leading
Hollywood figure. 'Demand will far outstrip supply.'
The same thinking lies behind the industry's other recent significant
takeovers - the purchase of independent studios Castle Rock Entertainment
and New Line Cinema, by Mr Ted Turner's television empire, Turner
Broadcasting System, for Dollars 670m.
A third reason for optimism is that Hollywood's revenues are growing
particularly fast in international markets - a fact underlined by this
month's row, in the final stages of the Gatt Uruguay Round negotiations,
over US demands that its audiovisual products be granted freer access to the
European market. The two sides decided to put the issue to one side, for
later resolution.
Veronis, Suhler, a New York investment bank, forecasts that while US
spending on filmed entertainment will rise at an annual average of about 7
per cent to 1997, Hollywood's international sales will grow by 12 per cent
and make up just over 50 per cent of the sector's revenues by 1997, compared
with 38 per cent in 1987.
Reasons for such optimism - and the increasing ties between US and foreign
entertainment companies - include the rising number of households with video
cassette players; the renovation of old 'flea-pit' movie theatres or
construction of new 'multiplex' cinemas in countries such as the UK; the
growth of satellite broadcasting; and the increasing penetration of western
culture into former communist countries and the newly industrialised nations
of Asia.
Many US films already do much better abroad than in the US. For example,
Sliver, a thriller from Paramount starring Sharon Stone, got poor reviews in
the US early this year and brought in only Dollars 38m of domestic box
office revenues. Yet it has produced over Dollars 70m internationally.
Jurassic Park has grossed Dollars 336m in the US and Dollars 527m abroad.
However, Hollywood's outlook is hardly unclouded. For one thing, rising
production and marketing costs in the 1980s mean the industry's operating
margins - net operating income as a percentage of revenues - have gyrated in
recent years between 7 and 10 per cent, well below the 14-17 per cent
enjoyed in the 1970s.
The industry's profits have recovered over the past two years since 1991,
when box office receipts fell sharply, thanks to a crack-down on costs. But
some analysts worry that plans to ramp up production next year will boost
its costs without a commensurate rise in revenues and profits.
Many also argue that Hollywood has become too dependent for its profits on a
small number of blockbusters with expensive special effects, a handful of
costly superstars, and high marketing costs.
This increases the financial risks from flops (seven out of 10 Hollywood
movies generally lose money) and makes it harder for smaller, independent
studios to raise the capital needed to compete against the leaders -
producing a consolidation of the industry.
The increasing importance of the international market seems likely to
encourage the blockbuster trend, since global audiences can relate more
readily to established stars and dramatic special effects.
Some sceptics even question whether the interactive home entertainment
revolution will be a boon to the industry. For one thing, it may be further
off than its proponents predict. And it may simply shift film consumption
patterns - for example, from video rental to pay-per-view TV films - rather
than increase the number of hours people spend watching movies and TV shows.
Crystal-ball gazing aside, the large Hollywood studios are bracing
themselves for a more immediate challenge: increased competition in an area
they have dominated for a few decades - prime-time network television shows.
A recent court ruling relaxed a ban that had prevented the big three
television networks - ABC, NBC and CBS - from owning a financial interest in
most of their prime-time programmes, and they are gearing up to increase
their output, though their past record at producing hits has been mixed.
The court ruling also makes it more attractive for Hollywood studios to
merge with the television networks, and some analysts predict deals will be
struck in the next few years involving each of the big three.
Rumours also persist that Sony or Matsushita might seek outside partners for
their studios, which have yet to produce a strong return on their Japanese
parents' investments.
The Paramount battle, in other words, marks just the latest stage in a
Hollywood marital soap opera that has a long way to run.

FT  23 DEC 93 / O come all ye faithful
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the night before the night before Christmas, believers in the Science of
Happiness will gather in the Tokyo Dome, scene of baseball games in season,
stadium-style rock concerts and the occasional trade fair.
They will come to listen to Ryuho Okawa, founder of the religion and former
office worker, who will deliver a sermon on the Neo-Japanese Dream, his
vision that late 20th-century Japan has been chosen as the site for an
international spiritual renaissance.
Mr Okawa, who still has the look of the salaryman and lacks a firm
handshake, is one of many gods crowding into the Japanese pantheon. The
Science of Happiness (or Kofuku No Kagaku) regards Jesus as an early
prophet, providing reason to genuflect at Christmas, though a nativity scene
depicting events of 2,000 years ago can hardly compete against a sports
stadium filled with 50,000 of the faithful and a man they believe to be a
god.
The sudden rise of Mr Okawa's religion, which claims more than 5m followers
and has ambitions to convert all Japanese, is seen as a popular reaction
against the spiritual poverty of material wealth, though the Christmas
antics of young Japanese suggest that materialism still has drawing power.
Christmas Eve is supposed to be spent in the company of that special friend,
for whom the Y100,000 act of devotion is a supper show, a hotel room
overlooking Tokyo Bay, and a pendant, diamond ring or otherwise prominent
piece of jewellery.
Well-prepared couples will have taken a pre-Christmas tour to an amusement
arcade, Mirrorna, where they stumbled through a mirror maze, and sought
advice from computerised fortune tellers about the suitability of their
partner. Recession has made 'Christmas At Home' a popular theme in Japan,
but the emphasis is still on romance and consumption. Present-giving to
children, not traditional in Japan, is socially acceptable, and the
Christmas card has acquired a creeping popular-ity.
Most of the card scenes are of snowmen and Santa rather than the arrival of
the wise men or the radiant babe in manger. One card claiming to 'provide
energy for the year ahead' comes with a compact disc that supposedly sends
'subliminal messages' through a selection of songs including White Christmas
and Silent Night. A homegrown hamburger chain, Mos Burger, believes that
this is the season to be amused by puns, as munchers are told to have a
Merry Xmos.
Indulging in a Christian festival can be done without violating the doctrine
of Shinto, a religion or folklore which allows the devout to observe other
faiths. It is a mark of Japanese tolerance that 49 new religions were
registered last year, bringing the country's total to 5,888.
Shinto is flexible enough for the Emperor to have been deified and debunked
during the past century, and gradually redeified in the minds of a minority
of Japanese over the past few years without undermining the popularity of
festivals with origins in the planting season and the harvest.
It also allows Japanese companies to pursue the cause of materialism with
enthusiasm while maintaining a shrine on the roof of their head-quarters.
But the stripping away of Emperor Hirohito's supernatural powers at the end
of the second world war left a vacancy that others rushed to fill. In 1945,
a Yamaguchi farmer's wife declared the 'first year of God's Kingdom', and
spread the word of what was known popularly as the 'Dancing Religion' for
its ceremonial use of dancing. Born Sayo Kitamura, she became Ogamisama and
travelled the world, urging all to 'rid yourself of selfishness, polish your
soul and become a true human being', a creed still followed by an estimated
650,000 people.
Mrs Kitamura described herself as a living god. But other self-appointed
deities are coy about their status and rely on the faithful to draw the
conclusion that, for example, Daisaku Ikeda, leader of Soka Gakkai, a lay
Buddhist movement claiming 8m members, is more than a mere man. An unseemly
argument within the movement has stained his halo. Mr Ikeda has been
'excommunicated' by the monks who claim to be guardians of the faith; the
monks, in turn, are accused by Mr Ikeda's assistants of 'madly playing golf
and living spendthrift lives'.
Another reason for the spread of new religions and the sudden popularity of
hypnotism and seances is believed to be the weakening of ties between
company and employee. Instead of worshipping daily at the house of
Mitsubishi or Mitsui, disillusioned employees are said to be seeking
satisfaction elsewhere, swapping the blue suit for monk's garb or dabbling
in the supernatural or tak-ing in mass on Christmas Eve.
Perhaps the most or least appropriate place to spend Christmas in tolerant
Japan is Shingo, a village in the northern prefecture of Aomori, which
claims to be the last resting place of Jesus. The locals say they have
uncovered evidence that Jesus's younger brother was captured and crucified,
while he escaped, finally seeking refuge in Japan, where he married and
fathered three children.
Having created the legend, the Shingoites are cashing in on it. They have
produced 'Christ village' sake and rice crackers in recent years, and
arranged an exclusive appearance by Santa Claus this Christmas. The
villagers are haunted by neither Christian guilt nor eastern shame, and all
are welcome.

<TEXT>
Sir, Thank you for printing the article 'Trapped in a Company Flat - The
Leasehold Act is creating a two-tier property market', by Caroline Garnham
(Finance and the Family, December 18).
This demonstrated admirably the tangle that is being created by current
legislation; not all that different from the work of a kitten with a ball of
string.
Economists think that the economy is driven by market forces, but growth is
a function of the ability to do things without the burden of tax advisers,
investment managers, pension fund administrators, solicitors and specialists
on current EU legislation.
It is even tough being the beneficiary of a will. The administrators send
you a letter giving you the good news and some four months later you get a
cheque for half the amount. It is good fun (for some) trying to get an
explanation from a solicitor who has made a mistake]
Oh for the simple life, when laws could be read and understood by all (as in
the Ten Commandments) and we did not have to pay for the advice which we did
not need and at rates that we could not afford.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Economic model not understating
impact of tax changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KENNETH F WALLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You have recently given publicity ('Tax 'flaw' may trip chancellor',
November 15) to the claim by Douglas McWilliams, of the Centre for Economics
and Business Research, that models of consumers' expenditure of the type
conventionally used by the authorities have a serious flaw, which leads them
to understate the impact of tax changes on the economy. Instead, he says in
his recently published study, 'a change in income tax rates will affect
consumers' expenditure by approximately twice the amount estimated by
conventional models such as those used by the Bank of England, the Treasury
. . .'.
The estimate given by CEBR of the impact on consumers' expenditure in the
Bank model of a 1p rise in the basic rate, namely a reduction of 0.14 per
cent, does not accurately reflect the properties of that model.
Nor, for that matter, does it accurately describe the Treasury model, which
has been the recipient of most of the adverse comment. The correct way to
estimate the economy's response to a policy change is through a simulation
exercise on the model in question. On doing this with the versions of the
models released to us by the Bank and the Treasury (the Treasury's model is
publicly available) we find that the corresponding figures are in the range
0.5 to 0.7 per cent, depending on the definition of consumers' expenditure
that is used.
CEBR's preferred figure, in the range 0.25 to 0.34 per cent, is itself a
considerable under-estimate. Hence its claim, based on its figures, that the
official models understate the impact of tax changes, is incorrect.
Observer ('Younger model sought', November 29) described Douglas
McWilliams's finding as 'an embarrassing flaw' in the Treasury model.
Treasury and Bank officials need not be embarrassed at all by this
alle-gation.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: All lottery profit should go to good
causes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD BRANSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, To reply to your editorial, 'Charity lottery' (December 20), we have
been planning our bid for the national lottery since 1988 as a result of a
visit to the Irish Republic, where charities, sport, theatre and the arts
all benefit from the lottery. I was one of a number of businessmen who, as a
result of that visit, offered our business skills to set up and run a
national lottery for worthwhile causes.
In almost every other country and state in the world this is exactly how the
national lottery is run. A group of managers - some with lottery experience
 -is appointed directly by the government to set up the lottery. It is a
myth to think that it is a particularly difficult company to set up. It is
no more difficult to set up and run than, say, an airline is. The difference
is that the national lottery is, in effect, a licence to print money.
Any good, competent business managers drawing on the right expertise can run
and promote it. Almost any of the groups which have put their names forward
would be quite capable of running it. This is not a particularly
entrepreneurial venture. Therefore, the question that needs to be asked is:
is it really necessary to add an extra layer of shareholders, over the
managers, who can sit back and cream off hundreds of millions of pounds of
profit that could otherwise be going to good causes?
Furthermore, there will be millions of people in Britain who will have a
flutter every week on the national lottery hoping to become millionaires.
However, we believe - and believe we will be able to prove conclusively to
the director of Oflot - that many of these same people will be happy to
spend a pound or two more a week if they can be assured that all the profits
are going to charity. As the former speaker of the House of Commons, Lord
Tonypandy, said: 'As a matter of principle I wanted nothing to do with the
national lottery. I, along with many others, disagree with gambling.
However, with all the profits going to good causes, I'm not only happy to
change my mind but to become a trustee of the Lottery Foundation. I might
even have a flutter myself.' We believe that there are hundreds of thousands
of people who will participate more fully with a lottery designed to
maximise the take for charitable causes.
We are not only saying this. I, together with others, am willing to devote
considerable time and sums of money (with no wish for any return) to prove
this to be the case.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Legal means not best way to deal with
late payers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GERALD FRANKEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You are right to point out that, while a legal right to interest may
help resolve the growing problem of late payment, suppliers will always be
wary of using the legislation for fear of antagonising purchasers ('Flaws in
the German model', December 21).
In this respect, Financial Times readers might like to consider some ideas
recently put forward by the Labour party in its consultative document Into
the Growth Corridor - Helping Small Businesses to Succeed.
This suggests several measures which could be considered before legislation.
Public sector organisations could be required to pay within 30 days or pay
interest on the outstanding amount; public companies could be required to
identify and publish their payment practices in their annual report.
In addition, the introduction of a code of practice on the payment of debts
could be made a requirement for companies achieving quality standards such
as BS 5750.
The introduction of legislation would be considered only in the light of the
results of these actions.

The wildlife series made by David Attenborough over the past 15 years,
beginning with Life On Earth, constitute one of the most impressive and
important bodies of work ever undertaken for television. Today brings the
final episode of Life In The Freezer, a series about Antarctica which has
sustained and sometimes surpassed the extraordinarily high standards set by
Attenborough and the BBC's Bristol Natural History Unit in their previous
programmes (8.00 BBC1).
Television has been as influential as any other factor in driving back the
celebration of the winter solstice to the pre-religious roots from which it
sprang. Christmas Time In Vienna is a concert starring Placido Domingo,
Dionne Warwick, and Ruggero Raimondi. Some of their songs may well have
Christian origins, but that seems fortuitous: this is entertainment rather
than an expression of faith (8.00 BBC2).
Word of mouth suggests you should not encourage the children to stay up for
The Secret Adventures Of Tom Thumb which is said to be both'adult' and
occasionally depressing (9.30 BBC2).

FT  23 DEC 93 / Arts: The panto is in good shape - Antony Thorncroft finds
tradition flourishing and the young audience loving it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Throughout the land the familiar seasonal sounds can be heard - the crunch
of popcorn under foot; the thump of lifting seats as wailing children are
led to the lavatory; the screams and shrieks as chocolate bars are fought
over in the stalls: it is panto time again.
Playwright David Hare recently admitted that the British, as a nation, could
not care less about the theatre. He should pop into one during the next few
weeks and cheer himself up. Your local theatre is likely to be packed
(hurrah); with children, the audience of the future (double hurrah); in
family groups bonding in traditional values (triple hurrah); and enjoying a
live entertainment which draws on the past but embraces the contemporary
(mass delirium).
How stands the panto? Exceptionally well. Business is up on last year, which
is excellent news for those theatres which pay for their serious productions
with the profits from this annual wallop of nostalgia. It also suggests that
there is at least one British art form which continues to flourish.
Pantomime traces itself back to the early 18th century but in its current
form it has a noble enough history of a century or more. Any Victorian time
traveller would have felt immediately at home at the Wimbledon Theatre the
other night with the Fairy Courgette on one side of the stage rhyming her
couplets and setting the scene while on the other Blackspider, melodramatic
evil incarnate, threatened his worst. Plots, characters, jokes, very little
has changed.
It is also quite acceptable that most pantos feature at least one
audience-pulling star of an Australian TV soap; they come over by the
planeload for the chance of trying their hand at acting - and a percentage
of the box office take. A century ago music hall stars like Dan Leno and
Marie Lloyd were lured into panto, and a generation ago it was the turn of
pop stars like Cliff Richard and Cilla Black to spend their Christmases on
the boards.
Of course some adjustment is necessary to incorporate Kristian Schmid
(formerly of Neighbours) into the Orchard Theatre, Dartford, or Stefan
Dennis (currently of Neighbours) at Wimbledon, or Ray Meagher (of Home and
Away ) at Woking, or home grown soapers like Nick Cotton (Eastenders) at
Croydon, and Seeta Indrani (The Bill) at Wycombe, and so on. The Australians
especially are not always up to carrying off Aladdin or Cinderella so they
tend to end up, like Schmid and Dennis, as Idle Jack in Jack and the
Beanstalk. The more seasoned TV stars, like Graham Bickley of Bread, can cut
the mustard as Aladdin (at Woking), but it means that we get a cheeky man
playing the role rather than the saucy girl of Christmas Past.
There are pantos which still offer the frisson of thunder thighed, strapping
lasses courting each other like mad (I was much struck by Bromley's
Cinderella, which fielded Elizabeth Watts as a diminutive Cinders being
chatted up in turn by Sophie Corbett as Dandini and Lisa Hollander as Prince
Charming), but there is a danger that panto is becoming sensible.
Perhaps the biggest criticism after taking in half a dozen pantos on the
fringe of London is that pantomime is susceptible to political correctness.
There is a blandness about many of the cavortings. Evil is played down so
that the agreeable sensation of fear, and the relief at the triumph of good,
hardly featured. There is a concentration on spectacle and the familiarity
of safe routines (the cast cannot wait to get into the 'Oh, no you can't';
'look behind you' audience responses). There is also a profound disapproval
of good old fashioned smut. Alice no longer sighs 'almost midnight and still
no Dick', in Dick Whittington; Dames are allowed a little nostalgia about
their long lost sex life, but now concentrate on their costumes and
slapstick. The overwhelming impression was that pantos are aimed at
children, specifically at girls between the ages of three and eight.
Certainly watching the faces of these neat little spectators, often a giggle
of Brownie packs or school parties, remains one of the joys of the adult
pantogoer. They still rustle noisily during the love songs and the
exposition of the plot; they are still totally captivated by the magical
effects and the moments when the hero or heroine is in danger. They enjoy
most the sweet throwing; the chance to go on stage; watching other little
girls from the local dance academy do their bit; and any animal that takes
to the stage. They are a spontaneous, extroverted, whole hearted audience.
All the pantos seem to offer excellent value to their audiences. The scripts
could be wittier and make more use of local jokes but there were few signs
of skimping, apart perhaps at Stratford East where Red Riding Hood had a
slightly makeshift air. Apart from mild regrets about the freezing out of
some Principal Boys and the preference for the squeaky clean over the good
old fashioned English innuendo, my only criticism is that less use is made
of popular contemporary songs. This is a pantomime tradition but now
listless, newly composed material is often favoured over the latest hits.
But in the main pantomime has smartened up its act. There are few references
to television commercials, indeed to the day's events. Mr Blobby pops up, as
does Prince Charles, but the time when panto was just an excuse for pop
stars or comedians to perform their usual routines while the panto proceeded
unsteadily around them seems to be over. Tradition rules.
Here are some memories of pantos 1993-94. The beguiling Ronnie Corbett as
Buttons at Bromley, bringing the first act to a triumphant conclusion with
his dying swan ballet routine. Tudor Davies as a vigorous non-camp Dame at
Wimbledon and Danny La Rue managing to be both motherly and nostalgically
rude as Widow Twankee at Woking, a panto which also contains a sweet voiced
Alison Young as the Princess; Hugo Myatt as a convincingly straight villain
at Dartford and Alan Cowan as a pleasingly theatrical Wolf at Stratford
East.
Perhaps panto is a little too pleased with itself these days. The barriers
have been lowered between performers and audience and this can create
self-indulgence among the cast. But it remains a vigorous dramatic
tradition, confirming for millions that a visit to the theatre can be a
magical experience. Roll on next Christmas.

A PERFECT WORLD (15) Clint Eastwood
CENTURY (15) Stephen Poliakoff
ANOTHER STAKEOUT (PG) John Badham
A Perfect World, starring Clint Eastwood and Kevin Costner, is set in Texas
in 1963. Your starter for ten and no conferring - what famous event also
took place in Texas in 1963? And are Eastwood and Costner doomed to spend
the rest of their lives re-living it or referring to it?
Eastwood, you recall, was a guilt-haunted ex-security man at Kennedy's
motorcade in In The Line Of Fire. And Costner, just before fooling us a
little by playing a guilt-haunted ex-security man for Reagan in The
Bodyguard, played Dallas assassination investigator Jim Garrison in JFK.
Hollywood likes to type-locate as well as type-cast its leading men - this
saves the audience brain fatigue - so the command went out to the two stars
of A Perfect World. 'Stay in the Lone Star state. Keep your clocks at 1963]
But this time, guys, the action takes place two weeks before JFK's visit,
which is just a distant symbolic stormcloud. At least, that's what the
screenwriter John Lee Hancock is telling me right now in my earpiece.'
And the story? Kevin is an escaped convict driving across Texas with a
fatherless seven-year-old as hostage (TJ Lowther) and he kinda, well,
becomes the boy's surrogate Pop. And Clint is the grizzled,
seen-it-all-before lawman - same part as usual - who pursues Kev in a
loaned-out gubernatorial campaign bus.
A what? Well, you see, Governor John Connolly, the Dallas survivor who died
this year, is semi-fictionalised here as an electioneering fusspot
interested only in getting his battle-bus back unscratched. (De mortuis nil
nisi fatuum). But an hour into the film, guess what? The bus is smashed up
in the chase] What a surprise. This is written into the script so that
lawman and outlaw can shake off their respective techno-military support
systems plus telegraphically hopeless cronies - lady criminologist Laura
Dern for Eastwood, psychotic sidekick Keith Szarabajka for Costner - before
moving in for the final mano a mano showdown.
Eastwood himself directed this film, which from the maker of Unforgiven must
be accounted unforgivable. He begins promisingly with an eerie-lyrical
slow-motion image: Costner lying half-asleep (or dying?) on a patch of
breeze-blown grassland, empty but for a white Halloween mask and a drift of
dollar bills. This is a 'How are we going to get to this point in the
story?' device, but it works. At least for its behind-the-credits minute or
two. It lends an air of mystery that the movie then spends 2 1/4 hours
unravelling.
As cars crunch, guns rattle and corpses queue up for disposal, we learn that
Costner is a violent former armed robber driven to crime by bad parenting.
(Clint 'Make my day' Eastwood is now making bleeding-heart liberal movies?).
And the boy he kidnaps has been brought up as a Jehovah's Witness by a
spoilsport single mother, so naturally he cleaves to fun-loving, gun-loving
Costner as the Pop he never had.
Nor is on-the-hoof psychotherapy confined to the psychopathic classes. Ten
miles back down the road is Clint and his busful of career folk, working out
or playing out their personality problems. Laura Dern, fresh from
palaeo-botany duty in Jurassic Park where her scholarship and feminist
chutzah were programmed to disintegrate into little-lady screams, does the
same number here. Expert criminologist; but too heavy on the book-learned
polysyllables; throws up at first sight of a dead body. As for Clint, he
must get over his own bad memories of - yes - negative parenting.
So the lessons in life grind on, milling wit, character and drama into
readimix messages for morons. The only folks in touch with raw reality in
this film are the behind-camera craft-masters, Henry Bumstead (production
design) and Jack N. Green (cinematography). Bumstead's no-frills authority -
as well as being an Eastwood veteran he designed Hitchcock's Vertigo - turns
every set, from grungy diners to giant dilapidated hardware stores, into a
kind of Essence of Texas. And Green's camera eye breathes life and movement
into a story that, left to itself, would freeze into the postures of moral
pedagoguery prescribed by the script.
But pedagoguery is the flavour of the season: see Stephen Poliakoff's
Century (opening in Britain next week). Nothing makes a more specious
milestone than the birth of a new century. Do the human heart and mind
change because two digits in the year's number-counter click over to zero?
But you cannot stop an artist when he gets a fit of the epochal-apocalyptic.
The time is 1900. The Hamlet-like hero is an aspiring doctor (Clive Owen)
who puts an emotional rapier into his East European, Scottish-naturalised
father (Robert Stephens) before migrating to London to test his metal on
father substitute Charles Dance, a leading surgeon-teacher. Looking on from
the wings is laboratory assistant Miranda Richardson, part Gertrude part
Ophelia, offering sex, work companionship and surrogate motherhood as Owen
sets out to blaze his medico-scientific path into a New Age.
We know it is a New Age because the film strafes us with visuals to that
effect. There is the illuminated 'Welcome To The New Century' sign that
eccentric old Stephens erects on a hill, only for the council to order its
removal. (No change there in 93 years of British local politics.) And there
are the gleaming shafts of enhanced sunlight pouring in through the teaching
hospital's windows, making Wagnerian heroes of everyone in sight.
Two rival medical subplots fight for centre screen. One concerns Dance's
jealous suppression of Owen's breakthrough research work on the human gland;
the other, early birth control schemes in the age of Malthus. As we try to
discern a connection between the two (there is none), Poliakoff piles on the
period colour (frockcoats, beards, cloppity-cloppity street traffic), dances
around the fetchingly fish-eyed Dance and brings Robert Stephens back for an
encore whenever possible.
Stephens is a joy: a whiff of green-belt organic life on a excursion ticket
to the movie's inner-city schematism. Watch his ludic, rubicund face; listen
to the fluent fun he has with a Scottish-Jewish-Romanian accent (sic).
Elsewhere, Century is a large, confused, gas-filled undertaking from a
playwright-filmmaker whose last, best movie (Close My Eyes) was a small tale
of doomed love which proved that largest thoughts and feelings often come
from simplest story ideas.
Are you ready for the week's third film about surrogate fathers? In Another
Stakeout, the title operation requires undercover cop Emilio Estevez to
masquerade as colleague Richard Dreyfuss's son. They and Assistant District
Attorney Rosie O'Neill, pretending to be Dreyfuss's wife, play house in a
borrowed mansion overlooking the sea-washed hideaway of a fugitive state's
witness (Cathy Moriarty).
We are on an island off Seattle. Correction: we are in Never-never-land,
Disney Studios, Hollywood, where director John Badham and writer Jim Kouf
try to magic forth a sequel to their hit cop caper of yesteryear. But where
Stakeout had novelty, Another Stakeout has 'novelties'. A funny dog, a funny
woman law official (the tuba-shaped Miss O'Neill), a travel-brochure
setting.
Only in a truly ingenious - and funny - dinner scene, where the masquerade
starts fraying right there in front of the neighbours, does wit usurp
weariness. After that it is back to pounding the predictable plot. The cops
stake out the nextdoor quarries; the dog stakes out the nextdoor cat;
Dreyfuss stakes out the flaky Estevez; the audience, picking up the habit,
stakes out the exit sign.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Arts: A Crypto- Christmas concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Monday's concert by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment was not billed
as fare for the festival. Yet it was almost that, with not only Corelli's
'Christmas' Concerto, but the secular cantata by Bach that he would soon
cannibalise for his Christmas Oratorio. The sentiments of the original
cantata, however, were hardly seasonal; and in this performance they began
to seem downright queer.
'Hercules auf dem Scheideweghe', BWV 213, was one of those occasional
baroque encomia designed both to honour a royal patron, and to urge him
along virtuous paths. In this case, he was the frail, crippled Prince
Elector of Saxony, and the occasion was his eleventh birthday (I am drawing
on Nicholas Anderson's programme-note). To inspire him, Picander's fairly
awful text represented the hero Hercules at a 'crossroads' where he must
choose between Wollust (heedless sensuality) and Tugend (virtuous decency).
His choice, thumpingly signalled from the start, is of course Tugend, whose
voice joins his in a climactic duet of surrender.
But most of us know this duet well from the Christmas Oratorio, where
soprano and bass - with obbligato twin oboes d'amore - give thanks for
divine mercy; it was disconcerting to hear it from the mouths of a male alto
(Hercules) and a tenor, with an androgynous pair of violas, to quite
different words: 'I am yours, I am yours. I kiss you, oh kiss me, etc'.
Especially since Wollust had been so sweetly and subtly impersonated by the
soprano Barbara Bonney - though Paul Agnew's Tugend was fervently
upstanding, and for the young Hercules Ralf Popken's ultra-elegant line was
expressive to the point of exacerbation.
Forswearing any speculation about male-chorister life in 1730s Leipzig, we
may prefer the 'Christmas' adaptations of most of this music that Bach made
the next year. All due thanks, nevertheless, to the veteran conductor Gustav
Leonhardt for re-animating the original score; and for an engaging,
characterful performance earlier of the 'Coffee' Cantata BWV 211, with Agnew
as narrator, Bonney as the caffeine-addicted daughter and David
Wilson-Johnson as her despairing father. If his light, dry bass lacked the
substance for ripe comic effect, he acted hard to compensate; in fact
Bonney's soprano too has lost the fresh bloom that we first admired in her
Rosenkavalier Sophie, though her mature art is delightful.
The Corelli sounded uncommonly refined, in beautifully graded hues of grey.
Exploiting the range of their period-style bowing, the OAE strings were more
searching and delicate than ever. Still, this evergreen 'Christmas Concerto'
is actually a concerto grosso with a prominent duo of solo violins: would
Corelli's Roman band really have been led by such mild, soft-grained,
self-effacing players - impeccably musical though they were - as we heard
here?

FT  23 DEC 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Harnessing pester
power - Diane Summers considers the tactics of the toy advertisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pester power', as those in the business of marketing to children so
appropriately call it, has just about done its job for another year.
This week parents all over the world will be wrapping Barbies, Lego and
video games, as well as all the other fads, fashions and enduring favourites
that make up the global toy and games market, worth more than Dollars 55bn
(Pounds 36.90bn) last year.
The most indulgent, according to market analysts Euromonitor, are the
Germans. In 1992 their children each had Dollars 429-worth of toys and games
lavished on them, while Swedish children got Dollars 400, Americans Dollars
384, and British Dollars 294. More than half of the Dollars 55bn total is
spent around Christmas.
With advertising budgets to match, toy and games manufacturers are
constantly searching for the most effective ways of harnessing pester power
and making their products the ones that parents will scour the shops for in
the run-up to Christmas.
The youth market is the trickiest and most competitive of the children's
markets, as is apparent from the video games wars being fought between
giants Sega and Nintendo. While some of Sega's more aggressive advertising
might make parents flinch, it appears to be getting through to its intended
target of teenage boys.
Mark Earls, planning director of advertising agency Still Price Lintas, who
has studied marketing to youth, observes: 'Sega has got the personality at
the moment. The personality of the brand is excitement and being a bit
anarchic, a bit dangerous.'
Advertisers often wrongly assume that young people now are very much like
their own younger selves, says Earls. Salvador Dali pinpointed the problem,
says Earls, when he observed that 'the trouble with the youth of today is
that we are no longer part of it'.
Middle-aged advertising folk 'trying to be hip and cool and groovy just
doesn't work', according to Earls. The result can too often be adverts that
have the same effect 'as the vicar doing the twist at the youth club party'.
Nor, in his view, is the structured advertisement with an obvious 'moral'
ending effective with a generation exposed to a wide range of media images
and with a sophisticated understanding of how advertising works. The
approach now needs to be looser. 'All youth culture now is about play. You
throw something into their world and hope they're going to play with it,' he
says.
At the other end of the children's age range, life appears to be simpler.
Peter Waterman, vice-president of corporate affairs at Hasbro, the toy
company with the second largest global market share after Nintendo, has no
time for the wilder schemes of advertising's 'creatives'.
He has a clear recipe for success when it comes to advertising to, for
instance, five- to nine-year-olds. 'You do what you would do if you were an
adult with the toy in your hand. You show the toy to the child and then show
the child how the toy works. The toy itself and its operation is always the
hero of the action.'
Waterman, who used to work for Procter &amp; Gamble, says the selling of
detergents and toys should be based on similar principles. 'You demonstrate
the product in action. Every half-second you use dressing that up in some
disguise is time wasted when you could be telling the consumer about the
product you want them to use,' he says.
And the half-seconds around Christmas come very expensive. The most
effective medium for toy and games advertising is television and all the
main manufacturers will be clamouring for airtime during children's peak
viewing. In the UK, for example, media buyers Zenith report that one
30-second slot on GMTV, the breakfast channel, would cost Pounds 15,000 just
before Christmas, compared with about Pounds 9,000 at other times of the
year. Provisional bookings have to be made a year in advance, with firm
commitments from advertisers by Easter.
Television itself, with its tight regulation of what is allowed by the
broadcasting authorities, also acts to make toy advertising relatively
simple, says Waterman. In the UK, the Independent Television Commission has
a formidable set of rules advertisers must abide by. For example, direct
exhortations to practise pester power are outlawed - the slogan 'Don't
forget the Fruit Gums, mum' might well fail to get past regulators these
days.
Anything that might make a child feel inferior or 'liable to be held in
contempt or ridicule' if it does not buy a particular product is also
banned. Furthermore, the price must be shown if the toy costs more than
Pounds 20.
One rule that many parents may wish to quote in the aftermath of Christmas
is: 'Where advertisements show results from a drawing, construction, craft
or modelling toy or kit, the results shown must be reasonably attainable by
the average child and ease of assembly must not be exaggerated.'
Some countries have gone further: in Flanders, the 'five-minute rule' means
there can be no advertisements during children's programmes, or for five
minutes before or after them on terrestrial television channels. In Greece,
a complete ban was lifted but its reimposition is being discussed following
a change in government.
In effect, Sweden and Norway ban all advertising to children on terrestrial
television channels. Waterman, who is also an official of the Toy
Manufacturers of Europe, a lobbying group, says the ban is a barrier to
trade which distorts the market. He hopes it can be challenged in the new
year when the European Economic Area treaty comes into effect. The treaty
will extend European Union single market and competition rules to those
countries, including Sweden and Norway, which are signatories.
Waterman is indignant about restrictions which he considers do more to
protect trade than children. 'Advertising to children is an entirely
harmless activity. Steps to stop children seeing advertising at all are
completely unnecessary and, in fact, are undesirable. They prevent children
from learning important social and economic lessons,' he says.
Lessons which include, presumably, early training in how to spot who holds
the purse-strings and how to lobby effectively for your favourite projects.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Dedicated team in
high spirits - Philip Rawstorne explains how United Distillers has attacked
Europe's lucrative duty-free market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
For the past three years, United Distillers, the Guinness spirits company,
has outperformed its rivals in western Europe's Pounds 2bn duty-free spirits
market.
UD's share of the world's biggest duty-free market has risen from 17.5 per
cent in 1990 to 20.5 per cent this year, nearly nine points ahead of its
nearest competitors International Distillers &amp; Vintners and Hiram Walker.
Volume sales have grown from 1.44m nine-litre cases to 1.65m. Its Johnnie
Walker Red Label Scotch whisky and Gordon's gin are the two leading brands.
That performance owes a great deal to UD's development of a dedicated
European duty-free organisation. UD's strategy has given it a sharper
regional focus than its rivals in the market, which the EU has extended
until at least mid-1999.
UD's organisation grew from the recruitment in late 1987 of Gerd
Biedenbacher, a German executive from Dunhill, to run the German and
Austrian operations.
He inherited a management system devised by the old Distillers Company which
Guinness took over in 1986. Under it, the worldwide duty-free business was
run from London through independent agents in each market.
In Germany and Austria, Biedenbacher found five different agents, each with
responsibility for one or two UD brands, competing against each other. He
ended the agency contracts and put the brands together in one portfolio.
The restructuring worked well. It was extended, first to Scandinavia, and by
1991 covered the whole of western Europe. Today, Biedenbacher runs the
business from a converted warehouse in Hamburg with regional sales and
marketing offices in London, Helsinki, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Antwerp,
Paris, Milan, Madrid and Athens.
He has a total staff of 70, comprising 16 different nationalities speaking
13 different languages. 'The only thing we insist on is fluency in English,'
he says.
The team's area director for the UK and Ireland, which accounts for a third
of market sales, is a German; a Finn heads operations in Germany and
Austria; and a Belgian is responsible for southern Europe.
All products, formerly supplied direct from the UK, are distributed from
warehouses in Hamburg's free port, Piraeus in Greece, and Hoddesdon in the
UK. 'Lead times have been cut from five or six weeks to 48 hours,' says
Biedenbacher. 'About 250 different product specifications are permanently in
stock.'
Faster delivery deserved faster payment, so with the help of Barclays,
Biedenbacher set up the first cross-border business direct debit system.
Legal hurdles prevent the use of the system in some countries but
three-quarters of payments are now settled this way. 'One of the great
advantages is that salesmen can concentrate on selling rather than chasing
late payments,' he says.
The closer UD has come to its customers in airport duty-free stores,
airlines and ferries, the more it has become involved in trying to improve
retail techniques.
It collects market data to detect trends in sales of different categories as
well as to assess the performance of its competitors' brands.
Travellers' shopping behaviour is studied closely. Only about half of them
visit duty-free shops. Japanese businessmen are the most assiduous shoppers
 -88 per cent visit the stores and nearly all of them buy alcohol. But only
about one in six American or French travellers buy drink.
Considerable effort has gone into attracting more people into stores.
'Opportunities to influence consumer decisions are limited,' says
Biedenbacher. 'There are so many different nationalities; no television
advertising, no other media except airline magazines.'
UD, therefore, seeks to influence shoppers in the few seconds they take to
reach a decision by constantly improving in-store promotions and
merchandising.
Those who do not visit the stores at 10 European airports are being tempted
to buy from 'last-minute' trolleys of goods in the departure lounge.
A team has been established to help retailers achieve more effective space
management - planning the lay-out of stores, the positioning of categories
and brands, and the space allotted to them - to maximise sales and profits.
The team uses confidential data supplied by its retail customers. 'The rest
of us have no access to it,' says Biedenbacher. 'Our view is that, with a 20
per cent share of the market, we will benefit from any overall increase in
sales that results from their work.'
All these efforts have reinforced the trend among travellers to trade up to
more expensive, better-quality brands of drinks. London Heathrow is now the
biggest malt whisky outlet in the world.
This year, the market has coped effectively with changes in its regulation
giving retailers responsibility for enforcing allowance limits. Initial
confusion hit sales at airports which were down 10 per cent in the first six
months, according to UD estimates. But this loss was offset by a boom in
ferry sales. Hordes of UK cross-Channel trippers, shopping for cheaper beer
in France, have also been picking up their duty-free spirits.
The big question hanging over the market, however, is what happens when the
EU extension runs out?
Biedenbacher believes abolition is unlikely. The British Airports Authority
now makes more money from retail concessions than from landing fees.
'Without the income generated by duty-free, airport charges and the cost of
airline tickets would have to rise,' he says.
But even if travellers within the EU are denied duty-free, he remains
optimistic about long-term prospects. 'Air travel worldwide is forecast to
double in the 1990s - and long distance flights are the fastest growing
sector. Eastern Europe duty-free sales are increasing. Airport shops will
also have more to offer than duty-free bargains - and people at airports
always have time to spare, and to spend.'

FT  23 DEC 93 / Technology: Cool and cost effective - The invention of a
self-chill can
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A self-chilling can would be such an obvious boon to the brewing and soft
drinks industries that it is hardly surprising a lot of inventors have
attempted to create one over the years.
At least 10,000 patents have been filed worldwide, according to Michael
Anthony, chief operating officer of MicroCold Technologies of Florida.
'But nobody, so far as I know, has ever come up with a self-cooling can that
not only works but does so cost-effectively. Until now.'
Anthony, an engineer who emigrated to the US from England 13 years ago,
returned to London last week to demonstrate to the UK's leading brewers the
self-chilling can he has invented.
He was working on cooling techniques for instrumentation when he met
Mitchell Joseph, head of a long-established US beverage company, who had
spent several unsuccessful years trying to develop a self-cooling can.
Their partnership, they claim, has now made the breakthrough. As evidence,
they placed an ordinary-looking cola can on a table, pulled the tab, and
recorded the fall in temperature of its contents from 73'F (23'C) to 40'F in
about 30 seconds.
The cooling device is a small canister of gas inserted in the can. When the
tab is pulled to open the can, it also releases the gas in the canister. The
gas swirls rapidly. Heavier cold molecules separate from lighter hot
molecules, cool the canister, and then the liquid around it. The heat
exchange unit displaces only two fluid ounces of liquid in a 12 fl oz can.
It is simple and relatively inexpensive to produce from readily-available
materials, says Joseph.
Fitting the device into the can will require little modification to
high-speed filling lines, he claims. 'The process involves no chemicals, no
toxics, no hazards to the ozone layer; in fact, no hazards at all. And the
can is fully recyclable.'
Patents for the technology have been filed and, after test-marketing, Joseph
expects to be ready for production within a year.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Fat profits for
pharmaceuticals - Drugs companies' approaches to the potentially huge
obesity market are weighed up by Paul Abrahams
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As surely as famine follows feast and hangovers follow New Year's Eve, the
decision to diet inevitably follows Christmas's excess calorific intake.
Help could be at hand from the pharmaceuticals industry, which believes the
potential market for drugs designed to assist weight loss could be huge.
In the US alone, anything between Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn) and Dollars 8bn
a year is spent on weight-loss products ranging from sports club memberships
to low-fat frozen food.
While the overall US weight-loss market is already immense, the prescription
pharmaceuticals market is tiny, worth between Dollars 50m and Dollars 70m.
The problem is that there is no widely accepted safe and effective
weight-loss drug available.
Undeterred, drugs groups are investing hundreds of millions of dollars to
develop safe, effective and non-addictive drugs that will assist weight
loss. New York-based industry consultants The Wilkerson Group believe the US
and European market for pharmaceutical obesity products could each be worth
Dollars 1bn by 2000.
If the idea of a safe, non-addictive weight-loss pill sounds attractive,
that is part of the drugs companies' problem. Regulators are worried that
the medicines, which will probably be licensed only for people medically
threatened by obesity, would be used in the more general population. Doctors
would come under intense pressure from non-obese patients to prescribe an
effective treatment.
The regulatory authorities are worried that any new drug could be abused in
the way that amphetamines were in the 1970s. These drugs are effective
appetite suppressants but were addictive, with serious side-effects.
Definitions of obesity change from country to country, warns Christine
Nathan, director of scientific affairs at Servier, the French drugs group.
Its incidence ranges from 10 per cent to 50 per cent of the population,
according to how it is measured. Technically, there is a difference between
being overweight and being obese, says Shade Cronan, associate consultant at
The Wilkerson Group. Overweight means excess poundage, while obese means
excess fat tissue. Probably about 8 per cent of the population in developed
nations is obese.
The causes of obesity are complex and multiple. The obvious one is a
long-term imbalance between energy intake and output, produced in two ways.
One is when the body's metabolism is too efficient - it needs very little
energy to sustain itself and therefore stores the excess as fat. The second
cause is that calorific intake is too great. This is often a behavioural
problem, but excessive intake can also be caused by medical disorders. When
empty or full, the gut produces different hormone peptides that act on a
region in the brain called hypothalamus. This contains feeding and satiety
centres that control the feelings of hunger or fullness.
The peptides released from the gut tell these centres in the brain whether
the body is hungry or satiated. Excess production of certain peptides leads
the feeding centre to believe the body is hungry when it has enough food. A
shortage of peptides acting on the satiety centre indicates the body is not
satiated when in fact it is. Activity in the hypothalamus is partly
regulated by neurotransmitting chemicals such as serotonin and dopamine,
although their precise mechanism is unknown.
Whatever the causes, obesity is medically dangerous.
Mervyn Busson, director of medical sciences at Boots Pharmaceuticals of the
UK says it is associated with increased mortality. 'Those seriously obese
have twice to 2 1/2 times the mortality of someone their own age of normal
weight.' The most common problems linked with obesity include non-insulin
dependent diabetes, high blood pressure, gall-bladder disease, and possibly
cancer.
Given the complexity of obesity, a number of different tacks have been
taken. Normal dieting and exercise are the most common methods. Heroic and
unpleasant means such as wiring people's jaws and surgery to cut out fat or
remove sections of the bowel have largely stopped.
In the pharmaceutical world, most attention has been directed towards
creating drugs designed to suppress appetite.
Amphetamines worked by interacting with the appetite centre, probably
through neurotransmitters in the brain such as dopamine and noradrenalin.
Following the problems associated with amphetamines, a second generation of
drugs called fenfluramines was developed. These also interact with the
neurotransmitters in the brain and are less addictive than the amphetamines,
but their use is not widespread. The best-selling compound is Servier's
Ponderax.
More recently, a new generation of appetite suppressants is awaiting
regulatory approval. These are selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors
(SSRIs) which increase levels of serotonin in the brain.
Eli Lilly deposited its dossier for its SSRI appetite suppressant Lovan with
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1988. The drug, which is
marketed as Prozac, an anti-depressant, has still not been approved for an
obesity indication.
Meanwhile, last May, Servier filed its FDA dossier for its SSRI Adifax. The
drug was developed in the US by Interneuron, a small biotechnology group,
and Lederle, the pharmaceutical division of American Cyanamid. The drug,
already available in Europe, is effective in about 40 per cent of patients,
and has limited effect in a further 20 per cent, according to Nathan.
Other SSRIs in development include Pfizer's anti-depressant Zoloft, and
Boots' sibutamine. Busson says his company's drug allows patients to sustain
weight-loss of 1lb to 1.5lb a week over extended periods compared with a
placebo.
Other means of suppressing appetite are also being explored. Some companies
are developing drugs to raise levels of gut peptides known as
cholecystokinins, or CCKs, which increase the sense of satiety.
Peter Johnson, research and development director at Fisons, the UK group,
says tests involving direct injection of CCK failed because the chemical has
a short half-life and quickly disappears. His group is developing a CCK
selective agonist which increases levels of the hormone either by increasing
production or reducing the speed it is broken down by the body. Abbott of
the US also has a CCK-agonist in pre-clinical development.
Other routes being explored include attempts to create drugs that increase
the metabolic rate. A number of companies are developing 'thermogenic'
agents such as beta3-agonists which may affect fat tissue. But progress has
been slow. Zeneca of the UK recently abandoned its thermogenic compound,
while SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American group, licensed its drug,
Fastin, to Mochida of Japan.
Another tack is to reduce intake of fat through the gut. Roche of
Switzerland has a compound in early development called Oristat. This is
believed to reduce production of enzymes in the gut that break down fat and
allow it to pass through the gut wall.
Shari Samotin, a principal at The Wilkerson Group, warns there is unlikely
to be a magic bullet. The causes are so complex that no one drug will work
in all patients. Most will need multiple therapies.
In spite of the demand, or maybe because of it, the latest generation of
drugs face substantial barriers before they reach the market. Unless the
long-term safety and efficacy of these drugs is proven, regulatory
authorities, particularly in the US, are likely to remain reluctant to
license these products for fear of huge demand from the non-obese public.
Nevertheless, the rewards for the first compound to be cleared are huge.
Weight loss drugs could lead to fat profits.
The series continues next month with a look at wound healing.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Technology: An X-ray provides proof of pudding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christmas in Finland means a cake with a gold coin in it - but how does the
manufacturer ensure that all consumers are given an even chance of finding
it?
One has solved the problem by using a new range of X-ray detection equipment
to ensure that the coin is close to the centre of the cake and not too near
the surface.
A similar difficulty, in reverse, is faced by producers of Christmas
puddings in the UK. How can they check for contamination by pieces of glass,
stone or metal in a dense mixture of fruit, nuts and suet?
TransTec, the Birmingham-based specialist engineering company, came to the
aid of the Finnish cake company and has just launched an X-ray machine with
which it is hoping to make waves in the food industry.
X-ray imaging of food has been available for some years, and simple metal
detection equipment for decades. But tougher food hygiene regulations and
scares about contamination of products such as baby food have combined with
developments in image processing technology to create a new market
opportunity, says Sami Ahmed, executive director of TransTec.
The food passes through Trans-Tec's Ultrascan System on a conveyor belt
travelling at up to 300ft a minute. The machine uses an image intensifier to
convert the X-ray beam - which is a tiny fraction of the amount used for
irradiating food - into an optical signal for analysis by an image
processing system supplied by Data Cell of Reading.
It takes about a week to work out the software for each food item, says Mark
Graves, an image processing expert at TransTec, but once programmed the
machine can switch between foods quickly.
It costs between Pounds 60,000 and Pounds 100,000. But TransTec hopes that,
once the food industry has been convinced that the machine will work
reliably, it will buy in bulk.
TransTec is now working on the next stage - which will use two detectors
working at right-angles to build up a 3-D image of the food. The UK company
and its European partners have received a Pounds 2m grant from the European
Union to develop the machine.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Institutions beef up their investments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Net investment by institutions rose sharply to a record Pounds 14.6bn in the
third quarter of the year, according to figures released by the Central
Statistical Office yesterday.
The figure takes the total for the first nine months to almost Pounds 40bn -
well ahead of estimates at the start of the year of Pounds 30bn over 1993 as
a whole. It suggests that the total for the year could be about Pounds 50bn,
compared with an actual Pounds 31.3bn for last year.
Although institutional net new investment in UK company securities fell by
Pounds 2.5bn to Pounds 4.1bn, compared with the second quarter, however,
investment by individuals through unit trusts rose.
Pension funds notably increased their cash and short-term assets by Pounds
1.5bn, and reduced their end-June holdings of UK company securities by
Pounds 800m during the quarter.
The FT-SE 100 index rose from just under 2900 when the market closed on July
1 to more than 3030 at the end of September.
In the third quarter total net investment by unit trusts rose Pounds 700m to
a record Pounds 3.2bn, and net investment by long-term insurance funds went
up Pounds 2.5bn to Pounds 7.8bn - its highest for almost two years.
There was a record increase in cash and short-term balances held by
institutions, which rose Pounds 4.1bn, after a fall of Pounds 1.6bn in the
second quarter.
Investment in UK gilts fell to Pounds 2.1bn after its record Pounds 5.6bn of
the previous quarter. One of the main factors in this was the lower net
investment by long-term insurance companies, down to Pounds 1.1bn from
Pounds 3.6bn in the second quarter.
The figures also showed continuing institutional investment in overseas
equities, which rose to Pounds 3.0bn in the third quarter.
Mr David Shaw, director of bonds and investment strategy at Legal &amp; General,
said the extent to which low interest rates would produce a readiness among
personal savers to transfer deposits out of banks and building societies
into other forms of investment, particularly single-premium products, had
been underestimated.
'It looks as if the willingness to move is greater than we all anticipated,'
he said.
He denied that the institutions had been left behind by the rise in the
market, saying that the current strength of the stock market was a sign that
the cash shown in the third quarter was being invested.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Gas supremo prepares to put competition proposals into
effect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the director-general of gas supply, will be the chief
figure in shaping the new gas market after the government's decision this
week to abolish British Gas' monopoly by 1998.
She will have to draw up the rules for the new market and then ensure that
it delivers the promised benefits. It is a daunting task after only two
months in the job.
She professes, however, to be wholly in tune with the proposals set out by
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary.
She said his decision 'mirrors exactly the ideas I put to the Department of
Trade and Industry. Millions of gas users will reap the rewards of greater
choice and lower prices flowing from the introduction of full-scale
competition.'
Her immediate task will be to put together a consultation paper on the new
arrangements in February. Central issues will be how to encourage new
suppliers to enter the market while at the same time safeguarding consumers'
rights to a gas supply. This will involve preparing terms for a gas supply
licence and drawing up a code of conduct for gas companies.
She will have to set a new level for price controls on gas supplied to the
tariff market. At present prices may rise only by the retail prices index
minus 5 percentage points.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission recommended that this be raised to RPI
minus 4 percentage points to compensate British Gas for the costs of
restructuring the market. Ms Spottiswoode pledged that once she had set the
new formula she would not tinker with it, so as to provide a certain
framework for the market.
In 1996, Ms Spottiswoode will have to launch the two-year transition to a
fully competitive market in domestic supplies by deciding how large a market
share new entrants can have at the initial stage. The indication given by Mr
Heseltine was that this would start at 5 per cent.
After 1998 the market will be completely liberalised. What is not yet clear
is whether price controls will persist after that date. That will depend on
whether Ms Spottiswoode is satisfied that competitive forces are strong
enough to shape prices by themselves.
She will also have to decide whether the internal separation of the various
parts of British Gas' business, as required by Mr Heseltine, is working
properly.
Ms Spottiswoode comes to the job with a strong belief in the virtues of
competition.
She believes Mr Heseltine was right to put a priority on abolishing British
Gas' monopoly rather than trying to break it up which would have meant
postponing the free market for several years.
She does not think that the issue of British Gas' structure will be a
long-term problem. She said: 'The changes being put in place by the company
are so fundamental it won't be a long-term issue. It will all be relatively
quick.' Although the MMC was keen to see British Gas split up, she said the
company was changing so fast that the commission would probably have come to
a different conclusion if it was conducting its investigation now.
She is also convinced that the de-regulated market will attract sufficient
competitors to make it work, and that fears that parts of the country might
be left without a gas supply are groundless. She said: 'I see a lot of
potential competition. There is no reason why suppliers should not want to
supply.'
Ms Spottiswoode made clear that she was not seeking the confrontational
approach of Sir James McKinnon, her combative predecessor. 'I see no
conflict in having a good professional relationship with British Gas and
being a tough regulator,' she said.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Specialist unions warned over merger danger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN and ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Small specialist trade unions are in danger of being swallowed up in the
wave of union mergers, a union official warned yesterday.
Mr Michael Bradley, general secretary of the General Federation of Trade
Unions which has 29 union affiliates with memberships totalling 200,000,
said the trend of small unions merging into larger ones was likely to
accelerate in 1994.
More unions would be under financial pressure to merge, he said, because of
the difficulties in administering the 'check-off' system which requires
written authorisation for subscriptions to be deducted by employers at
source. The burden of increasing administrative and financial
responsibilities on unions is concerning the Trades Union Congress which is
debating whether union mergers are the only answer to pressures on
resources.
Mr John Monks, the TUC general secretary, questioned in a discussion
document on the TUC's planned relaunch whether there was scope for unions to
share the provision of some services or to use their combined purchasing
power to get good deals from approved lists of suppliers.
Mr Bradley said that three unions in the federation had been absorbed by
union mergers in the past year and he expected more to opt for merger in the
coming year.
'Small unions have a number of advantages over larger ones, such as a higher
officer-to-member ratio, and we have to give them the confidence to remain
independent,' he said.
Meanwhile, the leaders of Britain's two largest unions expressed their
unease yesterday about the pace of radical reform being proposed for the
future structure of the TUC by Mr Monks.
Both Mr Bill Morris of the TGWU general union and Mr Alan Jinkinson,
general-secretary of Unison, the public services union, revealed their
anxieties at yesterday's TUC general council meeting that gave the go-ahead
for consultation on the plans before February 11.
While the two men said Mr Monk's plans were an 'important first step' and
their 'general direction was very good', they thought more time should be
spent on consultation. They also raised doubts about the composition and
powers of the proposed new TUC executive which will follow the abolition of
existing policy committees.
Mr Monks hopes to relaunch the TUC on March 1 but observers believe he may
have to compromise on the details if he wants to carry everybody with him.

FT  23 DEC 93 / People: Bond surfaces at Bullough
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Gordon Bond, who resigned earlier this month from Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the
Franco-British paper group, after a boardroom row, has been snapped up by
Bullough, the office products and refrigeration group.
Bond, whose resignation as chief executive of AWA's printing and writing
division disappointed institutional investors and sent the stock tumbling,
has been appointed chief executive at Bullough.
Bob Steel, who had been Bullough's managing director since 1988, is leaving
the company after 17 years.
Although in July the group announced sharply lower interim pre-tax profits,
it has since then been widely viewed as a recovery stock and its share
price, which jumped 13p to 150p yesterday, has been reaching 12-month highs.
The group confirmed that the operating profit, before exceptional items, is
expected to be above the level of last year 'by a useful margin'.
Bond, 52, joins Bullough after 10 years with Rank Xerox and 10 years at AWA.
He has wide experience as a director of manufacturing and marketing
organisations in all main European countries as well as the US.
At AWA he managed a European division between 1984 and 1988 and then the US
Appleton operations; he increased profits every year for nine consecutive
years and was widely regarded as one of AWA's most successful operational
directors.

FT  23 DEC 93 / People: Drake: putting BR Telecoms back on track
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The appointment of John Drake as chief executive of British Rail
Telecommunications marks another attempt by BR to get the privatisation of
its telecom subsidiary back on track.
BR has been looking to spin off BRT for some time as a potential competitor
to BT and Mercury in the UK's long-distance telecoms market. But the
previous chief executive, Peter Borer, left abruptly in October after
reported clashes with Sir Bob Reid, BR's chairman, over the sell-off plans.
Borer had been attempting to promote a management buy-out of BRT, but the
necessary private-sector backing for the venture does not appear to have
been forthcoming.
Drake, 42, will have to take BRT back to the drawing board. As the managing
director of GEC Marconi Transport Systems, he knows something of the
business.
But he will need to move quickly. The government wants to sell off BRT late
next year. Before then, responsibility for rail signalling safety passes
from BR to Railtrack, which will be free to employ other private-sector
suppliers besides BRT.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Duty calls drinkers to France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just a few cross-Channel shopping days to Christmas - and a sense of urgency
grips the crowded Dover to Calais ferries.
Swarms of foot passengers clamber aboard and station themselves
strategically at the entrance to the duty-free shop. Many of them clutch
folding trolleys to wheel away the bargains on offer.
The scrum starts as soon as the ship sails and lasts throughout the trip.
Shoppers emerge with a few cases of beer, a bottle of spirits and a pack of
cigarettes - and fortify themselves for the struggle to collect more spirits
and cigarettes on the return journey.
At Calais the ships disgorge the bigger spenders. The vehicles that roll off
towards the town include scores of rented Transit vans, a pick-up truck and
a black cab. There are cars towing trailers, old Post Office and British
Rail vans, and a horsebox.
Mr Bill Simpson, of Whitbread, who has been monitoring the beer run, says
there are a dozen warehouses and supermarkets catering for British shoppers.
Calais Chamber of Commerce estimated that British visitors would buy 80m
litres of beer in the pre-Christmas period. 'This trade,' said Mr Simpson,
'now represents a quarter of the total beer market in northern France.'
EastEnders, one of the biggest warehouses, run by Mr Dave West, a Londoner,
was sealed off this week by police who said he had not complied with
planning rules.
At Pidou cash-and-carry the drivers of four articulated lorries joined a
stream of buyers of Stella Artois and Kronenbourg beer at FFr45 to FFr49
(Pounds 5.20 to Pounds 5.66) for six litres.
Among mountainous stacks of cases at Beers R Us, 12 litres of super-strength
Skol lager was on offer at Pounds 14 - 'about the cost of duty in the UK',
said Mr Simpson.
At another warehouse one customer claimed to have bought Pounds 1,500-worth
of champagne as seasonal presents and to have saved Pounds 2,500 on his
usual bill. Another shopper was less fortunate. In a hurry, he loaded his
van with cases of bottles labelled Panache and learned back at the docks
that he was taking home a load of shandy.

FT  23 DEC 93 / People: In the wake of Andrew Crockett
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pen Kent, associate director of the Bank of England since 1988, is to
replace Andrew Crockett as a director of the Bank from the end of this
month. But Kent, 56, will not take over as director of the international
division, a post to be abolished in the new year.
As part of the Bank's efforts to untangle its convoluted allocation of
responsibilities - the first such effort since 1980 - the international
director's post will be abolished in January. This will leave senior staff
members in London to represent the Bank at whichever international forums
are most relevant to their duties in London. Former international directors
 -many of whom are now in the City - include Anthony Loehnis, Sir Kit
MacMahon and Sir Jeremy Morse.
The International Division, likely to be rechristened, will continue in a
more modest form, with the rejigging of responsibilities designed to bring
its work more into the mainstream of Bank politics.
Kent (left) will retain his existing responsibilities as the director for
finance and industry and for the Bank's printing works.
Ian Plenderleith, currently responsible for the Bank's monetary policy
operations, will add the work of Anthony Coleby to his brief when Coleby
retires at the end of February.
It has already been announced in Basle that Crockett is to take over as
general manager of the Bank for International Settlements from the beginning
of next year.

FT  23 DEC 93 / New man may tilt 'goodwill' decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Accounting Standards Board has appointed a new member who could tilt its
decision on the controversial treatment of goodwill.
The Financial Reporting Council, the parent body of the board, said
yesterday that Mr Ray Hinton, a partner with accountants Arthur Andersen,
had been appointed as the ninth member.
Goodwill - the difference between the price paid for a company and its net
assets - is likely to be one of the biggest tests for the board in the
coming months.
On Monday the board unveiled two alternative proposals on the topic after
admitting that it was unable to agree a common line. Its members were
divided 4-4, with one vacant seat caused by the recent resignation of Mr
Roger Munson of Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
Mr Hinton, whose appointment is for two years, has been an outspoken critic
of one of the suggestions - that goodwill should be capitalised on the
balance sheet and depreciated. He believes that goodwill should be written
off directly to reserves and not pass through the profit and loss account.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Major sees economic hope and 20p tax
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major talks up Britain's economic prospects in an interview
published today and speaks of his ambition to reduce the basic rate of
income tax to 20p.
The prime minister said in a Daily Telegraph interview there was the
'overwhelming probability' of a long period ahead of stable growth and low
inflation.
He set the long-term objective of nursery schooling for all children,
promised initiatives to improve inner-city education, pledged that the
welfare state was secure and promised that the state pension 'will continue
to maintain its real value'.
Mr Major was optimistic about Britain's economic potential and foresaw the
UK having a far better growth rate than any other European country in the
next two years.
He said it remained the government's ambition to widen the 20p lower band of
income tax until it became the basic rate of tax, replacing the 25p rate.
But the prime minister declined to set a deadline for achieving this.
'We will wait and see. We have to get the deficit down. It depends on what
happens in terms of growth in the economy.'
He foreshadowed a series of government initiatives next year to improve
inner-city education.
These would involve sending in special task forces, or education
associations, to run schools identified by the inspectors as a cause for
serious concern.
Mr Major said that increasingly people would retire with an occupational as
well as a state pension. He denied that the state pension would be a
trifling amount.
'Our commitment is that the state pension continues and it will continue to
maintain its real value,' he said.
'The welfare state is secure. I am not going to move away from the basic
tenets of the welfare state or the social security system.'

FT  23 DEC 93 / Building societies rap regulator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Building societies have clashed with their regulator over the way in which
the Cadbury code of corporate governance should apply to them.
Draft guidance from the Building Societies Commission has been severely
criticised by many societies. They say it goes beyond the recommend-ations
put forward by the Cadbury committee - which in any case were intended for
public limited companies - and fails to take into account their other
regulatory and statutory obligations.
More than a quarter of societies, including some of the largest, have
channelled their complaints through the Building Societies Association,
which responded to the draft guidance last week.
Its comments reflected concern that the guidance did not take account of the
different characteristics of the full range of societies, from smallest to
largest.
The association said that the commission's plans exceeded the Cadbury code
in, for example, requiring that boards include at least one member with
relevant professional expertise to direct a society's non-core activities,
such as commercial lending or a treasury operation.
The proposed guidance, issued as a draft prudential note, has also revived
the recent argument between societies and the commission over the way in
which it makes its recommend-ations.
Prudential notes have a particular status in the way that building societies
are regulated. Any society that does not comply with such a note normally
has to explain itself to the commission, and might also find its credit
rating affected.
Some society chief executives have already criticised the commission for
adopting too detailed and prescriptive an approach, for example in its draft
prudential note on lending.
Among other criticised aspects of the draft note on corporate governance
were the proposals that societies should meet more extensive reporting
requirements, and that audit committees should be made up entirely of
non-executive directors.
Societies said that requiring them to give details such as the term and
notice periods of service contracts and pension arrangements for directors
was undesirable. They argued that this would place them in a different
regime from the one proposed by the Cadbury code or the one in force under
Stock Exchange requirements.
They also said that their audit committees performed a different role from
companies' audit committees. Since they were primarily about inspection and
control systems, it was right that chief executives should be able to be
involved in their work.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Women rule the brainwaves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Women have made up the bulk of the recruits who have helped to expand
British universities in the past five years, government figures released
today show, John Authers writes.
Last year women were for the first time more likely than men to move on from
school to higher education. Female participation in full-time and part-time
education outstrips that of males at the ages of both 16 and 17. But
traditional attitudes are still present in the subjects which women study.
Only 1.6 per cent of 18-year-old women attempt A-level physics compared with
6 per cent of 18-year-old men, and more men than women take mathematics.
Business studies A-level is now more popular with women, however. This is
yet to be reflected in industry recruitment, where men are more than twice
as likely as women to be recruited. Among recruits to the teaching
profession there are almost three times as many women as men.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Accountants seek to have public-sector ban lifted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm, has approached the government in an
effort to have its long-standing ban from public-sector work lifted.
The firm has held discussions with senior Whitehall officials and
corresponded with the Treasury solicitor over possible breaches of European
law in its failure to be considered for tenders.
It has won no work for nearly a decade since the collapse of De Lorean, the
Northern Ireland-based car company. The government, which had provided De
Lorean with substantial grants, is suing Andersen for alleged negligence in
its role as auditor.
Officials have made it clear in meetings with the firm that it would receive
no contracts, and it has failed to win any tenders for the substantial
amount of privatisation, auditing and accounting work handed out to the
larger accountancy firms.
Andersen Consulting, which is autonomous in the UK although part of the same
global firm, has continued to receive public-sector work.
The approaches by Andersen in the past few months come in response to
European Union legislation enacted in Britain during the summer which
appears to place no restriction on tendering from firms being sued by
governments.
They also follow a different approach adopted by the government to Touche
Ross and Spicer &amp; Oppenheim, with which it merged.
In October the head of the government accountancy service wrote to senior
officials saying that no contracts should be awarded to 13 named partners
and staff at Touche Ross, although the firm itself has continued to win
work.
All those named were apparently in some way linked to the audit of Barlow
Clowes, the financial services firm closed by the Department of Trade and
Industry in 1988.
The government had to make large payments to investors and is seeking to
recover the funds through legal actions, including writs against Touche.
An EU council directive on 'the co-ordination of procedures for the award of
public service contracts' lists a number of reasons why firms might not be
considered for tenders. Outstanding legal action is not among them.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Political Notebook: Return to the real world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is an important lesson to be learnt from 1993 by those of us
interested in British politics.
The wider electorate does not share the preoccupations and judgments of
Westminster's chattering classes. Yet it is how Mr John Major's policies
play in the country, not in the clubs of SW1, that will determine the future
of his government.
The above may seem an obvious thought but it is too often overlooked even by
sophisticated practitioners of the black art. Take just a few examples from
these two, very separate, worlds of politics during the past 12 months.
During more than half of it politicians and commentators were obsessed by
ratification of the Maastricht treaty. At one dramatic point Mr Major and Mr
Douglas Hurd were set to resign if MPs had voted for something called the
social chapter.
The voters were completely indifferent to such shenanigans, save that they
reinforced their contempt for politicians so distracted from the real world
of economic recession.
More recently there has been Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget. The combination of
the most draconian spending squeeze for a decade and another hefty round of
tax rises left Conservative MPs howling with delight. Newspaper leader
writers praised it as a masterly political manoeuvre.
And the voters? They hated it. The opinion pollsters could find nobody on
the Clapham omnibus willing to describe the prospects of a cut in take-home
pay, a rise in their heating bills and longer hospital waiting lists as a
'skilful package'. Mr Major's government has yet to pay the price.
Nor is the electorate as stupid as often assumed in the political world of
Westminster. Remember the Newbury by-election back in May. The government
fought it on the basis that economic recovery was under way (technically, it
was).
Weighed down with negative equity and fearful of the dole queues, the voters
were enraged by such presumption. The Conservatives were kicked out. Mr
Norman Lamont followed a few weeks later.
The Christchurch debacle told a similar story. Mr Major said we would hardly
notice value added tax on fuel. Anyway, it was environmentally sound. The
biggest by-election swing against the Conservatives in 50 years provided the
voters' response.
Labour was not immune from flights of fancy. For Mr John Smith the biggest
event of 1993 was his confrontation at the party conference with the trade
unions. It was about something called 'one-member-one-vote', and had to do
with trades unionists selecting Labour candidates.
As the drama was played out in Brighton the more Neanderthal union leaders
said there was a dreadful threat to the historic links between party and
workers.
Mr Smith somehow managed to tell journalists he was determined to break free
from his paymasters while assuring union bosses they would get an even
bigger say under his new system. The row filled the evening news bulletins.
The voters switched channels to Neighbours.
Next year though, it will be different. The two worlds of politics will
converge during the summer when the electorate gets its chance to pass
judgment.
The local elections in May and the European elections in June will provide
the most important test of public opinion during the present parliament.
They will follow hard on the heels of the first tranche of promised tax
rises.
It was the crushing defeats on Mrs Margaret Thatcher's government in the
same elections back in 1989 that started to pull down the curtain on her
premiership.
So the conventional wisdom among the chatterers is that the outcome of next
year's polls will decide if Mr Major stays in 10 Downing Street. This time
they are probably right.
Ministers are already rehearsing arguments to soften the impact of defeat.
The local elections - this time concentrated in the big cities  - will
provide an unreliable guide to sentiment across the country. The European
elections, they add, always have a low turnout. And all governments, of
course, suffer from mid-term blues.
The voters - unlike the pundits - are unlikely to pay much attention to such
excuses. They will see the elections as an opportunity to pass judgment on
Mr Major and his government.
By supporting, or withholding support from, Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal
Democrats the electorate will have the chance also to tell us whether Mr
Smith offers a credible alternative. The real world of politics promises a
fascinating 1994.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Award of Pounds 16m made against valuers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John D Wood Commercial, a commercial estate agent, has been ordered in the
High Court to pay Pounds 16m in damages after being found negligent in its
valuations on three properties.
The case, which was brought by Banque Bruxelles Lambert and Eagle Star, is
one of a growing number of negligence claims against surveying practices
that stem from allegedly excessive valuations carried out in the volatile
property market of the late 1980s.
The litigation concerned a number of BBL's property loans that were insured
by Eagle Star, on which the borrowers subsequently defaulted. The judge
criticised the valuers for paying insufficient attention to the marketing
history of the buildings in making their valuations.
The valuations attached to the buildings greatly exceeded the price at which
they had earlier changed hands. In one example a building in Westminster was
valued at Pounds 44.35m after being bought a month earlier for Pounds 25.5m.
Mr Justice Phillips said BBL had shown contributory negligence, and cut its
damages by 30 per cent.
The judge also ruled that valuers could not be liable for the fall in
property values that resulted from the collapse in the property market. This
ruling was greeted by lawyers as a significant departure from the
traditional view about how damages should be assessed when it is found that
a loan would not have been made without the overvaluation.
The settlement, by which John D Wood is required to pay Pounds 10.8m to
Banque Bruxelles Lambert and Pounds 5.3m to Eagle Star, may not be covered
by its insurers. The agent's indemnity insurance is understood to have been
withdrawn by Zurich Insurance, its principal insurer, before the hearing.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Travel agents cut prices by 11%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The three largest travel agency chains yesterday signalled the start of a
post-Christmas price battle by announcing holiday discounts of 11 per cent.
The price-cutting campaign, which starts on Monday, is not likely to last
more than a few weeks as the high level of discounting means the chains will
be giving away virtually all of their profits.
Thomas Cook, the third-largest chain, fired the first shot yesterday by
offering 10 per cent off all its summer 1994 holidays. It said it would cut
the price of cruises by 15 per cent.
Its two larger rivals, Lunn Poly and Going Places, immediately offered
discounts of 11 per cent - forcing Thomas Cook to do likewise.
Going Places, made up of the former Hogg Robinson and Pickfords Travel
chains, is offering the discounts on its summer holidays only. Lunn Poly,
the market leader, is offering the discounts on summer and winter holidays.
All three chains stressed that the price campaign would be short. Lunn Poly
and Going Places said their campaigns would run for a week. Thomas Cook said
its offer would last 'for a limited period only'.
If Thomas Cook extends its offer beyond the first week the other two chains
will probably be forced to follow suit. As the average commission earned by
the large chains is about 11 per cent or 12 per cent on each holiday sold,
none of the retailers is keen to see the price cutting develop into a price
war.
Post-Christmas discounting in the travel industry is part of a pattern which
has emerged over the past year. In place of the ruinous price wars of
previous years the large chains have started to discount over shorter
periods and then return to more profitable price levels.
The most recent short discounting campaign took place in August.
The retailers' aim is to win market share from one another and encourage
holidaymakers to book earlier in the year, so improving the companies' cash
flow. They also want to try to disappoint customers who wait until the last
moment to book their summer holidays in the hope that retailers will be
forced to sell at distressed prices.
Thomas Cook said yesterday that hotel beds in Spain for next summer were
already difficult to find. It said it might end up selling 'late
availability' holidays to Spain at prices 'significantly higher than current
brochure rates'.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Review assists absent fathers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Absent fathers facing big increases in maintenance payments will be able to
pay the bills in stages over 18 months.
Mr Alistair Burt, social security minister, yesterday announced the plans as
part of several changes to the workings of the Child Support Agency.
The changes follow a review of the agency after widespread anger regarding
the formula used to calculate maintenance.
The new arrangements, which will come into force in February, apply to those
fathers already paying maintenance and who have second families. Among the
planned changes are:
An increase in the money absent parents can keep after maintenance is
deducted. That rises from Pounds 8 above income support levels to Pounds 30.
A reduction in the amount paid for children as they get older, by a quarter
at the age of 11 and by half at 14.
A cut in the additional amounts asked of absent parents who have paid the
full amount of basic maintenance in cases where there are only one or two
children involved.
An increase in the additional proportion of income just above the protected
minimum, which absent parents may keep to strengthen work incentives.
Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons social security
committee which recommended sweeping reforms to the workings of the agency,
yesterday welcomed the changes as a 'good first move'.
He warned that the committee would consider whether the proposed changes
were adequate and was reviewing the 'clean-break' divorce settlements, under
which a man leaves a property to his wife in lieu of maintenance payments.
Mr Donald Dewar, Labour's shadow social security secretary, said the changes
did not go far enough. They seemed to be a 'political solution to an awkward
problem' rather than the required fundamental review.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Judge rules SFO can withold papers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Serious Fraud Office should not have to give defence lawyers all
documents covered by widely drafted notices under Section 2 of the Criminal
Justice Act 1988 requiring banks to supply investigators with the relevant
papers, a judge ordered yesterday.
Lawyers for Mr Muhammed Naviede, the former head of the Manchester-based
Arrows trading group who has been accused of fraud, had argued that the SFO
should hand over all documents conceivably covered by the Section 2 notices.
This covered papers not seen by investigators because the banks had not
passed them on.
The situation arose because, under the working of the SFO's Section 2
powers, it is often left to banks to decide which documents are relevant to
a fraud investigation before handing them over. The defence lawyers had
argued that the SFO had 'constructive possession' of documents, if not
physical possession, even if it had decided they were not relevant to its
inquiry.
However, Judge Hawkins QC yesterday ruled that the SFO was not under any
obligation to provide papers in such circumstances.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Valuer told to pay Pounds 16m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John D Wood Commercial, a commercial estate agent, has been ordered in the
High Court to pay Pounds 16m in damages after being found negligent in its
valuations on three properties.
The case, which was brought by Banque Bruxelles Lambert and Eagle Star, is
one of a growing number of negligence claims against surveying practices
that stem from allegedly excessive valuations carried out in the volatile
property market of the late 1980s.
The case concerned a number of BBL's property loans insured by Eagle Star on
which the borrowers subsequently defaulted. Mr Justice Phillips criticised
the valuers for paying insufficient attention to the buildings' marketing
history.
The valuations attached to the buildings exceeded the price at which they
had earlier changed hands. In one example a building in Westminster, London
was valued at Pounds 44.35m after being bought a month earlier for Pounds
25.5m.
The judge said BBL had shown contributory negligence, and cut its damages by
30 per cent. He also ruled that valuers could not be liable for the fall in
property values that resulted from the collapse in the property market.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Lecturers threaten strike on contracts
</HEADLINE>

   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Talks between principals of further education colleges and the Natfhe
lecturers' union over new contracts broke up yesterday, John Authers writes.
Natfhe said it would ballot members on holding a national strike in the new
year. Mr Geoff Woolf, general secretary, said proposals over the length of
the working year had proved the sticking point. Under draft contracts from
the employers annual holiday leave would be halved.
The College Employers' Forum said it was willing to continue negotiations
before December 31, but only if Natfhe changed its position on the working
year.
Mr Gordon Scott, forum chairman, said that under the terms of the colleges'
budget Pounds 50m in grant would be withheld if flexible contracts were not
introduced. Natfhe's proposals were not sufficiently flexible to gain the
extra grant.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Surprise ruling on pensions bias
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK company pension schemes can continue to use life expectancy tables which
distinguish between men and women for the purpose of calculating benefits
after an unexpected decision by the European Court of Justice yesterday.
The Luxembourg Court's ruling that European equal-pay rules do not extend to
non-pension benefits, such as tax-free lump sums on retirement and transfer
payments, means UK employers will be able to quantify the main cost
implications of the court's 1990 Barber judgment.
In the Barber case the court ruled that pension benefits of men and women
had to be equalised as they constituted pay for the purposes of the Treaty
of Rome equal-pay rules.
Yesterday's decision was a disappointment for Mr David Neath, whose claim
against his former employer Hugh Steeper, the Leeds artificial-limb
manufacturer, was backed by the Equal Opportunities Commission and the MSF
white-collar union.
Mr Neath was made redundant in 1990 at the age of 54 and was offered the
alternative of a deferred pension or a transfer payment.
He said the company pension scheme discriminated against men by calculating
pensions on the basis that they would be paid at 65, as against 60 for
women, and by using different actuarial assumptions in calculating transfer
payments.
The scheme offered him a pension payable from 65 or a transfer payment of
Pounds 30,672. But if the transfer payment had been calculated by reference
to a retirement age of 60 it would been Pounds 39,934. If female actuarial
factors were also used it would have increased to Pounds 41,486.
The court ruled that these issues were all determined by the funding
arrangements for the pension scheme chosen by the employer and were not
therefore covered by the equal-pay rules.
Mr Robert West, of Hugh Steeper's solicitors Baker &amp; McKenzie, said the
decision resolved one of the few outstanding issues on sex discrimination in
pension schemes and would be welcomed by employers which, contrary to
expectations, would not have to use non-discriminatory life expectancy
tables in future.
The Confederation of British Industry said: 'The possibility of unisex
factors in occupational pensions was causing concern to employers because
they would not reflect the reality of different life expectancies between
the sexes.'

FT  23 DEC 93 / Consumer optimism hit by Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Confidence among consumers that the economy will improve has increased but
Mr Kenneth Clarke's first Budget has added to fears that they will be worse
off next year, says Gallup, the market research group.
Gallup's latest survey of consumer confidence, carried out just after the
Budget, showed that people were more concerned about household finances than
at any time in the past 3 1/2 years.
The poll of 1,986 adults between December 2 and December 14 found that 37
per cent expected their own financial position to worsen next year compared
with 19 per cent anticipating an improvement. The resulting balance of minus
18 per cent was 3 percentage points worse than in November and the lowest
since April 1990.
The survey registered less pessimism about unemployment and the economy in
general, however. Although those expecting the economy to improve in the
next 12 months were still in a minority, December's negative balance of 9
per cent was less than November's 14 per cent.
Just over half those polled (54 per cent) expected unemployment would rise
next year, compared with 19 per cent expecting a fall. But the resulting
negative balance of 35 per cent was 8 points less than in November.
Consumers thought by a slim margin that now was a good time for making a big
purchase. However the poll suggested people would spend less on big items
next year than during this year.

The Independent Television Commission has cleared the way for television
advertising for the National Lottery - something that would be prevented
under present rules.
The commission has decided to amend its code of advertising standards and
practice.
Television programmes designed as promotional vehicles for the lottery,
which is due to launch late next year or early in 1995, will not be allowed.
Codes forbidding 'undue prominence' of goods and services in programmes will
remain in place, but the ITC has decided that it will be possible to
incorporate a lottery draw in 'suitable programming', such as a light
entertainment show.
This will only be possible where:
There have been no financial inducements to the programme maker or licensee.
No other programme elements - other than the draw - can be supplied by the
National Lottery.
Editorial control must remain with the broadcaster.
The commission also suggests that it may be possible for the National
Lottery operator to sponsor programmes on ITV or Channel 4.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Currencies' Summer of Discontent: Faultlines show in
Franco-German unity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The moment of truth for Europe's exchange rate mechanism came on Friday July
30 at a secret meeting of French and German ministers and officials in
Paris. David Marsh tells the story of this bruising encounter and of other
summer crisis meetings that reveal an extraordinary clash of policy and
psychology between two governments which were previously renowned for their
co-operation
When Mr Theo Waigel and Mr Edmond Alphandery, the German and French finance
ministers, sat down in Paris at secret midsummer talks to save the franc,
international currency markets were close to boiling over.
The D-Mark/franc exchange rate, the core of the 14-year-old European
monetary system, was rapidly melting under the impact of massive world-wide
sales of the French currency. At one stage, the Bank of France was selling
Dollars 100m a minute in borrowed foreign exchange in a frantic effort to
stop its currency falling through its floor of FFr3.4305 to the D-Mark in
the exchange rate mechanism.
Yet, as top delegations from the French and German finance ministries and
central banks struggled in vain to resolve the crisis, the mood in Mr
Alphandery's conference room on the banks of the Seine grew steadily
frostier.
The ERM's moment of truth came on Friday July 30 at Bercy in eastern Paris,
behind the closed doors of the French Finance Ministry's headquarters. The
meeting had been hastily arranged the previous evening at the personal
intervention of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the German leader, and Mr Edouard
Balladur, the French prime minister who had staked his political future on
upholding the franc.
The talks came 60 hours before European finance ministers, after a weekend
of emergency discussions in Brussels, announced a sharp widening of ERM
fluctuation bands to shield the system from currency speculation.
The story of the Bercy talks, and of other undisclosed crisis meetings
during the summer, has been assembled from conversations with participants
from both the German and French sides. It reveals an extraordinary clash of
policy and psychology between two governments previously renowned for their
monetary co-operation.
In the five months since the ERM flare-up, the French and German governments
have maintained their political support for Europe's efforts to develop the
ERM into economic and monetary union, in line with the Maastricht treaty.
Additionally, the link between the D-Mark and the franc has been partly
reforged. The French currency this month has regained its pre-crisis level
against the D-Mark, climbing back above its former floor in the previous
'narrow-band' ERM.
However, it will take longer to rebuild a political consensus between the
two countries on turning Emu into reality.
The ERM had already erupted several times in the previous 12 months.
Hitherto, the high point of unrest and acrimony had been in September 1992,
when Britain and Italy were forced to leave the system. Amid accusations
from the UK government that the Bundesbank had deliberately tried to scuttle
sterling's ERM link, Mr John Major, the prime minister, launched an attack
on 'faultlines' in the ERM. Even by the stormy standards of past ERM
tussles, the Bercy meeting was remarkably tense.
Mr Alphandery and Mr Jacques de Larosiere, the governor of the Bank of
France, wanted the four visiting Germans - including Mr Helmut Schlesinger,
the Bundesbank president - to pump lifeblood into the ERM.
Instead, the French bore helpless witness to the biggest one-day haemorrhage
of monetary reserves in history.
At the meeting, the French turned down Germany's suggestion of an immediate
suspension of ERM intervention. Instead, they proposed that the D-Mark
should leave the exchange rate mechanism. The suggestion was rejected by Mr
Waigel's team on the grounds it would 'singularise' the Germans as the cause
of ERM tensions.
European financial markets were already in a state of unusual turbulence
when the Germans arrived at the Finance Ministry at 10.30am on July 30. They
had endured an uncomfortable hour-long journey in a minibus, driving through
the Paris traffic from Villacoublay military airport south-west of Paris.
Two hours earlier, as the German delegation took off for Paris from
Bonn-Cologne airport in a 10-seater German air force Challenger aircraft,
the Bank of France had already started to borrow large amounts of foreign
exchange to sell for francs.
As the talks progressed in the Finance Ministry, a messenger arrived at
regular intervals, bringing up-to-the minute reports of the Bank of France's
sharply rising drawings on its large 'swap' credit from the German
Bundesbank. The bilateral credit had been operating at sporadic intervals
for at least a year.
By lunchtime, when the talks petered out without agreement, the credit - for
a total of about DM30bn - was exhausted.
By the end of the day the total amount of foreign exchange deployed by the
Bank of France to try to hold the franc's ERM parity is thought to have
exceeded FFr300bn. Heavy foreign borrowing, from the Bundesbank and other
central banks, wiped out France's foreign currency reserves, leaving the
bank with a net deficit of more than FFr180bn.
The dramatis personae at Bercy included some of Europe's most experienced
monetary officials. Apart from Mr Waigel and Mr Schlesinger, the German side
included Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank deputy president, and Mr Gert
Haller, state secretary at the Bonn Finance Ministry. Mr Tietmeyer has
subsequently taken over the Bundesbank helm, moving to the president's job
in October on Mr Schlesinger's retirement.
Accompanying Mr Alphandery and Mr de Larosiere (now president of the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development) were Mr Jean-Claude
Trichet, director of the French Treasury (now governor of the Bank of
France), and Mr Herve Hannoun, the bank's deputy governor. Two interpreters
were present, although part of the conversations were carried out in English
to ease communication.
Significantly, Mr de Larosiere led negotiations for the French side. Mr
Alphandery - who in June had irritated the Germans by making a rash and
counter-productive public statement calling on the Bundesbank to cut
interest rates - took little detailed part in the meeting.
The session at Bercy was the second top-level Franco-German get-together in
eight days. The two delegations had met at another, more productive, secret
meeting late in the evening on July 22 at the Hotel Marriott in Munich. They
agreed to increase the ceiling of the swap credit between the Bundesbank and
Bank of France, and to co-ordinate interest rate policies to help steady the
franc.
The next day, July 23, the Bank of France raised its key overnight borrowing
rate to 10 per cent - intensifying an already severe monetary squeeze and
heightening Mr Balladur's political problems caused by recession and 3m-plus
unemployment. The two governments issued a joint statement pledging support
for the franc's ERM parity.
If the Munich talks signalled the start of the countdown to crisis, the
Paris meeting marked the explosion. Just a day after widespread surprise
that the Bundesbank's decision-making council, at its regular fortnightly
meeting on July 29, failed to cut its key discount rate (then standing at 6
3/4 per cent) to assist the franc, Mr Waigel's delegation resisted French
pressure for fresh interest rate cuts and extra Bundesbank support
intervention.
The hastily arranged nature of the Munich and Paris meetings led to
inevitable mishaps and misunderstandings, adding to the difficulties of
reaching an agreement.
For the July 22 talks in the Hotel Marriott, which extended into the early
hours, Mr Schlesinger flew to Munich in a small private aircraft from his
holiday home in Greece. He arrived only at midnight, after hold-ups on the
journey. Through an oversight, the German government failed to arrange
transport at Munich airport to pick up Mr Alphandery and the other
high-ranking French visitors. They had to pay their own taxi fares to the
hotel in the Munich district of Schwabing.
Similarly, on July 30, there was no official French government reception
team on hand when Mr Waigel's delegation reached Villacoublay airport.
In view of the need for discretion, they were given neither limousines nor a
motorcycle escort. This was almost certainly not a riposte - as some of the
German delegation suspected - for the transport mix-up in Munich. However,
the lateness of the German team's arrival at Bercy did nothing to improve
the warmth of the talks or the likelihood of a meeting of minds.
At the outset, Mr de Larosiere asked the Bundesbank to agree interest rate
cuts for the following week on its securities repurchase agreements - the
main method by which it channels funds to the banks.
He also urged the Bundesbank to buy unlimited amounts of francs against
D-Marks to stop the French currency hitting its lowest permitted level of
FFr3.4305.
The Germans' response was acid. Although the Bundesbank the previous day had
left its discount rate unchanged, it had cut by  1/2 point to 7 3/4 per cent
the less significant Lombard rate, which sets a ceiling for German money
market rates. This, Mr Schlesinger felt, went slightly further than the
steps outlined at the July 22 meeting at the Hotel Marriott.
As for the request for unlimited intervention, Mr Schlesinger repeated the
Bundesbank's long-standing opposition to taking part in such so-called
'intra-marginal' support for currencies before they reached their ERM
floors.
The debate about intra-marginal intervention soon became academic. At
11.00am, half an hour after the talks started, the franc fell to its D-Mark
floor. This sparked off obligatory franc purchases by both central banks,
with the Bank of France able to borrow unlimited quantities of foreign
exchange under automatic ERM short-term lending facilities.
The Germans favoured lifting the obligation to intervene, which would have
entailed closing the official lunchtime 'fixing' of European currencies.
This option, which would have needed the agreement of all Germany's European
partners, had already been discussed informally with Mr Wim Duisenberg,
president of the Netherlands central bank, and chairman of the committee of
European central bank governors. It could be coupled, the Germans believed,
with a joint Franco-German declaration convening the European monetary
committee in Brussels the next day.
Such a move, the Germans argued, would save the French large-scale reserve
losses caused by foreign exchange intervention. The French, however, knew
that suspending the ERM in the middle of the trading day would be
interpreted as an overwhelming defeat for Paris. They responded that central
banks had a duty to maintain a market for the ERM currencies.
When the US exchange markets opened during the European afternoon,
intervention to keep the franc within its ERM band picked up momentum. As a
result, the scale of intervention to defend the franc at the end of July
appears to have been more than twice the estimated Pounds 16bn spent by the
Bank of England when Britain left the ERM on 'Black Wednesday', September 16
1992.
Immediately after the Paris talks, Mr Waigel and his three companions flew
to another secret meeting to plan the next steps with Chancellor Kohl.
Flying via Bonn and Frankfurt to Salzburg in two aircraft, they arrived at
about 5pm at the chancellor's rented holiday house in the Austrian village
of St Gilgen am Wolfgangsee.
At least one of Mr Kohl's summer visitors feared the chancellor might try to
persuade the Bundesbank to ease monetary policy to shore up the
Franco-German political alliance. Instead, Mr Kohl was unexpectedly relaxed,
agreeing with the idea - already voiced informally by the Bundesbank several
months earlier - that the ERM should escape the currency market storms by
moving to wider bands.
The following day, on July 31, the European Community's monetary committee,
linking Finance Ministry and central bank officials from the 12 member
countries, assembled to discuss the crisis in an anonymous European
Commission building in Brussels.
After a frenetic weekend search for compromise, finance ministers announced
in the early hours of August 2 that all currencies except the D-Mark and
Dutch guilder were abandoning their existing 2 1/4 per cent fluctuation band
and moving to 15 per cent.
Almost to the end of the Brussels meetings, France maintained its line that
Germany should leave the ERM. The Paris government consented to the wider
margins plan only after a telephone conversation between Mr de Larosiere in
Brussels and Mr Balladur in Paris, which took place between 11pm and
midnight on August 1. They agreed that the bands should be set at 15 per
cent.
This was greater than the original German suggestion of 6-8 per cent.
However, Mr de Larosiere told the Germans that setting the bands at a
narrower level would be like offering speculators 'slices of meat on the
table'.
Because of the pro-German solidarity of the Benelux countries, the French
plan to eject Germany from the ERM was doomed from the start. Already on
July 31, unknown to the French, the German and Dutch governments concluded
an agreement that, whatever happened, the guilder  - the ERM's second
hardest currency - would remain firmly bound to the D-Mark. Later, Belgium
and Denmark said they also wanted to follow the D-Mark.
The French thus ended up with the untenable policy of promoting a rump ERM
from which the strongest members would have departed.
As the Bundesbank never tires of pointing out, the Maastricht treaty's Emu
plan requires participating countries to display far-reaching political
solidarity in uniting not only their currencies, but also their economic
policies. In summer 1993, however, France and Germany put on a display not
of solidarity but of miscalculation and wounded pride.
Yet there was also a curious air of fatalism to the drama, as if both sides
were conducting a ritual with a pre-ordained outcome. As one participant at
the Munich and Bercy meetings observes: 'It was like a Greek tragedy. All
the characters were destined to play out a part. You couldn't really imagine
that they would do anything else.'
Another participant says the outcome could have been averted had a
full-scale realignment taken place in 1991 or 1992 involving a D-Mark
revaluation, an idea which had always been hotly opposed by the French (and
never put on the agenda by the German government). By July 1993, this
official believes, the narrow-band ERM was beyond repair.
Particularly because of the widespread feeling that the September 1992 ERM
crisis had been mishandled, the Germans were eager to show the French that
the Bundesbank would play a constructive role in assisting the franc. Yet,
when it came to the crunch, neither the French nor the Germans were prepared
to make essential concessions to maintain the narrow-band ERM.
At Bercy, and at the earlier meeting in Munich, the two sides wanted to
demonstrate that the alliance was still intact. As one German participant at
the Munich and Paris talks puts it: 'Each time we sought to resolve the
situation. We understood that it (the D-Mark/franc rate) was a cornerstone
of their policy.'
The Germans had self-interested reasons for seeking to maintain France's
firm exchange rate commitment. A sharp devaluation, of the sort carried out
by Britain and Italy, would have damaged further German exporters' already
poor competitiveness.
Both during the pressure on the franc which followed the Anglo-Italian ERM
exit, and during another squall in January 1993, the French and Germans had
invested large amounts of political and economic capital in preserving the
D-Mark/franc parity.
The level of contacts in July 1993 contrasted sharply with the lack of any
top-level personal exchanges between Britain and Germany in the crucial few
days before Britain's ERM departure in September 1992.
Another important difference with the UK was that - in view of France's good
anti-inflation record - both sides believed there was no need to make any
changes to the franc's central parity against the D-Mark.
There was, however, a critical sticking point. The Bundesbank was concerned
not to upset French feelings. But the fiercely independent central bank was
even more anxious not to lose anti-inflation credibility by being dragooned
into 'political' interest rate cuts.
Mr Schlesinger had especially sensitive memories of the weekend of September
12/13 1992, when Italy devalued the lira four days before leaving the ERM,
along with sterling. Over that weekend the Bundesbank decided to cut
interest rates to help persuade Italy to devalue. The episode was
interpreted, particularly in Germany, as infringing Bundesbank independence.
In the past the Bundesbank had made behind-the-scenes interest rate
concessions to accompany ERM realignments, notably on the occasion of the
ERM realignment in January 1987, which was the last time the D-Mark/franc
parity had been changed. However, the September 1992 affair was the first
time that such monetary deal-making had become public knowledge.
In his 41-year-long career at the German central bank, Mr Schlesinger had
developed a strong mistrust of the inevitable dilemmas created for domestic
monetary policies by fixed exchange rate systems.
When currency turbulence erupted anew in July, he was determined that,
whatever method was chosen for resolving the dilemma, it should not
jeopardise the Bundesbank's reputation for independence.
The Bundesbank's ambivalence about the monetary relationship with the French
surfaced in revealing fashion on July 29, the day before the talks at Bercy.
At the fateful meeting of its council that day, Mr Tietmeyer, more mindful
of Franco-German sensitivities than Mr Schlesinger, suggested a  1/4 point
cut in the discount rate, but was overruled by his president.
In a gesture to help the French, Mr Schlesinger did agree that, in addition
to the  1/2 point cut in the Lombard rate, the Bundesbank would allow its
money market rates to fall in coming days below the 6 3/4 per cent discount
rate.
Mr Schlesinger clearly feared, however, that, if this measure was given too
much publicity, it would have looked like submission to political pressure.
As a result he announced the potentially important step in an off-the-record
briefing, on the afternoon of July 29, with a small group of German
newspaper journalists, rather than through an open statement that would have
been relayed to the foreign exchanges by news agencies.
By the time the measure had become public knowledge the next day, it had
already been overtaken by the worldwide flurry of franc sales.
The summer discord between France and Germany throws shadows into the
future. Before he took over as president 2 1/2 months ago, Mr Tietmeyer told
a long-time colleague that the Bundesbank should have been 'more courageous'
in easing its interest rate policies during the summer.
Nonetheless, Mr Tietmeyer agreed it had become necessary to break
'illusions' about Germany's willingness to provide an automatic open-ended
commitment to the franc.
Now that European exchange rates have settled down after the summer storms,
France and Germany are likely to use their new monetary leeway to continue
interest rate cuts as a means of promoting economic recovery.
There is little prospect for a speedy formal return to ERM narrow bands. But
the German Finance Ministry believes the franc will remain firm in coming
months, especially since the dollar is likely to strengthen and the D-Mark
will remain burdened by worries about financing reunification.
Bonn officials hope a firmer franc, combined with a gradual European
recovery, will lower French pressure for an 'artificial' dash to monetary
union - a prospect viewed with distaste by much of the German electorate.
On this reading, the shattering of Franco-German illusions could have a
salutary effect. As Europe struggles to rebuild the project for monetary
union, economic reality has established primacy over political vision. The
chronicle of bruising encounters and spurned hopes of summer 1993
demonstrates that the dividing line between the feasible and the impossible
can sometimes be excruciatingly thin.

Taiwan and China yesterday ended five days of talks without resolving the
problem of frequent hijackings of Chinese aircraft to Taiwan, reports Dennis
Engbarth from Taipei. The two sides could not agree on mutually acceptable
language for an agreement in principle that hijackers should be repatriated.
Nine Chinese aircraft have been hijacked to Taiwan this year. The failure
underlines the difficulty which the two sides will have as 'unofficial'
contacts gather pace. The talks were the third round of negotiations on
practical issues agreed by Taiwan's strait exchange foundation and China's
association for relations across the Taiwan strait in April.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Hosokawa's star begins to fade as coalition looks vulnerable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Support for the cabinet of prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa has plummeted by
10 percentage points over the past month to 60 per cent, according to a
survey yesterday by the Asahi Shimbun daily newspaper. Formerly, Mr Hosokawa
was the most popular prime minister since the second world war.
The survey's publication coincided with a fresh split in the Social
Democrats, the largest party in the coalition, which appears to be preparing
to divide into two parties with uncertain allegiances.
In an attempt to restore flagging public confidence, Mr Hosokawa plans to
announce tomorrow an outline plan to stimulate the economy, said government
officials. An economic package was embarrassingly shelved earlier this month
due to splits in the seven-party coalition and opposition from the
conservative finance ministry.
Mr Hosokawa also intends to apologise for failing his election pledge to
pass plans to reform Japan's corruption-prone political system by the end of
the year, said officials. Delaying tactics by the traditionalist wing of the
opposition Liberal Democratic party forced Mr Hosokawa to extend the
parliamentary session to January 29.
Yesterday's poll confirms that the government's popularity is firmly in
decline, first indicated in a survey two weeks ago. The change of fortunes
occurred soon after the government outmanoeuvred the LDP last month to ram
the political reform bills through the lower house.
The LDP, which ran Japan for 38 years until Mr Hosokawa's arrival last
summer, counter-attacked by impeding the plans in the upper house and by
putting pressure on the government to switch its attention from reform to
the economy.
To make matters worse, Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the government's powerful backroom
negotiator, has temporarily taken a back seat. Associates say Mr Ozawa is
recuperating from exhaustion and influenza, rather than plotting his next
political move, as speculated by the popular press.
A further sign of the coalition's fragility emerged yesterday with the
formation of a 40-strong study group of moderate and right wing members of
the Social Democratic Party, the coalition's largest and most troublesome
member.
Previously, study groups like this have been precursors to factions or new
parties. This group, called the Democrats, is understood to be seeking
members from other parties, including the LDP.
The SDP's recent ability to overcome left wing members' opposition to
opening the rice market indicates that it values power enough to control
internal differences. But the study group is a sign that the coalition will
not last long once it has achieved political reform, the only task on which
its members more or less agree, believes Mr Jeff Young, political analyst at
Salomon Brothers Asia.

FT  23 DEC 93 / South African MPs vote to end minority rule: Deadlock
remains over attempt to draw black and white right wing into constitutional
process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAPE TOWN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The South African parliament yesterday voted formally to end three centuries
of white minority rule, adopting a non-racial constitution despite
opposition from black and white right-wing groups.
Cries of 'traitor' broke out from the parliamentary seats of the ultra-right
Conservative Party, while independent legislators who support the African
National Congress shouted 'amandla', or power, foreshadowing the bitter
political battles to be fought before next April's multi-racial elections.
Though negotiators from the government, the ANC and the right-wing parties
managed to avoid a permanent rupture when last minute talks ended on the eve
of the vote, their negotiations remain at an impasse. In three days of
intensive talks this week, no substantive progress was made to persuade the
right wing to accept the transition to majority rule. The negotiators' main
achievement was to open the door to continued talks, with a new deadline of
January 24 for agreeing amendments to the constitution passed yesterday in
parliament.
'The process never ends,' government chief negotiator Roelf Meyer said at
the literal and metaphorical midnight hour when the deadline passed for
amending the constitution before yesterday's vote. Indeed, the process has
not ended: negotiators from the Freedom Alliance, the right wing umbrella
group, will take a proposal to their principals to allow talks to resume in
the new year. But that proposal covers only the process, not the substance
of a deal: it would commit the Alliance to participate in elections and the
Transitional Executive Council, if their constitutional demands were met.
But it goes no way toward dealing with the substance of those demands.
While the Inkatha Freedom Party, one of the most important Alliance members,
has reached a measure of agreement with the government on amending the
constitution to increase the powers of regions, less common ground seems to
exist with the ANC. With the balance of power having decisively shifted
toward the ANC after adoption of what is close to a majority rule
constitution, no deal can be done with the Freedom Alliance unless the ANC
supports it.
Some political analysts doubt the ANC's bona fides in seeking a deal with
Inkatha. It seems more committed to placating the white right wing. There is
no doubt that further delay acts to the short-term political advantage of
the ANC and the government, whose election campaign plans are well advanced,
and to the detriment of those parties who formally enter the race at a later
stage (parties must lodge election lists in February).
The ANC and the government are apparently hoping the delay will further
strain the Freedom Alliance, and cause it to split - the best possible
outcome for them as politicians. But if, as the rhetoric from both sides
suggests, they are also keen to act as statesmen and ensure an all-inclusive
constitutional settlement, their tactics of brinkmanship and ultimatums may
yet backfire. Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi of Inkatha is unpredictable at the
best of times, never more so than when his back is against the wall.
Many ANC and government negotiators seem strangely unconcerned by Chief
Buthelezi's ability to disrupt the election, if he finally decides to
boycott it. ANC officials worry more about the threat from the white right
wing, especially the Conservative Party and the paramilitary Afrikaner
Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement) - but they were not
concerned enough to ensure that constitutional amendments on Afrikaner
self-determination went into the constitution, to give effect to an
important ANC/right wing declaration of intent on an Afrikaner homeland.
That deal was to have been signed on Tuesday, but it fell apart when the
broader right wing talks failed.
Some ANC negotiators say they believe that Inkatha and much of the white
right will participate in elections, whether or not their constitutional
concerns are met, and that it is not worth giving away too much to woo
parties who have no realistic option but to fight elections anyway.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Bombay scam puts minister under threat

India's health minister was under pressure from the opposition to resign
yesterday after being heavily criticised in a parliamentary report on the
Rs40bn (Pounds 850m) Bombay securities market scandal.
The report, published on Tuesday, said Mr B. Shankaranand, when oil minister
and chairman of the Oil India Development Board, a state enterprise, had
violated prudential norms in his personal supervision of the board's
investments. The board deposited Rs2.08bn with investment companies which
have since defaulted on repayments.
The joint parliamentary committee's report was a comprehensive indictment of
India's financial system, including the ministry of finance, the Reserve
Bank of India (the central bank), stockbrokers and commercial banks,
particularly foreign banks.
It urged the government to suspend the banking licences of ANZ Grindlays of
Australia, Standard Chartered Bank of the UK, and Citibank and Bank of
America of the US.
Standard Chartered, which suffered a Pounds 305m loss from the scam, said it
was 'surprised and disappointed' by the report's conclusion that foreign
banks originated the scam and were the 'biggest players'. 'We would strongly
dispute that,' a spokesman in London said, adding that the contention was at
odds with the evidence laid out in the report itself.
The spokesman said: 'It would be very unjust for foreign banks to be singled
out for possible stringent penalties unless similar action is taken against
Indian banks which are proved to have been involved in similar
irregularities.'
Yesterday, shares in Australia and New Zealand Banking Corporation, the
Melbourne-based institution whose ANZ Grindlays operation was one of four
foreign banks slammed by the committee, fell about 2 per cent.
Mr Don Mercer, ANZ's chief executive, said it was difficult to comment
without having seen the report, but added: 'Early indications are that it
contains no new material'. He said the bank was concerned by 'the apparent
implication that foreign banks behaved in any way differently from local
banks in relation to market practices at the time'.
Citibank's Bombay office said it now complied with all internal and external
regulatory requirements.
The Indian parliament will debate the report today. The Bharatiya Janata
Party, the right-wing Hindu opposition party, urged the government to take
action against Mr Shankaranand.
In Bombay, India's commercial capital, reaction to the report was muted.
Commercial bankers said the central bank would be under pressure sooner or
later to respond to the report, which condemned it for lax supervision of
the markets.
On the Bombay Stock Exchange, there was no trading for a seventh day because
of a strike by brokers protesting against a planned clampdown on forward
trading by the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the markets watchdog.
A senior BSE official said the exchange would follow up the criticisms made
in the parliamentary report. MPs reserved some of their toughest comments
for the stock market which they said was racked by insider trading, poor
transparency and routine flouting of regulations.
The parliamentary committee spent over a year investigating the affair,
which erupted in April 1992 when evidence emerged that money was being
illegally siphoned out of banks and into the stock market. The scandal
resulted in a cabinet minister's resignation and the arrest of leading
businessmen and brokers.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Business confidence plummets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese finance ministry's index of large companies' business
confidence hit a record low of minus 21.8 in the quarter from September to
December, down from 18.6 in the previous three month period.
But medium sized companies and service industries reported a slight
improvement, offering a glimmer of hope for Japan's embattled government,
whose popularity is starting to suffer from its failure to tackle the
recession.
A majority of the sample of just over 11,000 businesses thought conditions
would improve in the next few months.
Corporate profits in the three months to the end of September fell by 21.6
per cent from the same period a year earlier, declining for a record 13
quarters running, said the ministry.
However, the problems ahead were underlined yesterday by the latest poor
statistics from the car industry, confirming heavy surplus capacity. The
Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association estimated that production in the
first 11 months of the year reached 10.4m vehicles, down 9.5 per cent on the
same period in 1992.
Jama believes output for the year will reach 11.2m units, which compares
with maximum production of 13.2m vehicles. Output in November fell 12 per
cent against 1992.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Provincial riots point to Argentina's economic weaknesses:
John Barham reports on the first serious challenge to Menem's reform
programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Calm has returned to Argentina's remote province of Santiago del Estero, but
the problems that touched off the worst violence seen since hyperinflation
gripped the country in 1989 still remain.
A week ago about 5,000 people rampaged through the provincial capital.
Unchallenged by police, they burned the governor's palace, the legislature
and courthouse. They ransacked and set fire to the homes of politicians and
looted stores.
Rioting started when the government said it would not pay wages due since
September and October and threatened to cut jobs.
The disturbances were the first serious challenge to Mr Menem's four-year
economic reform programme. Immediately, the call went out for a softening of
Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo's strict market-oriented policies.
But Mr Menem firmly backed Mr Cavallo. He said economic policy 'is not
negotiable. These adjustment plans are absolutely necessary'. He appointed a
close Cavallo ally, Mr Juan Schiaretti, a federal deputy, as administrator
of Santiago del Estero for five months.
On Monday, Mr Schiaretti defused the unrest by paying Dollars 500 in
emergency wages to each of the province's public employees and Dollars 350
to pensioners.
The rioting rammed home the critical state of many of Argentina's 23
provinces. Most suffer heavy unemployment and poverty, which governments try
to offset by increasing public employment. In Santiago del Estero, one third
of people of working age works for the government and 15 per cent are
unemployed or under-employed.
Invariably, this has led to unmanageable budget deficits, worsened by
widespread corruption and maladministration. Although Santiago del Estero is
one of the poorest regions of Argentina, senior government officials paid
themselves wages of Dollars 10,000-18,000 while public employees get Dollars
180-Dollars 500.
Santiago del Estero is not the only province in deep trouble. In nearby La
Rioja, which Mr Menem governed intermittently from 1973-89, unrest made the
local government drop a plan to cut 10,000 jobs.
La Rioja's government spent Dollars 398m last year. Roughly one-third of the
money came from federal grants and loans and over half in tax-sharing
transfers. It raised only Dollars 28m in taxes and still ran a 1.3 per cent
budget deficit.
This week has seen two more provincial governments back down from
job-cutting programmes in the face of public hostility.
Public employment and spending has grown strongly in the provinces in the 10
years since civilian rule was restored. With only a few exceptions,
provincial governors' authority rests on distribution of patronage,
government jobs and in some cases by buying votes and rigging elections.
Santiago del Estero's rioters were driven not only by fury at losing jobs,
but disgust at government corruption and a contempt for politicians. Mr
Cavallo's demands for a minimum of financial rationality threatens the power
of governors, most of whom belong to Mr Menem's Peronist party. Over the
last three years, six local governments have fallen, usually leading to rule
by a federal administrator.
The gap between rich and poor is growing, as is an already sharp division
between wealthy and backward regions. Argentina's strong growth since 1991
is restricted almost entirely to Buenos Aires and the industrial provinces
of Cordoba and Santa Fe. But even Santa Fe reports rising unemployment as
obsolete factories close in increasing numbers.
Tension elsewhere could grow as a shakeout in industry gathers pace.
Unemployment the Buenos Aires industrial belt has risen 40 per cent in a
year to 9.4 per cent. The absence of a government social safety net to care
for victims of economic dislocation and inefficient social policies are
exacerbating the trauma of reform.
Mr Cavallo has been struggling with the provinces since he took office in
January 1991. Their budget deficits, uncontrolled spending, poor tax systems
and worsening economic problems all threaten economic stability.
Buenos Aires cannot let the provinces sink or swim, because Mr Menem needs
their representatives' support in Congress, both to approve routine
legislation and to garner the necessary two-thirds support needed to reform
the constitution. Mr Menem wants to stand for re-election for a second term
when his mandate ends in 1995, which requires a change to the constitution.
Mr Cavallo promises to redouble efforts in 1994 to make the provinces
reform. Last year he devolved responsibility for education and health to the
provinces. He has provided money to provinces that streamline their tax
systems and offered subsidies for private companies to take on surplus
government employees.
But usually the governors simply use the increased revenues to raise public
employment. Private companies in most provinces are either in declining
industries or too weak to absorb surplus public employees.

French consumer spending on manufactured goods fell by 1.6 per cent last

followed a reduction of 1.2 per cent in October and underlines the pressures
on the economy in France where consumer confidence has been depressed by
high real interest rates and rising unemployment.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Mortification of a mighty Miti mandarin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's coalition government won a showdown against the powerful bureaucracy
yesterday, when a senior official of the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry resigned after prematurely promoting a colleague to enhance his
curriculum vitae.
The defeat of the mighty Miti echoed around the streets of Kasumigaseki,
Tokyo's bureaucratic district, where officials of other ministries saw the
government's action as an encroachment on their traditional territory and an
attack on their reputation.
Mr Masahisa Naito, director-general of Miti's industrial policy bureau,
admitted that he had erred by promoting his colleague, who became an
unsuccessful candidate for the Liberal Democratic party, but thought that
the offence did not warrant his resignation.
He was urged by other bureaucrats to hold out against the resignation demand
by Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, the Miti minister, but Mr Naito apparently sensed
that public opinion was running against the bureaucrats and their political
partisanship.
'I wouldn't say that Mr Naito broke the law, but if you were asked whether
his behaviour was appropriate or inappropriate, then you couldn't say it was
appropriate,' Mr Kumagai said.
The outcome was also a victory for Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the powerbroker who
pulled together the coalition and who is close to Mr Kumagai. In recent
weeks, Mr Ozawa has complained about the lingering influence of the LDP, now
in opposition for the first time in four decades, at Miti and other
ministries.
However, it is unclear whether the attacks on the bureaucracy's power will
continue or whether the government will just target officials with close LDP
ties, which, in the past, were important for the ministries.
Japan's bureaucrats believe that they have run the country since the end of
the war, as the LDP routinely changed ministers every year, meaning that few
had the time to master their ministries and left most of the important
decisions to senior officials.
Miti officials complained yesterday that the campaign against Mr Naito came
as the coalition government is increasingly fragile and another election is
imminent. The Naito case, they say, has undermined the stability of the
bureaucracy without ensuring longer-term changes in the relationship between
politician and ministry.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Japan urged to open up pension fund investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European and US fund managers are increasing their calls for Japan's
ministry of finance to open investment of the country's vast state pension
funds to asset management companies.
Pressure from the US forced the ministry to liberalise partially fund
management of corporate pensions and mutual aid associations in 1990.
However, the Y20,000bn (Pounds 125bn) worth of state pension funds are still
tightly guarded and allocated to trust banks and life assurers.
The issue has also been debated among Japanese and US trade officials in the
bilateral framework talks. The third round of the talks ended this week, but
made little progress.
The country's ministry of health and welfare, which holds jurisdiction over
the state pension system, also wants to diversify its investments and is
calling for the ministry of finance, which controls the way the pension
funds are invested, to change the regulations. The welfare ministry is
concerned that because of the sharp pension fund growth, the amounts
allocated to any one fund manager are swelling.
Laws covering the state pension system are reviewed every four years, and
welfare ministry officials fear that if they cannot convince the finance
ministry by next April, the rules cannot be changed until the next review in
1998.
European and US investment advisers say the ministry of finance's tight
regulation prevents money flowing to investments with the highest yields.
However the ministry counters that as the government has to guarantee social
security benefits, it cannot allow state pension funds invest in stocks,
which most investment advisory companies specialise in.
Mr Hitoshi Yamamoto, president of Morgan Grenfell Asset Management in Tokyo,
objects that this stance goes against efforts by prime minister Morihiro
Hosokawa to remove excessive bureaucratic regulations.

President Carlos Menem's re-election bid overcame a big obstacle yesterday
when the lower house of Argentina's Congress narrowly approved a package he
had negotiated with Mr Raul Alfonsn, former president and leader of the
opposition Radical party, John Barham writes. The constitution bans
consecutive presidential terms, but the Radicals back reform in return for
amendments reducing the president's powers and a greater opposition role in
government.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US economy grew slightly more briskly in the third quarter of this year
than had been previously thought, Reuter reports from Washington.
The reason, said the Commerce Department, was businesses stepped up
production of goods for inventories. Third quarter gross domestic product
was valued at Dollars 5,140bn.
In a second and final look at national output during the third quarter, the
department said GDP expanded at a 2.9 per cent annual rate instead of 2.7
per cent as earlier estimated.
Though third-quarter growth was modest, it eclipsed 0.8 and 1.9 per cent
increases in the first and second quarters. Consumer spending was strong,
helping set the stage for a firmer closing quarter.
Inflation was restrained in the third quarter, with the implicit price
deflator rising at a 1.6 per cent rate.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Top US retailer curbs gun sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wal-Mart, the discount retailer which is one of the two biggest sellers of
guns in the US, is to stop stocking handguns in its stores from next
February.
It will continue to sell the weapons through catalogues, though; and rifles
and shotguns will still be available in the 700 of its 2,000 stores across
the country which currently sell firearms.
Wal-Mart said the decision to take handguns out of its stores reflected
unease among customers. 'The majority of them feel uncomfortable with being
in a store that sells guns,' it said.
The decision, which the company says was taken 'three or four months ago,'
comes after a handful of lawsuits against Wal-Mart and discount retailer
Kmart, the US's other biggest seller of guns. These allege negligence in the
sale of guns by staff who have not been properly trained.
'You might be selling mens-wear one day and firearms the next,' said the
Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, one of several pressure groups which have
targeted campaigns against discount stores in recent months.
The decision also follows the killing of six passengers on a Long Island
commuter train last month, which has added to pressure for stronger gun
controls in the US. Last weekend, two people were killed with an assault
rifle in a Wal-Mart parking lot in Oklahoma.
Wal-Mart and Kmart sell between a fifth and a quarter of all rifles and
shotguns in the US through their national chains. Figures for handgun sales
do not need to be reported, but the discount retailers' market share of such
weapons is believed to be broadly similar.
Wal-Mart said that while taking handguns out of its stores, it was not
making any changes to the paperwork or other procedures involved in selling
the weapons. The change meant there would now be a longer delay between the
time a handgun is purchased and when it is delivered, however.
Wal-Mart faces a lawsuit brought this month by the relatives of a mentally
ill man who shot his parents using a handgun bought from one of the
company's stores.
In a landmark decision in October, Kmart was ordered to pay the victim of a
shooting Dollars 12.5m (Pounds 8.3m) after it was found to be negligent in
selling a rifle to an intoxicated man.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Canadian central banker calls time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Crow, the Bank of Canada governor who has built a reputation as one
of the industrial world's most ardent inflation fighters, said yesterday he
would not be available for another term in office when his first seven-year
term expires next month.
Mr Crow, who is also chairman of the Group of 10 central bank governors,
cited 'personal reasons'.
However, the newly elected Liberal government in Ottawa has been under
strong political pressure not to offer Mr Crow a second term. While foreign
investors and domestic business leaders have strongly backed his
anti-inflation crusade, the Bank of Canada's tight money policies between
1988 and mid-1992 are widely blamed for exacerbating the recent recession.
Mr Crow's position was also undermined by a blunt and condescending manner,
which offended members of the Liberal caucus during their years in
opposition.
He will be replaced by his deputy, Mr Gordon Thiessen. According to one
former Bank of Canada official, the two men's views on economic policy are
virtually identical, but Mr Thiessen has a reputation as a more skilful
communicator. 'Gordon could say the same thing and finesse it,' one former
finance department official said yesterday.
The Canadian dollar initially sank on news of Mr Crow's departure, but
recovered quickly to 74.85 US cents in the early afternoon, half a cent
above its opening level.
Canada's inflation rate has dropped from 5.6 per cent in 1991 to 1.9 per
cent in the year to November. The commercial banks' prime lending rate
reached a peak of 14.75 per cent in mid-1990 but has since tumbled to 5.5
per cent.
The finance minister, Mr Paul Martin, said the government aimed to hold
Canada's annual inflation rate within a 1-3 per cent range until at least
1998. Although he stressed a commitment to containing inflation, the targets
are more flexible than the 'zero inflation' policy favoured by Mr Crow.

FT  23 DEC 93 / US media worries over Clinton sex story: Jurek Martin
reports from Washington on how the liberal establishment has reacted to the
headline 'His cheatin' heart'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jim Lehrer almost grimaced on the air on Tuesday night. The affable and
unflappable co-host of public television's excellent evening news programme
told the panel assembled to discuss the latest allegations about President
Bill Clinton's sex life that there had been a fair amount of agonising in
his shop about whether or not to run with the story.
Johnny Apple, magisterial Washington bureau chief of the New York Times, was
even more blunt in comments published by the Washington Post.
Asked to explain why his newspaper had virtually ignored the story until
yesterday morning, when it ran Mrs Hillary Clinton's counter-attack on its
front page, he observed: 'I am not interested in Bill Clinton's sex life as
governor of Arkansas. I'm certain there are a lot of readers who are
interested in that and there are lots of publications they can turn to to
slake that thirst.'
One is not the Wall Street Journal, no fan of the president and hot on the
trail of his financial entanglement with the former chief executive of a
now-defunt Arkansas savings and loan institution. Not a word of the sex
charges have so far appeared on its pages.
The Washington Post itself, the capital's house organ and sometimes arbiter
of taste, has been one of the few newspapers to venture an editorial
comment. Under the headline 'Once more into the muck', it wrote the charges
came 'in tawdry form' and concluded 'the case so far is suspect and far from
convincing'.
The establishment media is grappling with an increasingly familiar problem -
whether or not to play down a story whose sources are extremely suspect, and
which has little relevance to governance of the country.
The excuse to back into it is any official comment - which has come in the
shape of the president's interview with wire service reporters yesterday in
which he denied all the allegations and a similar interview with Mrs Clinton
on Tuesday - or when it is suggested that the president himself may have
intervened to try to pressure or otherwise induce the two Arkansas state
troopers not to go ahead with their allegations.
It is this latter point which may give the story 'legs', in journalistic
parlance. One such 'leg' was apparently removed last night when the troopers
said they had never been approached by the White House.
This, of course, does not satisfy conservatives who contend that the liberal
media establishment is once again protecting one of its own, in the person
of a Democratic president. But the generally rough treatment he has received
from all media quarters for much of the year indicates a degree of
right-wing paranoia.
Mr Clinton's die-hard opponents also claim that his alleged behaviour, which
they are convinced is not only true but took place during the transition
between the election and inauguration, amounts to hypocrisy on a grand scale
after he and his wife had assured the public in the wake of the the Gennifer
Flowers affair early in the election campaign that their marriage had
survived rocky periods and was now in good shape.
It may, therefore, have been deliberate that Mrs Clinton, a First Lady like
no other before, was chosen, or volunteered, to lead the counter-attack. She
did so pungently and with a sense of grievance. Noting that Cliff Jackson,
representing the state troopers and understood to be sifting through offers
of payment for their stories, had for years been 'obsessed' with her
husband, she said: 'I find it not an accident that every time he (Mr
Clinton) is on the verge of fulfilling his commitment to the American
people, they respond and out comes a new round of these outrageous, terrible
stories that people plant for political and financial reasons.'
She may have a point. The fullest account of the charges appeared in the
American Spectator, the ultra-conservative journal, and was written by David
Brock whose previous magnum opus had been a controversial book attempting to
debunk Professor Anita Hill's charges of sexual harassment against now
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. The article conceded the
corroborating evidence was in short supply and that financial gain, and
resentment, appeared to be a motivating factor. It nonetheless devoted
11,000 words to the subject and, in case anybody missed the point, the
headline ran 'His cheatin' heart'.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Car industry confronts price 'fantasy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A closer convergence in new car prices across west Europe would remain 'a
mere fantasy', as long as the European Union is confronted with frequent
significant exchange rate realignments, leaders of the European car industry
claimed yesterday. A survey published by the European Commission suggested
yesterday that around 80 per cent of the prices for cars produced by
European manufacturers and 90 per cent of Japanese models showed price
differentials of less than 20 per cent as at the end of November.
The Commission said that Spain and Portugal were the lowest priced markets
in the EU, while Germany was the highest.
The European Automobile Industry Association (ACEA) claimed that
manufacturers' efforts to reduce price differences had not been reflected in
the prices published by the Commission, as they had largely been offset by
recent currency realignments versus the Ecu. These had varied from a 3 per
cent revaluation in the DM and the guilder and 7 per cent devaluations of
the escudo and the peseta.
The ACEA claimed that currency fluctations were the 'decisive influence' on
car prices.
Spain was now the lowest priced market in the EU, but only in June last year
it had been the highest priced market. The Commission accepted that car
manufacturers had tended to reduce price differentials for most of their
models, and said that about 90 per cent of all car price differentials were
less than 20 per cent. All of the European manufacturers have price
differentials of more than 25 per cent for at least one model, however.

FT  23 DEC 93 / French probe is launched over Tapie business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Bernard Tapie, the flamboyant French politician and businessman who owns
the Olympique-Marseille football club, is to be officially investigated by
magistrates over alleged financial malpractice at Testut, one of his
businesses.
Mr Tapie, who was minister of urban affairs in the last socialist government
and is a protege of Mr Francois Mitterrand, the French president, was
questioned yesterday about the Testut affair by judges at Bethune in
northern France.
His parliamentary immunity was lifted earlier this month by a special
National Assembly vote so that he could be questioned.
The judges announced after questioning that Mr Tapie had been formally
placed under investigation.
The case concerns allegations that Testut bought Trayvou, a loss-making
company also owned by Mr Tapie, at an inflated price, only to sell it back
to him for a token sum after increasing its capital by FFr30m (Pounds 3.4m).
Mr Tapie has repeatedly denied that any financial irregularities occurred.
The next stage of the French legal procedure would be for Mr Tapie to go on
trial. If he were found guilty he would risk losing his parliamentary seat
and face personal bankruptcy. Recent estimates have suggested that he has
personally-guaranteed bank loans of up to FFr1bn.
Mr Tapie was until recently lauded as a working class hero by the French
public, but his image has been badly damaged by this summer's scandal over
alleged match rigging by Olympique-Marseille officials and more recently by
the Testut affair.
He topped the 'biggest disappointment of the year' poll in this week's
Paris-Match magazine, beating the French football team, which failed to
qualify for the World Cup, into second place.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Elections weaken Milosevic's grip on Serbs: Laura Silber
reports from Belgrade on the outcome of last weekend's voting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Prospects for stability in the Balkans, which hinge on Serbia, looked headed
for deeper political uncertainty following the results of parliamentary
elections at the weekend.
Despite the claims by the ruling Socialists of an overwhelming triumph,
President Slobodan Milosevic has clearly failed to win an outright majority.
Nearly complete results show them winning some 123 of parliament's 250
seats. However, the opposition parties have together emerged stronger.
Mr Milosevic, a leader incapable of sharing power, will thus face an
assembly deeply divided between Socialists and opposition parties.
The latter include the Depos coalition led by Mr Vuk Draskovic, the
ultranationalist Radicals under Mr Vojislav Seselj, and the Democratic
party. This party, led by Mr Zoran Djindjic, runs a middle course in
Serbia's schismatic political landscape and made the largest electoral gain.
The opposition, however, is united only against Mr Milosevic. In the
unlikely event that they managed to agree on a common platform, it would
differ little from that of the Socialists on the national question. During
the campaign, no political leader voiced opposition to the war in Bosnia or
the 21-month siege of Sarajevo by Serb forces.
When the war erupted in former Yugoslavia in 1991, President Milosevic was
the indisputable leader of all Serbs. Now, he remains the most influential,
but his hold over Serb politicians, particularly those outside Serbia, has
weakened significantly.
Since the start of peace talks on Bosnia last year, international mediators
have counted on him to exert pressure on his Bosnian Serb proxies to endorse
an agreement. But shrugging off international threats, Bosnian Serbs have
refused to hand over enough land to give their Moslem adversaries the viable
state sought by western governments.
In May, they even snubbed Mr Milosevic by rejecting his attempt to
strong-arm the Bosnian Serb 'assembly' into endorsing the Vance-Owen peace
plan for Bosnia.
Two weeks ago, in spite of considerable support from Belgrade, his protege
lost presidential elections in the self-styled Serb state of Krajina, which
covers a third of Croatia. The victory of Mr Milan Babic, who is politically
independent from Belgrade, will make it impossible for Mr Milosevic and his
Croatian counterpart, Mr Franjo Tudjman, to bypass local Serb leaders in
reaching a settlement on the status of Krajina.
The European Union has stressed that reaching a modus vivendi in Croatia is
an integral part of the peace package, without which there will be no
gradual lifting of sanctions imposed on Serbia by the United Nations 19
months ago for the violent partition of Bosnia.
While western governments still pin their hopes for an agreement on him
almost exclusively, the Serbian leader will be forced increasingly to devote
his attention to the economic deluge in his country. Devastated by sanctions
and footing the bill for nearly three years of war in neighbouring Bosnia
and Croatia, Serbia has plunged into poverty. Inflation is expected to reach
a monthly rate of 500,000 per cent by the end of the year.
The drama of the southern province of Kosovo is also still waiting to
unfold. The majority ethnic Albanian community there boycotted last
weekend's election with the result that the tiny Serb population, just 7 per
cent of the total, gave the Socialists one fifth of their 123 seats.
There is no chance of stability in the Balkans without a solution of the
status of the Albanians living in a virtual parallel state under police
control.
The Albanian question will draw in newly recognised Macedonia, where ethnic
Albanians comprise more than a third of the population.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Chinese air hijack talks fail

Taiwan and China yesterday ended five days of talks without resolving the
problem of frequent hijackings of Chinese aircraft to Taiwan.
The two sides could not agree on mutually acceptable language for an
agreement in principle that hijackers should be repatriated. Nine Chinese
aircraft have been hijacked to Taiwan this year.
The failure underlines the difficulty which the two sides will have in
solving intractable problems as 'unofficial' contacts gather pace. The talks
were the third round of negotiations on practical issues agreed by Taiwan's
Strait Exchange Foundation and China's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait in April.
Taiwan officials said the critical gap remained Beijing's unwillingness to
accept Taiwan's 'right of legal jurisdiction' - a code phrase for the
island's sovereignty as a political entity separate from China.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Israelis protest against killing of settlers: Talks on
Palestinian self-rule seek to end stalemate as Arab-Jewish violence mounts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Thousands of Israelis demonstrated across the country last night after the
killing of two Jewish settlers by Arab gunmen as Israeli and Palestinian
peace negotiators continued intense efforts in France to break a deadlock
over Palestinian self-rule.
Protesters chanted anti-government slogans and accused Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the
Israeli prime minister, of betraying the Jewish people and sacrificing the
security of settlers in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The
demonstrations, calling on the government not to arm incoming Palestinian
policemen, came after extremist Palestinian gunmen shot dead two Jews in a
drive-by shooting near Ramallah, in the West Bank.
Yesterday's killings brought the death toll since the signing of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord in September to 20 Israeli and 44
Palestinians.
Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, met Mr
Nissim Zvili, a senior Labour party official, in Tunis and told him that the
attack showed both sides that time was not in their favour. Both Israel and
the PLO fear that Arab-Jewish violence will escalate in the vacuum created
by the continuing stalemate in talks to implement Palestinian
self-government in the occupied Gaza Strip and the West Bank area of
Jericho.
In Versailles, the two negotiating teams led by Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli
foreign minister and Mr Yassir Abed-Rabbo, a PLO executive committee member
held difficult meetings throughout the day to try and break the deadlock
which centres on who should control border crossings. Both sides were
struggling to find a compromise which would guarantee Israeli security
concerns while at the same time giving the Palestinians some concessions
towards at least symbolic sovereignty.
After his meeting with Mr Arafat, Mr Zvili said the PLO chairman had said he
understood Israeli security worries 'but we should understand the political
and psychological problems of the Palestinian people'.
In a sign of an apparent softening of the PLO demands for full control over
the borders Mr Suleiman Najjab, a PLO executive committee member, said:
'Yes, Israel may keep external security in its hands but not at the expense
of Palestinian sovereignty.'
Israel Radio said Mr Arafat told Mr Zvili he had instructed his negotiating
team 'to sit and discuss until white smoke comes out of the room'.
The Yesha Council, the organisation which represents Jewish settlers in
occupied Arab lands and opposes the peace agreement, said yesterday's attack
would not prevent more people moving into settlements in the occupied
territories.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Growth in US revised upward
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The US economy grew slightly more briskly in the third quarter of this year
than had been previously thought, Reuter reports from Washington. The
reason, said the Commerce Department, was businesses stepped up production
of goods for inventories. Third quarter gross domestic product was valued at
Dollars 5,140bn.
In a second and final look at national output during the third quarter, the
department said GDP expanded at a 2.9 per cent annual rate instead of 2.7
per cent as earlier estimated.
Though third-quarter growth was modest, it eclipsed increases of 0.8 and 1.9
per cent in the first and second quarters.
Consumer spending was strong, helping set the stage for a much firmer
closing quarter this year.
Damaging floods in the Midwest and drought in the southeast cut about 0.6
percentage point from third quarter growth by destroying crops. But a
rebound in the fourth quarter for agricultural production will add about 0.4
of a percentage point to fourth quarter output, department officials said.
The key reason for the upward revision in third quarter growth was that
businesses added about Dollars 2.7bn more goods to their inventories than
previously estimated.
Inflation was restrained in the third quarter with the implicit price
deflator rising at a 1.6 per cent rate, the same as reckoned earlier, and
the GDP fixed-weight index up 2.1 per cent instead of 2.2 per cent.
The department said Americans saved just Dollars 0.038 out of each dollar of
income in the third quarter, close to the lowest level since 1950.
Consumer spending rose by Dollars 36.9bn in the quarter after Dollars 28.9bn
in the previous quarter.
Non-farm businesses boosted their inventories by Dollars 19.4bn in the third
quarter instead of by Dollars 16.7bn as estimated previously.
Foreign trade faded in the third quarter. Net exports - the difference
between foreign sales and imports - decreased by Dollars 11.1bn after
falling Dollars 15.3bn in the second quarter.

FT  23 DEC 93 / EU fails to break Bosnia deadlock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of the warring parties in former Yugoslavia yesterday agreed to a
Christmas truce, but European Union-led efforts to achieve a wider
breakthrough remained deadlocked over Bosnian Moslem claims for more land to
create a viable, independent state.
The Belgian presidency of the EU blamed Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian
Serb leader, for intransigence at the end of the peace talks in Brussels
widely seen as the last chance for a political settlement before the end of
winter.
Mr Willy Claes, Belgian foreign minister, said Mr Karadzic had delivered a
'flat no' to a request to reopen Tuzla airport in order to allow
humanitarian aid to resume.
Mr Claes also suggested that Bosnian Serbs were still pressing for a
division of Sarajevo, despite the fact that the future status of the
multi-ethnic Bosnian capital was 'of paramount importance' to a lasting
peace settlement.
Negotiations were continuing last night in Brussels under the guidance of
Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the two international mediators. Also
present was Mr Slobodan Milosevic, Serb president; Mr Franjo Tudjiman,
Croatian leader, and Mr Mate Boban, his Bosnian proxy.
Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenberg were trying to expand on 'points of agreement'
reached yesterday between the warring parties, notably the principle that
the Bosnian Moslems were entitled to one third of the territory in the
former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, said the issue turned on 'the
quality, rather than the quantity of land' claimed by the Moslems. He and
other officials singled out several areas of difficulty.
Bosnian demands for land corridors linking Sarajevo to the enclaves to the
east, including Bihac, Zepa and Srebrenica. The Moslem claims also cover
Gornic to the west which Moslems say fell victim to Serb atrocities.
The status of Sarajevo. Europeans would like to avoid dividing the Bosnian
capital on ethnic lines, preferring instead administration under a United
Nations mandate lasting around two years. The Serbs are resisting.
Bosnian demands for access to the Adriatic sea, either to the north or to
the south at Neum. Croatians are prepared to discuss sharing sovereignty or
joint administration, but broad differences exist over land corridors to
Neum.
Mr Claes said a measure of progress had been made during the talks
yesterday, and the shelling was now likely to stop during Christmas. But he
made no attempt to disguise his disappointment that all parties had failed
to compromise. 'It is an old story. The glass is half empty or half full,
you choose.'
The Belgians repeated warnings that the EU was ready to tighten sanctions
against Serbia if it was clearly responsible for a breakdown in the peace
talks. But diplomats said the Europeans did not mention earlier threats to
withdraw their peace-keeping troops.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Girls overtake boys in academic performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Girls last year overtook boys in virtually every measure of school academic
performance, figures released by the Department for Education show.
For the first time, a greater proportion of women entered higher education
than men, while girls' performance in GCSE exams was sharply superior to
boys'.
In 1992, 45 per cent of girls passed five GCSEs at grade C or above
(equivalent to a pass in the old O-level), while 38 per cent of boys reached
the same standard.
More girls attempted A-levels (31 per cent against 26 per cent of boys), and
16 per cent passed at least three, compared with 14 per cent of boys.
Provisional figures showed that roughly twice as many women as men gained
vocational qualifications. On leaving university, total female graduate
unemployment last year was 10.6 per cent, compared with 15.1 per cent for
men.
The Equal Opportunities Commission hailed the results as showing that
women's aspirations and expectations of themselves were at last the equal of
men's. It said education had been one of the most significant barriers to
full equality of opportunity.
Only 20 years ago, lack of educational qualifications had been one of the
toughest hurdles for women to surmount when looking for jobs, according to
the commission. The education department's figures show that women have had
to seek work without enough high-level qualifications: men between the ages
of 40 and 59 are more than twice as likely than women to hold a university
degree, and more than three times as likely to have A-levels.
The commission suggested that childcare facilities would have to improve if
women were to be able to take full advantage of educational improvements in
the jobs market.
It also voiced concern that, at university level, male dominance of
traditionally 'masculine' science subjects continues. Almost a quarter of
men took engineering and technology degrees, compared with less than 5 per
cent of women, and men also provided more undergraduates in mathematics,
computing and physical sciences.
Mr Tim Boswell, the further and higher education minister, welcomed the
figures but claimed that sciences were still seen 'too much as no-go areas'.
In university degrees, men can claim to provide slightly more examples of
excellence, with 8.7 per cent gaining firsts, compared with 5.7 per cent of
women. But men also receive more third-class and pass degrees.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Sinn Fein told to pick up 'gauntlet of peace': British and
Irish prime ministers strive to regain initiative on Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, TIM COONE and Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds tried to recapture the initiative in
their joint attempt to halt 25 years of violence in Northern Ireland
yesterday.
Presenting a united front in statements coinciding with Mr Major's third
visit to the province this year, the British and Irish prime ministers
categorically ruled out negotiations with Sinn Fein until the IRA ends its
armed campaign.
But in a third statement in as many days, Sinn Fein redoubled its efforts to
drive a wedge between London and Dublin, accusing the two governments of
making 'contradictory statements' about last week's Downing Street
Declaration.
The charge from the IRA's political wing came as President Bill Clinton
appeared to offer it an incentive by hinting that he might lift a ban on Mr
Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, entering the US in return for a positive
response to the Major-Reynolds initiative.
Mr Major used a surprise visit to Belfast to tell Republican leaders: 'There
is a gauntlet down on the table. It is marked peace. It is there for Sinn
Fein to pick it up.'
He added: "The joint declaration is perfectly clear. There is no need for
fresh negotiations. There is no need for any indecisiveness.'
If Mr Adams wanted clarification, he should stop the violence and wait for a
brief period. Then the questions he wanted answered would be answered.
Accusing Sinn Fein of 'delaying tactics', Mr Major warned that London was
not prepared to wait indefinitely for a positive response to the peace
initiative. 'I don't think one can be strung along for ever,' he said.
On his first official visit to Republican west Belfast, Mr Major urged
listeners: 'Don't play Mr Adams's game. He has an opportunity. That
opportunity is marked peace. The opportunity is on the table - does Mr Adams
have the will and the courage to pick it up?'
Before moving on to meetings last night at Hillsborough with church and
community leaders and leaders of Northern Ireland's four non-violent
political parties, the prime minister said a terrorist decision to renounce
violence was the only 'sane' decision that could be made. The men of
violence no longer had 'a shred of justification'.
Mr Reynolds echoed Mr Major's line in telling the Irish senate the 'next
stage' of negotiations with Sinn Fein could come only after peace 'has first
been established'. But the Irish prime minister took a more emollient tack
in pledging 'an enlightened and pragmatic approach' in subsequent talks on
'difficult' security issues. A 'balanced' approach would be essential, he
said.
In a further hint at flexibility, he said the Republic's broadcasting ban on
Sinn Fein would be reviewed 'in depth' on January 19. Mr Peter Brooke,
national heritage secretary, is expected to report to Mr Major on a review
of similar British restrictions about the same time.
As Mr Adams repeated calls for talks with London and Dublin to clarify
'confusions and contradictions' in the declaration, senior Sinn Fein
officials said 'direct contact' was now 'a vital and essential part of the
process'.
But after a meeting of the party's national executive committee in Dublin,
Mr Caoimnghin O'Caolain, a committee member, said he did not believe the
peace process was deadlocked. Mr O'Caolain also hinted Sinn Fein had tried
to reopen its secret channel of negotiations with the British government.
There was no indication whether the IRA is planning to extend its
traditional three-day Christmas ceasefire, spanning Christmas Eve to Boxing
Day. That is expected today.
Yesterday's developments came after the Irish Times reported that President
Clinton had indicated the ban on Mr Adams entering the US might be lifted.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Yeltsin pledges his support for Gaidar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Russian president Boris Yeltsin said yesterday that Mr Yegor Gaidar, the
first deputy premier and the man most closely associated with economic
reform, would stay in government.
Breaking his post-election silence, Mr Yeltsin said Mr Gaidar's policy of
reform would also remain. But he suggested that reform might take a
different course after the setback for reformist parties in the recent
parliamentary elections.
He told a Kremlin press conference that the 'volume of social benefits'
available to the population was likely to grow if inflation continued its
downward trend. Inflation for November fell below 15 per cent monthly -
although financial experts in Moscow believe the trend may be temporary.
It is clear that the Russian government and international financial
institutions will put more emphasis on the social impact of reforms. The
International Monetary Fund, criticised over the past week by Al Gore, the
US vice-president, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, for
insensitivity to Russian hardships, has said it will send a team to Moscow
in January to help design a social security system.
However, the IMF and US Treasury have indicated that Russia's basic economic
troubles - high inflation and a huge budget deficit - have to be tackled if
the economy is to be pulled out of crisis.
Mr Yeltsin said the surge in support for the extreme right Liberal Democrats
of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky and the Communist party reflected weariness with
hardship. His comments will be hard to reconcile with the need to
restructure a swollen state sector and to control spending.
The Russian president emphasised the referendum vote for a new constitution,
saying that, when extremist political forces were strengthening, it was all
the more important that a constitution guaranteeing a powerful presidency
was in place. He said the direction of foreign policy - a prerogative of the
president - would be basically unchanged.
He played down the threat posed by Mr Zhirinovsky, saying he would 'not let
him walk over me' to take the presidency. At the same time, he voiced
readiness to work with the Liberal Democrats and Communists if they showed
themselves able to form a 'constructive opposition'.
No single group will dominate the new parliament, though - as Mr Yeltsin
noted - the reformist Russia's Choice bloc, led by Mr Gaidar, will have the
most seats in spite of the Liberal Democrats' success in taking the majority
of seats in the half of the lower house elected through party lists.
In Washington, President Bill Clinton said he and Mr Yeltsin had discussed
their planned mid-January summit in Moscow in a half-hour telephone
conversation.
Mr Zhirinovsky, meanwhile, was in Austria as guest of a businessman, Mr
Edwin Neuwirth, who told reporters he had volunteered for the Waffen SS
during the second world war.
Mr Zhirinovsky earlier met the head of a radical rightwing German party in
Munich.

FT  23 DEC 93 / GM invests Pounds 130m in upgrade of Luton plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
General Motors, the US car-maker, is to invest about Pounds 130m during the
next two years to modernise and automate its Vauxhall assembly plant at
Luton, Bedfordshire.
Vauxhall is planning to increase capacity at the plant, which produces the
Vauxhall Cavalier-Opel Vectra large family car, by about 25 per cent by the
end of 1995, when the present car is replaced.
The company has emerged as the most profitable carmaker in the UK during the
recession, and the Luton plant is now GM's lowest-cost assembly facility in
Europe for the Cavalier-Vectra, ahead of rival plants in Belgium and
Germany.
In preparation for the introduction of the Cavalier-Vectra replacement in
two years, GM is planning a marked increase in the level of automation at
the Luton plant.
It is investing heavily in new equipment for body welding, and the number of
robots at the plant will be increased from the present 34 to about 215. The
amount of automated spot welding will rise from 20 per cent to 70 per cent
of the total.
GM is also installing a new trim and final assembly line. The investment in
new plant and equipment, coupled with the improved design of the new car, is
aimed at reducing the time needed to make each car by more than a third to
about 17 hours a car by 1998.
Vauxhall is aiming to increase the plant capacity from about 48 to 60 cars
an hour or some 215,000 cars a year by the end of 1995, when it begins
production of the new model.
In 1992, Luton produced a record 170,600 cars. But production has fallen by
nearly 30 per cent this year, to about 121,000, as exports have plunged in
the face of the steep decline in demand in continental Europe.
Exports in 1993 have accounted for only 14.7 per cent of the plant's output,
compared with 41 per cent last year.

FT  23 DEC 93 / Paramount board recommends Dollars 10bn bid from QVC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The board of Paramount Communications last night recommended a hostile
Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) bid from television shopping channel QVC Network
rather than a friendly, but lower, offer from cable company Viacom.
The board said it was terminating its existing merger pact with Viacom, but
said the cable group was considering raising its offer.
The move represents a psychological shift in the three-month battle for
Paramount. The board had previously shunned QVC's advances and insisted that
a merger with Viacom offered better long-term benefits.
However, it does not spell the end of the tortuous fight. Each bidder still
has a 10-day period in which it can increase the value of its offer, and
shareholders are free to accept either proposal.
Viacom was yesterday understood to be seeking finance for a higher offer,
approaching companies that have backed its bid. These include Nynex, the
regional telephone company serving the north-eastern US, and Blockbuster
Entertainment, the video rental chain.
Trading in shares of Paramount, QVC and Viacom was suspended when reports of
the decision began circulating, but later resumed. At the close, Paramount
stood at Dollars 79 5/8 , down Dollars  5/8 . QVC was down Dollars  3/4 at
Dollars 41 1/4 , and Viacom A was up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 51. The
board's two days of deliberations follow a ruling by the Delaware supreme
court that the company must create a level playing field for both the Viacom
and QVC offers. Paramount agreed to auction itself off and set a deadline of
last Monday for offers.
QVC increased the value of its cash offer for 51 per cent of Paramount's
shares, from Dollars 90 to Dollars 92, while Viacom resubmitted its existing
cash offer, worth Dollars 85 a share.
Both bidders are offering stock for the remaining 49 per cent. Based on
their fluctuating share prices, QVC's entire bid was yesterday morning worth
about Dollars 10bn, or Dollars 83 1/2 a share, compared with Viacom's
Dollars 9.6bn, or Dollars 79 5/8 a share.
Analysts said the Paramount board had little choice but to recommend the QVC
bid since it was substantially higher than Viacom's.
The board is under close legal scrutiny to ensure it does not unfairly
favour Viacom.

<TEXT>
In a legal assault meant to enforce the European Union's single market, the
European Community said yesterday it would take member countries to court in
184 cases where they have failed to implement EU legislation, AP-DJ reports
from Brussels.
The offensive reverses an 11-month truce between the Commission, which is
responsible for upholding Community rules, and member states which have been
slow to take in Community laws to national legislation.
The Commission said it would file the complaints with the European Court of
Justice, the Community's highest court, against recalcitrant members.
It said it had also decided to open 103 new internal proceedings against the
12 EU governments, and send 709 'reasoned opinions', giving governments two
months to bring national laws into line with EU norms.
Commission spokesmen refused to give details about where the alleged
breaches of legislation have occurred, or even to say which members states
were involved.
In a statement, however, the Commission said the move illustrates a
'co-operative rather than confrontational' approach towards member
countries.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Non-resident EU citizens 'should get tax equality'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
European Union citizens working beyond the borders of their home country
should be granted the same tax benefits as residents from 1995, the European
Commission said yesterday.
The Commission is calling on member states to end discrimination against
200,000 to 300,000 of the Union's most mobile workers, currently unable to
claim benefits, such as family tax allowances, at home or abroad.
The Commission asked governments to bring their national legislation and
bilateral tax agreements with other EU members into line with the
recommendation by 1995. If national rules are not harmonised, then a formal
directive could be proposed.
The recommendation marks a new approach to EU tax legislation by the
Commission. By not proposing formal legislation, which requires member
states' unanimous approval, the Commission hopes to speed up tax
harmonisation in other fields.
The Commission is recommending that citizens who receive at least 75 per
cent of their income in a member state other than their home country should
be eligible for the same treatment as residents in the state where they
work.
Mrs Christiane Scrivener, tax commissioner, said the plan would particularly
benefit EU citizens who live on one side of a border and work on the other,
and others who want to take advantage of the single market to work away from
home. The Commission said businessmen and women, lawyers, architects,
doctors, journalists, sports people and actors could benefit. But the
recommendation would also stop cross-border workers claiming benefits in two
member states.
According to the Commission, under the current system a 'non-resident'
family with two children, earning BFr2m (Dollars 56,000) in Belgium, pays
tax of BFr936,000 annually. If the Commission's recommendations are adopted,
the same family would pay only BFr750,000 because it would benefit from
family and married couple tax allowances. Applied in Germany to a married
couple earning DM80,000 (Dollars 47,000), the recommendation would result in
a tax saving of DM6,253 a year.
Formal tax measures are often blocked for years by governments which fear
losing revenue and sovereignty over tax matters. A broad recommendation
could be used to speed up harmonised tax treatment for small and
medium-sized companies.
Senior Commission officials said Brussels would continue to pursue
individual governments through the European Court of Justice, using the
recommendation as a basis for complaints that countries have broken EU
treaty rules on discrimination.
A similar proposal on non-resident taxation was first proposed by the
Commission in 1979 but held up by member states until it was abandoned last
year.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (11): Oil refineries lose their fat -
The Aramco-Samarec merger has created a company that may be without equal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Integration' has for so long been such a buzzword of Saudi Arabian oil
policy that perhaps it should have come as no surprise when the kingdom
announced in June that it was to merge Saudi Aramco, the state-run oil
producing company, with Samarec, the previously separate refining and crude
marketing arm.
Nevertheless, industry analysts in and outside the kingdom professed
bafflement at the timing of the move, asking why Mr Hisham Nazer, the oil
minister, had decided to submerge Samarec, originally his creation, into
Aramco after putting such effort into establishing its distinct identity.
Rumours circulated in the industry that the move was a setback to Mr Nazer
and that his ministerial tenure was threatened.
All of which is roundly rebutted by senior Saudi officials. The timing, they
say, was 'irrelevant'. When Samarec was set up in 1989, they say, it was
considered an appropriate transitional step towards the eventual
establishment of a wholly-integrated national oil company. Its creation
gathered 12 previously disparate refineries and marketing operations
overseen by Petromin, the oil ministry, into one. The decision to merge with
Aramco, says one official, 'had been devised ever since Mr Nazer began
restructuring the oil ministry' - something which inadequately explains why
Samarec had commissioned a corporate plan for 1993-97 from Arthur D. Little,
the consultants.
What Saudi officials do not say, but oil executives and some Aramco staff in
the kingdom do, is that Samarec's bureaucratic management style had come to
contrast increasingly poorly with that of Aramco, which inherited from the
US oil majors which created it a pervasive and efficient western corporate
culture. 'Samarec was overspending; it had a lot of fat and Aramco had been
sniping at it for years,' says the Riyadh representative of one foreign oil
group.
What the merger is producing, therefore, is not just one of the world's
biggest integrated oil companies, but also a wholesale change of management
ethos in Saudi Arabia's vast oil refining and marketing operations. Six
months into the merger - which officials say is now operationally complete -
Aramco's mark is already clear on what had been Samarec's style and
strategy.
In style, Aramco officials see the task essentially of retraining the 11,000
Samarec workers it has inherited and, perhaps more pertinently, tuning them
to Aramco's work ethic. The joke in Dhahran is that when Aramco staff
arrived in Jeddah, turning up at the Samarec office at Aramco's standard
7am, they were stopped by police incredulous that anyone would be there at
such ungodly hours. 'The hardest part of the merger will probably be the
culture change,' remarks one western oil executive.
In scale, the merger has created an oil company that, it could be argued, is
without equal. Aramco is the sole custodian of almost all Saudi Arabia's
258bn barrels of oil reserves - a quarter of the world's total - and 186
trillion (million million) standard cubic feet of gas reserves. As the
state's oil producer, it accounts for about an eighth of total world crude
output and a fifth of world trade in oil.
To this, Aramco has added a total of 394,000 barrels a day of refining
capacity at the kingdom's three domestic refineries in Riyadh, Jeddah and
Yanbu and the kingdom's interests in the joint venture Yanbu (250,000b/d)
and Jubail (240,000b/d) export refineries, along with that in the 325,000b/d
Rabigh plant, which is a joint venture with Mr John Lakis, the Greek
businessman. Aramco already ran the Ras Tanurah refinery in the eastern
province, with a capacity, after fire damage in 1990, of 300,000 b/d.
The administration of the merger, according to Aramco staff on the
100-strong task force which undertook most of the work in July, has been
swift and relatively smooth. So far, most of Samarec's 11,000 staff have
kept their jobs - the great bulk being staff at the refineries - and only a
few senior executives have been moved from its former Jeddah headquarters to
Aramco's base in Dhahran. Aramco has created a fifth 'business centre' to
run the refining and marketing operations, headed by Mr Abdelaziz al-Hokail,
an Aramco senior vice-president.
But while the transition team say every effort was made to ensure that none
of Samarec's operations was disturbed during the merger, the same does not
apply to what had been the company's ambitious expansion and upgrading
project, where the process of Aramco-isation has had an immediate effect.
Before June, Samarec was well advanced with plans to upgrade all its
domestic and joint venture refineries at an initial estimated cost of
Dollars 4bn. Foster Wheeler, the US engineers, had been contracted to
oversee the plan, the first phase of which was to have been completed by
1996. But immediately after the merger, Aramco put the entire project under
review - where by early December it remained. As one Dhahran official puts
it: 'The planning work had been done, but it had not been done by Aramco -
and an Aramco man doesn't like to go ahead with something unless he's looked
at it very closely himself.'
Officials say the upgrade project has not been shelved, though there may be
'some shifts' in priorities. Aramco has meanwhile released Foster Wheeler,
while keeping on Brown and Root, the engineering group, to proceed with a
Dollars 1bn upgrade of the Ras Tanurah plant planned before the merger and,
it would appear, to serve as consultant on any future upgrading at the newly
inherited refineries.
Industry executives suggest that most or all of the Aramco refineries will
eventually be upgraded. 'From a basic technical point of view they ought to
be doing something,' says one. 'But how much and when depends on a number of
variables.' Chief among these, some analysts suggest, may be the
government's present budget deficit, and the opportunity Aramco's review
presents both to re-cost Samarec's plans and perhaps also to defer or at
least extend one of the kingdom's costliest industrial projects.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (12): Why European carbon tax is an
irritant - Oil production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saudi Arabia's post-Gulf war oil production policy has never been under
greater pressure. The slide in crude prices - in late November these hit a
five-year low - is the greatest test the kingdom has faced of its
determination to hang on to the expanded share of Opec production it won
during the war, when it boosted output to replace Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude.
But even if the kingdom were to agree to an expedient to buoy failing prices
under the pressure of its Opec colleagues, senior Saudi officials suggest
that any such move should not be seen as a deviation from the country's oil
strategy. 'No short-term action on our part should be interpreted as a
policy change,' says one.
Some analysts made just such an interpretation after the October Opec
ministerial meeting, when the organisation agreed slightly to increase its
official output ceiling to 24.52m barrels a day but Saudi Arabia forsook any
rise in its own production allocation. The kingdom's decision to stick to
its output of around 8m b/d was seen by some as a slide back towards
becoming Opec's 'swing producer' - a notion Saudi officials determinedly
resist.
While agreeing that 'price is an important issue', the officials refuse to
discuss any possibility of Saudi Arabia cutting output below 8m b/d, and a
share of Opec's total production of around a third. The officials hope the
market will recover of its own accord.
But the depressants overhanging the market - chiefly rising North Sea and
other non-Opec production and the possibility that Iraq may return to the
oil market - are unlikely to have diminished by the next Opec meeting early
next year. Some analysts suggest that the kingdom may well have to
countenance a cut in its allocation in 1994.
However, Saudi officials are unlikely to see this as an abandonment of their
commitment to sustained market share - one of the prime goals of post-war
policy and one which shores up the kingdom's long- standing pursuit of
moderate oil prices to assure steady growth in world petroleum demand and to
diminish incentives to harness alternative energy sources.
With these longer-term strategic aims in mind, and anticipating what many
experts predict to be a 1m b/d rise per annum in world oil consumption to
the end of the century, the kingdom has pressed ahead with expansion of its
oil production capacity. Present capacity is around 9.4m b/d and is expected
to reach a target sustainable capacity of 10m b/d by next year after a
programme that Aramco officials say will have cost around Dollars 15bn.
The scheme was planned before the Gulf conflict and accelerated - largely by
demothballing existing facilities - during it. Aramco staff say that work to
bring on stream the new light and super light crudes from Hawtah and
neighbouring fields south of Riyadh is near completion and the oil should be
available to lighten the kingdom's export mix by next year.
In pursuit of the kingdom's concomitant goal of achieving maximum oil market
stability through the greatest achievable integration, Saudi Aramco is
continuing to seek joint venture refining partnerships in or near its main
consumer markets.
This strategy first found fruit with Aramco's 50-50 venture with Texaco,
Star Petroleum, which locks in 600,000 b/d of crude in sales to Star's
refineries and US east coast distribution network. A 35 per cent share in
Ssangyong of Korea's refining operations followed in 1991 and it had been
widely expected that the third deal would tie Aramco into a joint venture
with Nikko Kyodo, Nippon Oil and Arabian Oil. The plan, which Saudi
officials said had passed feasibility studies, would have led to the
upgrading of two refineries in Japan and construction of a third in a deal
worth an estimated Dollars 10bn.
However, disagreement over the economic viability of the deal between two of
the Japanese partners led to its cancellation in early November. Aramco is
now in advanced negotiations with at least two south-east Asian oil groups -
one of these is understood to be Nippon Oil - for an alternative deal that
officials say will be of similar scale. An announcement is possible soon.
Aramco has also long been known to be negotiating similar deals with
European refiners, but nothing tangible has emerged from talks that the
Saudi officials have tried to keep firmly under wraps. One reason for this,
some Saudi officials say, is that the kingdom's opposition to European plans
to introduce a carbon tax - which Saudi Arabia is in the forefront of
opposing - 'weigh' on Aramco's negotiations, as to some extent do continuing
and unresolved discussions on access of Gulf refined and petrochemical
products to European markets.
Saudi Arabia has long emphasised what it calls 'reciprocal security' in its
oil relations - meaning that producer countries will commit themselves to
policies guaranteeing security of supply in return for consumer countries'
own commitment not to introduce barriers or restrictions to oil exports.
Carbon tax is perceived as exactly such an impediment.
Officials also say they have been dissatisfied with what they describe as
the attitude of some European oil companies in seeking upstream access in
Saudi Arabia in return for a downstream joint venture agreement. 'Once
companies in Europe are persuaded that they should change their attitude and
deal on commercial terms, then we'll be ready to enter into joint ventures,'
says one senior Saudi.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (13): Stock market is in limbo -
Growth is still being held back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After its heady post-Gulf war bull run, Saudi Arabia's stock market finds
itself in a state of limbo.
Much of the speculative froth which followed the war has been knocked out of
the market - though the past two years' often frantic activity have
nonetheless turned it into what is by far the most vigorous market in the
Middle East.
However, it remains unclear where its growing maturity will take it. In
particular, it is an open question whether the market is moving naturally
towards any greater role as an intermediary between Saudi Arabia's vast
reserves of privately-held wealth and the financing of domestic business and
industry.
It was essentially the repatriation of billions of riyals' worth of private
Saudi wealth after the Gulf war that revived the market, which had tarried
in the doldrums up to the war and after the oil price slump of the
mid-1980s.
Some economists in the kingdom calculate that up to SR30bn returned to the
country, a repatriation inspired both by the fall in returns available in
broader world markets and by unprecedented confidence in the financial
security and potential rewards available at home.
In a land officially based on Islamic law, and where interest-bearing
accounts or financial instruments attract religious opprobrium, much of this
money found immediate homes in real estate investments and the stock market,
both of which subsequently roared ahead on a speculative wave.
The effect on stocks was startling. The official market index, which had
been stuck minimally above its 1985 base level of 100 at the immediate end
of the Gulf conflict in February 1991, had by April the following year
reached a record level of 233.82. The number of transactions rose from
10,790 in the first quarter of 1991 to 67,017 in the same period of 1992.
Into this tide of speculative interest and available capital most of the
country's joint stock banks and a small handful of industrial companies saw
an opportunity to recapitalise - raising in the process what one banker
estimates to have been around Dollars 3.5bn in new issues.
That, in turn, considerably boosted the market's overall capitalisation and
liquidity. Since then, the market has turned down considerably, though while
the official index has bobbed along at around 180 for the past few months
now, the volume and value of trades have remained substantially above
pre-war levels and the new share-trading salons in the country's 12
commercial banks have never been more popular, or social, haunts.
Even in its newly slimmer guise, the market's vital statistics still dwarf
those of any other regional equity market. At the end of last month, the
total value of quoted shares stood at around Dollars 50bn, a league ahead of
the Middle East's second biggest capitalised market in Jordan, which had a
total share value of just over Dollars 3bn in 1992.
The value and volume of trades also considerably outstrip the comparatively
sleepy markets in, for instance, Bahrain or Kuwait. In 1992, a total of 35m
shares was traded in 272,075 transactions amounting to a gross value of more
than Dollars 3.4bn.
The banks, which alone are authorised by Sama, Saudi Arabia's central bank,
to trade directly in what has evolved as a floorless market, are predictably
delighted with the fee income the market has offered, which one describes as
a 'gold mine'. They are also cheered by what they consider to be the
market's maturity in having weathered the past year's downturn without this
having turned into a panicky sell-off. 'People are beginning to make
rational appraisals of stocks rather than try to take purely speculative
gains,' says the general manager of one Riyadh bank. 'They're beginning to
know the concept of book value and understand earnings per share - it's
becoming a normal market.'
But there remain features in the market, and for that matter the Saudi
economy itself, which some critics believe are likely to impede much
immediate further growth.
For one thing, the sum of actually traded shares represents only between 7
and 10 per cent of the market's gross capitalisation and, according to
bankers and economists, the great bulk of the country's total stock lies in
the few hands of the kingdom's wealthiest individuals where, for the most
part, it stays.
For another, activity is highly concentrated in a small clutch of the 58
listed stocks. By virtue of the flood of scrip made available by the banks'
recapitalisations, the banks alone account for six of the kingdom's top 10
capitalised joint stock companies, around 40 per cent of the market's
overall capitalisation and, in 1992, 51 per cent of the value of all trades.
Outside the banking sector, shares in only a couple of industrial companies
 -the 70 per cent state-owned Sabic holding company and Savola, the
vegetable oil group - could be considered liquid blue chips.
The market's other sectors fall well behind. The seven quoted cement sector
stocks make up just 6 per cent of total trades by value, the nine
agriculture companies half that, while the five regional electricity
utilities a mere 2 per cent of the value of trades. These, which pay a
government regulated 7 per cent dividend annually, are widely regarded as
the equivalent of fixed interest stocks.
For the moment, there are no signs of other companies rushing to market. One
reason for this is the possibility of an economic downturn over the next
year - something traders say has already made the market twitchy. Only three
companies are presently making arrangements for new issues. According to Mr
Abdul-Aziz al-Dukheil, chairman of the Riyadh-based Consulting Centre for
Finance and Investment, only three of the kingdom's 2,000 manufacturing
groups have so far made use of the market to raise capital.
Another reason, however, is the predominant structure of Saudi Arabia's
biggest trading and contracting companies, which for the most part are
tightly and privately owned by the kingdom's richest families. To date, most
of these have preferred the privacy of their family ownership and demurred
at the reporting requirements of the stock market. Moreover, most of these
groups appear able to finance their business expansions themselves.
Some analysts also point to the nature of the market as an impediment to
growth. Although informal brokers do operate in the large 'grey' market
outside the banks, they are actually forced to make trades through the
banks, which have exclusive rights to use the three-year-old Electronic
Securities Information System, the screens of which are proliferating across
the country's banks.
But some of these brokers claim that while the market is so decentralised,
and while there is no central floor to serve as an open arena for market
information, the present structure facilitates trading on privileged
information.
There is at the moment no real prohibition on insider trading. It is more
the norm than the exception for well-placed investors to discover leading
company results before they are formally reported. Such imperfect knowledge,
suggest several brokers, makes for an imperfect market.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Environmental Management (10): Debate rages on
liability / Review of the problem of contaminated land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cleaning up contaminated land has emerged as one of the toughest problems in
environmental management.
Developed countries, particularly those such as Britain, with a long
industrial history, have tens of thousands of sites which have been
contaminated over the years with waste and hazardous materials.
Even leaving aside the technical difficulties, the question of who should
pay the enormous costs involved is an important issue for many countries.
Although 'the polluter pays' is the widely adopted principle, it fails to
provide a complete answer because the polluter may be long dead, or
untraceable. And while public opinion may be clamouring for sites to be
cleaned up and the polluter punished, the business community has begun to
fight back because it fears the bill will land on its doorstep.
Earlier this year, the UK government was forced to drop plans for a register
of contaminated land because of opposition from business and property owners
who feared it would have a devastating effect on land values.
The US launched an assault on the problem with its 1980 Comprehensive
Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (Cercla), or Superfund
programme. This provides the government with money to clean up sites and
pursue polluters. But although the programme was supposed to prevent
disputes about responsibility from delaying clean-up work, the result has
been rather the opposite. Fewer than 100 sites have been cleaned up - but a
lot of money has been spent on legal argument. The Clinton Administration is
now preparing to re-authorise the Superfund, so the debate about
environmental liability is likely to be revived in the US.
In Europe, the Council of Europe drew up a convention on environmental
liability earlier this year, but several countries (including the UK)
declined to sign it because they thought it too sweeping in scope. The focus
has now switched to a green paper from the European Commission on civil
liability for environmental damage, which has also caused widespread
controversy.
The paper proposes a strict liability regime which would be harmonised
across the community. This would be linked to a compensation plan for cases
where the polluter cannot be identified. The paper has upset a wide swathe
of the business and financial community, which fears that owners of land
could be held responsible for damage caused by previous owners.
Opposition is particularly strong in the UK, which has a different legal
tradition from continental countries. Mr Tim Yeo, the UK's environment
minister, pledged in a recent speech to British bankers that the government
would oppose the directive in its present form. 'No evidence has been
provided to support claims that EU action in this area would deliver any
additional environmental benefits at all in the UK.'
Mr John Garbutt, head of the planning and environment unit at Nicholson
Graham &amp; Jones, a City of London law firm, says: 'It would establish a level
of liability which we don't accept in this country.'
Banks are particularly worried that they could be sued for environmental
damage caused by their borrowers. These fears date back to the late 1980s,
when a US court ruled that a bank could be liable where there was evidence
that it was in a position to influence the way a client disposed of
hazardous waste. Although the Environment Protection Agency subsequently
issued a regulation which annulled this ruling, that action is now being
challenged in the US courts. 'The position is still unsettled,' said a
spokesman for the American Bankers Association, which is urging Congress to
pass fresh legislation to clarify the issue once and for all.
In Brussels the Federation Bancaire, which represents the EU's banks, has
warned the Commission against going down the Superfund route, and has asked
for special exemptions for banks.
Some of the insurance industry's anxiety about pollution claims in the UK
was eased with an important House of Lords ruling earlier this month in the
long running Eastern Counties Leather case. The tanning company had been
found liable by a lower court for polluting the local water supply with a
solvent and told to pay the water company's costs even though the spillages
ceased in 1976 and the applicable EC directive did not require compliance
until 1985.
But the law lords said the tannery could not have 'reasonably foreseen' at
the time that it used the solvent that the spillages would lead to any
environmental hazards. The ruling was widely welcomed because it averted the
danger that the concept of retrospective liability would be introduced into
English law.
Even if the issue of liability can be settled by redrafting appropriate
laws, the question of who should pay, where the original polluter cannot be
traced, remains a heated issue.
Environmentalist organisations such as Greenpeace have put forward proposals
for a special tax on 'dirty' industries which would be used to fund a
clean-up campaign. The EU green paper proposes a compensation fund which
would be financed by a levy on industry. But as Mr Tom Handler of the
international law firm Baker &amp; McKenzie says: 'How do you define the
industries?'
In Germany, which has a special problem with its formerly communist eastern
region, the early purchasers of property there were exempted from liability
for any environmental damage caused by the property in the past.
In the UK, several laws and agencies already address the issue of clean-ups.
But the government is currently conducting a review after the failure of its
contaminated land register plan. The CBI has been arguing that the cost of
cleaning up past pollution should be borne by a partnership of private and
public sector money, but with increased emphasis on state and EU
regeneration grants. However, Mr Yeo was careful in his speech to bankers
not to commit the government to footing the clean-up bill.
'Deciding what the liability should be and where it should fall - on the
polluter, the owner or the state - is not easy. There is no simple solution
and it may be that different provisions should apply in different
situations. However, no one has the right to be regarded as a special case.'

FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Environmental Management (11): Cleaned up with
courage on the river Clyde - Health Care International centre

The site of a former asbestos factory and shipyard might seem a curious
place to locate a hospital. But such is the case with the new Health Care
International medical centre nearing completion at Dalmuir on the banks of
the Clyde.
The Pounds 180m project will contain some of the most advanced medical
facilities in Europe, including 64 intensive care units and 21 operating
theatres. It will also have a hotel with 168 bedrooms to accommodate friends
and relations of the patients. Yet six years ago, the site was derelict and
polluted, a relic of more glorious days on Clydeside.
The 50 acre site used to house a shipbuilder and a factory which made
asbestos building components such as pipes and tiles. After these went out
of business, it was taken over by the Scottish Development Agency, now
called Scottish Enterprise, and cleaned up in the hopes of attracting fresh
investment.
The site included a former ship basin. This was sealed off at the mouth, and
lined with a geotextile membrane - a woven man-made fabric which creates a
flexible barrier against contamination. The contaminated remains of the
factory were then tipped into the dock, and the top of the basin was sealed
with another membrane. The whole site was then covered in clean material and
landscaped.
The operation, which began in early 1988 and took two years, was monitored
by local health authorities and the Institute of Occupational Medicine.
Several thousand tests were conducted while the work was in progress.
Health Care International, which is owned by a group of business investors
headed by Harvard University. Scottish Enterprise, Samuel Montagu, the
merchant bank, and John Laing, the project's builders, had been looking for
a site for a new hospital to provide advanced medical care for patients from
Mediterranean countries. The requirement was for a location close to an
airport in an English-speaking country with medical traditions.
The Dalmuir site met all those criteria. It was 15 minutes from Glasgow
airport and only a few minutes from the centre of the city. The fact that
the site had a history of contamination was obviously important. But an HCI
spokesperson says the investors were satisfied that it had been cleaned up
to a high standard. They commissioned an independent test which prompted
some further remedial work to satisfy the US investors. The purchase went
through in July 1991; The hospital will take its first patients next March.
The clean up cost, Pounds 9.3m, was paid for by Scottish Enterprise. The
project shows that contaminated sites can be returned to productive use. But
it also suggests that the initiative needs to be taken by an official agency
with some money at its disposal.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (8): Never-ending drainson the
exchequer - Demand for electricity and water is growing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By A Special Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the kingdom's National Day - September 23 - there was a freak blackout,
lasting up to 16 hours in parts of Riyadh and the eastern province. It was
an uncomfortable reminder of how dependent the Saudi have become, in the
short space of 20 years, on uninterrupted power supplies, writes a special
correspondent.
Hectic developments in all sectors of the country's economy since the first
oil-price rises in 1973 have resulted in a generation that has grown soft,
compared with its predecessors, on an abundance of energy for
air-conditioning and refrigerated products and all the material comforts
that modern technology can buy.
The power cuts came in spite of the enormous - and overwhelmingly successful
 -efforts of the industry and the electricity ministry, the state
electricity corporation and its agencies, the regional Saudi Consolidated
Electric Companies (Sceco), plus the Saline Water Conversion Corporation to
increase power supplies in line with the rise in demand.
The kingdom covers an area the size of western Europe. The Sceco companies
are divided into four areas - central, south, east and west - with the
largely desert area in the north, bordering Jordan and Iraq, being supplied
by different state companies. Together, they produce some 17,000 MW of
power, which is supplemented by some 4,000 MW from the sea-water
desalination plants operated by SWCC.
The government has now embarked on, or has pending, plans costing some
Dollars 10,000bn to increase power generation by more than 9,000MW in the
next six years. Looking beyond 2000, the electricity corporation has
commissioned Quebec Hydro, with the Riyadh-base Saudi Consulting Services,
to draft a master plan evaluating needs for the next 25 years.
Demand is now coming as much from industry and commerce as from
householders. Five years ago, industry was responsible for only some 5 per
cent of total consumption. But since the economic boom of the last three
years, industry and commerce are now reckoned to be using some 20 per cent
of total supplies.
By far the biggest increase in demand has come from the western region,
including Jeddah and the holy cities of Makkah and Madinah. The region
consumes some 40 per cent of power supplies, but produces only some 25 per
cent of aggregate power. The second largest consuming area is the central
province which includes the capital, Riyadh. Then comes the eastern
province, taking some 20 per cent of total power, but producing some 30 per
cent of the country's total.
Most of the power network - 71.2 per cent in 1991 - relies on gas-burning
technology and this proportion is likely to rise. But the gas available from
the kingdom's master gas system is limited to the associated gas coming from
crude oil production of some 8m b/d. Until oil production is increased or
more natural gas is found, Sceco will have to make do on existing supplies
or turn to other forms of technology.
Such has been the increase in power consumption - some say the growth is of
the order of 10 per cent a year - that there are cities where the system is
operating dangerously close to design capacity. But the king is committed to
keeping prices low. This is a very sensitive political issue. When he tried
to cut subsidies in 1987-88, the public's reaction caused him to rescind the
cuts almost immediately.
The government now spends SR3bn (Dollars 800m) a year on electricity
subsidies. These exclude the amounts in hidden subsidies emanating from
Sceco not paying Saudi Aramco for gas and oil supplies.
Power generation is a never-ending drain on the exchequer. In addition to
the subsidised price of SR0.05 per KwH paid by industry, ministries and
agricultural users as well as hospitals, regardless of consumption, the
state is equally generous to householders and non-industrial businesses.
Since April 1992, these pay on a sliding scale from SR0.05 for the lowest
consumers to SR0.07, and SR0.10 up to SR0.15 for the biggest users.
There are those who say that the need now is to improve distribution through
construction of a national grid rather than concentrate so much in the
immediate future on building more plants without encouraging people to limit
consumption voluntarily. For instance, they point out that for the next six
years the Haj season - when some 3m Muslims make an annual pilgrimage to the
holy cities of Makkah and Madinah - will fall in the cooler autumn or winter
months, when theoretically less power would be necessary.
Lack of a distribution network had something to do with the decision, four
years ago, to abandon the proposed Dollars 1bn Xenel Industries aluminium
smelter at Yanbu. The smelter would have used up almost all the existing
power capacity, so it was proposed to extend the grid to Yanbu. Planners
were, however, reluctant to do this unless Sceco-West was able to charge
commercial rates for its power supplies on a sliding scale, depending on the
current market price for aluminium.
However, the smelter planners argued that the smelter should benefit from
subsidised prices available to the rest of industry. In the end, no tariff
system could be agreed, and prices started to slide on the world markets.
But should the opportunity arise again to build a smelter, there is still no
national grid to enable power to be transferred from one part of the kingdom
to another in the event of shortages in one region and a supply surplus
elsewhere.
In spite of budgetary problems, the power companies are pushing ahead with
ambitious expansion plans. The largest are:
construction of Riyadh's ninth power plant;
Power Project 9 - to provide the city with a further 1,200MW, for which
turnkey bids are being evaluated;
a 1,000-2,500MW power plant at Shuqayq, north of Gizan on the Red Sea coast
for Sceco-West, for which bids are due next march;
a 2,400MW plant at Ghazlan in the eastern province for which pre-qualifiers
are due to apply this month;
a 1,500-2,000MW plant at Shuaiba, about 25 miles south of Jeddah, for
Sceco-West, for which bids are due next year.
The greatest problem is finance. Each of these four plants will cost between
Dollars 800m (Shuaiba) and Dollars 2bn for the plant at Ghazlan. The power
companies need to raise money but the banks want a finance ministry
guarantee or at least a letter saying that included in the budget are sums
assuring creditors of repayment of principal and provisions for
debt-servicing. The export credit agency of the winning bidder could back up
the supplier credit, but not only has no supplier credit yet been put
together for the kingdom's power sector, but any export credit agency would
itself want a similar guarantee from the finance ministry.
Further privatisation of the consolidated electric companies could,
theoretically, be an option. All four are already publicly quoted with 40
per cent of their shares being held by 'GCC citizens'.
How many of these 'citizens' are truly private sector individuals or
companies rather than members or agents of ruling families - and as such an
arm of the government - is impossible to gauge. But since the kingdom's
power subsidies detract from the real profitability of the companies, this
kind of utility stock can hardly be attractive to an investor seeking a
genuine return on equity.
However, the utility companies are reported to be paying a net 7 per cent
return per share and given the amount of cash available in the private
sector, there would, it is reckoned, be buyers if equity financing was
deemed to be an option.
Sceco's attempts to raise money through the commercial banks have not so far
been successful. National Commercial Bank is reported to have sought to
raise some Dollars 400m for Sceco-West for the Rabigh 3 power expansion
project. After six months' negotiations, only Dollars 320m was raised, and
the banks which did participate had to be encouraged with front-end fees to
add to the  13/16 margin over Libor.
The same financing problem affects the Saline Water Conversion Corporation's
expansion plans. Power and water are inexorably linked. SWCC provides 70 per
cent of the water used in houses and a significant proportion used by
industry, as well as 20 per cent of the kingdom's total energy supply
through the power plants which form part of the desalination plants. So the
provision of desalinated water at subsidised prices for drinking and other
domestic uses is closely tied in with power generation.
As with electricity, the subsidies are generous. Consumers, both domestic
and industrial, pay SR0.15 per cubic metre for consumption of between 1-100
cu m per quarter; and on a sliding scale up to SR4 per cu m. These prices do
not make SWCC an attractive commercial proposition for investors.
Alarm bells have started to ring as consumption has mounted. At the
beginning of November Crown Prince Abdullah appealed to users to show
restraint, but appeals of that nature are likely to be ignored until
customers are made to pay more.
In the meantime, SWCC has to do its best to keep up with incremental demand.
Established in 1974 as a semi-autonomous body supervised by the agriculture
&amp; water ministry, it produces some 2.2m cubic metres of water daily from 22
desalination plants on the Red Sea and Gulf coasts. SWCC expansion plans,
including new plants under construction, envisage almost doubling the number
of desalination plants and available water for domestic and industrial use.
They include construction of a Dollars 1bn power and desalination plant at
Shuaiba to process up to 100m gallons per day, as well as produce 500 MW of
power for Scico-West.
But SWCC has also to expand its distribution system. Existing lines go only
from Jubail on the Gulf coast to Riyadh and Qassim province north of the
capital and from three points on the Red Sea coast to the main cities of the
western province; Jeddah/Makkah, Madinah, and Abha in the south-west.
But fundamental to any solution of water supplies is the need to persuade
consumers to use less. SWCC cannot be seen in isolation from other factors
such as the depletion of the water table by agricultural users, urban water
distribution (up to 40 per cent of water distribution in some urban areas is
being lost owing to faulty pipes and leaking connections); and sewage
disposal.
The tariff structure propping up the power and water subsidies not only
encourages the consumer to use more regardless: it prevents the government
from saving in one area of the annual budget or five-year plan in order to
be able to spend on basic infrastructural needs elsewhere. The decline of
these will sooner or later lead to the kind of widespread pressure for
improvements that will simply cost more for having been delayed so long.
Urban services such as sewage disposal are suffering from a chronic lack of
public finance. In the last five years, the condition of Jeddah, to cite
just one example, has visibly deteriorated because of these shortfalls.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (9): The results start to show /
Profile of Sabic's expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seldom can a company have undertaken so ambitious an expansion project into
the teeth of so unpromising a market as Sabic, the kingdom's vast industrial
holding group.
By the end of 1995, according to Mr Ibrahim bin Salamah, Sabic's
vice-chairman and managing director, the 70 per cent state-owned group will
have raised around Dollars 4bn to finance expansion projects at 12 of its 18
subsidiaries or affiliates, aimed at raising total output to 20m tonnes a
year from just over 12m tonnes at the start of the decade.
It is an expansion central to Saudi Arabia's industrial planning. The Sabic
group's family of companies and joint ventures represents the kingdom's
biggest non-oil industrial enterprise, employing 11,000 people. Since its
creation in 1976, it has been the predominant force behind the country's
development of its gas-based petrochemicals potential.
At the same time, however, the world recession has considerably softened
world prices of petrochemicals - Sabic's core market - with resulting damage
to the group's profits. Earlier this year, the group reported a 14 per cent
fall in 1992 earnings to Dollars 523m despite a 20 per cent rise in output
to 15.7m tonnes. Profits for 1991 had, in turn, been 24 per cent down on the
preceding year.
But there are tentative signs that the sheer scale of Sabic's expansion,
combined with the tremendous luxury of cheap gas feedstock it enjoys, is
turning the results around. Although Mr Salamah says profits for the first
nine months of 1993 remain 6 per cent down on the same period last year,
earnings in the third quarter were 10 per cent up on the same three months
last year. 'You can't say it's an improvement in prices,' he says. 'But we
now have more production coming on stream which, combined with our effort to
cut costs, is showing some results.'
He says the group has kept costs level over 1993 so far through efforts to
reduce bottlenecks at plants, cut inventories, improve transport and storage
efficiency and trim marketing costs. However, the group's chief cost
advantage in a weak world market is the fact that it purchases its feedstock
gases from Saudi Aramco, the state oil producer and refiner, at a guaranteed
30 per cent below the price of any competing supplier.
But Mr Salamah says that this apparent subsidy is less than it appears,
arguing that Sabic buys the gas direct from Aramco's gas-oil separation
plants and makes up much of the 30 per cent discount through having to
supply all costs of transport and refrigeration. 'The price is basically a
netback cost from the separation plants, not really a discount as such,' he
says.
By the end of this year, he says, total output of Sabic's mix of chemicals,
plastics, fertilisers, steel and gases will exceed 17m tonnes - around
two-thirds of which will be exported. 'The important thing is to maintain
our market share,' he says - which is currently about 6 per cent of the
world petrochemical market.
Of the 12 expansion projects, five are complete, four are between 80-97 per
cent finished and three are just getting under way. By Sabic's own
reckoning, just three projects are behind schedule.
Among the completed projects, Petrokemya, a wholly-owned affiliate, has
completed expansion of a new olefins plant boosting capacity to 1.8m tonnes
a year from 830,000 t/y. The new flexible feedstock cracker adds 300,000 t/y
of propylene output, 100,000 t/y of butadiene and 70,000 t/y of benzine
output, while raising ethylene capacity by 500,000 t/y to 1.15m t/y.
Propylene from Petrokemya will in turn feed Ibn Zahr, the country's first
polypropylene plant and another Sabic affiliate, which is slightly behind a
target of opening production of 200,000 t/y by the year's end, mostly to
feed local industries and the Gulf. This will see Sabic producing five basic
thermoplastic resins, complementing output of linear low density
polyethylene, high density polyethylene, polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride.
Elsewhere, Hadeed, Sabic's steel subsidiary, has completed expansion to 2.2m
t/y capacity from 1.6m t/y, Safco has also finished a new fertiliser complex
at Jubail to boost capacity in ammonia and urea, while Sharq has doubled
ethylene glycol capacity to 660,000 t/y and has nearly completed work to
boost polyethylene output. Gas, Sabic's air separation affiliate, has
additionally doubled nitrogen and oxygen output to feed other Sabic
industries to 490,000 t/y and 876,000 t/y respectively.
Ibn Hayyan, the majority-held plastics group, is in the early stages of
building a PVC paste plant which is due to come on stream in the last
quarter of next year, while work will begin in two to three months on a new
polyester plant for AIFC, the Sabic subsidiary at Yanbu. The main expansion
projects will be completed with an ethyl-hexanol plant in the early stages
of engineering at Samad, a 50-50 joint venture between Sabic and Taiwan
Fertiliser at Jubail. Both are set to begin production by early 1996 at the
latest.
Sabic is also on the verge of becoming one of the world's biggest producers
of methyl tertiary butyl ethers, the petrol additive which cuts carbon
pollutants while increasing octane. With the completion of new plants at Ibn
Zahr and Ibn Sina, both in the industrial city of Jubail, Mr Salamah
estimates Sabic will be producing 2.8m to 3m tonnes of MTBE a year by 1997.
In addition to this, Sabic has also recently consolidated its research and
development into a single new research centre in Riyadh as part of a
concerted effort to rationalise the group's cost base. Mr Salamah estimates
Sabic's annual R&amp;D budget at SR400m annually.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (10): Subsidies scythed - Farming and
self-sufficiency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Appropriately enough, one of the biggest pruning efforts so far undertaken
by the Saudi Arabian government in its preliminary attempts to trim the
towering budget deficit is in agriculture. The scythe has been taken to
wheat subsidies.
Since the 1970s the government has guaranteed the kingdom's 28,000 grain
farmers a premium purchase price to assure security of wheat supplies. This
year, it amounted to between Dollars 400 and Dollars 530 a tonne. That is so
far above world wheat prices that the kingdom has not only exceeded its
domestic requirement of 1m-1.3m tonnes since 1984 but also become the
world's sixth biggest wheat exporter.
In the last two years, wheat production has hovered at record levels of
around 4m tonnes. Since 1987, the number of wheat farms has shot up by 37
per cent, and deliveries to the Grain Silos and Flour Mills Organisation,
the state purchasing body, have risen by more than half. Wheat subsidies,
much the biggest part of an estimated Dollars 2.6bn spent in total
agricultural subventions in 1992, passed the Dollars 2bn mark.
But no more. Through a mix of policies which include trimming the outright
subsidy in favour of other grains, particularly barley, and dissuading big
producers from producing wheat, the agriculture ministry is bent on
restoring balance to a sector which economists and outside observers had
long singled out as wasteful, both of government funds and precious fossil
water.
Some critics reckon that since agriculture accounts for around 90 per cent
of the kingdom's 14bn cubic metres of annual water consumption, and wheat
the bulk of that, the kingdom perhaps exports as much as 80 per cent of its
yearly water output, embedded in wheat, every year.
Foreign experts have estimated that at present rates of depletion, Saudi
Arabia has only 15-20 more years of water to tap, though officials refuse to
comment on such figures. Instead, they point to countrywide dam-building
projects designed to help replenish aquifers by holding what annual rainfall
there is, and by emphasising that the thirsty wheat harvest is being
controlled.
By setting a purchase quota and buying first from smaller producers,
staggering subsidy payments to bigger farmers and forcing the latter to
build their own grain storage silos - the state's own, holding 2.38m tonnes,
are full - the government hopes that the next harvest will fall to 2.5-3m
tonnes and slide further thereafter. 'Even if we had a healthy budget
position, we would have to think about these subsidies,' says a senior
agriculture ministry official. 'If we'd left it to the farmers, output would
double every year.'
Instead, grain farmers are being encouraged to produce barley, some 3.5m
tonnes of which are imported a year as fodder. Barley subsidies are half
those granted to wheat, while higher domestic production will help the
kingdom's other runaway deficit, on the trade account. The ministry believes
the kingdom will reach self-sufficiency in barley within two years.
Saudi Arabia is already self-sufficient, or almost, in fish, most seasonal
vegetables, fruits, eggs, poultry and dates - of which the kingdom is among
the world's biggest producers. Nearly 600,000 tonnes of dates are produced a
year, and all but a fraction, which is donated to fellow Islamic states as
charity, is consumed domestically. Both production and demand are rising at
around 10 per cent annually.
The search for self-sufficiency was prompted by fears in the 1970s that the
west might impose a food embargo in retaliation for the kingdom's use of the
oil weapon after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. According to the agriculture
ministry, between 1987 and 1991 food imports halved in volume to just over
4m tonnes, while the value of local food production rose to 60 per cent of
total consumption from 53 per cent. Locally-produced foodstuffs rose from 51
per cent to 74 per cent of the volume of food consumed. The value of food
exports rose to SR19bn in 1991 from SR13bn in 1987. Yet the sector as a
whole accounted for 9-10 per cent of gross domestic product, at constant
prices, throughout the period.
The agriculture ministry is now making efforts to increase production of red
meat, particularly lamb, by encouraging joint stock agriculture companies
and other farmers in the relatively rainy northern areas to farm sheep. Even
so, it will be hard to make much of a dint in gross imports - for the Eid
al-Fitr feast after Ramadan alone, the kingdom imports 2m live sheep, mostly
from New Zealand. Nevertheless, the ministry says local production is now
keeping pace with an annual rise of 4-5 per cent in demand. A few companies
are beginning to make use of wool and sheepskin, byproducts of the country's
lamb consumption which were largely ignored in the past.
But self-sufficiency is only one aim of the kingdom's continuing undertaking
to subsidise agricultural production. The government has always emphasised
the importance of the subsidies as a means by which the kingdom's oil wealth
can be shared with the rural hinterland, at the same time dissuading people
from leaving the countryside for Saudi Arabia's main cities. 'If we'd not
done this, Riyadh would be another Cairo,' says a ministry official, 'and
we'd be spending billions instead on infrastructure and roads. This way we
help limit city growth, slums and crime while at the same time keeping
people living on our borders.'
Success in this regard is difficult to quantify, though government figures
show a fall in the proportion of people working in agriculture from 14 per
cent of the workforce in 1985 to just under 10 per cent today. Perhaps as
strong a political motive for the subsidies is the fact that the farmers'
lobby includes several land and farm-owning princes - a reason why cuts in
overall subsidies to the sector are likely to be undertaken with some
delicacy.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Environmental Management (8): Plans to 'wrap' it
up - The chemicals industry must apply self-interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Few industrial sectors have an environmental image as appalling as that of
the chemicals industry. In the UK, public approval for the chemicals sector
has declined from more than 50 per cent at the start of the 1980s to less
than 20 per cent last year. The declining popularity of its chemical
companies has been mirrored by that of its counterparts around the globe.
'The chemical sector is rightfully cast among the problem industries,'
concedes Mr Nicholas Reding, vice-chairman of Monsanto, the US chemicals
company.
The dangers of not improving the performance and image of the industry are
serious. 'If the industry fails to clean up its act, it runs the risk of
being legislated out of existence, argues Mr David Buzzelli, director
responsible for the environment at Dow Chemical, the US group.
'Failure to improve both performance and image will be very expensive.
Planning approvals for investment will be refused, making sites uneconomic.
Plants will be driven further from employees and markets, further adding to
costs. The chemicals industry could be legislated to the point of economic
non-viability,' he says.
Mr Mike LaGraff, BP Chemicals manager for health, safety and the
environment, agrees: 'The industry must improve its environmental
performance not because it is being altruistic - although as corporate
citizens we do care. It must improve out of self-interest.'
The industry is being asked to spend ever-increasing amounts to meet
environmentally-related legislation at a time when chemicals groups can
least afford them.
Many chemicals segments are struggling with over-capacity, poor demand
growth, dire operating rates, declining margins and tumbling profits. Some
sectors, such as the European petrochemicals industry, are bleeding red ink
and require restructuring.
Nevertheless, the chemicals industry has spent billions of dollars trying to
clean up its act. Around the globe, the sector is trying polish its
tarnished image and regain public trust through its programme of Responsible
Care.
This involves measuring emissions in a credible way, improving environmental
performance and then communicating that performance, warts and all, to the
public. The programme was initially created by the Canadian chemicals
industry, was adopted by the US, migrated over the Atlantic to Europe, and
has now proliferated worldwide.
Convincing all companies of the value of Responsible Care has not been easy.
But most now accept the need for the programme.
The key to the process is measuring and then improving environmental
performance. 'We don't want to put out propaganda. There is no point
communicating, if you don't have anything of substance to communicate,'
warns Mr Kasper Eigenmann, head of corporate unit safety and environment at
Ciba, the Swiss group.
Over the past decade, most companies have invested heavily in end of pipe
solutions - treating waste after it has been created. Now they are turning
their attention to waste minimisation. Some groups have adopted the concept
as their mantra. Dow, for example, has a programme called Wrap - waste
reduction always pays.
The rhetoric behind Responsible Care is laudable, but implementing the
programme is far from easy. It involves far more than just investing in
technology and plant. Rather, it requires a change in an organisation's very
culture.
'Responsible Care is not just a question of following a set of rules. It's
like driving a car. There are a lot of regulations about how to drive, but
we still have bad drivers. In the same way you can have companies that
comply with regulations, but are not environmentally sound. An integral part
of Responsible Care is a change in culture within the organisation,' says Mr
Jacques Puechal, president of Cefic, the European Council of the Chemical
Industry, and chief executive of Elf-Atochem.
The impact of environmental measures can be dramatic. Take Leverkusen, the
main manufacturing location for Bayer, the leading German industrial group.
The giant chimneys stacked along the Rhine no longer spew smoke and are home
to hawks and other bird-life. The Rhine is sufficiently full of fish to
support a population of storks nearby during the summer.
But to repair its damaged reputation, the chemicals industry must not only
improve its environmental performance; it must also communicate that
improvement in a credible manner. Much of this historically secretive
industry is now trying to become more open in its communications with local
communities and the public.
The issue of credibility is the key. It depends foremost on the quality of
environmental reporting. However, the sector is still divided on the issue.
While some groups, such as BP Chemicals, have taken to publishing all their
emissions, others, such as Ciba and Rhone-Poulenc of France, prefer to
publish indices. Solvay of Belgium published its first set of figures this
month. Others still refuse to publish group figures.
At Monsanto, Mr Reding admits he had worries when the company started
publishing its entire emission figures because they might provide ammunition
for environmental groups. 'In fact, the external reaction has generally been
pretty good, even if we have a long way to go to reduce our emissions,' he
says.
The chemicals industry has made enormous strides in its environmental
performance and reporting. But it must make greater efforts in its
communications if it is to change public attitudes to the sector.
Britain's chemicals industry spent more than Pounds 1bn on the environment
last year, according to figures released by the industry's trade body. That
represents about 3 per cent of the industry's Pounds 29.9bn turnover.
The Chemical Industries Association said the UK chemicals sector was the
first British sector to publish its spending and environmental emissions
figures. It was also the first national chemicals industry to publish such
statistics, the association said.
The association reported that between 1990 and 1992, environmental spending
increased from Pounds 830m to Pounds 1.032bn.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Environmental Management (9): California sets the
agenda - Car makers are not yet persuaded that 'green' is good for business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volkswagen, the car maker, keeps goldfish. They live, apparently healthy and
content, in a big tank at Wolfsburg, one of Europe's largest car
manufacturing plants. The water they swim in has been used in the paint
plant, or in umpteen other processes before being recycled  - 'in-house' -
back to cleanliness.
The fish represent one of the giant German car maker's favourite
illustrations of how it is managing its business with due regard for
environmental considerations. Short of forming a subsidiary to sell goldfish
and chips, VW in this case is nevertheless hard pushed to see the business
opportunity and increased profitability which, legislators insist, should
arise from sound environmental management.
It is not all bad news. For example, the complex and expensive equipment
which VW, General Motors and others in the motor industry have installed to
collect gaseous solvents from a number of processes, and which in the past
would have merely escaped into the atmosphere, does have some commercial
payback.
The gases can be used as a feedstock in on-site electricity generating
plants, thus marginally reducing fuel bills. But in most aspects, and for
the motor industry as a whole, environmental management means cost - and a
lot of it.
Few industries are exposed to environmental legislation and 'green' social
pressures in so many forms. It is easy to see why. The motor industry is the
world's single largest manufacturing activity, producing about 50m units a
year of products, each containing at least 5,000 individual pieces of widely
varying materials. It is a huge consumer of energy and raw materials in its
production processes - and a prodigious generator, through those processes,
of waste.
But the products, too, are the target of environmental regulation and
concern. The drive to curb exhaust emissions builds in cost and complexity
from first concept on the computer to final assembly, as designers seek to
accommodate increasingly more intricate catalytic converter systems and the
plumbing and electronic management that goes with them.
For companies such as Johnson Matthey (JM), involved in the supply of the
precious metals-coated catalyst itself, there has indeed been a business
opportunity as a result of Europe following North America into making 'cats'
mandatory on all new cars from the start of 1993. It has meant the opening
up of a whole new European market sector, for which JM fought vigorously in
the 1980s propaganda wars between advocates of 'cats' and those of the
seemingly rival 'lean-burn' technology (until it was realised that the
technologies were in fact complementary).
But for vehicle makers 'cats' have meant a significant on-cost which, though
justified in environmental terms, has inevitably squeezed their profit
margins in terms of how much can be passed on as higher prices to the
public. Emissions-linked costs appear poised to escalate further.
In North America, traditionally the leader in tightening the exhaust
emissions screw, standards for 1994 will require a further 40 per cent cut
in hydrocarbon emissions and a 60 per cent reduction in oxides of nitrogen
compared with the previous standards.
However, such big percentage cuts do not mean another big leap forward in
reducing the amount of pollutants emitted compared with a car fitted with no
catalyst at all. Even the relatively simple cats of five or more years ago
removed 90 per cent of exhaust pollutants compared with a 'non-cat' car.
The new standards are thus acting on the remaining few per cent - at what
the motor industry insists, because of the technology now involved, is a
similar cost to removing the initial 90 per cent.
Again, the manufacturers know they cannot pass on these costs in full - or
that if they did so collectively (quite apart from anti-trust
considerations), higher absolute prices would reduce the size of new car
markets and lead to an older - and 'dirtier' - car population as motorists
hung on to their vehicles for longer.
Not surprisingly, the industry's own, fruitless urging has been that the
biggest immediate impact on exhaust pollution could be made by government
sweeping the older car population from the streets, and perhaps providing
fiscal incentives for the purchase of new ones.
Instead, California has pointed the way towards yet more draconian emissions
standards - and thrown another huge burden on the world's motor industry -
by insisting that 2 per cent of a car maker's sales in the state must be of
'zero emission vehicles' (ZEVs) starting in 1998, rising to 10 per cent in
the early 21st century, as well as requiring populations of ULEVs (ultra-low
emission vehicles).
Given the propensity for other US states and, eventually, other continents
such as Europe to emulate California, the intended California standards are
being taken seriously - not least because state legislators say
non-complying manufacturers would be excluded from the Californian market
altogether.
Most manufacturers have interpreted the ZEV as necessarily being powered
electrically - by batteries - with the exception of a few exploring hydrogen
power.
Thus a huge research effort into viable electric cars has been going on for
the past several years. In one example of the effort, the North American
'big three' car makers, GM, Ford and Chrysler, are participants in a federal
government-backed consortium spending Dollars 1.2bn in search of new
batteries which might overcome the power and mileage limitations of existing
types.
GM is building a fleet of 50 prototypes of a car called the Impact, made
mainly out of aluminium, in the hope that an electric car can be made at
least faintly competitive with a petrol counterpart. But deep scepticism
exists. And in terms of business opportunity the prize is not the creation
of an important new market, but at best a partial substitute for the old.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (7): Deficit casts shadow over growth
/ Assessing  prospects in the banking sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whichever way you measure them, Saudi Arabia's banks are in robust shape.
Consolidated profits for the country's 12 commercial banks were up by more
than a third in 1992 over the previous year and figures for the first three
quarters of 1993, from those which have so far released them, are 24 per
cent ahead of the same period last year. Indeed, Saudi British Bank is 50
per cent up on the period, while Saudi American Bank looks poised this year
to become the kingdom's first bank to report annual profits over SR1bn.
Gross bank lending was up 27 per cent in 1992 over the preceding year,
assets rose more than 13 per cent and the consolidated capital of the 11
listed commercial banks, after a spree of recapitalising issues on 1992's
bullish stock market, rose by half. The overall capital-to-assets ratio of
the commercial banks at the end of June this year was a secure 8.7 per cent.
Liquidity also remains high - with more than 30 per cent of consolidated
assets of SR298bn by the end of 1992 being held as cash and due to banks.
Overall, based on 1992 results, the gross profile of bank assets showed a
near-exact split of bank assets of a third in highly liquid assets, a third
in loans and a third in investments, including both domestic bonds and
overseas bills and other investments.
Added to this, National Commercial Bank, the kingdom's oldest and biggest,
has rejoined the fray refreshed. After a SR6bn injection of capital from the
bin Mahfouz family, the predominant of the private bank's two family owners,
the bank finally issued results this year for 1991 and 1992 after a troubled
few years off the reporting map.
The results showed a 168 per cent rise in profits for 1992 to SR427m and are
the first approved by the bank's auditors since the bank's accounts were
qualified in 1987, 1988 and 1989 in a dispute over bad debts.
Mr Abdulhadi Shayif, NCB's deputy general manager, offers only a coy 'no
comment' when asked if 1990, for which figures have not been released, was a
loss-making year. But he says that damaged confidence in the bank after the
US indictment last year, on charges connected with the BCCI scandal, of Mr
Khalid bin Mahfouz, who later resigned as chief operating officer, 'has long
been behind us'.
So, there is almost unalloyed good news all round, apparently. But while the
profitability of the kingdom's banks looks secure for the foreseeable
future, some in the industry are starting to counsel caution. Although
deposits continue to rise - they are up 12 per cent in the first half of
this year - some economists and bankers point out that the banks have now
enjoyed the bulk of an estimated Dollars 30bn which Saudis repatriated after
the Gulf war.
From now on, some economists and bankers suggest, banks are likely to raise
their deposit bases substantially only by competing with one another for
market share through sharp marketing and improved services - such as the
recently introduced electronic point of sale technology springing up in the
kingdom's still flourishing shopping malls.
This will be an increasingly tough scrap. In the past couple of years the
leaders in the consumer market have been the tightly managed joint venture
banks such as Saudi Hollandi, Saudi British - which estimates it has swelled
its deposit base by 20 per cent already this year - Saudi American and Saudi
French banks.
But the country's two biggest banks, NCB and Riyadh Bank, are gearing up to
take on their generally nimbler competitors. Although NCB denies it has in
any way fallen behind the field during its last few troubled years, it has
seen its share of assets slip from a third to just over a quarter of the
banks' total assets.
The arrival earlier this year of Mr Michael Callen, former head of
Citibank's worldwide finance sector, as special adviser is part of a
thorough rationalisation of NCB's retail operations, combined with an
attempt to increase automation and slim the bank's staff - by at least 500
to 6,400 by the end of next year. 'Our 1993 figures will show a rise in our
share of deposits,' says Mr Shayif.
Riyadh Bank is also undertaking a Dollars 100m revamp of its services and
automation with the aid of consultants contracted from Ernst &amp; Young's Los
Angeles offices under a strategic shift towards improved customer banking
introduced by Mr Suleiman al-Mandeed, who took over as general manager in
the spring.
But outside the drive to win over more of Saudi Arabia's increasingly
sophisticated banking public, economists and bankers are mixed over
prospects for profit centres elsewhere. The great unknown, and potentially
the darkest shadow over the banking sector's growth beyond 1993, is the
government's sustained budget deficit and what it plans to do about it.
As for financing the present deficit, bankers have few doubts about their
ability to mop up the supply of treasury bills and government development
bonds required. The flood of quasi-government borrowing, particularly
associated with Sabic's huge petrochemical expansion plans, has ebbed since
1991 and early 1992 - though bankers view this with mixed feelings. Further
borrowing associated with new power projects, expansion of the country's
telephone capacity and water projects is likely over the next year, but
according to some bankers the government will be under some pressure to
improve margins on such borrowing.
More troublesome is the prospect of government spending cuts and the likely
effect this will have as it trickles through to the still booming private
sector. Bankers already report numerous ministries to be delaying -
sometimes by as much as a year - payments to their private sector clients.
Delays in some previously planned state-backed expansion projects, such as
those to upgrade the country's main oil refineries, are also likely to
depress private sector growth next year.
Some economists, however, suggest it would be wrong to worry too much. As Mr
Henry Azzam, chief economist at NCB, argues, the private sector has
increasingly stopped relying on the public sector in recent years. Despite a
10 per cent fall in oil prices over the past year, the private sector has
grown by 6 per cent. Mr Azzam says that most Saudi banks have 'barely
scratched the surface' of possible fee-based services they could offer the
kingdom's top companies. 'It remains an unsophisticated market in that
respect. Very few banks do advisory services, the full range of treasury
services and hedging instruments.'
Others, though, are gloomier - particularly about the prospects for a fall
in private sector growth. One chief economist of a leading Riyadh-based bank
suggests that the headlong rush in the construction sector is already
overdone. 'It's clearly going to burst,' he says. 'People have yet to
realise that the party is over.'

FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (6): One day, the call will be
answered - A special correspondent reports on plans to expand telephone
lines fourfold by 1997
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the past five years, the country's demand for telecommunications,
particularly telephone lines, has exceeded all expectations. A Jeddah
newspaper, in an article earlier this month, suggested that 'the average
Saudi' spends more time on the telephone than his counterparts in other Arab
countries.
However, placing an international call at peak business hours in either
Saudi Arabia or the receiving country is much more difficult today than,
say, two years ago. All too often, the caller gets the recorded reply: 'We
are sorry, your call did not go through; please try again later.' Bankers
report long waits for new telephone lines, while many factories are said to
be resorting to portables for which there is less of a wait.
Saudi Telecom, the operational arm of the Posts, Telegraphs &amp; Telephones
ministry, has a target of one telephone, a mobile phone and a pager for one
in every five people. That would mean at least 3m of each item for a
population which last year was officially estimated to be 16.9m, of whom
12.3m were Saudi nationals. The population is said to be increasing by 4 per
cent or nearly 500,000 a year across the country, and possibly by 5 per cent
in the cities. To reach the PTT's target, Saudi Telecom's strategy is to
expand telephone lines nearly fourfold by 1997.
Part of the reason for this surge in demand is that domestic telephone
charges are heavily subsidised. While international calls are more expensive
than in the US or Europe, domestic calls are part of the government's
welfare state benefits to add to a list that includes schooling, medicine,
domestic flights, power, water and some parts of agriculture. Free dialling
within a province was introduced in April 1992 - at the same time as
electricity and water charges were cut for consumers - and the cost of other
telephone calls went down by 40 per cent.
Saudi Telecom is, however, a cash cow. It would make an attractive
proposition for privatisation were it not for the government's concern over
control and monitoring; so that, as has happened more than once in the past
30 years, it has on occasion closed the entire system without warning at
times of acute political sensitivity. Even so, the telecom sector has so
attractive a cash flow that five domestic banks and one offshore bank
recently put together a finance package for the winning bidder of the
outstanding jumbo telephone expansion contract.
Since the 1970s and early 1980s when Sweden's Ericsson with Phillips of the
Netherlands set up the original Dollars 5bn national telecommunications
system, the standard of service has been very high. Overall supervision
under successive three-year management contracts has been with Bell Canada
and more recently with Australian Telecom, whose existing contract will
expire next October. Earlier this month, Saudi and foreign companies were
invited to prepare bids for the next three-year contract.
Until the recent announcement of the jumbo expansion plan, several smaller
works had been commissioned. In 1991 the UK's GPT (General Electric/Plessey
Telecoms), in which Siemens has a 40 per cent interest, was given a Dollars
30m contract to install 2,000 card payphones in the Riyadh, Jeddah, and
Makkah-Madinah areas.
Last year, the US's AT&amp;T surprised the market by offering a 44 per cent
discount on a Dollars 90m gross bid to supply hand-held and vehicle-mounted
mobile telephones; it being standard practice in this market to offer a
discount at the time the bid envelope is opened. At the end of last month, a
Finnish company, Technoman, won a SR28m (Dollars 7.5m) order to set up
200,000 pager lines by 1995, and Siemens last February won a Dollars 120m
contract to supply and install 190,000 telephone lines to help ease the
serious shortage for domestic and business users. But this was only a taster
for the jumbo contract now being evaluated to try to bring supply in line
with demand.
Six pre-qualified companies - AT&amp;T, France's Alcatel, Ericsson with Japan's
NEC, Canada's Northern Telecom and Siemens with input from GPT - have made
offers which with discounts vary from Dollars 3.5bn gross to Dollars 1.6bn
for the PTT's Telephone Expansion Project number 6 (TEP6). This involves
supplying and laying 500,000 to 1.5m lines plus provision for other
infrastructure needs including support buildings, microwave towers,
fibre-optic links, satellite connections, subscriber radio telephones for
rural and desert areas, new switching systems and maintenance. Early this
month, Alcatel was reported to have offered to install 1m lines for the same
price as 500,000. Provision for new cellular telephones, originally part of
the jumbo package, has been taken out, to be bid separately by the same
companies.
Because of the widely differing systems on offer, the technical evaluation
will not be complete until well into next year, by which time the amount of
money available to the PTT ministry will have become partly clearer after
publication of the 1994 budget in January.
When the PTT called for these bids, it also sought supplier financing to be
part of the tender offer. This would involve the export credit agency of the
country or countries concerned, but the kingdom's banks are also so liquid,
and with telecoms having the cash flow that it does, that six banks came up
with their own financing proposal for the winning bidder.
For obvious reasons, the banks are not prepared to discuss details of their
proposal but the logic behind their initiative is not hard to find. Official
budgetary constraints are such that expansion schemes of this kind are more
and more likely to go off-budget; to be financed by bank lending and/or
supplier finance, and possibly equity financing or leasebacks.
To date, the problem has been that even export credit agencies, not to
mention domestic or offshore banks, want a finance ministry guarantee to
ensure that the settlement risk on the total loan money lies with the Saudi
government, even though PTT, as a government ministry, is tantamount to
being a sovereign risk. But the finance ministry is no more likely to give a
guarantee for TEP6 than it was for the recent long-term riyal loan for Saudi
Consolidated Electric Company for the Western Region.
Since equity financing through privatisation would seem not to be an option
in the case of PTT, the banks are having to call on all their innovative
abilities to find ways to take part. One area reportedly being discussed is
for the winning bidder(s) on TEP6 to raise the capital to complete the
contract and to lease the system back to the government.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Environmental Management (6): A whole heap of
trouble - Bronwen Maddox follows Europe's squabbles over waste packaging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The row about Europe's mountains of waste packaging is shaping up to be one
of next year's biggest environmental controversies.
The dispute has pitted European countries against each other - and set
environmentalists against the packaging industry. It also offers one of the
best examples of how 'green' enthusiasm can lead to bad and expensive
regulation.
Pressure on governments to tackle the question of waste packaging has been
growing steadily. Some of the most prominent environmental groups, such as
Friends of the Earth, have made recycling one of their highest profile
campaigns. They say they have found it easy to arouse public support -
people are reminded of the issue every time they look at their kitchen
dustbin. One UK government official says: 'recycling is the kind of thing
people like being told to do - they like thinking they can make a
difference'.
As a result of that pressure, the European Commission is trying to thrash
out minimum recycling levels for the 50m tonnes of packaging waste produced
each year in the European Union. Half of the total comes from households,
15m tonnes from services and 10m tonnes from industry.
Separately, the UK is considering whether to introduce a levy on landfills -
licensed rubbish dumps - to increase the rate of recycling and incineration
of waste. The political pressure for new regulation in Europe and in the UK
is tempered, however, by the cautionary spectacle of the crisis in the
German recycling industry.
German 'green' enthusiasm spawned tough laws which stipulated that almost
all packaging must be recycled. But the Duales System Deutschlands (DSD),
the national collecting and recycling scheme set up by industry, has been
forced into near-bankruptcy this year. Industry failed to develop recycling
technology in time, and markets for recycled paper and plastic were slow to
develop.
As a result, mounds of unwanted waste packaging, some in its raw, unrecycled
form, poured into other European countries. The House of Lords select
committee on the European Communities commented in October: 'What was at
first hailed as a pioneering approach to the environmentally responsible
management of packaging has become, within Germany and internationally, a
considerable embarrassment'.
The German overspill has undermined the UK's developing schemes for recycled
packaging. However, they already faced considerable problems: technical
difficulties, high costs, and lack of markets for recycled products.
According to Mr Steve Webb, policy director of the National Association of
Waste Disposal Contractors, recycling metal such as aluminium soft drinks
cans or steel food cans is cheaper than making new ones out of unused
aluminium.
But many kinds of plastics are technically difficult and extremely expensive
to recycle. A single plastic bottle, he points out, contains many different
types of plastic in its cap, its reinforced base and its sides, while
collection and sorting costs are high.
Glass recycling shares some of those problems and is 'struggling', in Mr
Webb's view, following a merger of the two main buyers of used glass and a
fall in the price they pay for collected material.
Even paper recycling, which is favoured by many local authorities, is
problematic, paper manufacturers argue. It can only be recycled usefully two
or three times before the fibres become so short that the paper is weakened.
'It is better to burn it to get the energy back', in Mr Webb's view.
Incpen, the Industry Council for Packaging and the Environment, which argues
that the proposed imposition of strict quotas takes no account of these
problems, is particularly sceptical of the recycling of household waste.
Commercial and industrial waste is at least homogeneous and easily collected
in bulk, Incpen argues. But it says that the cost of collecting and sorting
domestic waste - with the possible exception of metals, which can be
extracted with magnets - is likely always to make household recycling
uneconomic.
Doubt hangs over the economics of many kinds of recycling - some may be
environmentally harmful, some studies suggest (schemes may require high
volumes of polluting chemicals, or consume a lot of energy). Incpen
comments: 'It is pointless to conserve 'visible resources' - raw materials -
at the expense of using 'invisible resources' - fossil fuel energy. The
overall aim from an environmental perspective should be to make efficient
use of resources.'
This warning is recognised by the House of Lords select committee:
'Recycling is not a cost-free operation; it may be that the costs, in energy
or cash terms or both exceed the costs of the alternatives'.
While the committee urges governments to discourage 'excessive' packaging,
it also concludes that for some types of waste, incineration combined with
schemes to recover energy may be the best treatment. It argues, too, that
the UK is blessed with a large number of suitable landfill sites as a result
of the quarrying of building materials, and that landfill may often be a
cheaper and environmentally superior destination for waste.
The debate is far from over. However, it is clear that recycling is not
always the best choice for waste. The analysis of when it is appropriate is
complex, and in many cases has not yet been carried out.
Given those difficulties, it is hard not to have some sympathy with
industry's worries about the imposition of fixed recycling quotas. If those
concerns are ignored by politicians anxious to capitalise on one of the
strongest strands of green enthusiasm, the result could be an addition to
industrial costs without real environmental justification.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Environmental Management (7): Eager to sell green
advice - Andrew Jack asks whether consultants are worth the money

<TEXT>
As the number of environmental consultants continues to expand rapidly, so a
growing number of existing and prospective clients are asking an awkward
question: are they really worth the money?
Firms around the country are eagerly cashing in on the potential to sell
environmental management systems, green reporting advice and other forms of
expertise to businesses under legal and commercial pressure for reform.
The environmental consulting sector has itself begun to recognise the wide
variation in the quality that it delivers, and has started to address the
concerns with at least two accreditation schemes.
But as one former senior executive at a large environmental firm says: 'The
consultancy business has grown far faster than the work. There are 700 firms
all scrambling around for business, and they are all finding it very tough.
Profits are down.'
'Environmental measures cost money; they do not save money,' he says. 'Once
you've got beyond the public relations froth about creating an improved
image, it costs . . .'
If environmental management systems are genuinely so worthwhile, say the
critics, why have companies not implemented them already?
Mr Jeremy Barrett of Environmental Data Services (ENDS), a London-based
environmental research company, argues that companies lack the expertise,
and are only gradually becoming aware of the benefits that management
systems can bring. 'There is huge hypocrisy in the criticism,' he says.
'There are a lot of bad consultants, but there are many who have also saved
companies stacks of money.'
On one hand, there is a growing cadre of environmental managers being hired
directly by companies in response to a variety of external pressures, which
arguably might dispense with the need for so many consultants. On the other
hand, many are ill-prepared for the job, and may seek out outside help more
than ever in the past.
A survey of 210 such managers by Ends, published last month* suggests that
not only are numbers growing, but their role is changing from in-house
policeman into people 'adding value' to their companies by savings through
environmental practices in areas such as waste minimisation.
Yet it also highlighted the fact that only 39 per cent had any environmental
content in their basic education, and the vast majority learnt merely by
attending conferences from time to time.
The survey showed that just 14 per cent of respondents did not use external
consultants periodically. For two-fifths, the reason for bringing in outside
help was the greater skills of the adviser for one-off advice. One eighth
said the reason was lack of resources or time to do the job internally.
However, it admitted that 'adverse views about consultants were not
uncommon' in its questionnaire responses. Typical comments included:
'Everybody has got to earn a living but consultants are awful and we would
only use them in very particular circumstances'; 'They tell you what you
know, or should know, and give it to you in a glossy package'; 'Some
consultants I would not have as a gift'.
The survey is critical of these remarks, pointing to projects where there
have been cost savings, and demonstrating that demand for consultants is
likely to grow sharply in the future.
Mr Tony Bishop, manager, environment services at PA Consulting, says: 'The
cynical view is that an awful lot of companies are having a go at it for
themselves and not getting any results. This area is new and it's difficult.
Managers cannot buy this knowledge off the shelf.'
'There are a lot of consultants who have not delivered anything. I don't
think any consultancy appears cheap. It has to be justified very carefully.
People are more and more asking for tangible, direct, bottom line benefits.'
He adds that there is a glut of technical competence, when consultancy is
far more about communication and the ability to persuade companies to
implement change. 'Otherwise you end up with a fat report that no-one can
use,' he says.
That is one reason why PA Consulting has developed its own simplified
version of an environmental management system, known as managing
environmental performance. It uses a series of 'site environmental
fingerprints' to develop measures and future plans. It can be used as the
basis for BS 7750, the environmental management standard, but without the
cost and formality - which many companies can do without.
Mr Mike Samuel, environment affairs manager at Sainsbury, the high street
retailer, believes he has obtained good value from the external advisers his
company uses because he knows their limitations.
'I tend to look at consultants as providers of information,' he says. 'They
help us ask the basic questions: whether we are, what should we be trying to
achieve, the sorts of outputs to get there.'
'The actual work is something you've got to do yourself. We have always
tended to keep things in-house until we feel we don't know what to do, and
then we use them.'
He defends the need for green consultants, particularly for their broad
knowledge of the issues and how companies are responding to them. 'The
environment is one of those things that creeps up on you,' he says. 'An
organisation often has difficulty seeing the wood for the trees and asking
what it is actually trying to achieve.'
He emphasises several points in getting the best value from environmental -
as with other sorts of - consultants:
Make sure the people pitching for the job are the ones who will be doing the
work.
Be sure to specify exactly what the consultants will achieve, and have it
written into the contract.
Don't bite off more than you can chew. Be realistic and ensure the
recommendations made can be implemented.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (5): Gulf memories run deep - The
foreign policy agenda has changed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 1990-1991 Gulf crisis has proved a defining episode in the evolution of
Saudi Arabia's foreign policy.
Until Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, senior Saudi officials acknowledge that
their attitude to the region and to the wider world was set primarily by the
experience of others and by the assertion that the Arabs shared a common
heritage. The shock of Iraq's occupation of Kuwait, and, as importantly, the
reaction of other Arab states and organisations to it, taught the kingdom a
lesson which it is still digesting.
The first and most important result is that Saudi Arabia now insists, above
all, that it must have a foreign policy which rests primarily on an
assessment of its own national self-interest.
Senior officials argue that before the invasion of Kuwait, the kingdom was
susceptible to a foreign policy agenda based on the colonial and
post-colonial experiences of other Arab countries. In the three decades from
1960 to 1990 this manifested itself in pan-Arabism, Arab socialism and the
belief that the solution to the region's problems lay essentially in
ever-closer Arab co-operation.
The hollowness of those slogans was brought home to Riyadh by the actions of
President Saddam Hussein. 'If the Arab League had been responsible for
resolving that crisis, then Iraqi troops would still be in Kuwait today,'
comments a Saudi official. Many Saudis remain disgusted by the attitudes
adopted by some fellow members of the Arab League, particularly Jordan,
Yemen and the Palestine Liberation Organisation.
'We cannot forget, and we cannot forgive,' says another official. 'But there
are two things in this life that you cannot escape - families and
neighbours.' Accordingly, Saudi Arabia would not rule out an improvement in
relations with the PLO, Jordan and Yemen, but it would have to be based on
their acceptance of the damage they had done. Equally, there would have to
be a fundamental review of both the organisation and the policies of the
Arab League before the Saudis could feel confident again of its value as a
regional organisation.
'The future effectiveness of the Arab League depends on its ability to
articulate a shared and common purpose,' says a Saudi official. 'It is
weakened and divided. Basic reforms have to be carried out. Above all, this
means that it must give supremacy to international legality.'
The Gulf crisis brought home to Saudi Arabia that there was no other path to
follow. It now emphatically rejects the concept of a separate 'Arab
legality'. The rules of international law have to be applied as much to Arab
nations as they are to the rest of the world.
The concept that there is a different set of rules for Arabs has been
finally buried, along with the former assumption that the main threat to
Middle East stability comes from outside the region. 'It did not come from
the industrialised world, nor did it come from the ideological confrontation
between east and west. It came from within: from the war between Iran and
Iraq and then from Iraq alone,' says an official.
This, in turn, has led Saudi Arabia to review its attitude towards the
provision of aid, or as it was put officially, 'from our policy of acting as
the treasury for other people's expenses'. Nothing is more irksome for
Saudis than the knowledge that its heavy financial commitment to Iraq during
the eight-year conflict with Iran helped President Saddam to acquire the
military muscle to invade Kuwait. It will think long and hard before helping
any neighbouring country to develop its military establishment, but remains
willing to provide assistance 'which could help other countries to build a
better economic and political future'.
It is an indication of how much Saudi attitudes have evolved that 'a better
political future' is also deemed to include greater political pluralism
which, had it been practised in Iraq, might have prevented the invasion of
Kuwait, or at least led to a military pull-out in the face of western
threats.
This does not mean that Saudi Arabia is anywhere near advocating for the
region the democratic processes of the western world, but officials are keen
to stress how much they share the western view of international legality.
Suggestions that the kingdom might have become more dependent on the US in
particular as a result of the Gulf crisis are rejected, but it is now more
openly accepted that a greater commonality of interest has developed between
Washington and Riyadh.
It applies, with qualifications, to the US 'dual containment' policy towards
Iraq and Iran. Insofar as that policy articulates the need for both Baghdad
and Tehran to abide by international resolutions, it enjoys Saudi support,
but there would be less enthusiasm in Riyadh for any attempt to isolate the
two countries.
However, the depth of suspicion in Saudi Arabia about Iran's intentions
continues, despite cosmetic signs of an improvement in diplomatic relations.
Saudi Arabia suspects that the Shah of Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini and
President Rafsanjani all shared a common desire to be the dominant political
and economic force in the Gulf, a view reinforced by Iran's recent
unilateral actions in asserting sovereignty over Abu Musa, and the Greater
and Lesser Tumbs islands, near the Strait of Hormuz.
Saudi Arabia has also welcomed officially the declaration of principles
signed by Israel and the PLO in Washington on September 13, but wants to see
far more progress towards a comprehensive Middle East peace settlement
before it is willing to speculate about any wider implications.
In particular, officials are totally dismissive of suggestions by Israel
that Saudi Arabia could be one of the next Arab countries to establish
formal diplomatic relations. 'They are just dreaming', says a senior
official. He is also sceptical about the possibility on an early end to the
primary Arab boycott of Israel, while pointing out that Saudi Arabia has
already taken steps to phase out the application of the secondary boycott,
which discriminates against international companies which do business with
Israel.
Riyadh is also being cautious over the extent of its financial commitment to
the Palestinian interim self-governing authority which will take over
administrative functions in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in the
wake of the Israeli withdrawal or redeployment of its forces.
The Saudi Fund for Devel- opment will channel the kingdom's initial
first-year pledge of Dollars 100m, designed to improve basic infrastructure
such as roads, schools and housing.
The fund has also agreed to provide further funds during the five-year
transitional phase, but will wait to see the progress that is made in
disbursing the initial tranche before announcing the size of further
financial support.
Officials emphasise that there is no question of the funds being directed to
Tunis, the present headquarters of the PLO, another reminder of how deep the
Gulf war memories run.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Environmental Management (4): Quality concern - A
green tinge to a company's financial statement may not add up to much
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Environmental reporting may be on the rise, but much more needs to be done
to justify the quantity of trees that are being cut down to sustain it.
A substantial and growing number of companies now have at least a green tint
to the pages of their financial statements. The concern is over the quality
of the information that they provide: much is more hollow words than
meaningful content.
A survey released last month by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm,
canvassed the practices of 690 of the leading companies in Belgium, Canada,
Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, the UK and the
US*.
More than 100 companies produced a separate environmental report, while 400
at least referred to green issues somewhere in their annual report. As
Professor Rob Gray, director of the Centre for Social and Environmental
Accounting Research at the University of Dundee, puts it, this represents a
'phenomenal' upsurge in the last few years.
But when it comes to issues such as consistency, comparability,
accountability or the degree to which information is verifiable, the results
are more disappointing - and in line with other similar findings.
Just 83 of the companies in the KPMG study set quantitative targets. Even
though 128 provide some figures to illustrate their performance, the
majority were just brief references to issues such as costs of environmental
investment.
A few also mentioned the fines imposed on them, although there was a general
tendency to highlight 'good news' and ignore the bad, particularly among US
companies. KPMG argues this reflects concerns over the risk of exposing
themselves to litigation.
When it came to any indication that the information provided was backed up
by any guarantees, the results were also disappointing. Only 63 companies
disclosed that they had had an internal environmental audit, and 33 an
external audit.
Mr Kim Hayworth, partner in charge of KPMG's National Environment Unit in
London, admits that the growth in green reporting has been slower than many
expected.
'The pressure to report is not strong,' he says. 'It is an issue but it is
not at the top of the agenda yet.
'Also, companies are still trying to put together the information on
environmental performance. It does not emerge easily.'
Mr Hayworth argues that this is partly linked to the growing
decentralisation of the management of organisations. 'It is difficult to
demand subsidiaries to provide data.'
On the other hand, he stresses that a number of voluntary corporate
reporting initiatives are being developed. 'For a company starting up now,
the standard is very high,' he says. Reports are expected to be logical,
honest and full of quantifiable data.
He cites as examples the most recent reports of companies such as British
Telecom, RTZ and Thorn, which are beginning to provide considerable
information on responsibilities and quantified targets for environmental
improvement.
A handful go further still, such as BSO/Origin, the Dutch computer services
company, which has attempted to put a cost on all of its activities
affecting the environment.
Aside from the specific examples, Mr Hayworth also draws some consolation
from several new voluntary environmental reporting guidelines which are
being developed, such as the Public Environmental Reporting Initiative in
the US, and the work of the Global Environmental Management Initiative.
The question is how far these guidelines are relevant to smaller companies,
or to those outside the industry sectors which have developed them: normally
in the highly-regulated chemical or extractive areas.
More generally, there are few attempts by governments to impose stricter
reporting. One exception is the Netherlands, where a draft law proposes a
requirement on companies to publish detailed information on environmental
impact and improvement plans.
In the absence of tougher legal requirements, there is one other factor
which may drive companies to implement strict environmental management
standards internally although these may not be reported: commercial
pressure.
That will come primarily from litigation, but also partly from companies
which are beginning to demand accreditation or other evidence of sound
environmental management from their suppliers.
Elsewhere, and in less litigious sectors, voluntary initiatives are the
norm.
Both BS 7750, the British standard on environmental management, and the
European Union's Ecological Management and Auditing Scheme (Emas) have been
unveiled. But both are awaiting final tweaking and any significant take-up.
Emas was substantially diluted over the last few years as a result of
intensive lobbying from industry, switching it from a mandatory into a
voluntary scheme, and from something with company-wide scope to being
site-specific.
Despite the changes, there are still considerable issues to be resolved in
its implementation. A pilot study on Emas completed over the summer by PA
Consulting, showed considerable enthusiasm for the concept.
But there were concerns about whether the considerable additional costs  -
particularly related to external verification of reports - would outweigh
the benefits, especially when applied to smaller companies.
Mr Tony Bishop, manager for environment services at the firm, argues for
several distinct types of environmental management system across different
industry sectors rather than a uniform approach, depending on the degree of
formality required and the environmental impact.
Meanwhile, if companies still need considerable prompting to develop
meaningful statements, the consulting industry that has grown up around the
environment equally needs to improve its performance. There is wide variety
in the quality of services provided.
The Institute of Environmental Assessment has launched an environmental
auditors' registration association scheme for individuals. The Association
of Environmental Consultancies has launched a registration scheme for member
firms.
How independent and effective they will prove remains to be seen. But
without high standards, the surfeit of consultants peddling management
systems and environmental reporting advice to their clients could simply add
to confusion and waste.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Environmental Management (5): Not a lot of cover
to run for - Insurance is causing persistent management headaches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pollution is giving Mr Alan Fleming, the executive director of the the UK's
Association of Risk and Insurance Managers, a headache.
Mr Fleming views the shortage of cover for environmental liabilities as one
of the biggest problems facing the 300 or so industrial and commercial
insurance buyers represented by the association.
Faced by legal uncertainties and fears that they could be landed with the
costs of cleaning up more than 500,000 acres of polluted land, insurers are
increasing their prices and reining back the scope of protection offered to
customers. 'There is no question that it is an important issue,' says Mr
Fleming. 'The big concern is retrospective liabilities. Unless the
legislation becomes absolutely clear, I am afraid we will find another area
where the insurance industry is not responding,' he adds.
Insurers are concerned by several trends.
The establishment of a more rigorous regime of pollution control and
remediation in the UK. The 1990 Environmental Protection Act provides powers
for local authorities to force site occupiers to clean up contamination
irrespective of proof of fault.
Similarly, the 1991 Water Resources Act makes provision for cleaning up
polluted rivers. Under the legislation, bankers foreclosing on a loan to a
property company could become liable for the cost of cleaning up
contamination.
Europe: Insurers are also worried about potential developments in European
law, following indications that some EU officials favour an extension of
strict liability in relation to clean-up costs.
Recent common law cases: The ruling of an appeal court last year, in a case
involving Eastern Counties Leather and Cambridge Water, caused particular
consternation before it was overturned by the House of Lords on December 9.
The appeal court awarded well in excess of Pounds 1m in damages and costs
against Eastern Counties Leather even though it found that the company had
not been negligent when it regularly spilled chemical into ground water.
Although the pollution was 'unforeseen', the court found Eastern Counties
liable in 'nuisance' - an older legal concept in which it is not necessary
to show fault.
Another recent case involving allegations of land contamination by Coalite,
a chemicals company, has also caused some controversy.
Coalite was allegedly responsible for polluting land and a river near three
farms at Bolsover in Derbyshire, thereby restricting the farmers from
selling dioxin-contaminated produce for more than a year. The company
eventually agreed to pay 'substantial damages' (thought to be at least
Pounds 200,000) to the farmers in an out of court settlement. Coalite is
still negotiating with Royal Insurance, its insurers.
Reinsurance: Finally, companies are also under some pressure from their own
reinsurers to reduce the coverage they give for pollution. It is understood
that a decision taken by French insurers, to exclude pollution cover from
their liability policies sold from the beginning of 1994, followed decisions
by large European reinsurance companies.
UK insurers withdrew cover for 'gradual' pollution - typically caused by
leakages or seepage of contaminants such as in the Cambridge Water case - in
April 1990. Even so, many observers believe they could be vulnerable to
claims for 'historic' pollution against policies underwritten before then
(in the same way as US insurers have received claims on comprehensive
general liability policies before pollution exclusions were introduced in
the 1970s).
Like their US counterparts, UK insurers underwrote liability policies on a
so-called 'occurrence' basis, in which the relevant policy for a claim is
the one which covers the year when the 'insurable' event occurred, rather
than the year in which the claim was made (the so-called 'claims made'
basis).
In a number of cases US courts have ruled that site owners and operators who
were ordered to clean up can claim on insurance policies stretching back to
the original point at which pollution is deemed to have begun.
Some observers believe that British insurers could ultimately be exposed to
a heavy clean up bill. Mr Randolph Fields, a lawyer who has developed a
thriving business in researching insurance coverages in the US, is confident
that he can locate the historic coverages in the UK and warns that the UK
industry faces liabilities of 'catastrophic proportions'.
Mr Tony Baker, head of public affairs at the association, plays down the
danger, suggesting that, at most, UK insurers will face a maximum of a tenth
of an estimated clean up bill of Pounds 30bn. He points out that much of the
UK's worst pollution has been caused by nationalised industries - such as
coal and gas - which have no insurance cover. He suggests that, even then,
in the worse possible circumstances the resulting bill of Pounds 3bn would
be paid over decades, diluting its impact.
Even so, Mr Baker concedes that insurers are considering the introduction of
further restrictions to public liability policies and could withdraw
coverage even for 'sudden and accidental' pollution, which occurs, for
example, when chemicals are spilled.
'People could withdraw cover from public liability policies, making
protection available on a 'stand alone' basis which would have to be
separately underwritten,' he says.
Already buyers have suffered sharp increases in prices over the last 18
months. Companies whose operations are deemed to be high risk' - such as
waste management companies - can now pay as much as 1 per cent of the annual
turnover for insurance.
One composite insurer has already made even limited pollution cover
dependent on proof that the buyer of the policy has taken measures to
control environmental risks, and brokers fear that the market could
introduce new risk management criteria - for example, adhesion to new
British environmental standards.
Already a number of companies including Swiss Re, AIG Europe, ECS
Underwriting and Zurich offer a policy covering against the risk of gradual
pollution, which is linked to measures such as site surveys, environmental
audits and the remediation of pre-existing contamination. The policies are
expensive and so far take-up has been limited.
Brokers believe that the scope of these new types of policy could become
broader, wider, and their take-up common, as the availability of traditional
insurance cover is reduced.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (4): Royal boundary to free speech -
The stirrings of political life in the kingdom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When a middle-ranking member of the House of Saud opens a conversation by
suggesting that most of the Council of Ministers should be dismissed for
having failed to come up with any new ideas for managing the nation's
economy, it is clear that political life in the kingdom is rather less
moribund than its detractors suggest. Saudi Arabia is not facing an economic
crisis, he insists, but is suffering from over-centralised, incompetent
ministries best noted for the opportunities they have missed.
Such comments to visitors are still likely to be made only by those
confident of their royal status, but they do reflect a widely held view
among the younger and more entrepreneurial generation of Saudis that a
fundamental revision of government policies is required. The suggestion that
too many ministers have been too long at their posts for the good of the
country is not a particularly new phenomenon, but it has gained wider
acceptance as a result of the Gulf war and the consequent impact on the
kingdom's exchequer.
King Fahd may have responded to those concerns in August when he finally
named the 60 members of a consultative council (majlis al-shura). The
concept of such a council was first raised three decades ago, and given the
monarchy's legendary caution in initiating reforms, it is likely to be some
time before the role and importance of the council can be fairly assessed.
Reactions to the limited powers vested in the council, and the composition
of its members, have varied widely. Taken at face value, the consultative
aspect of the council's role appears paramount. It cannot initiate
discussions and will deal only with issues referred to it. Its
recommendations need not be adopted and will be carried forward only if they
coincide with those of the Council of Ministers.
Mr Mohammed Ibrahim al-Jubair, the speaker of the council and a former
minister of justice, will have considerable authority over the working of
the council. Deliberations are to be kept secret, members cannot speak at
full council sessions for more than 10 minutes without special dispensation,
and no documents can be removed from the council building. For critics of
the council, particularly those yearning for a more westernised, democratic
reform of Saudi political life, the king's proposals smack more of a rubber
stamp than of genuine reform.
However, within the kingdom, that seems to be very much a minority view.
Many Saudis appear genuinely impressed by the quality and educational
attainments of the council members and are cautiously optimistic that their
deliberations will add an important new layer of ideas and debate within the
decision-making process. King Fahd, who is also prime minister, can choose
to adopt the council's recommendations just as much as he may reject them.
To that extent, the council could well become the main vehicle through which
policy options are aired and trial balloons floated without any endorsement
or commitment by the ruling family.
Several western diplomats admit that they were surprised by the council's
composition. They had presumed that the members would strongly reflect the
tribal, regional and religious characteristics of Saudi society. Instead,
the professions are powerfully represented with 32 of the 60 members having
gained advanced degrees at western universities, two-thirds of them in the
US. The conservative religious establishment is only modestly represented
and no members of the royal family are included.
Conversations with the new members of the council reveal how seriously they
are approaching their task. The appointments are full-time, salaried and for
an initial period of four years. By the middle of last month most of them
had already gathered in Riyadh and initial work had begun on the formation
of committees where the bulk of the council's work is expected to be done.
Members acknowledge that they are entering uncharted territory and are
unsure what their influence may be. However, several have indicated that
they expect to be given substantial topics to research and debate, such as
methods for improving government revenues, how to achieve an overall
reduction in the budget deficit, together with defence, foreign and social
issues.
Some senior members of the business community hope that the council will
evolve into a primary source for new legislation, allowing the council of
ministers to concentrate more on its role as the executive arm of
government. 'Ministers just do not have the time to think about
legislation,' says one businessman. 'They should be left to continue their
primary role which is executive, and rely on the majlis al-shura for the new
ideas.'
King Fahd has also taken modest steps to reform the council of ministers. A
decree issued in August sets a four-year term for ministers but this can be
extended, both for the council as a whole and for individual ministers. It
also specifies that ministers should not hold other government jobs,
although exceptions are provided for. Similarly, restrictions are placed on
ministers following separate business careers.
These actions, together with the creation of a second ministry devoted to
Islamic affairs, could also be interpreted as a response to criticism by
radical Moslems. But the latest group to seek public attention for its
grievances, the so-called Committee for the Defence of Legitimate Rights,
set up last year, has also been left in no doubt that the government will
not tolerate overt criticism. Some members of the 60-strong group, drawn
mostly from a conservative, academic background, have been detained, and
others banned from leaving the kingdom.
Such strong official reaction might appear to dampen any western hope that
the ruling family is moving towards a marginally greater degree of popular
participation in government. But for Saudis it is more likely to have
reinforced the understanding that criticism of the king and his government
should not stray outside the family domain. In theory, a commoner can say
whatever he wishes to King Fahd, and will be listened to. But if he
challenges that convention, then displeasure is likely to be demonstrated.
It is a lesson which the consultative council will, initially at least,
observe with care.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (2): Budget targets may not be met -
Impact of the Gulf war on the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Saudi Arabia is well versed in handling the peaks and troughs of oil export
earnings. The 1980s saw annual variations of up to Dollars 100bn as the
kingdom was affected by sudden changes in supply and demand, and fully used
its role as the swing producer within the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to smooth out fluctuations for the greater long-term
benefit of the producer nations.
However, the financial impact of the Gulf war, particularly on the level of
Saudi Arabia's reserves, has put an end to that role. The kingdom is now
like any other member of Opec in that it will need to maximise its oil
export revenues for the foreseeable future if it is to prevent its budget
and current account deficits from running out of control.
The government can fairly point to the fact that it has already enjoyed a
measure of success with deficit-reduction policies during the five-year
period before Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990 and threw its programme
badly off course. During the second half of the 1980s, Saudi Arabia cut its
overall budget deficit by more than half, from over 20 per cent of gross
national product to less than 10 per cent. During the same period the
current account deficit on the balance of payments was reduced by 5 per cent
of GDP to 11 per cent.
But President Saddam Hussein put an end to those creditable achievements.
The average budget deficit for the years 1990 and 1991 came to about 17 per
cent of GDP and the current account deficit climbed back to about 14 per
cent.
It has been the government's stated intention to get back on track as
swiftly as possible. Its 1992 budget was supposed to see a sharp drop in
spending with total expenditure set at just over Dollars 44bn, compared with
an annualised rate of Dollars 61bn over the two previous war-affected years.
This should have seen the deficit decline to a forecast 3.3 per cent of GNP.
In the event, the government failed to reduce spending by its target of 28
per cent and provisional figures suggest that at about Dollars 55bn, it was
some Dollars 11bn over budget. As a percentage of GNP, the deficit was
nearly three times larger than the target.
Although officials decline to discuss budget details, it seems clear that
capital expenditure was substantially larger than forecast and there was
also slippage in the announced programme of reducing subsidies, particularly
those related to the agricultural sector. The government has promised to try
harder in the current financial year and there is evidence that it is having
greater success, particularly in reducing the subsidies paid to wheat
producers. The main cuts were designed to fall on project expenditure,
especially that related to security.
However, there is little additional evidence, real or anecdotal, to indicate
that firm government action has been taken. The spending target of Dollars
48.5bn appears unrealistic and the final figure could well turn out to be
within the Dollars 53-55bn range. At the same time, government revenues
appear certain to fall below the forecast Dollars 45bn as a result of
weakening oil prices. This would suggest another budget deficit this year of
more than Dollars 10bn. With little or no growth forecast in the overall
economy, the aimed-for reduction in the budget deficit as a percentage of
GDP will not be achieved.
This failure has to be seen in the context of the concerns expressed
privately six months ago by a visiting team from the International Monetary
Fund. The mission warned then that even if the Saudi government met its 1993
budget targets, total debt would rise from 56 per cent of GDP to some 60 per
cent. Unless further stringent measures were taken in the succeeding years
the debt-to-GDP ratio would rise to 80 per cent by 1997.
These forecasts were also made on the assumption of a modest annual increase
in the level of oil revenues. But, the Fund added, if the government failed
to meet its 1993 targets, which now seems certain, the medium-term deficits
would be even larger and debt servicing would place an increasingly heavy
burden on budgetary resources.
Although the authorities remain confident that the banking sector's high
liquidity level will continue to finance the budget deficit through the
traditional means of government development bonds, there are fears among the
private sector that in the medium term its access to funds could be
squeezed. Such a prospect should be an additional cause of alarm for a
government which for nearly a decade has insisted that the private sector
must take a growing responsibility for providing economic growth.
One probably inevitable consequence of all these pressures is that the
government will have to turn to taxation, in some form, as a way of boosting
its revenues. Ministers have been adamant during the past two years that
social conditions have not permitted either a significant cut in subsidies
or any form of additional charges. On the contrary, subsidies on some
utilities were actually increased in order to offset the modest increase in
inflation stemming from the Gulf war. But the nettle will eventually have to
be grasped, and there are some indications that the government is already
looking at modest initiatives, such as a tax on international and domestic
airline tickets.
There is also considerable scope on the expenditure side, where military and
infrastructure projects appear to be ripe targets for cuts or delays. The
Gulf war experience demonstrated that the kingdom's ability to resist
external threats resulted as much on the facilities it was able to provide
for foreign armies as it did on Saudi Arabia's own armed forces. Those
facilities proved their value, and military experts argue that the kingdom
requires more time to absorb the equipment it now has, rather than embarking
on a programme of new acquisitions. In other words, it could well do without
do without some of the Dollars 30bn of weaponry it has contracted to buy
since the invasion of Kuwait.
Such cuts or delays would also help to ease the balance of payments problems
which have mirrored those of the budget. The current account deficit last
year at Dollars 19.4bn was substantially above forecast and casts serious
doubt on the outcome for 1993 which, it had been hoped, would not rise much
above Dollars 11bn, or around 9.3 per cent of GDP. Even on that basis, the
IMF had projected a worsening current account deficit over the next four
years, reaching some Dollars 19bn in 1997, assuming also strong capital
inflows. Weakening oil prices and a lower than expected level of foreign
investment in Saudi Arabia would obviously make the picture considerably
gloomier.
The problem is exacerbated by the loss of the reserve cushion caused by the
Gulf war. Net official foreign assets were estimated at Dollars 72bn at the
end of last year, equivalent to about 29 months of imports. But this tells
only part of the story. Over 30 per cent of the assets managed by the Saudi
Arabian Monetary Agency is held as statutory cover for the currency. Another
30 per cent is held against letters of credit and liabilities to the
commercial banks, while some Dollars 20bn or more represents loans to Iraq
and other countries which are most unlikely ever to be repaid.
In the middle of this year, liquid funds actually available to Sama were put
at a little over Dollars 7bn, and were unlikely to show much, if any,
improvement in the short to medium term.
Further external borrowing is, of course, an option, but there is no
evidence that Saudi Arabia has tapped international markets beyond the
Dollars 4.5bn it raised at the time of the Gulf war. Some bankers suggested
recently that the fact the government has not borrowed this year indicates
that the authorities are proving more successful than had been supposed in
controlling the current account deficit. This may also have served to dampen
recurrent speculative pressures against the riyal.
Some Saudis continue to argue privately for a modest devaluation against the
dollar, but there is no evidence that the government sees any benefit to the
economy from such action. On the contrary, it almost certainly fears the
damage that a devaluation would have on local confidence and the consequent
impact on capital inflows from abroad.

One of the reliable moments of comedy during environmental conferences is
the announcement from the 'chair' that there will be a workshop on 'green
industry'. Delegates will promptly begin to move towards the corners of the
seminar room allocated to alternative topics: animals, world trade, perhaps
global warming.
That will leave a small group of chemical industry executives and the newer
breed of environmental campaigners eyeing each other nervously before they
settle down to talk about whether regulation is really making business
greener.
Industry is one of the oldest targets of environmental pressure groups. The
lobbyists might credit themselves with some success: regulation to curb
industrial pollution is now at the heart of the UK's environmental policy.
Yet the government is still besieged with complaints from both
environmentalists and industrialists that the rules are not working: too
loose, says the 'green' side; too bureaucratic, says the 'brown'. Is either
chorus right?
The core of the regulation is set out in the 1990 Environmental Protection
Act, an ambitious and sprawling piece of 'enabling' legislation created by
Mr Chris Patten, then environment secretary, when popular green enthusiasm
was at its height.
The principle underpinning the rules is the cumbersomely named 'Batneec' or
'best available technique not entailing excessive cost'. The task of
applying it falls to the pollution inspectorate.
Its director, Mr David Slater, has a modern taste for 'long-term dialogue
with companies', and for 'cost-benefit' analysis. He argues that 'We're not
in the business of putting business out of business'. Instead, he and his
inspectors like to spend time discussing with individual companies how they
can minimise waste.
Industry, at first hostile to much of the new regulation, has recently been
making more conciliatory sounds, and companies say they appreciate the
flexibility the inspectorate is showing. In the early days of the Act, as
all parties were struggling to interpret Batneec, there were many fierce
complaints, particularly from the chemical industry, that the rules were
unworkable.
Mr John Cox, director of the Chemical Industries Association, which
represents some 250 UK companies, says 'there are still problems of
interpreting Batneec, but it is much better than it was'. In the early
months, he says, local inspectors often displayed 'a different understanding
of the regulations from the central inspectorate'. But some sticking points
have now been ironed out, he says.
While environmentalists are increasingly willing to contemplate cooperation
with industry rather than confrontation, many have regarded the
inspectorate's measures - and industry's mellowing response - with
suspicion. They particularly dislike some of the inspectorate's recent
decisions - such as allowing two power stations to burn orimulsion as fuel,
which campaigners have dubbed 'the world's filthiest fuel'.
In particular, they accuse him of having 'gone soft' on polluting industries
during the recession. While there are indications in parts of government
policy that environmental aims have been sacrificed because of the fragility
of economic recovery - environment department officials say privately that
they regard the construction industry as out of bounds at present - the
inspectorate denies that it has come under such pressure.
Some of that suspicion may seem inevitable, given the history of mistrust
between the environmental movement and industry. But criticism of the
regulation and the inspectorate is justified, some economists say.
Mr Dieter Helm, director of Oxera, the forecasting group, says 'the
structure that we have now facilitates 'regulatory capture' (an
over-sympathetic attitude towards companies by their regulator) because the
inspectorate has so much discretion with applying the rules, and so much of
the judgment depends on examining individual sites'.
A second weakness, he argues, is that the rules are 'technology driven, and
not subjected to a proper scrutiny of costs'. In his view, the 'Bat' element
of the 'Batneec' rule has been applied more than the 'neec', which entails
more difficult analysis.
For example, he argues, under present rules, coal burning power stations are
urged to fit flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) to cut sulphur emissions, which
have been linked to acid rain. It is true that FGD is the best available
technique for power stations, he says, but if cost is taken into account, it
would be cheaper to build gas-fired stations.
Failure to consider costs thoroughly has been a flaw of much environmental
regulation, and industrialists and economists - and some 'green' campaigners
 -are agreed that closer attention is merited. That will not address,
however, the concern of environmentalists and other outside observers that
the regulator is too 'soft', if not 'captured' by industry.
Because of those concerns, Mr Slater is likely to find that he continues to
be the subject of suspicion and intense scrutiny by the environmental
movement. He will have a tough job as he continues to iron out the lumps in
Britain's well meaning but sometimes ill thought out pollution legislation.
As Mr Helm puts it, 'if you started from scratch, you wouldn't design
regulation like this'.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Environmental Management (2): Quick on the draw /
A look at directors and the law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX

<TEXT>
As they lie awake wondering if the recession has really ended, company
directors might add the threat of criminal prosecution to their catalogue of
woes.
Under environmental law, directors and managers can be personally liable for
their companies' pollution. In theory, criminal charges can be brought
against them and they can be sent to jail.
They might comfort themselves that only a handful of charges have been
pressed under these rules. But phalanxes of lawyers are on hand to warn them
that the government regulators are going to get tougher.
Once convinced that there is cause for concern, however, directors can take
a few simple steps to shield themselves from the risk.
Directors' liability for pollution is woven into much recent environmental
regulation. One of the main planks is Section 157 of the 1990 Environmental
Protection Act, which makes directors, managers and senior officers of the
company liable as well as the company itself for breaches of the Act, if the
pollution can be shown to have been caused by their 'neglect, consent or
connivance'.
The 1991 Water Resources Act carries a similar clause. Lawyers point out,
too, that liabilities are also tucked away in crannies of pollution
legislation dating back to the 1960s.
Despite these rules, government regulators - the pollution inspectorate
(HMIP), the National Rivers Authority and local waste regulatory authorities
 -have generally chosen to pursue companies, not individuals. The NRA
explains: 'It is fairly easy to establish that a company has done something
it shouldn't. It is much harder, particularly with a big company, for us to
pin down who was responsible'.
In one of the few exceptions, when the London Waste Regulatory Authority
this year prosecuted the incinerator company, Clinical Energy, the site
manager and managing director were also charged. They received conditional
discharges.
For these reasons, many directors may not have felt much personal risk under
environmental legislation. According to Ms Clare Deansley, of Gouldens, the
solicitors, the risk of prosecution is 'probably more in directors' minds
than a few years ago but still not as much as it should be - many have been
concentrating recently on saving their businesses from going bust'.
But lawyers are agreed that the threat is growing, and that directors are
beginning to take it more seriously. Ms Pamela Castle, head of the
environmental group at solicitors McKenna &amp; Co, says that one reason 'is the
large number of prosecutions under health and safety legislation, which
overlaps in many areas with environmental issues'.
She points out that health and safety regulators have declared their
intention to focus on directors' and managers' liabilities.
A rush of cases have drawn attention to directors' responsibilities - not
least the prosecutions which followed the 1987 capsizing of the Herald of
Free Enterprise ferry off Zeebrugge (the officers were prosecuted as well as
the ferry company, but the charges were dropped).
Ms Castle says: 'I have been asking myself why we are so active in advising
companies on this when the government for the moment has put the environment
on the back burner. What is driving our business is fear'.
In her view, directors' concern is one force prompting companies to improve
their environmental performance; the second main one is their bankers'
concern.
Lawyers also point out that environmental regulators may begin to adopt the
aggression of their health and safety counterparts. Ms Deansley believes
that 'in the not too distant future, one of the regulatory authorities will
decide to make an example of a director of a high profile company'.
The pollution regulators may be temporarily disrupted if the government's
proposed merger to create a new environment agency takes place.
However, environmental campaigners such as Friends of the Earth have argued
that the advantage of the proposed agency - a 'one-stop-shop' for pollution
control - is that it may be more vigorous and systematic in pursuing
offenders than the agencies can now be.
A further reason why directors should be concerned, lawyers argue, is that
the environmental pressure groups are developing a taste for bringing their
own prosecutions. They may begin to see the pursuit of company directors
through the courts as a powerful way of publicising their anti-pollution
campaigns.
Because directors have criminal liability under environmental legislation,
they cannot insure themselves against being found guilty, although - in
theory - they can insure against the legal fees of defending themselves. In
practice, however, they may find such insurance hard to obtain.
Rather than running these risks, lawyers say that directors should take
several straightforward steps.
The essential measure, they argue, is to make scrutiny of the company's
environmental standards a regular part of management. That means taking the
trouble to monitor emissions, finding out how well the company meets
existing environmental law, and becoming alert to possible changes in
legislation.
For a start, that kind of systematic monitoring helps reduce the risk of
illegal pollution, whether constant or accidental. The second advantage is
that it also helps directors demonstrate that they have not personally been
negligent if excess pollution does occur.
Company directors who find themselves besieged with consultants recommending
'environmental management systems' may feel sceptical of the benefits (in
some cases with good reason). But if they turn up their nose at the carrot,
they may not ignore the stick.
They have plenty of evidence that their personal liability under
environmental law is worth taking seriously.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (1): Life for the not so rich - The
long-awaited consultative council is an important step in developing a
method of tuning into public opinion. Meanwhile, the kingdom is trying to
come to terms with its budget deficit at a time of pressure on oil prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS

<TEXT>
Saudi Arabia was briefly a rich country. In one spectacular year - 1981 - it
earned more than Dollars 120bn from oil exports, ran a budget surplus of
about Dollars 35bn and enjoyed net foreign assets of close to Dollars 170bn.
Its per capita gross national product was Dollars 12,600, one of the world's
highest.
Today it is ranked by the World Bank as a middle-income country with a per
capita GNP of about Dollars 6,750, larger than Greece but less than half
that of Singapore. It has run a persistent budget deficit for the past
decade, which last year reached about 9 per cent of GDP, double that of the
US. Its current account deficit in 1992 was close to Dollars 20bn, about
half of its estimated oil earnings for the year.
Athough this trend has been clear for some time, the message seems to be
only slowly filtering through to the majority of Saudi Arabians and the
outside world. Individual Saudis may still rank among the world's richest;
however, the nation does not. Symbols of affluence abound, but the
government needs urgently to find new ways of raising revenue and cutting
expenditure. Saudi Arabia will remain an attractive market for foreign
companies, yet for some, especially defence contractors, disappointments are
likely to lie ahead.
These are issues which many other governments would happily address,
provided that they also had Saudi Arabia's proven capacity to continue
pumping oil at its current rate of 8m barrels a day for the next 100 years.
But that asset, unique in the world, also appears to be the biggest obstacle
delaying the Saudi ruling family and its government from confronting the
country's worsening financial problems.
President Saddam Hussein bears part of the blame. The Iraqi leader's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990 did not just threaten the survival of the House
of Saud, it also cost the country some Dollars 55bn-Dollars 60bn which would
have helped to cushion the effects of a temporary fall in the price of crude
oil. The jubilation which greeted the partial defeat of the Iraqi regime was
deemed by the Saudi government to be hardly the moment for publicising the
need for relative austerity, while the military establishment's demands for
more and better weaponry could not easily be ignored.
The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Fahd bin Abdulaziz, and his
ministers, appear still to be hoping that something will turn up - in
effect, the price of oil - to lessen the need for hard choices. Instead, oil
prices have this month hit a five-year low and the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries appears to be at a loss to explain or reverse the trend.
Saudi Arabia has already been forced to concede some market share, but gives
no indication that it is willing to drop its production below 8m. b/d.
Worse still, the spectre of Iraq resuming oil sales at some point in the
future - although it is unlikely to occur within the next 12 months - looms
heavily over the market, and with it the possibility that oil prices will be
driven substantially lower.
Much though Saudi Arabia would like to see the back of the Iraqi regime, the
survival of President Saddam Hussein and the maintenance of international
sanctions are greatly in the interest of the nation's exchequer and those of
its Opec partners. However, the Iraqi regime will eventually change and it
will resume oil exports with the vigour expected from a country which over
the past decade has suffered ever-worsening deprivation.
Even without Iraqi sales and assuming the absence of currently unforeseen
boosts to world demand for oil, Saudi revenues will do well to remain in the
Dollars 40bn-Dollars 45bn range for the next three to four years. They
could, of course, fall significantly below those levels.
Earlier this year a team from the International Monetary Fund concluded that
'the medium-term outlook is for growing budgetary and external current
account deficits because current expenditure growth, even if modest, is not
expected to be matched by an increase in oil receipts. Such developments
would be unsustainable and could cause damage to the economy.' In IMF
language, that is a serious health warning.
However, judged by the standards of most of the industrialised world, the
Saudi patient should not be in need of much preparation before facing up to
what is scarcely major surgery. Saudi Arabia has in the past three decades
undergone an extraordinary revolution without showing any serious signs of
social upheaval or widespread political dissent. The strength of family and
tribal ties, and external disciplines of religion, have allowed Saudis to
cope with a fundamental physical transformation of their country, the
distorting effects of sudden wealth, wars on its borders, a huge influx of
expatriates, the temporary presence of foreign armies, intense international
scrutiny and no little envy. The nation has survived remarkably intact.
But, clearly, the government believes that its generous subsidies and
virtually tax-free environment has also played a key part in assuring social
cohesion. Officials told the IMF team a few months ago that 'political and
social considerations precluded a reduction in subsidies or an increase in
fees and charges'. While that is only partly correct, because a start has
already been made to reduce the hugely wasteful subsidies on excessive wheat
production, plenty of economists in the kingdom are ready with lists of
relatively painless revenue raising measures.
There would also be no lack of advice available if the government decided
that it had to make a more serious effort to reduce its planned expenditure.
This could range from rationalising recurrent government spending, a review
or delay in some the Dollars 30bn of new defence contracts entered into
since the end of the Gulf war, and a fresh look at the huge list of planned
and actual infrastructure projects estimated to cost further tens of
billions of dollars.
The effort will also have to be sustained over a period of years. Even
without the current fall in the price of oil, the demographic pressures
building within the kingdom are intensifying the demand for budget
allocations. Official figures, greeted with a degree of public scepticism,
suggest that the population of the kingdom is now close to 17m, including
12.3m Saudis. Latest estimates indicate that the Saudi population is growing
by at least 3.5 per cent a year, and it could be higher. The effect is
already being seen in the demand for increased health care, education, water
supply, power generation and housing.
It is possible that many of these issues could be handed to the
newly-created Majlis al-Shura, a milestone structure in Saudi Arabia's
largely featureless political landscape. The 60-member majlis, or
consultative council, has been chosen by King Fahd to advise him and the
council of ministers on issues referred to it. No-one is required to act on
any of the council's recommendations, but it would seem a pointless exercise
by the king to have spent so much time on personnel selection only to ignore
the deliberations of his chosen men. It might also seem sound royal politics
to create an additional layer of quasi-government, albeit consultative,
which could be subsequently blamed for suggesting measures which aroused
popular opposition.
To the surprise of many foreign diplomats in Riyadh, the consultative
council was weighted heavily in favour of professional men, more than half
of whom have higher degrees from western universities, with only modest
representation from the more traditional, conservative stratas of Saudi
society. All are, however, characterised by what one member described as
'our deep commitment to king and country'.
The enthusiasm with which they are approaching their responsibilities
suggests at least a novel opportunity for debate, and an acceptance by the
royal family that governing an increasingly complex and much less affluent
nation requires more involvement of the public. But from the outside, it
still appears to be a very modest adjustment to what is already a
fundamentally changed economic environment.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Environmental Management (1): Eyes open wider to
the green scene - Running a business with an eye to its impact on the
environment may not improve profits - but there are other motives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The high tide of popular green enthusiasm has partly ebbed away, but its
legacy across Europe and North America is layers of environmental regulation
directed at industry and commerce. It has left, too, cohorts of consultants
urging companies to improve their environmental management.
That exhortation covers a wide range of issues. Broadly, environmental
management means managing a business with an eye to its impact on the
environment and to environmental regulation. Surveys have shown that
companies are increasingly paying attention to these issues.
Last month's study of more than 200 environmental managers by Environmental
Data Services, the well-respected journal, found that two thirds had been
appointed in the last three years, and one third in the last year. KPMG Peat
Marwick, the consultants, found that more than 40 per cent of 700 companies
it questioned recently in industrialised countries published statements of
environmental policy.
The question of how management should take account of environmental concerns
also contains a trickier conundrum: whether cleaning up the environment can
be commercially worthwhile. There is fierce debate between those who see the
environment and the new regulation as an extra layer of cost on business,
and those who argue that 'greener' can mean richer.
The costs of cleaning up, certainly, have become increasingly clear. As
governments have enforced the new rules, some industrial and commercial
costs have risen - in many cases passed on to the consumer. That recognition
is behind the UK government's decision to tangle with Brussels over the
question of whether some water quality standards are unnecessarily high. The
message behind the higher fuel and road taxes in the UK's Budget last month
 -measures presented as 'green' - was also that a clean environment costs
money.
But at the same time ministers and many consultants argue that the
environment and the new regulation offer businesses new opportunities which
only the most stubborn would ignore. The traditional confrontation between
industry and environmentalists is giving way to co-operation.
There is no simple adjudication of that debate. Few figures are available to
show how much environmental protection is costing industry. Nor are there
many answers that apply beyond specific, local cases.
Of the reasons commonly given why it is worthwhile for businesses to improve
environmental management, a few are plausible; many are unconvincing.
Reducing the risk of prosecution under environmental regulations is one of
the best reasons for improving environmental management. Environmental
lawyers believe that companies' fear about potential liabilities is the
reason why they are so busy. Under the 1990 Environmental Protection Act,
directors and managers can also be held personally liable for the company's
pollution and can be subject to criminal prosecution.
Increasingly, bankers and insurers survey their exposure to customers'
environmental obligations, and want customers to demonstrate that adequate
controls are in place.
Improving public image is a powerful motive, although the benefits are hard
to quantify. Mr John Cox, director of the Chemical Industries Association,
which represents some 250 UK companies, says: 'The fall in the chemical
industry's reputation coincides with growing public concern about pollution.
It creates a political climate where legislators feel more bound to
legislate, and it certainly can affect planning permission'.
For example, he argues, industry needs a nationwide network of incinerators,
but because of public opposition to incinerators, it is difficult for waste
companies to get permission even to expand existing plants. 'We have never
been able to quantify what the poor image is costing us but we do say it is
a real cost to the bottom line and represents a threat to our freedom to
invest as we require'.
Minimising waste and saving resources, a favourite mantra of consultants,
raises the question of why businesses were not making the savings already.
The answer is that they should have been doing so, but the extra discipline
of regularly looking at their impact on the environment helps companies
locate new savings, according to Mr Martin Houldin, head of the environment
unit at KPMG Peat Marwick. 'In recession there is a drive to get costs down,
but they then creep up again as management priorities change'.
He argues that tightening regulation on waste disposal means that the
factory is 'no longer seen as a black box from which waste just comes out -
managers are looking more at the internal use of resources'. For example, as
regulators and water companies have increased the cost of drawing water and
discharging effluent to rivers, even small companies are finding it
worthwhile to recover, treat and re-use water themselves.
Finding new markets. Environment ministers are fond of arguing that sales of
environmental technology provide a new business opportunity. The success of
UK water companies, notably North West Water, in winning overseas contacts
for improving water quality, is a case in point. But these opportunities are
accessible only to a small pool of companies compared to the number affected
by tightening environmental regulation.
Improving competitive advantage. One of the most difficult claims to assess
is whether alertness to environmental issues gives companies an advantage in
selling their products. In some, the answer is yes: for example, motor
manufacturers expecting fuel prices or taxes to rise will find it worthwhile
to develop more fuel-efficient cars.
Companies which accurately anticipate these trends may then find they can
secure a competitive advantage within the arena where the taxes or rules
apply. It is also in their interest for the rules to be vigorously enforced.
However they could find themselves handicapped by a higher cost structure
compared to countries with looser environmental regulation - a concern which
the European chemical industry has voiced strongly.
It is also difficult to judge whether consumers prefer 'green' products and
will pay more for them. Claims that consumers would tolerate a 'green
premium' have been called into question by recession - price has become a
greater determinant of preferences, some surveys report.
Consultants acknowledge the difficulties of estimating the benefits of
environmental management. Mr Houldin says: 'There are very few companies who
will say that there is already a net financial benefit in what they have
done. But they would not be taking these steps if they did not believe there
would be a benefit.'
Complex environmental regulation means there is a need for companies to keep
abreast of environmental regulation and changes in customers' tastes. But
governments are worried about the costs of cleaning up the environment,
concerned that these costs should be compared with the environmental
benefits before regulation is passed.
The fashionable claim that environmental management is a wand to transform
the expensive process of complying with regulation environment into a
business opportunity has not been proven, and it ignores the unavoidable
costs of making the environment cleaner.

FT  22 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Caution on plan for Gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market registered its displeasure over the government's moves to remove
British Gas's monopoly in the domestic gas market and to impose a split of
the company's trading and transportation divisions.
British Gas shares, which reached an all-time high of 360p only last week,
came under increasingly intense pressure yesterday, sliding to a day's low
of 346p before stabilising and closing a net 10 off at 347p. Turnover of 10m
shares was well above the stock's usual levels of activity.
Energy specialists said the real disappointment for the market came with
news that competition in the domestic gas market will hit British Gas much
sooner than the industry and the City had expected. 'Competition is coming
early; British Gas now faces a progressive attack on the most profitable
segments of its business; the shares remain a sell,' said the oil and gas
team at Nomura.
The curtain came down on the interim results season from the utilities
sectors with a top of the range interim payment from Wessex Water. But not
even a 9.6 per cent increase in the dividend could prevent Wessex shares
mirroring a broad retreat by the utilities following publication of the
government's proposals for British Gas.
Wessex shares opened higher at 722p, buoyed by the dividend news, but
quickly fell away to end the session a net 3 down at 714p. Increases in
dividends announced by the water companies in recent weeks have averaged
around 8 per cent.
Market worries about increased regulatory vigilance now focus on the water
regulator's periodic review time-table, which next summer will see Ofwat
announce the companies' individual 'K factors', their regulatory pricing
formulae.
The FT-SE 100 constituents showed falls of 14 common to Anglian Water, 592p,
and Severn Trent, 604p, while Thames dropped 16 to 580p and North West 11 to
581p.
The power generators, however, held up well as the market continued to adopt
the view that a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is still
avoidable if PowerGen and National Power can reach agreement on prices and
power station sales to help increase competition.
National Power settled a shade higher at 475p and PowerGen eased 4 to 535p.
The regional electricity companies performed badly, similarly affected by
fears that Offer, the electricity regulator, will harden its attitude on K
factors. Southern, the only rec in the FT-SE 100, lost 7 at 700p.
A negative note from NatWest Securities triggered renewed weakness in
Enterprise Oil, which retreated 12 to 454p. NatWest cast doubts on the
security of Enterprise's dividend 'if oil prices stabilise below Dollars 16
a barrel', and said Enterprise is currently trading at 'a huge 52 per cent
premium to our asset value of 305p based on Dollars 16 real oil prices; and
even at a 19 per cent premium to our Dollars 18 asset value of 391p'.
Conglomerate Hanson eased 3 to 273 1/2 p after reports that it was
considering a possible bid of up to Dollars 3bn for all, or part of, Borden,
the US food and chemicals group.
Internationally traded pharmaceutical issues were weak again in response to
a lacklustre New York market. Glaxo slipped 4 to 703p and Zeneca 6 to 795p.
The bid talk that had previously given some relief to troubled Fisons was
not in evidence and the shares receded 3 to 112p.
The first of what is expected to be a rush of property groups seeking market
listings was provided by Chelsfield. The shares made their debut at 155p and
finished at 180p.
Several other private companies are in the process of preparing for
flotation, taking advantage of investor appetite for the sector and raising
valuable investment funds in the process. The potential market value of the
companies is in excess of Pounds 1bn.
A tumble by the Hong Kong market, plus news that an inquiry into the Bombay
stock market scandal had called for severe punishments to be imposed on the
four international banks involved, put Standard Chartered shares under
pressure. They dropped to 1062p early in the session, before rallying to end
15 off at 1179p. Turnover reached an above average 1.5m shares.
Bank of Scotland was active and lost 6 at 225p, with James Capel thought to
have adopted a more cautious stance on the stock.
Profit-taking lowered TSB 4 to 253p, with turnover expanding to 3.2m shares.
However, there was always good underlying support for the shares, according
to dealers, with persistent bid stories underscored by expectations of a
good set of preliminary figures when the bank reports in mid-January.
A Kleinwort Benson buy recommendation was responsible for driving
housebuilder Wilson Connolly 14 ahead to a year's best of 213p - within 10
of the stock's all-time high reached in July 1987.
The beleaguered food retail sector's recent good run came to an end on
rumours that a renewed price initiative was being kept under wraps for the
new year by one of the leading supermarket groups.
Tesco was the worst hit, retreating 9 to 211p. J. Sainsbury slid 13 1/2 to
435p, while Argyll Group fell 8 to 280p.
Among food manufacturers, an upbeat trading message by the chairman of
Berisford International helped the shares climb 5 to 111p. Elsewhere, the
sector steadied in the face of a weak market. Both Unilever and United
Biscuits trod water, while Northern Foods was squeezed up 6 to 217p and
Cadbury-Schweppes added 7 at 513p. NatWest Securities was said to be
pointing out the merits of Hillsdown Holdings, ahead 3 at 160p.
Profit-takers were out in force in the drinks sector. Grand Metropolitan was
one of the few to escape, the shares catching up from their recent subdued
run and rallying 6 1/2 to 466p. Greenalls' good form continued, adding 5 at
455p.
British Aerospace gained 5 at 406p, with dealers citing the recent
recommendation from SG Warburg. Rolls-Royce shed 3 1/2 to 163p as one
broker, believed to be NatWest Securities, was telling clients to sell the
stock down to 155p.
Powerscreen International, which recently rebuffed allegations of a tax
probe that had undermined the shares, continued its recovery, putting on 5
at 308p. Simon Engineering rose 5 to 121p following comment on the recent
sale of TR Oil Services. Weir Group firmed 8 to 291p, with Credit Lyonnais
Laing said to be recommending the stock.

FT  22 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A hefty premium in the new Footsie futures contract was cut back
significantly yesterday after a large deal went through the market shortly
after the start of official trading, writes Peter John.
Dealers said that some Pounds 230m was shifted from gilts into equities via
the futures market towards the close of trading late on Monday. The trade
was attributed to either SG Warburg or Goldman Sachs. It was partly
responsible for topping up the futures contract for March expiry and keeping
it strong in after-hours' dealing.
Yesterday morning, the 'i's and 't's of the deal were still being dotted and
crossed, and finalisation was responsible for lifting the underlying market
initially.
However, the successful shift of cash coincided with some disappointing
trade statistics which provided an opportunity for investors to take profits
after the second 300-point rally within six months. The first rally was
followed by a 100-point fall and chart analysts obsessed with the idea that
history always repeats itself are looking for a similar consolidation.
March opened at 3,400 and hit a high of 3,408 before beginning to drift back
to 3,367 by the official close. The premium above the cash market narrowed
from around 30 points to 22 by the close, not far off its fair value
premium, which is calculated at about 18.
Footsie options saw buying of the March series, which pushed implied
volatility to around 13.5 per cent, compared with 12.5 per cent in the
January's. Total turnover of 37,336 lots was up from Monday's 31,594. Hanson
was the most heavily traded stock option with 1,827 lots dealt.

FT  22 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-taking reverses early advance
in shares - Market Report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The widely predicted downward correction in UK equities started yesterday,
triggered by a sharp fall in British government bonds and bond futures. The
downturn in the second half of the equity session, which left the FT-SE 100
Index finally 22.5 off at 3,342.4, contrasted with a burst of strength at
the market opening when the overnight ticker disclosed the traces of the
substantial cash move into shares signalled in the equity futures markets on
Monday.
Equity traders, seeking out the identity of the overnight dealer, focused at
first on reports that a large US investment bank had been involved. But it
was later suggested that a London merchant banking and investment house
might have been acting for a client in switching around Pounds 230m from UK
gilts into equities. The aftermath of the trade continued to roll through
the stock market yesterday afternoon.
The Footsie jumped 13.7 to above 3,378 in early trading, but soon lost
impetus as the market absorbed the big overnight trade. The announcement of
a Pounds 767m deficit on Britain's non-EU trade in November had little
impact at first, but weakness in equities increased as the gilt-edged market
gave ground. Losses in gilts and, more significantly, in bond futures, began
to cancel out early firmness in the March futures contract on the Footsie.
A cooler trend in other European bourses, topped by a fall of 10 Dow points
early in the new session on Wall Street, left London to move slowly towards
the close of business. The final reading on the Footsie was just above the
day's low, however, and traders saw yesterday's fall as little more than a
very modest technical reaction after a successful market run.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index slipped a mere 3.5 to 3,706.9, indicating that there
had been little selling across the broader range of equities. Non-Footsie
business made up around 64 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 756.1m
shares. On Monday, Seaq volume of 748.9m shares returned Pounds 1.53bn in
retail, or customer, business worth.
The utilities sectors, which have been strong market leaders this month in
response to higher dividend payments, fell back as the UK government spelled
out its intentions to end the domestic monopoly for British Gas.
Attention continued to focus on the consumer sectors, where investors hope
to see evidence of a strengthening economy in the shape of higher Christmas
spending in the shops. There was some support for the main line store
groups, which have been lagging behind the market. Food retailers, however,
suffered renewed fears that a price war could recommence.
Profit-takers appeared among the banking and insurance stocks, although
merchant banks, which are benefiting from booming securities markets,
continued to attract buyers.
Market analysts remained bullish for UK equities over the near and medium
terms, with forecasts gathering towards the Footsie 3,600 area sometime in
1994; Strauss Turnbull yesterday set its mid-year target at 3,450 to 3,600.
Confidence is based on expectations that base rates will be reduced again in
the new year, although some analysts have begun to warn that rates could
start rising again towards the end of the year - Strauss believes rates
could return to 5 1/2 per cent at the end of 1994, after falling to 5 per
cent earlier in the year.

FT  22 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Interest rate worries help to
depress Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US stocks retreated yesterday amid anxieties over interest rates and the
Christmas retailing season, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 10.06 lower at 3,745.15, while the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 eased 0.55 to 465.30. In the secondary markets, the
American SE composite was off 3.31 at 460.77 and the Nasdaq composite shed
4.52 to 755.63. New York SE volume was 273m shares and declining issues
outpaced advances by 1,202 to 889.
After the previous session failed to build substantially on last week's late
rally, equities opened on a shaky footing with investors preoccupied with
the events in the US Treasury market. In late trading the bellwether 30-year
government bond was down just  1/16 at 99 7/32 , recovering from the
session's low after the monthly auction of two-year notes generated greater
demand than had been expected.
However, traders remained anxious about the outcome of a Federal Reserve
policy-making session being held in Washington. Although minutes of the
meeting would not be forthcoming for weeks, any hint that the Fed was
shifting its stance towards tighter money could send a shiver through the
bond market and in turn rattle stocks in the run-up to Christmas.
Against this backdrop, several blue chip issues moved lower. 3M was down
Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 119 7/8 , Alcoa Dollars 1 1/4 off at Dollars 68 3/8
and Cummins Engine Dollars 1 1/4 cheaper at Dollars 50 1/2 .
Equity investors drew mixed signals from the weekly Johnson Redbook Service
report, which showed retail sales in the third week of December, on a
seasonally adjusted basis, down 1.7 per cent from November, but up 7.1 per
cent from the year-ago level.
Many of the big store groups finished in the loss column. Sears Roebuck
slipped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 53 5/8 , JC Penney Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars
51 1/2 and May Department Stores Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 38 7/8 , but
Carter Hawley Hale picked up Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 9 3/8 .
Ford outperformed the market, advancing Dollars 2 to Dollars 64 3/4 after
Merrill Lynch raised its earnings estimate. General Motors appreciated
Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 54 7/8 .
Shares in the two companies vying for Paramount Communications were active
after QVC said its revised Dollars 10.5bn offer was greater than Viacom's
new bid. QVC was Dollars 1 1/2 lower at Dollars 42 amid concern over the
deal's impact on existing shareholders. Viacom 'B' shares eased Dollars  1/8
to Dollars 45 1/8. The target company's stock shed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars
80 1/4.
On the Amex, Greyhound Lines dropped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 11 1/2 after
the bus company said its earnings would fall short of 1992 levels because of
fare discounting.
On the Nasdaq, Banyan Systems plunged Dollars 11 1/8 to Dollars 14 1/2
following a profits warning by the software concern.
Canada
Toronto closed lower after relatively moderate trading. The TSE 300 index
declined 8.9 to 4,214.7 and falls outnumbered rises by 460 to 383. Volume
amounted to 67.3m shares valued at CDollars 730.9m.
Eight of the 14 sub-indices lost ground, led by the golds sector, off 1.6
per cent as the bullion price in New York shed USDollars 1.50 to USDollars
387.75 an ounce.

FT  22 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Poland outstrips emerging markets -
Companies are about to capitalise on Warsaw's boom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While emerging market strategists debate the appeal of Asia, or Latin
America, Polish equities have left more conventional choices far behind this
year.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has seen an almost uninterrupted boom since last
Easter, taking the WIG index up from 1,040.7 at the end of last year to
11,354.6 yesterday, up 433.6 or 4 per cent on the day, and indicating gains
of 991 and 718 per cent in local currency, and dollar terms respectively.
The process has taken the recent return to government of former communists
and their allies in its stride and share prices are expected to continue on
the upgrade, at least for the early months of 1994.
Mr Marek Borowski, Poland's finance minister and deputy premier responsible
for the economy, has told investors that the government intends to give a
top priority to privatisation through public share issues.
In another confidence bolstering move the prime minister, Mr Waldemar
Pawlak, has reaffirmed the promise that capital gains would remain untaxed,
as planned by his predecessors, until the end of 1995.
With continuing strong demand from domestic investors, Warsaw is still
capable of weekly gains of 10 per cent on some shares, in spite of a
slowdown last month. Now quoting 22 stocks, its ability to soak up new
offerings was demonstrated by a recent public offer of 30.1 per cent of the
equity in Bank Slaski.
The bank, one of the nine state owned banks being sold off under the
government's bank privatisation programme, saw a massive oversubscription
with over 800,000 applicants offering 7,993.2bn zlotys (Dollars 372m) for
1,226.5bn zlotys worth of shares. The 500,000 zloty offer price should more
than treble when the bank is first quoted on the WSE in the new year.
There were many, effectively multiple applications. Nevertheless the Bank
Slaski offer should lead to a major increase in the 200,000 or so investors
who already have accounts with the country's 36 stockbrokers.
In fact, the increased volume of business engendered by the offer threatens
to swamp the brokers and means that the WSE has been forced to postpone the
introduction of additional sessions until the second quarter of 1994.
However, the numbers mean that the exchange, which reopened after a break of
52 years in April 1991, is firmly entrenched. 'Its development cannot be
reversed' says Mr Wieslaw Rozlucki, the WSE chairman, commenting on the
implications of the new centre left government.
Small investors have rushed to buy shares this year and the underlying
stocks, on an average p/e ratio of 36, are 20 to 30 per cent overvalued
according to one foreign analyst.
However, the market is becoming increasingly sophisticated. Financial
reporting is developing in newpapers and newletters, and information on
Polish stocks is being put out by foreign brokers like Smith New Court and
the Italian-owned IMI Securities. Creditanstalt, the Austrian bank, which
has just opened the first foreign-owned broking house in Warsaw, is also
producing copious reports.
Foreign investors, expected to bring a measure of stability to the exchange
and accounting for 25 per cent of the stock ownership and 10 per cent of
daily trading according to Mr Rozlucki, have drawn back a little as they
wait for the bubble to burst.
But there is also the prospect of more foreign input. The Pioneer First
Polish Trust Fund, owned by the Boston-based Pioneer Group, has net current
assets worth Dollars 350m of which one-third has been invested on the WSE.
Turnover slowed in November as investors accumulated funds for the Bank
Slaski offer. That channelled funds into the treasury, but now the exchange
faces its first test as a provider of capital to the corporate sector as
companies already quoted plan rights issues and private companies consider
going public.
This month sees a 500m zlotys rights issue from the Export Development Bank
while Exbud, a construction company, and Swarzedz, a furniture producer,
have already announced new share issues. The privately owned Kredyt Bank is
planning to float its equity in the middle of next year, and become the
fifth bank to be quoted on the WSE.

FT  22 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong falls 2.7 per
cent as profits are taken

<TEXT>
Share prices lost further ground on selling by arbitrageurs and dealers, and
the Nikkei average closed moderately lower in spite of buying by investment
trust funds, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue index shed 88.81 to 17,315.43 after moving between 17,158.32
and 17,484.35. The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 1.52 to
1,445.73, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 3.34 at 1,195.57.
Selling was done in small lots, due to speculation that the government will
announce an emergency stimulus package this week. However, political
uncertainty was heightened by reports that a group of lawyers was accusing
Mr Ichiro Ozawa, leader of the Japan Renewal Party, of accepting illegal
donations from a construction company.
Volume came to 221m shares, against 235m. Trading grew thinner during the
afternoon session as investors retreated to the sidelines. Declines led
advances by 676 to 326, with 163 issues unchanged.
Institutional investors were seen realising gains on their holdings ahead of
the year-end book closing. Dealers who had failed to sell on Monday were
also seen making small-lot sales.
Hanwa, the steel trader known for the extensive financial investments that
it made during the 1980s, dropped Y82 to Y650. The issue declined in spite
of the company's denials of rumours that banks had stopped financial aid.
Nippon Steel, the most active stock of the day, softened Y1 to Y296 amid
selling by foreign investors. Nittoc Construction, which is alleged to have
given Mr Ozawa financial contributions, retreated Y20 to Y1,080.
Retailers were lower on deepening fears of the spread of discounting.
Ito-Yokado receded Y50 to Y5,410, FamilyMart lost Y130 to Y6,720 and
Chujitsuya declined Y80 to Y1,660.
Bank shares, which had plunged during Monday on index-linked selling,
recovered some ground. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y10 to Y2,860 and Fuji
Bank gained Y10 to Y1,900. Nomura Securities also rose Y20 to Y1,840.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone shed Y3,000 to Y748,000 on profit-taking, but
East Japan Railway put on Y8,000 at Y429,000 thanks to the government's
announcement that it would list only one of the remaining six regional
railway companies next year.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 136.12 to 19,212.92 in volume of 104m shares.
Turnover surged on trading by investors who sold shares to realise profits
and bought the stocks immediately afterwards to maintain their portfolios.
Roundup
Sharply divergent performances were seen in Pacific Rim markets. Bombay was
closed for the sixth straight day amid signs that the brokers' strike could
continue until the new year.
HONG KONG fell 2.7 per cent on a wave of profit-taking after recent rises.
The Hang Seng index lost 290.50 to 10,524.28 as US institutions joined in
the selling during the afternoon. Turnover was down slightly to HKDollars
8.84bn from Monday's HKDollars 8.89bn.
Utilities were among the biggest losers, with China Light slipping HKDollars
3 to HKDollars 51 and HK Electric relinquishing HKDollars 1.10 to HKDollars
25.80.
AUSTRALIA was dragged down by a fall in News Corp and an absence of offshore
interest. The All Ordinaries index closed 9.1 off at 2,067.0. A 33-cent, or
3.3 per cent, fall to ADollars 9.67 in News Corp was attributed to worries
about a deal that will see a US subsidiary pay around Dollars 1.1bn for the
broadcasting rights to four seasons of National Conference Football games.
NEW ZEALAND was marked 1.3 per cent lower as buyers deserted before the
Christmas holidays and the market continued to feel the weight of recent new
issues and placements. The NZSE-40 Capital index shed 26.27 to 2,046.97.
MANILA rose by more than 100 points for the second straight day before
profit-taking clipped the rise, but the market still closed at a record
high, bolstered by PLDT.
The Manila composite index finished 27.48 ahead at 2,836.28 after an
intraday peak of 2,927.98.
SEOUL climbed 2.0 per cent after news that the market stabilisation fund
would delay the liquidation of its stock portfolio. The composite index
added 17.16 to 865.79 in volume of 38.14m shares.
KARACHI posted another record high close amid active year end trading by
foreign funds and local institutions.
The KSE 100-index ended 18.49 higher at 2,062.39.
KUALA LUMPUR saw some bargain hunting and renewed speculative buying with
gains led by tin and plantation stocks. However, falls in some index-linked
stocks dragged the composite index down 1.47 to 1,096.61. Telekom fell 30
cents to MDollars 19.40.
TAIWAN closed higher on late foreign buying of industrial blue chips with
low price-earnings ratios. The weighted index rose 41.85 to 5,245.87 in
active turnover of TDollars 55.24bn.
SINGAPORE eased as retail investors continued to stay sidelined following
tighter trading conditions imposed by several broking houses.
The Straits Times Industrials index edged 0.59 lower to 2,276.89 after
trading to an intra-day high of 2,290.83.

FT  22 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses stretch rally to
further 1993 highs
</HEADLINE>

   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another Eurotrack 100 high, and domestic peaks in Frankfurt, Zurich and
Madrid testified to the durability of the 1993 European rally, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT's DAX index closed 4.77 higher at a new 1993 peak of 2,182.93.
Turnover rose from DM10bn to DM10.2bn.
Lufthansa fell DM5 to DM169.50 following newspaper reports that its
code-sharing agreement with United Airlines may be blocked by the US
government and recovered DM2 to close at DM171.50.
Metallgesellschaft fell another DM31.20, or 10.9 per cent to DM255; it said
after hours that its new management, headed by Mr Kajo Neukirchen, would
concentrate on core activities. Meanwhile, Mr Neukirchen's previous company,
Kugelfischer, rose another DM8.50 to DM188 on a broker's recommendation.
ZURICH continued its record breaking run, the SMI index adding 9.0 to
2,918.0.
In chemicals, Ciba-Geigy bearers rose SFr20 to SFr878 and Roche certificates
added SFr5 to SFr6,310, after a day's high of SFr6,350.
Nestle, firm in active trade for much of the day, dipped SFr13 to SFr1,247
towards the close on market rumours that it was considering buying a Swedish
food company.
MILAN rose as fresh indications of falling inflation added to hopes of lower
interest rates. The Comit index added 4.42 to 610.43.
Montedison eased L9.40 to L870.60, trading ex-rights while its parent,
Ferruzzi, added L314 or 17.9 per cent to L2,064, also ex-rights. Both
launched capital increases as part of the broad restructuring drawn up by
creditor banks to cope with the group's debts.
Among blue chips finding renewed foreign demand, Sip rose L93 to L3,535
while Stet was up L84 to L4,220. Fiat added L77 to L4,368 and Olivetti
gained L38 to L2,120.
Benetton, the clothing manufacturer, advanced L265 to L25,281 in response to
its planned rights issue on foreign markets which should bring in at least
L150bn.
PARIS saw profit-taking, the CAC-40 index closing 7.61 lower at 2,215.86 in
brisk turnover of FFr4.47bn.
In oils, Elf Aquitaine dropped FFr8.10 to FFr412.90 and Total by FFr3.80 to
FFr313. Total said on Monday that lower oil prices would show up as a
special inventory write down against profits this year but Mr Jeremy Hudson
of Lehman Brothers said that this was expected, and that the sector was
probably reacting more to the feeling that a rise in oil prices was less
than imminent.
Club Med dropped FFr12.90 to FFr335 ahead of a press conference late today.
AMSTERDAM shrugged off an unexpected interest rate cut to close slightly
lower on profit-taking. The CBS Tendency index eased 0.3 to 145.8.
Elsevier added Fl 1.70 to Fl 173.50 on strong foreign demand on the view
that the publisher had underperforming its sector. Fokker, the aerospace
group, closed unchanged at Fl 21.70 as the market reassessed talks with SAS
over possible new aircraft orders.
MADRID was led higher by late institutional buying, the general index
reaching a new 1993 high of 316.58, up 2.36.
Utilities saw profit taking and Sevillana, having made a miniscule cut in
dividend in line with official calls for moderation, dropped Pta7 to Pta693.
Repsol, on an 11 per cent dividend rise, rose Pta60 to Pta4,380.
BRUSSELS saw the Bel-20 index add 10.04 to 1,433.58 on the first day of the
new forward market account although some late profit-taking pushed shares
off their morning highs.
Cockerill was heavily traded after Monday's warrants expiry, rising BFr7 or
4.9 per cent to BFr149 after touching BFr155 during the morning.
COPENHAGEN turned higher after its recent declines, and the market is
expected to add to the advance today; the central bank announced a 0.25
point cut in the discount rate after the market closed. The KFX index added
0.95 to 101.11.
ATHENS saw profit-taking, and lost 1.55 per cent in heavy trading, the
general index closing 14.11 lower at 896.83 in turnover estimated at
Dr4.7bn. The index has lost about 5 per cent since December 15, when
profit-taking began.
ISTANBUL hit a third straight high, ending a provisional 193.2, or 1 per
cent higher at 19,410.9.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Danes, Dutch cut rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Interest rate cuts in Denmark and the Netherlands injected some life into
sluggish pre-Christmas dealings and spurred speculation of further European
easing before the end of the year, writes Conner Middelmann.
The Danish central bank reduced its discount and deposit rates by 25 basis
points to 6.25 per cent. The move did not come as a major surprise given the
Danish krone's recent strength against the D-Mark and following statements
from Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the central bank governor, that the bank intended to
test the market with small interest rate cuts.
The krone strengthened further after the move, closing at DKr3.910 to the
D-Mark, after DKr3.916 on Monday.
The Dutch central bank cut its special advances rate by 10 basis points to
5.80 per cent. The move was seen to have been prompted by the Dutch
guilder's persistent strength against the D-Mark.
The guilder is pegged to the German currency at a central parity of Fl
1.1267 per D-Mark, and for the last two weeks has traded below Fl 1.12. It
finished at Fl 1.120, up from Fl 1.121 on Monday. However, it ceded its top
ranking in the European Monetary System's exchange rate grid to the Irish
punt, moving into second place.
The northern European rate cuts fuelled talk that France and Italy would
follow suit, boosting their currencies against the D-Mark.
The Italian lira rose to a high of L975.25 per D-Mark and ended at L976.0,
compared with L980.0 at Monday's close.
'There is a good chance that the Italian authorities will cut rates again
before the end of the year - if nothing else as a reward for the passage of
the (1994) budget,' said Mr Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase
Manhattan Bank in London. The market has priced in a  1/2 percentage point
cut in the 8 per cent discount rate.
Italian rate cut hopes were intensified by preliminary data from eight major
cities compiled by the University of Bologna, indicating that the December
CPI rose 0.1 per cent on the month and was unchanged at 4.2 per cent
year-on-year, below market expectations for a 4.3 per cent yearly average.
Hopes for imminent easing also buoyed the French franc, which climbed as
high as FFr3.4025 to the D-Mark before closing at FFr3.403, up from Monday's
FFr3.409.
According to Mr Julian Callow, European economist with Kleinwort Benson,
'there is room now for the French authorities to cut interest rates'.
Belgium is also tipped to lower interest rates before the year-end, and
disappointment that the Belgian central bank left rates unchanged yesterday
caused the franc to slip slightly to BFr20.76 per D-Mark, from BFr20.75 on
Monday.
In Germany, the first regional December inflation numbers had little impact,
although the month-on-month rise was slightly higher than expected. Bavaria
reported a 0.2 per cent increase in the month to mid-December - slightly
above expectations for a 0.1 per cent rise - and a year-on-year rate of 3.4
per cent.
The three-month Euromark futures contract edged up 0.01 point to 94.47.
The dollar continued its steady ascent against the Japanese yen, which
remains dogged by worries over Japan's weak economy and political
uncertainty. The US currency ended at Y111.05, up from Monday's Y110.55. In
New York it finished at Y111.12.
'The US authorities appear to be shifting their position on the dollar/yen
rate,' said Mr Gunner at Chase Manhattan. After lobbying for a strong yen in
a bid to boost US exports to Japan, the US now appears to have tempered its
stance on the growing recognition that a strong yen would impede Japan's
recovery by dampening its exports, analysts said.
Mr Stephen Hannah, chief economist at IBJ International, said: 'Talking up
the yen is not in the US's long term interest; a strong Japan will be more
likely to import US goods eventually.'
Indicating that the US is comfortable with the current exchange rate trend,
US Treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen said in a television interview that US
currency intervention in regard to dollar/yen would not be necessary.
The dollar was mildly weaker against the D-Mark, closing at DM1.7080, down
from DM1.7135 on Monday. It ended trading in New York at DM1.7070. According
to Kleinwort's Mr Callow, that is partly a year-end effect. 'Because of the
US's position as a net debtor, a lot of money flows out of the US for
interest payments around this time and that tends to weaken the dollar,' he
explained.
In the UK money market, the March short sterling contract dropped by 0.08
point to 94.73. Traders said this had little to do with a shift in the
market's interest rate outlook, but rather was due to profit-taking in a
thin market. However, one senior trader commented: 'At this level, the
contract has pink ribbons on it saying: buy me]'
The Bank of England's initial forecast of a Pounds 1bn shortage was revised
slightly to Pounds 1.05bn. In early operations the Bank purchased Pounds 81m
of bills for resale to the market on January 10 at 5 13/32 per cent. It
later bought a further Pounds 168m, of which Pounds 40m worth was outright
and the rest for resale to the market on January 10. In the afternoon it
purchased Pounds 147m of bills and provided late assistance of around Pounds
675m.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cheap power deal clears way for
NZ aluminium expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL

   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Comalco and Sumitomo, owners of the Bluff aluminium smelter, New Zealand's
biggest industrial complex, are planning a NZDollars 300m (Pounds 113m)
expansion following this week's controversial decision by the government to
continue to give the smelter cheap power till 2012.
A Radio New Zealand report said that under the new contract Comalco will pay
substantially less than the city of Auckland, which has a population of 1m
and uses an equivalent amount of power.
The Dominion newspaper reported yesterday that the decision to approve the
deal struck between state owned electricity company Electricorp and Comalco
had split the cabinet.
The minority Alliance Party, pledged to support the government, which has a
very small majority, expressed disquiet at the decision.
The Dominion said the decision was pushed through by the prime minister, Mr
Jim Bolger, and the finance minister, Mr Bill Birch, after a long debate. A
number of other ministers expressed concern about the uncertainty of energy
supplies and wanted the contract renegotiated.
Ms Jeannette Fitzsimmons, an Alliance spokesperson, said that the smelter
was New Zealand's single biggest industrial user of electricity, taking 15
per cent. She said that the contract expired in the same year that New
Zealand was due to take the last gas from its large offshore Maui field. 'It
means New Zealand will probably have to switch to coal generation at a time
when the world will be increasingly concerned at emission problems,' she
said.
Comalco's managing director, Mr Kerry McDonald, said that the price and
continuity of supply would permit the company to go ahead with the expansion
. He said however that a final decision to expand rested with Comalco and
Sumitomo.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: FAO says 3% cereal output rise
needed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
World cereal production must rise by at least 3 per cent next year to avoid
a further reduction in the stocks that act as a safety net against famine,
the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation says today.
Global output this year is estimated to have fallen by about 4 per cent to
1.88bn tonnes, contributing to serious food shortages in some countries and
eating into world cereal stocks, the FAO says in its latest analysis of the
world food situation.
It says there are 790m chronically undernourished people in the developing
world and a further 2bn suffering from diet-related deficiency diseases that
can retard growth and lead to blindness and other serious disorders.
World cereal stocks have to equal at least 17 per cent of annual consumption
'to safeguard world food security', and this should be the case next year,
according to the FAO.
'Failure to boost cereal production could have a serious effect on
international cereal prices, already increasing in response to tightening
supplies in 1993-94, and on food security prospects, particularly of
low-income food deficit countries,' says Mr Edouard Saouma, FAO
director-general.
Early prospects for crops next year are seen as generally favourable, except
in Russia, where bad weather and a shortage of funds to buy fuel and inputs
have led to a sharp drop in the area sown with winter grains.
While African nations form the majority of those threatened by food
shortages, nearly 1m people in Russia's war-torn neighbours Armenia,
Azerbaijan and Georgia need emergency assistance to avoid starvation.
The FAO estimates that world wheat production will remain level in 1993-94
at about 567m tonnes, while coarse grain output will fall from 871m tonnes
to 791m tonnes and rice production will be down 6m tonnes at 520m, mainly
because of particularly wet weather.
It forecasts that world trade in cereals in 1993-94 will be 190m tonnes,
about 7 per cent less than the estimated trade volume the previous year.
This fall would be mainly attributable to a drop in demand for wheat and
coarse grain imports.
World trade in wheat and wheat flour, for example, is expected to be 93m
tonnes, or 5m tonnes less than last year, mainly because the countries of
the former Soviet Union are likely to import only 11m tonnes compared with
16m in 1992-93.
The US, for whose grain exports these countries are leading customers, will
therefore experience the sharpest drop in wheat exports, the FAO says.
Against the general trend, Australia is expected to export substantially
more because of a large increase in its production.
Developing nations are expected to import about 67m tonnes of wheat, roughly
the same as last year. But a record harvest this year in India means that it
will need only negligible imports, compared with the 3m tonnes it bought
last year.
Trade in coarse grains is forecast to be 82m tonnes, 9m less than last year,
with the drop mainly affecting maize.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Dutch gas deal threatens
'horizon pollution' - Ronald van de Krol on plans for exploratory drilling
in a much prized nature reserve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Dutch are bracing themselves for a short bout of 'horizon pollution' in
one of their best-loved nature reserves.
Last week, under a deal worked out with three natural gas companies, the
government cleared the way for exploratory drilling in the Wadden Sea, a
much prized beauty spot that each year attracts millions of migratory birds
 -as well as thousands of Dutch and German tourists.
The prospect of drilling platforms has prompted environmental campaigners in
this intensely flat country to decry what they see as 'horizon pollution', a
uniquely Dutch preoccupation. However, they are far more concerned about the
long-term dangers of seabed subsidence, the possibility of an oil and gas
'blow-out' and disruption to wildlife, both in the sea itself and on the
Wadden (or West Frisian) Islands.
In keeping with the environmental sensitivity of the area, the government
has said that actual commercial exploitation of the gas fields beneath the
sea must be done 'laterally' for at least the next five years.
This means that any production platforms will have to be located elsewhere,
probably on the Dutch mainland, the Wadden Islands or the North Sea, with
drilling taking place at an oblique angle from some distance away rather
than straight above the gas field, as would normally be the case.
The drawback to lateral drilling is that it may be able to extract only
about 70 per cent of the Wadden Sea gas. The rest will have to be considered
unrecoverable, unless direct drilling in the sea is permitted after the year
2000.
This month's agreement, which must be worked out in detail in early 1994, is
a delicate and controversial compromise between economic and environmental
considerations. It means that, although there will be no permanent drilling
sites in the Wadden Sea over the next five years, there will be exploratory
drilling at 21 sites over the period. Of these sites, about half will be in
the sea itself, with the rest planned for the surrounding area.
Exploratory drilling will be limited to the winter months, when the area is
not visited by as many migratory birds, and to about three months per
exploration site.
The three energy companies - Elf Petroland, Mobil and Nederlandse Aardolie
Maatschappij, a joint venture between Shell and Esso - are confident that
they can produce gas from the Wadden Sea without running environmental
risks.
In 1984, the three companies, which hold long-term concessions in the area,
agreed to a 10-year moratorium on exploration and drilling. The voluntary
stand-still expires on January 10, and the new agreement will cover the next
five years until 1999.
What is still unclear, however, is whether the gas companies will be able to
drill directly in the Wadden Sea once the latest agreement expires.
The Wadden Sea's environmental significance means that little detailed work
has been done until now on assessing its natural gas riches.
The area clearly has potential to yield natural gas because it is sandwiched
between the huge Slochteren gas field in the Dutch province of Groningen and
the gas fields in the North Sea and the continental shelf.
Rough estimates for the amount of gas located between the Wadden Sea range
from 72bn to 221bn cubic metres, representing a monetary value of between Fl
14bn (Dollars 7.4bn) and Fl 44.2bn. Well over the half of the proceeds would
flow into state coffers.
If the Wadden Sea proved to contain 221bn cu m, this would be equivalent to
nearly three full years of Dutch gas production at current rates of
extraction.
The government says that its cautious opening of the Wadden Sea to
exploration is motivated not so much by financial gain as by the desire to
bolster its 'small fields' strategy for the natural gas sector.
This strategy aims to preserve, as far as possible, the Groningen field,
which is still the largest gas field discovered so far in western Europe.
Unlike most gas fields, Groningen can quickly raise or lower its output in
response to seasonal or other types of fluctuation in demand, making Dutch
gas sales more flexible than they would otherwise be. By giving priority to
finding and exploiting smaller fields in places like the Wadden Sea, the
Netherlands hopes to be able to use its Groningen gas to greater effect.
'Seen in this light, the potential gas reserves under the Wadden Sea are of
great importance,' the ministers of economic affairs and of the environment
said in a letter to parliament.

<TEXT>
The German cocoa buyers' umbrella organisation Kakao-Einkaufs-Gesellschaft
is encouraging processors to take advantage of cheap cocoa following the
recent price slump, reports Reuter from Hamburg.
In a report the organisation noted that the March futures price at the
London Commodity Exchange had fallen Pounds 166 in just two weeks, to touch
Pounds 900 a tonne on Monday.
'An average price of DM240 per 100 kilograms, net, cif Hamburg for
January/December 1994 shipment offers a good chance to cover some missed
requirements,' it said.
KEG explained that the political situation in the Ivory Coast had settled
down, following the death of president Felix Houphouet-Boigny, taking a
bullish element out of the market.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: London copper prices climb to
3-month highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Copper's price rose strongly again on the London Metal Exchange yesterday,
moving to its highest level for three months. In the past three trading days
the cost of copper for delivery in three months has risen by 6 per cent, or
Dollars 103.25, to Dollars 1,802.50 a tonne.
The price rose Dollars 35 yesterday in the thin, pre-Christmas market and
traders and analysts remained split about its prospects. 'The overall
fundamentals of this market still remain bearish, although sentiment is
currently being helped by the recent drawdown in LME stocks,' said Mr Angus
MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal
Dutch/Shell group. 'However, the decline in stocks is likely to prove a
temporary phenomenon and has been attributed to delayed shipments from the
Commonwealth of Independent States and light Chinese offtake. US demand for
copper has improved but this is not enough on its own to prompt a turnaround
in sentiment in this market.'
But, according to Mr Wiktor Bielski of Bain and Company, part of the
Deutsche Bank Group, 'the fundamentals in the copper market are getting
better all the time'. He cited US copper demand - up 8 per cent so far in
1993 - and falls in copper stocks on both the New York Commodity Exchange
and the LME. Stocks represented only eight weeks' consumption, the lowest
ever coming out of a recession, he pointed out.
There had probably been a 1.5 per cent increase in western world copper
demand this year, compared with 1992, and 'people are begining to realise
there will not be a big surge in supply in 1994'. Mr Bielski said that only
60,000 to 70,000 tonnes of extra annual copper capacity was scheduled for
next year - the big surge was to be expected in 1995.
Nevertheless, in the short term he expected profit-taking temporarily to
halt copper's upward climb at between 82 cents a pound (Dollars 1,807.25 a
tonne) and 84 cents (Dollars 1,851.36).

FT  22 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Rate cuts fail to motivate European sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Interest rate cuts in Denmark and the Netherlands failed to boost European
government bond markets, where trading is thin ahead of the Christmas break,
while further weakness in US Treasuries helped pull down prices in some
markets towards the end of European trading.
The Danish central bank cut its discount and key deposit rates by  1/4 point
to 6.25 per cent while the Dutch central bank reduced its special advances
rate by 10 basis points to 5.70 per cent, but both bond markets rose only
slightly.
The rate reductions, attributed to the strength of the Danish krone and the
Dutch guilder, did however foster hopes that the French authorities will cut
rates sooner rather than later, given the continuing strength of the franc.
As a result, the French bond market was one of the better performers on a
generally lacklustre day, ending more than  1/4 point higher.
The US bond market regained its stride yesterday after the Treasury's
monthly auction of two-year notes generated greater demand than dealers had
anticipated.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/16 lower at 99
7/32 , with the yield rising to 6.303 per cent. On the short end, the
two-year note was unchanged at 100 1/16 , to yield 4.198 per cent.
In early trading, bonds across the yield curve weakened in anticipation of
the Treasury's auction of Dollars 17bn in two-year notes, to be followed by
Dollars 11bn in five-year bonds today.
With most institutional investors sitting on the sidelines until the new
year begins, demand for the new paper was difficult to gauge. Near midday,
the long bond was losing ground rapidly, dragged down by pre-auction
positioning by dealers on the short end.
However, the worst fears of the market proved unfounded. The sale attracted
an above-average level of interest, and bond prices lifted off their session
lows.
The German bond market failed to draw any inspiration from the Dutch and
Danish rate cuts, and also appeared to ignore some apparently encouraging
comments on the German inflation outlook by Mr Otmar Issing, a Bundesbank
board member.
The relative weakness of the German market caused the spread between 10-year
French OAT and German bund yields to narrow further to around five basis
points, dealers said.
UK gilt prices were weak yesterday, largely due to technical factors and
profit-taking ahead of the year-end.

Japan's finance markets
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese Ministry of Finance yesterday announced a package of easing
regulations for the domestic securities markets in an attempt to bolster
Japan's ailing financial markets.
The 70-point package includes the resumption of rights issues, which have
been suspended since March 1990 when the Tokyo stockmarket started its
descent.
The announcement follows a 3.6 per cent fall in the Nikkei average on
Monday. Officials hope that rights issues by blue chip companies will help
attract investors to the sluggish Tokyo stockmarket.
Mr Minoru Nagaoka, president of the Tokyo stock exchange, said the share
offerings should be limited to companies ready to return profits to
shareholders.
The package includes an easing of investment curbs and simplification of
administrative procedures required of brokers.
Investment trust funds will be allowed to invest in interest rate and
currency swaps, lend out securities and borrow short-term funds. The ceiling
imposed on investment trust funds' investments in the unsecured call money
market will be lifted.
The ministry will also abolish the 'lock up' period for Euroyen bonds issued
by sovereign borrowers starting on January 1. To protect the country's
domestic corporate bond market, the ministry has prohibited Euroyen bonds
from entering the country for the first 90 days of issuance.
Japanese securities houses found their way around the restriction by
agreeing to 'warehouse' the bonds for three months before selling the paper
to Japanese investors. Market participants have been calling for the ban to
be lifted. The rule, however, remains for bonds issued overseas by Japanese
borrowers and overseas companies.
For the corporate bond market, the ministry eased eligibility standards for
issuing foreign and domestic yen bonds by Japanese companies to a minimum
credit rating of triple-B from single-A.
The ministry also confirmed there were no restrictions on the issuing of
dual-currency bonds, and floating rate notes.

FT  22 DEC 93 / International Bonds: Italy to raise Y300bn in new year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Republic of Italy plans to raise Y300bn in the international bond market
early in the new year. The mandate for the widely-expected offering has been
awarded jointly to Daiwa and J. P. Morgan.
Yesterday's announcement coincided with the Japanese finance ministry's
decision to abolish the 'lock-up' period for Euroyen bonds issued by
sovereign borrowers from January 1. The lifting of this selling restriction
will facilitate the distribution of Eurobonds to investors in Japan.
Mr Alberto Giovannini, head of the Italian treasury's international
borrowing programme, said the timing of the Euroyen offering stemmed from
the virtual completion of the 1994 budget process in the Italian parliament
and the strength of the yen and the Japanese bond market. Italy has raised
about Dollars 12.8bn this year, within the Dollars 10bn-Dollars 15bn range
indicated 12 months ago as a target for 1993.
Daiwa said Italy's deal was likely to be the largest-ever offering of yen
securities outside the Japanese government bond market. No further details
were available yesterday but there was a view in the market that Italy was
looking for a maturity of more than five years.
Elsewhere, Woody Gundy pulled two more Canadian dollar offerings out of the
hat which allowed it to overtake ScotiaMcLeod in the Canadian dollar league
table.
Bayerische Landesbank raised Dollars 250m through an offering of Eurobonds
with a maturity of just under six years. One aim of the deal was to
re-finance a CDollars 75m five-year Eurobond offering which matured on
Monday. Part of the proceeds of yesterday's deal was swapped into floating
rate dollars.
The bonds were priced to yield 25 basis points over Canadian treasuries and
when they were freed to trade the spread remained intact.
Wood Gundy said the borrower took a good portion of the bonds to meet demand
from its retail clients.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the international rating agency, has raised its implied
rating of Chile's long-term foreign currency debt to triple B plus from
triple B.

The Philadelphia Stock Exchange has rejected the Chicago Board Options

The CBoE is reported to have bid Dollars 60m for the tiny exchange, which is
known for its foreign currency and equity options products.
The CBoE, the world's largest options exchange, made the offer for the Phlx
in early November. 'The CBoE is disappointed that the Phlx has rejected our
offer,' said Mr Alger 'Duke' Chapman, CBoE chairman.
'We are convinced that in these rapidly changing times that the two

Mr Chapman said his exchange maintained a co-operative relationship with the
Phlx, and had left the door open for further merger discussions.

CHINA International Futures Corp, a Beijing-based commodities trading
consortium, has become the first Chinese company to apply for membership at
three of the largest US futures exchanges.
Mr Hang Chang, Cifco's representative in the US, said the company would also
like a presence on the London Metals Exchange, although no application has
been made.
Cifco is seeking membership at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago
Board of Trade and New York's Commodity Exchange.
Mr Chang said the company had not decided whether it would purchase seats
outright on the US exchanges, or lease them from other members.
Cifco was formed a year ago by 12 state-owned commodities and materials
companies in China, including the China Grain Trading Co and the China
Material Trading Co.
It operates under the auspices of the Chinese Ministry of Domestic Trade.
Its president, Mr Lu Jian, is an Oxford-trained economist, and its chairman,
Mr Tian Yuan, was educated in China and the US.
Mr Chang joined the company this year after spending five years as an
economist at the Chicago Board of Trade.
With China's economy expanding rapidly, Cifco dominates China's plethora of
small domestic exchanges, and actively trades futures in US, London, Japan,
Singapore and Hong Kong.
Cifco has 2,000 employees and operates 18 subsidiaries and branch offices in
China's commercial centres, including Shanghai and Nanking.

FT  22 DEC 93 / International Company News: Flagship struggles to stay
afloat - Rights issue will not solve all Ferfin's problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Once a symbol of Italy's industrial might, the Ferruzzi-Montedison group is
on its knees.
The company, which includes the Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding
company and Montedison, its main industrial subsidiary, is the country's
second-biggest stock market listed group but its unchallenged leader in
terms of debt and losses.
Ferfin lost L1,667bn (Dollars 993m) on sales of L19,900bn last year. Losses
in the first half of 1993 reached L783bn, while group net borrowings stood
at more than L22,600bn at the end of June.
This week, Ferfin and Montedison launched ambitious rights issues to raise
more than L8,000bn in the coming weeks, and possibly almost half as much
again in the next 18 months. The deals follow a boost earlier this month,
when bankers agreed a controversial restructuring, aimed at reducing
interest payments, rescheduling borrowings and converting some debt to
equity - which should ease the immediate financial burden.
Success, though, is not a foregone conclusion. There is opposition from
several leading foreign creditors, and trading difficulties at many
subsidiaries, notably chemicals.
Ferfin's difficulties stem from over-ambition in the mid-1980s. Managers
indulged in acquisitions which switched the company from core activities in
farm products and trading to chemicals, cement, insurance and television.
Most of the takeovers were financed by debt. While strong profits masked the
growing financial burden of the acquisitions, the weight of accumulated
borrowings became progressively more evident in the recessionary 1990s.
As demand for many of the group's industrial products dwindled and profits
no longer covered mounting financial charges, Ferfin's problems reached a
critical mass. When severe financial irregularities and evidence of
political corruption came to light, the situation worsened.
This month, bankers representing more than 86 per cent of Ferfin's debts
accepted that L16,200bn of group borrowings should be rescheduled. This will
provide a breathing space for the company to reorganise, sell some
businesses and put others in joint ventures. The banks agreed to forego
interest on much of the group's debts this year and to accept interest
payments at below market rates for a number of years thereafter.
The complex package also contained a bank guarantee to underwrite this
week's rights issues, designed to pay back some loans and provide working
capital. However, the capital increases are largely book-keeping exercises,
as most of the new cash will be used to repay borrowings.
Assuming most of Ferfin's shareholders do not take up their rights, the new
shares will end up with the creditor banks, which will in effect have
swapped part of their Ferruzzi credits for equity.
But while the package means Ferfin's management has now plugged most of the
biggest holes, it is too soon to say the group is shipshape. For all its
financial ingenuity, the rescue scheme leaves a number of problems. Not all
Ferfin's bankers are convinced of the merits of the scheme, which was
masterminded by Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank. Four leading
international banks - Credit Suisse, Union Bank of Switzerland, Citibank and
Barclays - refused to accept the restructuring plan and are working on a
counter-proposal, which they hope to present shortly. Deutsche Bank, another
big lender, was also among the dissidents until the original rescue package
was amended.
The dissident banks say the Mediobanca scheme does not do enough to protect
creditors. They have called for additional asset disposals to raise more
cash and make the Ferruzzi empire more manageable. They also complain that,
in contrast to normal banking practice, where creditors take precedence over
shareholders, Mediobanca's scheme is too generous to the latter, including
the discredited Ferruzzis.
Such a view has limited influence, as enough creditors have now accepted the
revised scheme for it to go through. But foreign critics could still be a
thorn in the flesh for Mr Guido Rossi, Ferfin's chairman. Surprisingly, the
greatest risk comes from small banks, which are less concerned about
upsetting Mediobanca than multinational counterparts.
The recession means Ferfin may take longer to recover than forecast. Mr
Rossi argues that most of the group's operations are in profit at the
operating level, but show a loss because of interest charges on debts. By
rescheduling borrowings or converting part of them into equity, the
companies should move into the black, he believes.
Such optimism cannot mask the fact that parts of the sprawling empire are in
trouble. Stiff competition and falling demand account for the expected
L1,050bn loss at Montedison's Montecatini chemicals subsidiary for this
year.
Ferfin's new management is severely stretched. In effect, the group is being
run by a handful of executives drafted in under Mr Rossi. Although he has
won praise for his energy and resourcefulness, there are clear physical and
legal limits on how long he can continue to act as a virtual commissar.
Mr Rossi is a respected law professor, who won his business spurs as a
former chairman of Italy's Consob companies and stockmarket watchdog.
However, he is fighting on many fronts. Somewhere, he must also find time to
run the business. Although he is flanked by a few other top executives, some
former managers have been discredited, and the newcomers are having to take
on a vast range of responsibilities.
Mr Rossi and his colleagues must bear in mind the risk of further skeletons
falling out of the cupboard. Milan magistrates investigating the country's
political corruptions scandal and the new auditors hired by Mr Rossi have
uncovered a byzantine web of parallel accounts in which about L435bn in
losses - mostly incurred in commodities trading - have been camouflaged
since 1989 by shifting money around obscure subsidiaries which were not
included in the group's consolidated accounts.
With so many imponderables, the priority for Ferfin is to move fast in order
to avoid devouring yet more cash. Costs must be cut, businesses sold and an
ambitious chemicals joint venture with Shell signed. That project, codenamed
'Sophia', has been under discussion for months but has still not been
sealed.
This week's rights issues will lift the immediate financial burden. But Mr
Rossi must move decisively to restructure the business and show that it can
stand alone.

FT  22 DEC 93 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas settles C-17
dispute

<TEXT>
McDonnell Douglas, the US defence and aerospace group, said yesterday that
it had accepted a Pentagon plan to resolve a long-running dispute over
development of its controversial C-17 military transport aircraft.
The company will take a pre-tax charge of some Dollars 450m in the fourth
quarter to cover the settlement. There will be no significant adverse cash
impact.
The Pentagon revealed the outlines of the settlement on December 15, when it
placed McDonnell Douglas on 'probation'. The Pentagon said that unless the
company improved the performance of the C-17 programme, which has been
plagued by problems, it would buy only 40 of the aircraft, instead of the
120 planned.
As part of the settlement, McDonnell Douglas has dropped about Dollars 1.2bn
in claims against the government. The company announced last October that
the settlement would probably mean a Dollars 450m charge.

A four-way, ADollars 1.4bn (USDollars 950m) merger plan in Australia's
grocery wholesaling industry faces problems, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney.
One of the potential participants - Davids Holdings - has ended discussions
and will instead float its shares on the stockmarket early next year.
The planned amalgamation had originally involved Foodland Australia,
Independent Holdings, Composite Buyers and Davids.
It would have consolidated the grocery warehouses into a national group,
with an estimated 26 per cent market share. However, approval for the deal
from the Trade Practices Commission had yet to be secured.

FT  22 DEC 93 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft chief to
focus on core business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kajo Neukirchen, called in last Friday as the new chief executive of
Metallgesellschaft, is set to refocus the troubled German metals, mining and
industrial group on its core businesses.
In the first statement from the conglomerate since sweeping management
changes took effect last week, it said the restructuring would lead to a
flow of funds into the group, hinting at the partial or outright sale of
some of the group's 250-plus subsidiaries.
The statement, which did not go so far as to say what would constitute the
group's newly defined core businesses, came too late to influence the
group's share price. This fell by more than 10 per cent yesterday amid
uncertainty about the scale of the problems at the company, Germany's
fourteenth largest industrial group.
The shares dropped DM31.20 to close at DM255. They have nearly halved in the
two weeks since the group announced that it had negotiated new lines of
credit to stave off a liquidity crisis.
Metallgesellschaft said Mr Neukirchen had flown to New York immediately
after his appointment to get a picture of the financial problems at MG Corp,
the New York-based trading company whose difficulties triggered the crisis
and led ultimately to the ousting last Friday of Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, the
former chief executive, together with five boardroom colleagues.
Teams of specialists placed at MG Corp in the past two weeks had succeeded
in analysing and limiting the group's problems, the group said yesterday.
Further details were not forthcoming but 'the problems (of MG Corp) will be
dealt with professionally in the coming years,' the statement said.
Implementation of a solution to the problems had begun on Monday this week
and Mr Karl von der Heyden, former finance director of RJR Nabisco, had been
appointed as MG Corp chief executive, Metallgesellschaft said.
Two weeks ago Metallgesell-schaft said MG Corp had had to make margin calls
(cash-calls) as a result of dealings in oil futures on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. At the time, Metallgesellschaft and its bankers said
the liquidity squeeze caused by the margin calls was temporary, a
technicality triggered by the sharply falling oil price.
But investigations proved the difficulties to be more than a mere
technicality and it is now inevitable that Metallgesellschaft will need a
major capital injection.
Deutsche Bank and Dresdner bank, large shareholders in Metallgesellschaft as
well as creditors, are continuing to provide liquidity support.

FT  22 DEC 93 / International Company News: QVC claims higher Paramount bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
QVC Network, the television shopping group, claimed yesterday to have
submitted a higher offer than rival Viacom in Monday's sealed bid auction of
Paramount Communications. However, analysts cautioned that the Dollars 10bn
takeover battle was still far from settled.
The Paramount board met yesterday but recessed without taking any action on
the bids. A company spokesman declined to discuss details of the meeting.
The board will recommend one of the offers to investors. Shareholders will
be free to accept either and each of the bidders will be able to improve its
terms for a limited time after starting a formal tender offer for
Paramount's stock.
Before Monday's auction QVC's offer was worth around Dollars 10.1bn,
compared with Dollars 9.6bn from Viacom.
Mr Barry Diller, QVC chairman, made only a slight increase on Monday in the
value of his offer, apparently out of concern that he did not bid up against
himself.
Despite this, QVC said yesterday it had been advised by Paramount that 'it
is the high bidder'. Viacom declined immediate comment.
QVC has added around Dollars 100m to the value of its cash tender offer for
51 per cent of Paramount's stock, increasing the bid from Dollars 90 a share
to Dollars 92.
For the remaining 49 per cent of the company, it is offering 1.43 shares of
QVC stock per Paramount share, the same as under its previous bid, and a
revised preference stock offer.
This now consists of 0.32 shares of non-convertible stock, with a dividend
of 6 per cent, compared with a convertible with a 5 per cent dividend. The
new bid also includes 0.32 warrants a share to purchase QVC common stock at
Dollars 70.34.
QVC said the increase in the cash component of its bid gave Paramount
shareholders the benefit of its victory earlier this month in the Delaware
Supreme Court, which insisted that Paramount create a level playing field
between Viacom, its preferred suitor, and hostile bidder QVC.
The court criticised a Dollars 100m fee Paramount agreed to pay Viacom if
their merger agreement was not consummated, but the Supreme Court allowed
this to stand because QVC had not explicitly asked for it to be struck down.
Nevertheless, QVC's attorneys believe the Supreme Court stance means it can
get the payment invalidated by simply applying to a lower Delaware court.

FT  22 DEC 93 / International Company News: IBM brings in another outsider
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
International Business Machines yesterday named an outsider with a strong
consumer marketing background, but little high technology experience, to
head two key businesses: personal computers and IBM's new PowerPC chip
operation.
Mr Richard Thoman, 49, was previously head of international operations at
Nabisco, the foods group.
Before that he was in charge of international operations at American Express
and co-chief executive of the group's Travel Related Services business. In
the 1970s he was an associate at management consultants McKinsey.
At all three companies he worked closely with Mr Lou Gerstner, the former
chairman of RJR Nabisco who was appointed chairman of IBM earlier this year.
The appointment of a non-technologist to run the fast-changing PC businesses
may provoke controversy in the computer industry but it fits with Mr
Gerstner's policy of bringing fresh blood into IBM's inward-looking culture.
Analysts said that the company's PC businesses, which are heavily geared
towards business customers, could benefit from a marketing expert better
able to tap the fast-growing consumer end of the business.
Mr Thoman said yesterday that he brought to the company 'an understanding of
how consumers think and act, and an understanding of how to sell to them'.
He hoped this would complement IBM's technological expertise.
Mr Thoman, who will become a member of IBM's corporate executive committee,
takes the place at the PC businesses of Mr James Cannavino, who was recently
named IBM's top corporate strategist.

<TEXT>
Alcoa, North America's largest aluminium producer, is to take a Dollars 70m,
or 80 cents a share, after-tax charge against earnings in the fourth quarter
of 1993. It has also announced its fifth round of job reductions in 20
months.
The company said Dollars 59.4m of the fourth-quarter charge is associated
with the cost of permanent lay-offs of 1,600 hourly and salaried employees
in its US aluminium operations. Some of the reductions have already occurred
and the balance will be complete in 1994.
The remaining Dollars 10.8m of the charge stems from closing several
production operations, including an aluminium rod plant in Rockdale, Texas.
Alcoa is one of the few US aluminium producers to have remained profitable
in the face of a world aluminium glut and sharply depressed prices.
The company had third quarter earnings of Dollars 28.8m, or 32 cents a
share, on sales of Dollars 2.2bn.

FT  22 DEC 93 / International Company News: Eni chief says group is on the
way to recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Eni, the Italian state-owned energy and chemicals group, expects to report
earnings at 'about break-even' for 1993 after losing L815bn (Dollars 485m)
in the previous year.
The result could be affected by unforeseen contracts and the sharp fall in
oil prices in recent months, warned Mr Franco Bernabe, managing director.
However, he expressed confidence that Eni was on the way to recovery.
He said prospects for 1994 were even better, as Eni would benefit from the
restructuring programme begun last year. The 1992 loss reflected about
L1,500bn in extraordinary items, largely linked to the group's current
reorganisation and disposal programme.
While the 1994 results would also be affected by restructuring costs, the
burden would be appreciably lighter, he said. Eni 'still has a lot to do on
restructuring, but there will be fewer costs involved'.
Efforts to slim down the group, embroiled in Italy's political corruption
scandal, would continue, with further asset disposals, especially in
non-core businesses.
Eni should shortly announce the sale of its big Nuovo Pignone turbines
subsidiary, with General Electric tipped as the front runner. Mr Bernabe
said he hoped the disposal of Il Giorno, Eni's Milan-based daily newspaper,
might be completed by mid-1994.
However, he quashed suggestions that Eni might take a stake in the French
Elf group, to be privatised next year, as part of a long-term share swap
between the two concerns. He said such rumours were completely without
foundation.
Recent reports, nourished by Italian ministers, have suggested the French
could take a reciprocal stake in Eni's energy interests, due to be
privatised by the end of 1995. However, Mr Bernabe said: 'It seems strange
to me to talk about a share swap between an entity which exists and one
which doesn't exist.'

airline

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders in CSA, the Czech national airline in which Air France, Caisse
des Depots and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development jointly
have a 40 per cent stake, have agreed to implement a crisis restructuring
plan to return the troubled Czech carrier to profit.
The decision was made at an extraordinary shareholders meeting in Prague
called to discuss CSA's growing losses and claims by Air France and the EBRD
that the company was overvalued when they bought their stakes in 1992.
The meeting also accepted the resignation of Mr Jiri Fiker, CSA president.
He has been replaced by Mr Antonin Jakubse, a former CSA executive in
Toronto. Mr Fiker was asked to resign by the Czech government, which has
grown increasingly concerned about CSA's financial position.
The airline is expected to make a loss of Kcs1.2bn (Dollars 40m) this year,
following losses of Kcs400m in 1992. Previously published figures for 1992
had reflected only the loss for the first 8 months before the company was
partially privatised.
Mr Jakubse has been charged with preparing a 'crisis plan' for the airline.
Industry sources say this could include reducing some services and
accelerating the sale of old aircraft.

FT  22 DEC 93 / International Company News: CGM sees reduction in deficit
next year

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Compagnie Generale Maritime (CGM), the financially troubled French shipping
group, hopes to reduce its losses next year in preparation for its eventual
privatisation, said Mr Eric Giuily, chairman.
He said he was moderately optimistic that CGM would be able to reduce its
net loss to around FFr75.2m (Dollars 12.9m) in 1994 due to its restructuring
programme.
However, he warned that CGM, which is still in the throes of restructuring,
would produce a net loss of FFr475.2m for 1993.
On the trading front, CGM returned to the black in the second half of this
year due to a modest improvement in operations.
The company expects to post operating profits of FFr32m in the second half
of 1993, against a loss of FFr6.1m for the first half.
The group has been restructuring its activities and finances since Mr Giuily
took over as chairman last year. It has cut its workforce (excluding dock
workers) by 460 to 2,823 since early 1992 but its attempts to shed labour
have been complicated by the dockers' dispute with the French government
over the latter's attempt to modernise working practices.
CGM has also been selling assets and generated FFr230m in 1993 through the
sale of two ships and various investments. It plans further property and
other asset sales.
Despite the sales, CGM still requires an injection of capital from the
government to stabilise its finances. Mr Giuily said it had asked for
FFr500m and expected a response early next month.
Mr Giuily said that CGM, named as a candidate for privatisation by the
Balladur government, would not be ready for sale next year. In the meantime,
he said, the group planned to strengthen its commercial activities by
forging alliances with other shipping companies such as the Bollore group's
sea transportation business.

FT  22 DEC 93 / International Company News: Spring share issue for DnB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Den norske Bank, Norway's biggest bank, is to launch a NKr2bn share issue
next spring as the first step out of government control following a
prolonged crisis in the country's financial sector.
Under an agreement with the government agencies handling the state's rescue
of the loss-stricken banks, about NKr1bn (Dollars 135m) of the funds raised
through the issue will be used as a capital injection for DnB. But the
balance will go to pay back some of the state's heavy capital commitments
made to keep the bank afloat.
The agreement is the second move by the authorities towards re-privatising
the banking sector. It follows a share issue of a similar scale this month
by Christiania Bank, the country's second biggest bank, which also came
under state control during the loan-loss crisis.
At present, the Government Bank Investment Fund holds a 69 per cent stake in
DnB, representing NKr2.9bn in state capital. In addition, a second state aid
agency, the Government Bank Insurance Fund, injected preference capital
worth NKr3.5bn into the bank.
Initially, the preference capital will be converted into equity, bringing
the total government share of DnB's equity to 87 per cent. But the share
issue, likely to take place next May, will reduce the government's stake to
around 65 - 70 per cent and is likely to be followed later by further
privatisation.
Details of the share issue have yet to be worked out, but DnB said the value
would be 'at least' NKr2bn.
Officials were keen to point out that the government now looks set to more
than recoup its investment in DnB. At current market prices, the government
shareholding after conversion of the preference capital is worth NKr8.7bn.
This not only exceeds the NKr6.4bn injected by the investment and insurance
funds, but also covers a further NKr1.24bn in state cash already written
off.

Faupel Trading, the USM-quoted textile importer, returned pre-tax profits of
Pounds 404,000 for the half year ended September 30, down 37 per cent on
last time's Pounds 639,000.
The result was 'somewhat below' directors' initial expectations and the
shares slipped 9p to 80p.
Turnover from continuing activities improved from Pounds 13m to Pounds
13.4m, with household textiles accounting for Pounds 6.08m (Pounds 4.81m)
and garments for Pounds 6.55m (Pounds 7.59m).
There were lower earnings per share of 2.87p (5.19p). The interim dividend
is a same-again 1.85p.
The directors said an office had been established in Shanghai which would
enable the group to keep abreast of the 'rapidly developing' supply base in
China.

FT  22 DEC 93 / UK Company News: J&amp;S trims loss to Pounds 973,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jones &amp; Shipman, the Leicester-based producer of grinding and honing
machines, yesterday reported a marginally reduced first half pre-tax loss of
Pounds 973,000 - down from Pounds 981,000 - and is again passing its interim
dividend.
Turnover for the six months to end-September fell from Pounds 6.27m to
Pounds 5.41m, although the 1992 figure included Pounds 795,000 of sales from
the small tools business, sold in February.
Losses per share were slightly lower at 8p (8.2p) and gearing was contained
at 38.5 per cent. However, the company raised a net Pounds 2.96m in October
from a subscription, placing and open offer of 13.5m shares. Following this,
a pro-forma balance sheet would result in no gearing, it said.
Mr Len Weaver, chairman, said the capital injection had enabled the company
to resume its rationalisation programme announced last year, since when the
workforce had been halved to 265.
As part of the capital injection, Korber of Germany took a 26.5 per cent
stake in the company.
Mr Weaver said an integrated operating plan, advantageous to both J&amp;S and
Blohm and Schaudt, the Korber grinding machine tool businesses, was in the
final stages of preparation.
He said the first six months' trading had remained difficult, with order
intake still depressed.
The immediate outlook remained uncertain, although manufacturing activity in
UK and US markets was showing some signs of recovery. But the full
implementation of the company's new manufacturing strategy, which relies
heavily on buying-in machined components, had placed J&amp;S 'in an excellent
position to exploit even a modest upturn in demand and thus return to
profitable trading.'

FT  22 DEC 93 / UK Company News: An unexpected sector of bright sparks /
Analysis of the electricity companies' success in outperforming the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MIKE SMITH and KEITH FRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cast your mind back three years. Imagine you had Pounds 1,000 to invest on
the stock market, and you wanted your money to grow extremely fast.
Chances are you would have spurned suggestions to put it into the regional
electricity companies floated by the government in December 1990.
Utilities were seen as safe but dull - but the regional companies and the
generators which were floated four months later have proved to be one of the
stock market's brightest sectors.
By the end of last week - the conclusion of another successful interim
reporting season for the sector - Pounds 1,000 invested in a typical
regional power company three years ago would have been worth Pounds 2,960.
The same sum invested in PowerGen in March 1991, when it and National Power,
the other English generator, were floated, would be worth Pounds 3,005;
Pounds 1,000 invested in Scottish Power and Hydro-Electric three months
later would be worth Pounds 1,940.
What lies behind this share price growth?
And, in view of some potentially damaging regulatory reviews in the offing,
how long can it last?
Since privatisation, power companies have benefited from both luck and
judgment.
In the former category, low interest rates have prompted fund holders to
switch from low yielding government stocks into utilities, while electricity
sales have been helped by the country's economic recovery.
But the power sector has also impressed the market by cutting costs -
including labour costs - far quicker than an arguably naive government
expected, albeit from a high and inefficient base.
It has also avoided the pitfalls of diversification that several water
companies, for example, have fallen into.
Most of the 18 privatised electricity companies have diversified, but
usually into areas, including generation in the UK and overseas, in which
they have at least some expertise and knowledge.
As a result, the financial results of the last month have yielded no great
horrors.
'It is difficult to pick the highlights, but nor have there been any obvious
lowlights,' said Mr Nigel Hawkins, analyst at Hoare Govett.
All of this has meant that the sector has been able to expand profits and
dividends far faster than expected.
The average underlying rise in dividends, one of the main gauges by which
the market evaluates utilities, was about 15 per cent at the half year and
the full year out-turn for England and Wales is likely to be similar.
Even for the Scottish companies, floated after the government had learned
the lessons of earlier privatisations which critics said were give-aways,
the expectation is for 10 per cent plus.
But for both the generators and the regional companies in England, Scotland
and Wales, there is a blot on the horizon: Professor Stephen Littlechild,
the industry regulator.
National Power and PowerGen, the main England and Wales generators, are
first in line after he said last week that he would decide around the middle
of January whether to refer them to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Reaching an accommodation with the generators will be difficult, but the
market seems confident that a deal will be struck.
If this is right, the generators are judged by analysts to be in reasonable
shape to grow profits and dividends further.
Mr Nigel Burton, analyst at SG Warburg Securities, says there is scope for
both companies to continue cost reductions and to benefit from increases in
the price of electricity in the wholesale trading pool.
'They can also grow dividend faster than the market because of their policy
of reducing the cover provided by earnings.'
For the regional electricity companies the threat from Prof Littlechild
comes in the form of his review by next summer of the distribution
businesses which provide the bulk of their profits.
But it may be less of a danger than pessimists believe.
According to Mr Simon Williams, analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities, the
review will cut earnings substantially because rates of return at about 12
per cent are considered too high. 'But dividends are a different matter.'
Like the generators, most regional companies' dividends are covered about
three times by earnings.
Mr Williams says this could go much lower, particularly as the companies
have extremely strong balance sheets and cash flow.
One of the notable features of the interim results was that several
companies are now cash positive and most are on course to achieve surplus
cash within the next year or so.
Mr Hawkins, of Hoare, says companies in the strongest position in the review
are those which have already cut costs - but not so much that there will be
nothing left for them to attack after April 1995, when the results of the
review will be implemented. He puts Northern, Manweb, South Western and
Southern in that category.
But in any case, he says, most regional companies in England and Wales will
be able to increase dividends by 12 per cent in real terms before 1995 and
by 5 to 6 per cent thereafter.
For National Power his estimates are for 12 per cent to 1995 and up to 9 per
cent thereafter until the end of the century, and for PowerGen 14 per cent
until 1995 and then 9 per cent.
He expects the two Scottish companies to increase by at least 6 per cent in
real terms.
Most analysts believe that the spectacular share price growth of the last
few years is unlikely to continue, but that the sector is not about to fall
from grace.
According to Mr Williams of Kleinwort: 'By the end of the century the
electricity companies may be typical utilities with earnings and growth
profiles to match. But they are not that while they are pumping out dividend
growth of 15 per cent.'

FT  22 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Eurotherm's 38% advance to Pounds 20.1m
helped by cost cuts and growth in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eurotherm, the industrial process control equipment supplier, turned in a 38
per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the year to October 31, buoyed by
improved productivity, higher margins and the positive impact of currency
movements.
Pre-tax profits were up from Pounds 14.6m to Pounds 20.1m, on turnover which
edged ahead by 2.5 per cent to Pounds 158.4m (Pounds 154.6m), mainly
reflecting growth in the US market.
Earnings per share rose by 35 per cent, from 22.3p to 30.2p. An increased
final of 6p is recommended, making a total for the year of 9.5p (8p).
Shares in the group, which is also proposing a 1-for-1 scrip issue to
improve liquidity, closed 16p ahead at 690p.
Tight control on costs, including a further reduction in the workforce to
2,030, and a renewed focus on profitable product sales, helped boost gross
profit margins by almost 2 percentage points. As a result operating profits
increased by 29 per cent to Pounds 20.1m.
The group, which derives an increasing proportion of its turnover from
outside the UK - over 65 per cent in the latest period - also benefited from
sterling's relative weakness against the dollar.
If 1992 figures are restated at 1993 exchange rates and disposals are
excluded, like-for-like turnover slipped by 2.6 per cent and pre-tax profits
expanded by 30 per cent.
Growth from the group's range of AC drives helped offset lower turnover from
process automation and the effects of the recession in Germany and France.
Net interest costs fell to Pounds 25,000 (Pounds 1.03m) reflecting the
group's strong Pounds 14.2m (Pounds 8.2m) cash generation, including a sharp
Pounds 3m reduction in stock levels, which enabled it to eliminate net
borrowings and end the period with cash balances of Pounds 6.8m.
COMMENT
Over the past three years Eurotherm's management has refocused the business
and introduced more profitable products while driving costs down and
introducing tighter financial controls. As a result most of the group's key
performance measures, including its return on capital, have improved
substantially. While there is still some scope for margin improvement,
future performance will mostly depend on the group's ability to grow
organically - despite the lack of any general upswing. This will mostly be
achieved through new products like the AC drives and expanded recorder
product range which will add about Pounds 7m to sales in the current year.
Pre-tax profits should reach Pounds 25m this year producing earnings of
about 37.7p. The shares, which have more than tripled in price over the past
three years, are now trading on a forward multiple of 18.3 - but still look
like a good buy.

FT  22 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Further pay-out at Atlantic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Total liabilities of Atlantic Computer Systems, the leasing company that
collapsed in April 1990, should not exceed Pounds 168m, the liquidators said
yesterday.
With net realisations of up to Pounds 39.2m under current estimates, that
could lead to a further dividend of 4p in the pound after an interim payment
announced this week of 19p.
Mr Richard Boys-Stones, one of the liquidators from Price Waterhouse, the
accountants, said the payment reflected his strategy of 'maximising the
realisations and minimising the liabilities'.
The recalculated liabilities figure contrasts sharply with the estimate of
nearly Pounds 450m provided by Atlantic's directors at the time it went into
administration.

FT  22 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Wessex Water advances 21% - Acquisitions
and organic growth boost waste management activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wessex Water brought the reporting season for the 10 privatised water
companies to a close with better than expected results showing a 21 per cent
increase in interim pre-tax profits and a 10 per cent increase in the
dividend.
Mr Nicholas Hood, chairman, attributed the strong profits growth, from
Pounds 44.3m to Pounds 53.4m, to tight control of costs, which, excluding
depreciation and infrastructure maintenance, have not risen for the last two
years. Sales rose by 6 per cent to Pounds 109m for the six months to
September 30.
Fully diluted earnings per share were depressed by the Pounds 144.5m rights
issue in January, falling from 31.6p to 31.4p. The interim dividend is
raised to 8p (7.3p).
There was a strong performance from Wessex Waste Management, the joint
venture with Waste Management International, which increased its
contribution from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 4.2m. Mr Hood said the sharp
increase was because of both acquisitions and organic growth. Five
businesses had been acquired since the previous year for Pounds 7m,
contributing turnover of about Pounds 15m to the operation's total sales
which doubled to Pounds 42.1m.
Wessex Waste Management intended to continue pursuing acquisitions, Mr Hood
said, and had Pounds 80m with which to fund expansion.
The core utility side improved profits by 19 per cent, with just 6
percentage points due to price increases. The rest had been down to cost
controls, Mr Hood said. These included a small reduction in jobs through
natural wastage and strict control of fuel costs and other overheads.
Mr Hood said he was confident the company would achieve a satisfactory
settlement in next year's review of pricing by Ofwat, the regulator.
'We have got an amazing efficiency programme which I know is recognised by
Ofwat,' he said. 'I am confident we will get as good a deal as anybody.'
However, there was likely to an element of negotiating. 'You will always end
up with some eyeballing.'
Wessex has capital spending requirements of Pounds 120m in the current year
and about Pounds 100m is targeted for 1994.
The group ended the first half with net cash of Pounds 53m, against Pounds
54m at the start of the year. Mr Hood said he expected the group to have no
borrowings at the end of the current year.

FT  22 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Bespak gloomy after 43% decline to Pounds
2.08m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bespak, the medical equipment manufacturer, warned yesterday that its
full-year results would be lower than expected following a 43 per cent
decline in interim profits.
In the six months to October 29, pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 5.01m to
Pounds 2.88m in spite of increased turnover of Pounds 31m (Pounds 27.4m).
The company said the decline, which prompted a profits warning last month,
mainly reflected lower sales in the US where uncertainty over the impact of
President Clinton's health reforms persuaded many Bespak customers to reduce
stocks.
In dollar terms, first half turnover in the US - representing 46 per cent of
the group total - fell by 14 per cent. Sales to US Surgical, Bespak's
largest North American customer, fell by 34 per cent.
The poor performance in the US and continental Europe, where turnover
declined 7 per cent to Pounds 3.05m, pushed operating profits down by 39 per
cent to Pounds 2.93m (Pounds 4.83m).
The share price, however, climbed 12p yesterday to 320p after the company
said a healthy balance sheet and relatively low gearing of 15 per cent
enabled it to increase the interim dividend by 5 per cent to 4.2p (4p).
Mr Alun Hicks, finance director, said the higher dividend reflected the
board's confidence about future performance.
That optimism was based on improving turnover in the UK, where sales of
medical valves and components increased from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 12.1m.
Most of the increase came from a Pounds 1.5m contribution from Medix Group,
the breathing equipment manufacturer which Bespak acquired in May for Pounds
1.8m.
The company said it had written off Pounds 439,000 in goodwill on the
acquisition.
Earnings per share amounted to 7.5p (13.2p).

FT  22 DEC 93 / UK Company News: In need of an effective remedy - The
problems facing Fisons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fisons' latest boardroom drama has moved Mr Patrick Egan into the full glare
of the spotlight. Following the sacking last week of Mr Cedric Scroggs, the
group's chief executive, and the resignation of Mr Roy Thomas, finance
director, Mr Egan, the chairman, now dominates the Fisons stage.
Mr Egan is looking for an external candidate to fill Mr Scroggs' role. Given
the difficulties the company had filling the post last time - two
headhunting firms failed to find a suitable external candidate - Mr Egan may
be running the company for some time.
A courageous, straight-forward and at times blunt manager, he feels,
according to insiders, at least partly responsible for the problems
currently faced by the group, Mr Egan believes he can personally help Fisons
overcome its crisis.
Mr Egan knows the company's problems well. He was a non-executive for seven
years before becoming chairman during which time Fisons made critical errors
leading to its spectacular fall from grace.
These mistakes included lack of investment in pharmaceuticals manufacturing,
which led to the withdrawal of key products from the US on the insistance of
the Food and Drug Administration.
Another error was the dubious trading practice of the discounting of drugs
towards the year-end to boost sales and profits. By 1991, when the practice
was at its peak, it generated nearly a fifth of the division's sales.
However, mistakes were also made after January 1992, since when he has, as
executive chairman, in effect been running the company. During his tenure,
Fisons has issued two profit warnings and suffered a collapse in market
capitalisation from Pounds 2.23bn to only Pounds 794m.
Mr Egan's 40-year career in Unilever's consumer products businesses was a
far cry from the role he must now play as executive chairman at a
pharmaceuticals and scientific equipment group.
The son of an Indian civil servant, conversant in Urdu and Punjabi, he
joined Unilever in 1951 after national service. Without a university degree,
he once said: 'My horizons haven't been narrowed by too much education.'
In 1978 he became a director of Unilever, chairman of its UK operations in
1982, and regional director of Latin America, central Asia and South Africa
in 1987. He joined the Fisons board in 1985.
He took over as Fisons' executive chairman in January 1992, after the sudden
departure of Mr John Kerridge. The architect of Fisons' phenomenal growth in
the 1980s, Mr Kerridge left because of ill health. He had come under heavy
pressure after US regulatory authorities had discovered manufacturing
irregularities.
At that time, Mr Egan stressed Fisons' underlying strengths, claiming
scientific equipment was a good business. Yet the instruments business's
profits plunged from about Pounds 40m in 1991 into a Pounds 16m loss this
year.
He also misread the prospects for the pharmaceuticals division. Mr Egan was
unrealistically optimistic about the possibility of Opticrom, an eye
treatment, being reinstated by the FDA in the US.
He said 'the FDA could telephone tomorrow and we could have it up and
running the day after'.
The product, which had annual sales in the US of Dollars 40m (Pounds 27m) is
still not on the market nearly two years later and is unlikely to be
relaunched.
Mr Egan also misread the state of the drugs division's pipeline of new
products, essential for the company's future. Mr Egan stressed: 'We have
critical mass in R&amp;D. We have compounds in the larder. There is a string of
products that will sustain the business in the years ahead, not only in the
respiratory area, but also for the central nervous system.'
However, in April this year, development of Tipredane, Fisons' only late
stage treatment for asthma, the group's most important therapeutic category,
was halted. Its only other product in late stage development, an
anti-epileptic product called Remacemide, is not expected to be launched
until 1998. Analysts believe the chances of licensing in new compounds from
other groups will be held up again while a new chief executive is chosen.
The cupboard is, in effect, bare.
If Mr Egan misjudged the state of Fisons' businesses, the strategic
direction he chose over the past two years has also been questioned by
analysts. He initiated a strategic review in January 1992 which concluded
with the decision to sell the consumer health operations and horticulture
business.
With hindsight the group should have kept the consumer businesses, which
provided steady revenue streams, and sold the more cyclical scientific
equipment operations, say analysts.
After an abortive outside search for a new chief executive, Fisons turned,
in April 1992, to Mr Scroggs, head of the scientific equipment division.
Although Mr Scroggs had taken over a division in 1981 with a Pounds 64m
turnover and trading profits of Pounds 2.8m and turned it into a Pounds 645m
business, making profits of Pounds 68.4m, there was criticism in the City
for appointing him. It was felt he lacked the necessary pharmaceutical
experience and was too closely identified with the Kerridge years.
The reason for the timing of Mr Scroggs' sacking this month remains obscure.
Mr Egan said his departure was precipitated by the rapid deterioration of
the scientific equipment business and the need to accelerate the winding up
of the unwise, though not illegal, forward selling policy.
However, insiders insist Mr Egan had become aware of the forward selling
policy in April 1992. Moreover, no secret had been made of the scientific
equipment division's deterioration. The board had been given details of its
performance every month. Indeed, Mr Scroggs publicly admitted the division's
difficulties were 'a nasty episode' in September this year.
The board's decision, with the agreement of Mr Egan, to sack Mr Scroggs
leaves Fisons without a chief executive, without a finance director, and
without an apparent strategy. It does leave the company vulnerable to a bid.
The prognosis is gloomy. Mr Egan, a hunting, beagling and polo-playing
enthusiast, must now prove his mettle if Fisons is to survive as an
independent entity.

The board of Newspaper Publishing, publisher of The Independent and the
Independent on Sunday, gave the go-ahead yesterday for talks on a possible
new minority shareholder.
A number of potential investors ranging from Mr Conrad Black's Hollinger
group, which controls The Daily Telegraph, Lord Rothermere's Associated
Newspapers and Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Communications, have
expressed interest.
Mr Richard Branson, chairman of the Virgin Group, has also expressed an
informal interest.
The board yesterday approved in principle a three-year business plan drawn
up by Mr Patrick Morrissey, the recently appointed chief executive.
The plan is designed to rejuvenate the papers, which have suffered
significant circulation loss over the past six months.
Mr Morrissey last week made it clear that the aim was to approve the
business plan and then go forward to arrange new financing for the company.
After the board meeting the company said: 'A number of different options
were examined which would allow a secure future to emerge from the
restructuring process now being undertaken.'
The statement continued: 'Considerable progress has been made and a further
statement will be made early in the new year.'
The options being considered range from raising necessary finance from
existing shareholders through a rights issue through to bringing in a new
minority shareholder to a full takeover by rival newspaper publishers.
The leading option at the moment is bringing in a national newspaper
proprietor to take a 20 per cent to 30 per cent stake.
Mr Black is the most likely candidate if a way can be found of ringfencing
the editorial independence of the titles.

FT  22 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Berisford near to closing takeover deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Berisford International, which in May lost a Pounds 184m takeover battle for
C&amp;J Clark, the shoes group, is close to finalising an agreed bid for another
UK business.
The deal would be classed as a reverse takeover as it would be larger than
Berisford, which has a market value of Pounds 110m. It is expected to be
announced in January. Berisford shares rose 5p to 111p yesterday.
After the failure to win Clark, when the controlling family shareholders
rejected an offer which had been recommended by a majority of the board,
Berisford is understood to have taken steps not to miss out again.
The group, which yesterday reported a reduction in pre-tax losses from
Pounds 65m to Pounds 5m for the year to September 30, has been in search of
a business to acquire since it reduced its former operations, largely in the
commodities and property sectors, to a minimal size, repaying debts that
once stood at Pounds 1.2bn and nearly brought the company down.
Mr Alan Bowkett, chief executive since January 1992, has assembled a
management team with expertise in the engineering and building products
areas and it is expected that the acquisition will be of a business in these
sectors. It could be a division of a larger group.
Mr John Sclater, chairman, said the deal would be 'the first step in the
realisation of our strategy for the restoration of shareholder value'.
The deficit for the year was struck after the Pounds 828,000 cost of the
Clark bid.
The balance sheet had net cash at the year end of Pounds 3.5m compared to
debt of Pounds 15m, with the group raising Pounds 34.8m from disposals
during the year. Shareholders' funds stood at Pounds 81.4m (Pounds 84.6m).
Mr Bowkett said there were signs of a revival in the property market, with
institutional interest showing a marked increase in recent months. The group
expects to sell its remaining properties, valued at Pounds 18m in the UK and
Pounds 5m in the US, at or above book value.
Group sales rose to Pounds 69.3m (Pounds 50.5m) largely because of higher
property sales. The trading loss was Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 5.9m). Severe
weather conditions hit the US agribusinesses but Ketlon (UK), which makes
automotive components, held turnover despite a fall in the European market.
Bristar Trading, the cocoa trading associate, recovered from a poor first
half in the second six months.
The continuing push to sell or close activities led to further provisions of
Pounds 13.5m, but this was partly offset by a Pounds 8.3m release of
provisions made earlier but not needed. In 1992 net provisions were Pounds
58.2m.

FT  22 DEC 93 / UK Company News: BSkyB makes first Pounds 50m payment to
shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture, has made its
first Pounds 50m payment to its shareholders.
The payment was the first return on a total of Pounds 1.6bn invested in the
project so far.
Mr Richard Brooke, BSkyB finance director, said that a further payment of at
least Pounds 50m would be made before the end of the financial year.
He said operating profit had reached Pounds 3m a week by the end of November
but declined to say what the figure for the full year would be.
Half of the first Pounds 50m went to Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.
The balance was split between Pearson, owner of the Financial Times,
Chargeurs, the French communication and transportation group, and Granada.
Mr Brooke said the move to charge for BSkyB's channels had been a success.
In July, the number of homes subscribing stood at 2.35m and should reach
3.25m by the year end.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Williams makes Pounds 40m sale to management: The first
fruits of a strategy change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Williams Holdings, the once acquisitive conglomerate which has been seeking
a more appropriate role in the sober 1990s, yesterday took the first real
step towards refocusing its businesses.
The group announced the sale of part of its engineering division to venture
capital-backed management for Pounds 40.3m. It is selling six businesses to
Cortworth, including Newage Transmissions purchased for Pounds 20m in 1987.
Williams will retain Fairey Engineering, the military bridge engineer.
The disposal had been expected since Mr Nigel Rudd, chairman, outlined a
strategy in September of focusing on building products, and fire and safety.
A sale of the electronics division is also expected, although not
imminently.
Williams will provide Cortworth with substantial backing as part of the
disposal agreement. This includes reinvesting Pounds 15m of the
consideration in deep discount loan notes, which roll up interest, and a
Pounds 3m credit support.
The company will also retain an involvement in Cortworth through a deferred
consideration. Depending on Cortworth's performance, the deferred element
could take the form of an equity stake of up to 25 per cent upon flotation
or a cash payment in the event of a trade sale. The potential value of this
has been estimated at Pounds 15m-Pounds 20m.
Analysts welcomed the disposal as a sign that Williams was getting to grips
with its transition from a conglomerate to a more focused group of
businesses. They also estimated that this would reduce year-end gearing from
about 45 per cent to 35-40 per cent.
However, some remained sceptical about progress, given the structure of the
deal and the retention of Fairey Engineering. 'If it was such an attractive
deal, it is surprising they did not exit altogether,' said one. 'And why not
get terms with a loan which gives cash interest?'
Mr Rudd said the deal allowed Williams' shareholders to benefit from any
recovery. 'These are good businesses, but not necessarily for Williams,' he
said. 'They are better owned by other people.'
The businesses being sold contributed a pre-tax profit of Pounds 4.6m,
marginally ahead of last year, and sales of Pounds 46m for the 11 months to
November 26. Net assets stood at Pounds 38.5m. However, Williams would incur
a Pounds 17m exceptional loss on the transaction after writing off goodwill
which had previously been charged to reserves.
The management buy-out team is led by Mr Bill McMurray, head of Williams'
engineering division. Cortworth's non-executive chairman will be Mr Roger
Pinnington, former chief executive of Royal Ordnance. He was also formerly
chairman of Telfos and Blackwood Hodge.
The management will hold 28.6 per cent of Cortworth, while NatWest Ventures
will have 49 per cent and Barclays the balance.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Wood gets flotation option: RBS joint venture could be sold
if market value exceeds Pounds 200m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Peter Wood, chief executive of Direct Line, the motor and household
insurer, will be allowed to float a new insurance joint venture with Royal
Bank of Scotland if it reaches a market value of Pounds 200m.
Mr Wood will have the choice of full or partial flotation of the company,
which will insure 'non-standard' risks such as young drivers. He will have
the right to buy out Royal Bank's 60 per cent stake if it does not want a
flotation.
The deal follows speculation that Royal Bank might float Direct Line itself,
which analysts have estimated could be worth more than Pounds 1bn.
Speculation has eased since the recent strong rise in Royal Bank's share
price.
Details of the deal between Mr Wood, who was paid an Pounds 18m bonus by
Royal Bank this year and an additional Pounds 24m to buy out his bonus
arrangement, were disclosed in a letter to shareholders. They will be asked
to approve the buy-out of Mr Wood's bonus scheme and the new joint venture
at the annual meeting on January 14.
Mr Wood is to invest Pounds 1m in the new venture, giving him a 40 per cent
equity stake.
The bank also revealed in its annual report and accounts that remuneration
of directors had risen sharply as a result of the bank's increase in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 265.2m, against Pounds 12.6m for the year to September
1992.
The remuneration of Mr George Mathewson, Royal Bank's chief executive, has
risen 55 per cent from Pounds 219,287 to Pounds 341,326, while that of Lord
Younger, its chairman, has advanced 33 per cent to Pounds 167,814.
Total performance-related bonuses of executive directors - excluding Mr
Wood's - rose to Pounds 971,000 from Pounds 160,000, while pension
contributions went up to Pounds 473,000 from Pounds 246,000, and other
emoluments to Pounds 183,000 from Pounds 100,000.
The bank's 22,000 UK staff will be paid a 5.1 per cent bonus from a
profit-sharing scheme in January.
Mr Wood will be non-executive chairman of the new insurance venture - in
which Royal Bank is investing Pounds 1.5m in equity capital and Pounds 22.5m
in preference shares - and will be allowed to spend up to a day a week
working on it.
The deal stipulates that if a merchant bank values the new company above
Pounds 200m, Mr Wood may choose a full or partial flotation. If Royal Bank
does not agree, he will have the right to buy out its preference and
ordinary shares.
It also says that if the new company requires additional capital which Royal
Bank is not prepared to supply, then Mr Wood can provide the additional
funds himself, or through a third party, and buy out the bank's equity
stake.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Moulinex stake for Glen Dimplex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Glen Dimplex, the Irish household electricals group, is negotiating to buy a
minority holding in Moulinex, the French domestic appliances company, as
part of the latter's emergency financial restructuring.
Moulinex, one of the best known names in European household goods, has been
struggling to stabilise its finances. It has been hit by recession and by
intense competition from multinational manufacturers.
The company carries heavy debt incurred during the 1991 acquisition of
Krups, a German competitor. The Krups deal strengthened Moulinex's presence
in key product sectors, notably coffee machines, but triggered a steep rise
in costs.
Moulinex fell into the red in 1992 with a net loss of FFr115m (Pounds 13m),
on turnover of FFr8.22bn, against net profits of FFr171m. It stayed in
deficit during the first quarter of this year.
The group was left with net debt of FFr3.25bn at the end of March. However,
attempts to reorganise its finances have been complicated by its intricate
corporate structure. It has been run by a co-operative board since the death
in 1991 of Mr Jean Matelet, its founder, and is controlled by Finap, which
is owned by Moulinex employees.
In October the board approved proposals to raise new capital to reduce
borrowings. The company has since developed a plan for a cash injection of
FFr500m. Banque de Financement et de Tresorerie, a subsidiary of the Credit
Agricole banking group, is looking for institutional investors to take
stakes in Moulinex.
The talks with Glen Dimplex form part of the restructuring plan. Glen
Dimplex, which is already present in the household appliances market through
Morphy Richards, its UK subsidiary, has started discussions to buy a holding
either in Moulinex itself or in Finap.
Glen Dimplex is privately owned by Mr Martin Naughton and Mr Laughlin Quinn,
the latter being the brother of the Irish minister for enterprise and
employment, Mr Ruari Quinn.
The company was founded in 1973 as Glen Electric, and bought Dimplex from
the receivers in 1977. Concentrating on the manufacture of industrial
electric heating equipment and domestic electrical appliances, it has since
expanded through in Europe and North America.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Time to declare a rare vintage year for gilts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Every once in a while UK government bonds produce a spectacular annual
return as the markets are caught facing the wrong way. It happened in 1977
when the total rate of return on long-dated gilts was 50 per cent and again
in 1982 with 54 per cent. Here we go again with a return for 1993 which
could approach 40 per cent as long yields slip below 6.5 per cent.
Nobody predicted this. A year ago all the comment was about how difficult it
would be to finance the sharply rising budget deficit. Many thought that the
initial yield of 8 3/4 per cent would have to go up, and indeed for a few
pessimistic weeks in January it did, peaking at 9 per cent. The lowest
year-end forecast for long yields that I can recall was that of Midland
Bank's Roger Bootle, who picked 7 3/4 per cent (incidentally, he is
forecasting 5 3/4 per cent for this time next year).
Through the middle of the year the US Treasury long bond yield appeared to
be making all the running, but it stalled in October while bond yields in
many other countries, including the UK and Japan, have continued to decline.
As a result the gap between government long bond yields in the US and the UK
has dropped this year from 140 to only about 20 basis points.
The rare presence of an index-linked sector in the gilt-edged market makes
it possible to calculate that more than half of the drop has reflected a
sharp fall in inflation expectations: the long-term inflation crudely
implied by the gap between fixed interest and real yields started at 4.9 per
cent but has now slipped to 3.6 per cent (on a more sophisticated analysis
it is rather less than this, because of the risk premium contained within
the fixed interest yield). At the same time the real yield itself has
fallen, from 3.8 per cent to 2.9 per cent.
The much tougher fiscal stance progressively adopted by the British
government in two budgets this year has been an important factor in driving
down nominal yields. But the decline in the real yield is essentially a
global phenomenon. Falling inflation, too, can be partly attributed to
overseas influences, which is why the decline was so difficult to forecast
on the basis of historical British experience. The advanced industrial
economies appear to be in the grip of overcapacity and intense competition.
When long gilt yields tumbled from 15.6 to 10.9 per cent in 1982, also
reflecting a sharply tightened fiscal policy and in anticipation of a drop
in inflation towards the 5 per cent it reached at the end of the year, they
eventually hit a credibility barrier because of the persistence of
underlying inflationary forces, as shown by the persistent rapid growth of
broad money and earnings. Gilt yields subsequently fluctuated around 10 per
cent until 1991.
This time yields are searching for a new base level to reflect the much
lower underlying inflation suggested by growth in broad money and earnings
of only 5 and 3 per cent respectively. However, the eventual answer will not
depend entirely, or necessarily even primarily, on domestic considerations
because gilts now represent about 5 per cent of the global capitalisation of
government bonds in a market which is becoming more and more integrated.
Yield differentials have contracted sharply over the past year or two.
But some countries still stand out from the crowd. This year long gilts may
have outpaced US Treasuries but they have not been able to hold a candle to
the currency-boosted returns on Japanese government bonds, where even at the
less volatile 10-year maturity the total return to a dollar-based investor
has been around 30 per cent. Bond yields in Japan may now be heading below 3
per cent as inflation turns negative and investors perceive that real yields
may still be too high.
The sub-3 per cent area is where gilt yields were in the mid-1930s (and
again, somewhat artificially, in 1946). But it could only happen again if
the British government, like its Japanese counterpart on current evidence,
became overwhelmed by forces of deflation beyond its ability to respond.
Judging by the relatively vigorous economic recovery now taking place in the
UK, such a further gilt-edged bonanza is not going to happen any time soon.
But never mind, 1993 has been a truly wonderful year for bond investors.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Ford sees European profit in 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ford of Europe expects to return to profit in 1994 after three years of
heavy losses. Mr Jacques Nasser, Ford of Europe chairman, said the US
carmaker's European operations (excluding Jaguar, Ford's UK luxury car
subsidiary) had remained in loss in 1993, but had achieved 'a substantial
improvement' from 1992.
Ford had hoped to return to break-even in Europe this year (excluding
Jaguar), but had been hit by the prolonged fall in new car demand. Its
plants have operated at only around 70 per cent of capacity.
Mr Nasser said that west European new car sales were expected to rise by
only 1-2 per cent next year, following a decline of about 15 per cent this
year.
In the first nine months of 1993 Ford of Europe, excluding Jaguar, incurred
a net loss of Dollars 264m (Pounds 177m). Last year's record annual loss
totalled Dollars 1.3bn, including Dollars 395m at Jaguar.
Ford, which is in fourth place in the west European new car market behind
Volkswagen, of Germany, General Motors, of the US, and PSA Peugeot Citroen,
of France, had increased productivity this year by more than 10 per cent in
most areas, said Mr Nasser. It was aiming for a similar improvement in 1994.
Mr Nasser said that productivity at its two UK car assembly plants at
Dagenham and Halewood had improved by 42-44 per cent since 1990.
This year's radical restructuring had reduced the Ford of Europe workforce
by more than 10,000 to about 83,000. The total was 115,000 in 1990.
Production of cars and light commercial vehicles (excluding Jaguar) had
declined by 14 per cent this year to 1.45m, according to provisional
figures. Output in Germany (including the plant in Genk, Belgium) had
dropped 11.7 per cent to 829,000. UK production had declined 5.3 per cent to
390,000, while the Spanish total had plunged 31.9 per cent to 212,000.
Output of the Mondeo this year had reached 347,000, compared with 221,000
for the Sierra in 1992. But the output of Ford's other models had declined
sharply: Escort/Orion is down 28 per cent at 427,000; the Fiesta down 24 per
cent at 433,000; and the Granada/Scorpio had plunged by 34 per cent to only
38,000.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Yeltsin announces abolition of Russia's security ministry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin last night announced the abolition of Russia's
Ministry of Security - formerly the KGB - in a move which brings the
country's security and intelligence services under his direct control.
A new federal counter-intelligence service has been created, with its
director explicitly under Mr Yeltsin's command. The director retains
ministerial status but is no longer in the cabinet.
Mr Nikolai Golushko, the current security minister, has been named director
of the service and given only two weeks to present a proposal for the
reorganisation.
The move comes after Mr Yeltsin criticised the ministry for failing to warn
of the armed uprising staged by the former parliament in October. It follows
the gains made by the Liberal Democratic party of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky in
the recent elections. Many of the party's leading members are former
security officers, and it is routinely accused of being a creation of the
KGB since its foundation in 1990.
Security agents are temporarily retained on staff, but only until they take
a test which almost certainly will require proof of their loyalty to the
president.
The abolition of the ministry was presented as the death of a service which
was powerful and feared in Tsarist times, which became a vast empire of
terror and suppression under the communists. A statement from the
president's office said that in its various forms - as Cheka, NKVD and KGB -
the security police had 'proved unreformable'.
It said: 'Attempts to re-organise it in the past were superficial and
unsuccessful. At the present time, the security ministry has no concept of
Russia's state security needs. The counter intelligence system has been
weakened, while the system of political police has been preserved and can
easily be recreated.
'On the landscape of the democratic transformation going on in Russia, the
system of providing security has outlived itself, is ineffective, is a heavy
burden on the state budget and is a barrier to economic reform.'
The reshuffle does not affect the foreign counter-intelligence service,
which was separated from the KGB last year, and is now headed by Mr Yevgeny
Primakov, a former aide to President Mikhail Gorbachev.
Another former Gorbachev aide and liberal politburo member, Mr Alexander
Yakovlev, was yesterday named as head of the main Ostankino state television
channel, following the sacking of Mr Vyacheslav Bragin, seen in presidential
circles as the man who handed the election to Mr Zhirinovsky. Mr Yakovlev
has supported the Russia's Choice political group.

FT  22 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Borden
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Every investment banker on Wall Street seems to have crunched the numbers on
how to break up Borden's disintegrating food and chemical empire. That no
bid has yet emerged suggests how difficult it is to make the sums stack up.
As an unwieldy conglomerate attempting to rationalise too late, Borden has
been left with too many products commanding small market shares. Some of
Borden's foods businesses have been eaten alive by focused competitors.
Anheuser-Busch and the revitalised Frito-Lay have bitten great chunks out of
Borden's market share in salty snacks.
Borden retains more attractive businesses in spaghetti sauces, ice-cream and
pasta, which could appeal to Campbell, Unilever or Nestle. But it would be a
bold move for one predator to risk buying a company with such poor cash
flow, weak brands and tricky disposal prospects. Similar worries, though,
did not stop Tomkins buying Ranks Hovis McDougall.
The more likely outcome is that Borden will slowly shrink by selling off its
assets piecemeal. That, though, will only compound the cash flow constraints
of its remaining businesses. The worry for food industry rivals would be if
Borden's capacity was recycled in another form at lower cost. Other US
industries as diverse as paper and airlines have seen their economics
wrecked as excess capacity has been kept alive. Branded foods are more
defensible. Nonetheless, such a development would turn up the heat another
notch.

FT  22 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Williams Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Disposing of the bulk of its engineering division to management will not
transform Williams Holdings' balance sheet. Of the Pounds 40m proceeds,
Pounds 15m is being ploughed back into the business as debt finance for the
MBO team. The Pounds 25m cash realised from the sale compares with net debt
of over Pounds 200m at the last count. Since the transaction is likely to
dilute earnings per share, the stock market might be forgiven for being
underwhelmed. An exit multiple of around 12 times this year's earnings
underlines the fact that trade investors are not prepared to pay the kind of
heady prices that equity investors now take for granted.
The deal is unlikely to open the floodgates to a wave of similar disposals.
Fairey bridges, the only part of the engineering division which has been
retained, generates erratic profits and needs a large parent. Williams
cannot therefore rely on its entrepreneurial management to provide an early
exit. The electronics division, which is linked to the fortunes of its
customers in the German automotive sector, would be hard to sell at this
point in the cycle.
The rating of its shares might improve if Williams can gradually pay down
debt and reduce its sprawling empire. Raising equity to finance smaller
deals - such as the share placing which helped fund the acquisition of
Thorn's fire extinguisher business earlier in the year - would become a more
attractive option. But with the prospects for disposals so limited, Williams
will have to apply itself to generating more cash from existing businesses
to reduce its debt.

FT  22 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Wessex Water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was hard luck that Wessex chose to release its interim figures on the day
the latest bull run in water shares came to an end. A 20 per cent increase
in pre-tax profits and a 10 per cent dividend increase were hardly excuses
for yesterday's sell-off in the sector. Holding operating costs steady in
the regulated water business for the third year running, due to the
introduction of flexible working practices and performance related pay, is
especially impressive. Yet it is the success of Wessex's joint venture in
waste management that underpins the dividend. A doubling of half-year
profits in waste is a welcome contrast to the red ink being spilt elsewhere
in the sector. That said, the heady pace of acquisitions - another five were
completed in the last six months - makes the underlying progress difficult
to judge. Without an improvement in landfill prices, any margin gains will
be hard won.
With cash still in hand from January's rights issue, Wessex could easily
finance its portion of another large acquisition in waste. If the prospects
are as good as it says, it would do well to move sooner rather than later.
Keeping rights money in the bank at current rates of interest will do
nothing to improve earnings per share.

FT  22 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Gas under control
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A more competitive gas market has long been a main priority for the
Department of Trade and Industry. So it comes as no surprise that it has
rejected a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report which urged divestment
of British Gas's trading business but deferred the introduction of
competition. Since the DTI is so single-minded, it would be fair to assume
new entrants will be given a fair chance when their licences are drawn up.
That makes yesterday's 3 per cent drop in Gas's share price understandable,
even though many important variables, including the future price formula and
permissible rates of return on transportation, remain unsettled.
What is clear is that by April 1998, British Gas stands to lose 10 per cent
of its UK domestic tariff sales, which last year were worth Pounds 5.8bn in
all. Experience in the contract business suggests that when the tariff
market is fully free, it will lose considerably more. There will be savings:
the company will not have to pay for gas it is no longer selling. But the
net shortfall is likely to be large in relation to profits which are
currently around Pounds 1bn. Revision of the pricing formula is unlikely to
afford much compensation.
British Gas will thus be heavily reliant on cutting costs. It has already
promised to take out 20,000 jobs, though presumably some fixed costs will
have to be eliminated as well. There is no shortage of fat to trim, but the
equity market must also consider the consequences in terms of provisions and
cash outlays. Dividend cover is hardly ample at around 1.5 times. Cash spent
on restructuring will not be available for investment in the high return
overseas projects which Gas regards as essential for growth. That may
constrain its flexibility despite the recent sale of Consumers Gas.
Shareholders might have been better off if the company had been forced to
divest its trading business after all.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Britain's non-EU trade gap doubles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's visible trade gap with countries outside the European Union more
than doubled last month after a sharp drop in the value of exports.
The deficit with non-EU trading partners widened to Pounds 767m from
October's Pounds 372m. That followed a 7.5 per cent fall in export values
from Pounds 5.2bn to Pounds 4.8bn. Imports remained flat at Pounds 5.5bn.
Excluding oil and such erratic items as ships and aircraft, the deficit
jumped from Pounds 386m to Pounds 634m.
Although the widening of the trade gap looks alarming, it follows a small
deficit in October which government statisticians believed to be
unsustainable. Over the latest three months, the deficit appears to have
flattened. In the three months to November, the trade gap was just over
Pounds 2bn, the same as in the previous three-month period.
Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister, said the UK 'must look to future
opportunities in the Far East, India, South America and in Europe and the US
which are fast coming out of recession'.
But Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, said that unless
the UK improved its ability to make and sell things in the world, recovery
would not be sustainable: 'If we are unable to compete in world markets now,
what is going to happen when Gatt comes into force and competition hots up?'
Measured by volume and excluding oil and erratic items, exports and imports
continued their rise, but by only 0.5 per cent last month, compared with
over 1 per cent in October.
Exporters continued to increase prices substantially in November, although
the value of the pound has moved little since the first quarter, indicating
that manufacturers are attempting to rebuild their profit margins through
export sales.
The Central Statistical Office said that in the three months to November,
export prices increased by 12 per cent, compared with the previous three
months, against only a 4.5 per cent rise in import prices over the same
period. The non-EU trade figures paint a different picture from the intra-EU
statistics.
Yesterday's non-EU trade figures show import volumes rising a seasonally
adjusted 4 per cent in the three months to November, compared with only a 1
per cent rise in underlying export volumes. The EU figures suggest a
relatively flat picture for imports.
The deficit on trade with the US and Canada was Pounds 74m compared with a
Pounds 130m surplus in October. In the latest three months the deficit was
Pounds 5m, compared with a surplus of Pounds 183m in the three months to
August.
Exports to western European countries outside the EU reached a record Pounds
934m in November.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Treasury reorganisation aims to improve business connections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury has launched its most sweeping reorganisation for a decade in a
bid to improve management efficiency and counter criticism that it is out of
touch with the business world.
The moves, announced yesterday, will give more responsibilities to
relatively junior officials and set up a new directorate to handle policies
affecting industry, including education and employment.
Sir Terry Burns, Treasury permanent secretary, will link more closely with
officials lower down the department who will report directly to him.
The shift, to take effect next month, is intended to make the Treasury more
receptive to events outside Whitehall.
It is the strongest signal yet from the government's most powerful
department that it intends to change its culture to focus more on wealth
creation.
The changes come after criticism from industrialists and non-government
economists in recent years that the Treasury has developed too few contacts
with the business world and has been slow to react to outside events.
In particular, critics have said the department failed to wake up early
enough to the seriousness of the recession, and also to sense the pressures
on sterling prior to Britain's departure from the European exchange rate
mechanism 15 months ago.
Sir Terry has spent the past 18 months refining ways to reform the
Treasury's management.
He has recently been working with Ms Wendy Pritchard, a management
consultant, on ways to alter the department's culture.
The biggest element of the change is the regrouping of the Treasury's
financial services and industry divisions into one directorate under Mr
Steve Robson, a high-flying Treasury official in charge of industry
policies.
Mr Robson will take charge of the Treasury's responsibilities for
supervising financial institutions, and also for policies to help industry
work more effectively. Such 'supply side' policies include ways to attract
more private-sector involvement into large projects normally funded by the
government.
On the same deputy-secretary level as Mr Robson will be three other
officials who cover civil-service pay and management, public services, and
fiscal and monetary policy.
As part of the reshuffle, two of the Treasury's current deputy secretaries -
Ms Rachel Lomax, in charge of financial institutions, and Mr Huw Evans,
number two to Sir Nigel Wicks in overseas affairs - are moving jobs and are
not being replaced.
Ms Lomax is to become economic adviser at the Cabinet Office while Mr Evans
is to become the UK's representative at the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank.
Mr Brian Fox is moving to the Cabinet Office from head of establishments and
organisation.

statistics. Yesterday's non-EU trade figures show import volumes rising a
seasonally adjusted 4 per cent in the three months to November, compared
with only a 1 per cent rise in underlying export volumes. The EU figures
suggest a relatively flat picture for imports.
The deficit on trade with the US and Canada was Pounds 74m compared with a
Pounds 130m surplus in October. In the latest three months the deficit was
Pounds 5m compared with a surplus of Pounds 183m in the three months to
August.
Exports to western European countries outside the EU reached a record Pounds
934m in November. However, over the latest three months they were down
slightly on the previous three-month period. The deficit held steady at just
above Pounds 1bn.
Exports of manufactured goods grew slightly faster than imports in the
latest three months, compared with the three months to August. Compared with
the same three months a year ago, exports of manufactured goods were up a
seasonally adjusted 27 per cent against an increase of 19 per cent for
imports.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Double trouble, toil and struggle: Ukraine's nuclear weapons
and its collapsing economy are worrying for the west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the latest of a series of attempts to convince Russia and the west of its
good faith, Ukraine announced on Monday that 17 of the 46 SS-24 strategic
nuclear missiles on its territory had been deactivated, by moving the
warheads away from the launchers.
The move may go some way towards allaying anxieties in the west about the
prospect of a Russo-Ukrainian conflict, heightened by the electoral success
of Russian nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who wants to restore Russian
rule throughout the former Soviet Union. One Ukrainian parliamentarian has
argued that Ukraine should try to secure operational control of the nuclear
missiles on its territory, 'to confront the threat to its security posed by
Zhirinovsky's new-found strength'.
Russia has conducted a vigorous diplomatic campaign on the nuclear issue,
claiming that the weapons based in Ukraine are not being properly serviced
or maintained, and that there is a grave risk of an accident if they are not
handed over soon. 'Ukraine is deceiving us all . . . and we are so helpless
that we cannot deal with this evil,' President Boris Yeltsin was quoted as
telling US Vice-President Al Gore last week.
Western policymakers have grown increasingly worried about Ukraine's
apparent reluctance to implement the Lisbon protocol, signed last year,
under which it pledged to transfer the remaining nuclear weapons on its
territory to Russia, and to join the nuclear non-proliferation treaty as a
non-nuclear state. Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, warned
recently that Ukraine would get little or no US aid until it dismantled the
weapons, while Willy Claes, the Belgian foreign minister and current
president of the EU Council, said it was 'unthinkable' for Ukraine to join
Nato's planned Partnership for Peace so long as it had not fulfilled its
disarmament commitments.
But while some Ukrainian deputies have talked loosely of the weapons' value
as a deterrent against Russian aggression, defence experts realise that any
Ukrainian nuclear force would be vulnerable to a Russian pre-emptive strike.
Nor do they believe it would be easy for Ukraine to gain operational command
and control from Russia. 'The specialists who maintain and service the
weapons are Ukrainian,' says Serhiy Pirozhkov, director of Ukraine's
National Institute of Strategic Studies, 'but the black or red suitcase -
whichever it is - remains in Moscow.'
Anton Bouteiko, foreign policy adviser to President Leonid Kravchuk, insists
that full compliance with the Lisbon protocol depends on three conditions:
technical and financial help with dismantling the missiles; compensation for
their value; and guarantees that Ukraine's security would not be jeopardised
by its non-nuclear status. The west has been trying to meet Ukraine's
concerns on all three points.
Several well-placed western observers in Kiev are convinced that the
importance of the nuclear issue has been exaggerated, and that the true
danger to Ukraine's independence lies in its own government's mismanagement
of the economy. Industrial output fell by 20 per cent in 1992, and probably
as much again in 1993. Inflation is running at about 70 per cent a month -
or, as economy minister Roman Shpek prefers to put it: 'The total price
index this year is 37.8 times higher than last.' The long-promised national
currency, the hryvnia, has yet to be introduced; meanwhile Ukrainian workers
are paid in coupons which last week were trading at more than 30,000 to the
US dollar - or, even more tellingly, at 27 to the Russian rouble, with which
it started at par two years ago.
Despite monthly increases in wages and pensions, incomes cannot keep pace
with prices, and few Ukrainians can afford more than the barest necessities
unless they have access to hard currency. Most families survive on fruit and
vegetables from their dachas (country cottages), having gone out after work
every evening last summer to pick the beetles off their potatoes by hand;
and many, even in large towns, keep a goat for milk and cheese. Thus a
sophisticated industrial economy, which once manufactured many of the
components and guidance systems for the very missiles now in dispute, has
all but reverted to subsistence farming under the impact of hyperinflation,
aggravated by energy shortages.
Ukraine imports virtually all its energy from Russia, which has gradually
raised the price of its oil and gas exports to world market levels. Ukraine
has failed either to prepare for or adjust to the change. Its oil
refineries, which used to re-export refined products to Russia, are closing
down for lack of input, while gasoline is smuggled across the frontier in
trucks.
Ukraine no longer has surplus electricity, and has therefore had drastically
to cut its exports to central Europe, potentially a precious source of
foreign exchange. Conservation measures are haphazard and panicky - many
Kiev apartments were virtually unheated during November's severe cold spell,
and universities have been told to extend their Christmas holiday until
early February.
President Kravchuk recently called in foreign ambassadors and tried to
convince them that his latest 'economic reform', involving cuts in
industrial and energy subsidies and credit creation, with faster
privatisation, is more serious than its seven predecessors. All previous
attempts have been sabotaged by increases in wages and pensions to
compensate for price rises, and by credits to help companies stave off
bankruptcy and unemployment. 'We have a law on bankruptcy, but unfortunately
we don't have a single bankrupt,' says Mr Shpek.
Ironically, many Ukrainians voted for independence in 1991 not out of any
firm sense of national identity - though 11m of the 52m inhabitants define
themselves as Russian - but in the belief that they would be economically
better off. Mr Kravchuk's avoidance of painful economic measures which might
shatter this fragile consensus has resulted in a situation in which, by
every economic indicator, Ukraine is now worse off than Russia.
Not surprisingly, a lobby of politicians and industrialists has emerged in
the mainly Russian-speaking east of the country, advocating closer economic
ties with Russia, with which Ukraine still does 90 per cent of its trade. At
the same time, groups in various regions have started calling for greater
local autonomy. Politically most sensitive is the Crimea, which was only
made part of Ukraine in 1956, and which many Russians regard as rightfully
part of Russia.
So far Ukraine has been remarkably free of the ethnic violence which has
plagued other ex-Soviet republics. But while some Ukrainian nationalists
proclaim their willingness to 'eat grass' for the sake of independence, it
seems unlikely that many Russians are ready for that degree of
self-sacrifice. If the economy continues to deteriorate, different ethnic
groups will see their interests as divergent; and if violence does break
out, a local Russian leader, in Crimea or elsewhere, will sooner or later
call on Russia for help.
After the 1917 revolution, Ukraine, like the states of Transcaucasia, had a
brief fling of independence followed by reabsorption into the Russian empire
under the new guise of a Soviet republic. This time round a similar pattern
has been set, notably in Georgia and Azerbaijan: local conflicts have been
exploited by locally based Russian forces to reimpose de facto Russian
control while maintaining formal independence.
Should the same happen in Ukraine - a country that includes Europe's
geographical centre, and shares borders with Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and
Romania - it would, in the words of Markian Bilynskyj, the British-born
research director at a Ukrainian think-tank, be the result of 'a succession
of bad policy choices which look inevitable to the analyst after the fact; a
case of self-destruction or suicide, with Russia only too eager to play the
role of Dr Kevorkian (the US practitioner of euthanasia)'. Ukrainian
nationalists advocate greater economic independence from Russia and closer
ties with western Europe. Yet few grasp that only much bolder reforms would
make that orientation realistic.

Is Vladimir Zhirinovsky showing signs of losing his hair?
The question is not as daft as it sounds if one supports the analysis of
humorist Vladimir Voynovich, quoted in Solovyov and Klepikova's recent
biography of Boris Yeltsin.
Since Lenin's time, bald and hairy rulers have alternated throughout Russian
history: Lenin (bald), Stalin (hairy), Khruschev (bald), Brezhnev (hairy),
Andropov (bald), Chernenko (hairy), Gorbachev (bald), Yeltsin (hairy).
So the message seems to be that as long as Zhirinovsky keeps his hair on, we
should be all right.

Recession may have hit BSN hard, but Antoine Riboud, the French food group's
74-year-old chairman, has lost none of his Machiavellian flair for wheeling
and dealing.
Unilever's agreed bid this week for France's second largest ice cream
producer has Riboud's footprints all over it. Unilever leapfrogs arch-rival
Nestle to become market leader, while BSN picks up a frozen foods business.
Only 18 months ago, Riboud was using his famed political and business
connections to help Nestle outsmart his old buddy, Gianni Agnelli, for
control of the Perrier mineral water business.
But while Riboud may pose as power-broker at home, his manoeuvrings are
starting to look increasingly like attempts by a second-rank food
multinational to snatch crumbs from the big boys' table.
How much longer will they keep throwing him scraps?

Such has been the transformation of Berisford International, the one-time

Doubtless, chief executive Alan Bowkett is jesting when he explains that the

pluses instead of minuses in its cash line.

W Edwards Deming, who died this week, may have been one of the most
influential figures in modern industrial management, but that is not what
sticks in the mind of one of Observer's colleagues. His enduring memory is
of a conference in Detroit where an awe-struck audience became increasingly
puzzled by a rambling and somewhat disjointed speech by Deming, then in his
70s.
It was not until question time that the man who taught the Japanese Total
Quality Management admitted to having been beaten by one of life's simpler
challenges.
He had not been able to read his prepared text because he could not figure
out how to switch on the light on the lectern.

Sir John Banham's Local Government Commission is always being attacked for
its lack of clear direction, so the government deserves some credit for its
imaginative choice of new commissioners.
Chris Chope, a former minister and before that leader of Tory flag-waving
Wandsworth borough council, has been paired with Margaret Hodge, former
leader of Islington borough council (no Tory councillors at all at the last
election). Both are undeniable local government heavyweights, unlike the
other commissioners, and have a public stature to rival Sir John's.
Chope has a reputation for attacking unnecessary costs in local government -
a subject dear to Sir John's heart - while Hodge is a veteran of numerous
rows with the government over poll tax capping. Hard to believe that this
deadly combination will help the commission's increasingly disobedient
chairman toe the government's party line.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Observer: Gear change from BMW
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When the marketing supremo of the German car industry handed in his notice a
couple of weeks ago, his associates at BMW sat heavily on speculation that
Robert Buchelhofer was headed for Audi or any of Germany's other
hard-pressed carmakers.
Indeed he is not. From February, the 51-year-old Austrian will be on the
starting blocks of a brand new career, as a partner at the Frankfurt offices
of TASA International, the Swiss-based headhunting network.
Gabriele Willner, one of his new colleagues, claims he decided about a year
ago that he had peaked in the motor trade - just when BMW was crowing about
having outsold arch-rival Mercedes for the first time.
It was also when Bernd Pischetsrieder, group production director and just
45, was being presented to BMW's supervisory board as the man to succeed
chairman Eberhard von Kuenheim.
Unusual as it may be for German executives to undertake such dramatic career
switches, there comes a point when some say 'I've had it with this job and
stupid supervisory boards', Willner notes diplomatically.
She herself marketed Lancaster cosmetics in an earlier life, while other
TASA International partners in Germany come from retailing or the drinks
business.
Willner confides that the new recruit will be helped from 0 to 90 with
searches for two motor industry scalps, but that he will be expected to be
up to speed in all fields before long.

<TEXT>
When the Local Government Commission was launched in June 1992, ministers
expressed the hope that it would settle the structure of local government in
England for decades to come. That hope looks increasingly forlorn, with
little coherence in the commission's recommendations and continuing
ministerial interference in its work. Now comes the threat of a revolt by
backbench Tory MPs, concerned over the upheaval and its attendant costs.
The commission has been flawed from the start by its presumption that
opinion polls are an appropriate tool for deciding local government
structures. Its initial proposals were based on polls about people's
feelings about their local identity. In most cases, those proposals proved
unpopular and have had to be substantially revised. In trying to please
everybody, the commission has predictably ended up satisfying nobody.
It is not yet clear whether the revised plans will be more palatable to
local opinion. However, business leaders have already reacted with horror to
plans to create small single-tier authorities in areas such as Bristol and
Middlesbrough. They believe that wider strategic local government is needed
for urban areas such as these, which reach out beyond the city boundaries to
the larger economic areas around them.
Ministers argue that single-tier unitary authorities will cut administrative
costs and be more accountable than the present two-tier structure. Yet if
unitary authorities are smaller than counties, they will multiply the
administrative costs of county services. And if they are too small to
provide strategic services such as police and fire services, these will pass
to quangos and joint boards which are much less accountable than elected
councils.
There is a case for single unitary authorities for special cases such as the
Isle of Wight. Some larger cities such as Bristol, Leicester and Southampton
might also function better as unitary authorities - like the old county
boroughs abolished in the 1974 local government reorganisation. But in much
of England outside the conurbations, a two-tier system is needed if local
government is to think strategically yet deliver services responsively.
Recognising this would allow the government to restrict the work of the
commission to authorities where there is overwhelming local support for
change.
There are, in any case, much more important tasks than drawing lines on maps
in search of a chimerical perfect structure. One is the problem of making
the quangos which provide an increasing share of local public services more
accountable to their customers. Ministers, alas, show no interest in this
subject. It is time they reined in the Local Government Commission and
switched agendas.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Bombay scam
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Everybody was to blame, especially foreigners. This is the conclusion of
yesterday's report from the Indian parliamentary committee which
investigated last year's securities scandal. Its description of how easily
money flowed out of the banking system into the stock market in flagrant
violation of banking and stock exchange regulations will make many people
feel uncomfortable. None of those involved are spared from criticism. The
report is particularly tough on the finance ministry and the Bombay stock
exchange. Foreign banks, it says, were the 'originators and also the biggest
players'.
Many of its conclusions are self-evident. It is clear that there was
systemic laxity in oversight of financial markets. However, the report errs
in suggesting the scandal was the result of liberalisation of financial
markets. It was precisely because of official attempts to control the money
markets that institutions with money on deposit at low, regulated rates
sought methods of earning a better return, including portfolio management
schemes offered by foreign banks. If interest rates were liberalised, the
temptation to circumvent control would not exist. India needs better
supervision, but fewer rules.
That central bank restrictions were violated has been admitted by several
foreign banks. That internal controls of some banks were lax is clear.
Standard Chartered of the UK has shuffled managers, dispensed with some
staff in India and reported a Pounds 305m loss from its Indian operations in
1992. Nor can foreign banks suggest this was a purely Indian problem in
which they were hapless victims. Their international expertise helped them
to dominate the inter-bank securities markets in which most irregularities
occurred. The committee's suggestion that banks broke laws of their own
countries deserves thorough investigation.
As for the treatment to be meted out in India to the foreign banks, the
committee is right to suggest that a country seen consistently to uphold
rules will attract foreign investors rather than deter them. However,
suspension or expulsion would send the wrong signal when India's reforms are
seeking to break down barriers to the outside world. It would suggest
renewed insularity and xenophobia, as well as an unwillingness to tackle the
true inadequacies of the financial system. It takes more than one party to
make a scandal: many Indian banks have changed top managers as a result of
the scam, and a number of once-prominent people face criminal charges.
The scandal will have been of benefit if it forces Indian regulators into
more effective supervision. What is most important, however, is that this
should take place against a background of further liberalisation. India's
hopes lie in greater openness, not in a return to bashing foreigners.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Letter From Sao Paulo: Charismatic crescendo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the Roman Catholic church cared to map its long and continuing decline in
Brazil, it should begin by focusing on events in the country's highest
security prison, Bangu 1, one Thursday before Christmas. Mr Jose Carlos
Gregorio, known as the 'Fat One', the leader of Brazil's most dangerous drug
trafficking group who is serving 25 years for assault, was baptised as an
evangelical.
'The church is the light on the long road that from now on I want to
follow,' Mr Gregorio told a somewhat startled press corps. Few in Brazil's
Catholic majority will mourn his desertion to the Protestant flock. But his
conversion, along with 10 cell-mates who together face 277 years in jail,
shows the potency as well as the wide appeal of Brazil's rapidly growing
charismatic churches.
Brazil's lower-middle class, its growing number of very poor, as well as
'marginals' like Mr Gregorio, are increasingly looking to these movements to
offer solutions to today's problems rather than a promise of a better life
after death. 'The traditional Catholic and Protestant churches can't give
explanations for the realities of today, they use symbols from Europe and
explain poverty as predestiny or sin. New churches can explain things
simply,' according to Mr Antonio Gouvea Mendonca, a leading religious
studies professor in Sao Paulo.
Last Sunday at the Assembleia de Deus (God's Assembly) church in central Sao
Paulo, a packed congregation enjoyed two hours of singing and prayer before
being whipped up into a crescendo of wailing and excitement by their leader,
Brother Luke. A short man in a tightly fitting suit with a gold wristwatch
glinting under a cuff, he only slowed the pace of the service twice, when
seeking money and food.
The church, a simple meeting hall with peeling paint and heavy overhead
fans, needed nearly Dollars 2,000 to move to bigger premises. 'Who's going
to contribute in full?' he thundered. He told a story about a member of the
congregation who donated his last few cruzeiros to the fund, then found five
times the amount in a pocket on the way home. 'Alleluia, gracas a deus,'
cries of thanks echoed around the hall.
Brother Luke also called for sacrifice. The church's 'kilo campaign', which
involved members donating a kilo of a basic foodstuff to be distributed to
the area's street people, had lost momentum, he said. In the run-up to
Christmas he pledged a concerted effort to double the average food takings.
'Let's have a Christmas without hunger,' he called.
'Alleluia,' the audience responded.
As his invocations got faster and louder, the tears started. The women
started crying first, arms held aloft and trembling. Several of the audience
started shaking and an old black woman crumpled into her pew. 'Luz,' she
wailed, the Portuguese for light.
Protestantism officially arrived in Brazil in 1810. Successive waves of
immigrants from Germany and elsewhere in Europe established all the
mainstream churches such as the Lutherans, Methodists and Presbyterians by
the beginning of this century. According to Mr Mendonca's figures, which are
conservative, these groups now account for 4m of Brazil's 150m population.
But the Protestant 'explosion' did not take off until the 1950s during
Brazil's rapid urbanisation. Waves of immigrants from the country's poor
north-east moved to cities like Sao Paulo, where social pressures were often
intense and work hard to find. They were attracted by churches which offered
a sense of community and escape from daily troubles.
Most of these churches are pentecostal. Although their roots were in the US,
they are now wholly Brazilian and have adopted some of the mysticism of the
country's African cults, still popular in the north. The churches vary
greatly in their attention to conversion, hierarchy and dogma. But they
share a common history of rapid growth. Their followers have increased from
under 1m to 10m-11m in under 40 years, according to Mr Mendonca.
The pentecostal 'God is Love' movement is just such a church. Founded in
1962 with an emphasis on spiritual healing, it now occupies a huge disused
factory in a run-down area of central Sao Paulo. On the walls hang signs
saying 'Seating for 10,220 only'. Six bookshops spread around the cavernous
interior sell evangelical records and posters of the movement's founder,
pastor David Miranda.
During three daily services, a cross section of Brazil's sick,
disadvantaged, unemployed and lonely shuffle amid the blocks of pews. The
pastor, barely visible behind a glass screen, spends half the service bent
double. Only his hand, waving frantically at times, is visible above a
lectern. The language is often unintelligible. Several members of the
congregation shake violently when the pastor starts chanting. One young man,
unshaven and without shoes, is curled up in the corner of a pew, whispering.
A middle-aged white woman, who would not give her name, agreed to talk about
the church, but only outside its doors. She had come to Sao Paulo from a
neighbouring state. After her husband left her for another woman, she
started getting headaches and could not see for hours at a time. She visited
several other charismatic churches, but claimed to have been 'cured' when
she touched the stage of the 'God is Love' church. 'God helped me and now I
must help others,' she said several times.
She is not alone. Back in Bangu 1, Mr Gregorio left a similar message: 'I
have joined Jesus and I am going to teach evangelism to my brothers in
prison,' the former drug lord said.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Abolishing the gas monopoly
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The British government yesterday took an important step towards introducing
greater competition in the gas industry. The decision by Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to abolish British Gas's monopoly
to supply domestic customers over two years from 1996 should, in time,
deliver substantial benefits.
For customers, there is a prospect of lower prices, more choice and better
service. Meanwhile, the pressures of competition will give British Gas a
spur to turn itself into a more dynamic and efficient company - building on
the success already achieved since its privatisation in 1986.
Mr Heseltine's other principal decision was to reject a recommendation from
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that British Gas should be forced to
divest its trading business from its pipeline operations. The commission
felt there was an inherent conflict of interest between British Gas
competing in the trading business while owning the pipelines that its rivals
needed to use.
The failure to break the company up is regrettable, but not disastrous. The
prospects for fair and effective competition would have been enhanced by a
total separation of the two businesses. On the other hand, the plan to put a
reinforced 'Chinese wall' between the two units should achieve many of the
benefits of break-up without some of the disruption. The snag is that it
will also require extra regulatory oversight to ensure that the Chinese
walls are not porous.
While perhaps not ideal, Mr Heseltine's decision at least has the virtue of
pragmatism. Apart from the commission, few were clamouring for a break-up.
The irony is that British Gas, which was initially hostile to the idea,
eventually came to see that a break-up could boost shareholder value. Its
board of directors could still take that step voluntarily.
Much work remains to be done to turn the government's vision of a
competitive gas market into reality. That task largely falls to Ms Clare
Spottiswoode, the new director-general of gas supply. In particular, she
will need to determine how much competitors will have to pay to get access
to British Gas's pipelines and what obligations they will have to fulfil.
Though the level of access charges will to a large extent determine the size
both of gas bills and of the dividends enjoyed by British Gas's
shareholders, fixing them should not be too tricky. The monopolies
commission's recommendations on what constitutes a reasonable rate of return
will provide a useful starting point.
Fixing obligations for new competitors could be more controversial. On the
one hand, ministers do not feel confident enough to allow a complete
free-for-all. They fear that the poor, the elderly and other groups of
consumers - who are currently protected by a requirement on British Gas to
supply all on non-discriminatory terms - might prove unattractive to
suppliers in a free market. On the other hand, ministers think it would be
wrong to maintain obligations on British Gas, while allowing competitors to
'cherry-pick' the most attractive customers. The challenge for Ms
Spottiswoode is to resolve this conflict while avoiding the heavy-handed
regulation that would stifle the growth of competition.

FT  22 DEC 93 / FT Interview: Euro-club's new arrival - Theodoros Pangalos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The club rules of the European Union conventionally demand certain standards
of courtesy and tact between member states, and above all from whoever holds
the EU's rotating presidency, whose main job is to forge consensus, or at
least keep the 12 on the same side.
Thus, when the incoming president of the Union's Council of Ministers
describes Germany, one of the EU's most powerful member states, as 'a
bestial giant with a child's brain', it is a sure sign of interesting times
ahead.
Greece, arguably the EU's weakest member state, takes over the presidency on
January 1 for six months, and the author of those remarks, deputy foreign
minister Theodoros Pangalos, will be the Greek presidency's most visible
face as chairman of the foreign ministers of the 12.
This year's return to power in Greece of Mr Andreas Papandreou and his
Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) sent tremors right across the
Union's political spectrum. Irrespective of ideological affiliation, many of
Greece's partners worry that Mr Papandreou's past equivocations over
European integration could resurface.
Greece, under its previous conservative government as well as under Pasok,
is obstinately opposed to EU diplomatic recognition of the former Yugoslav
republic of Macedonia unless it agrees to change its name. Athens insists
that behind what it calls 'the Skopje government's' choice of Macedonia lies
a claim on the northern Greek region of the same name.
A Greek presidency is widely seen as a loose cannon on the deck of a
European ship, which, badly buffeted in the currency markets and the voting
booths during the past 18 months, is far from back on an even keel.
Mr Pangalos, outspoken and articulate, is well aware of prevailing
sentiments. 'The easy way they explain that is to say that the crazy Greeks
elected a crazy government which will do crazy things,' he says. 'I'm trying
to disappoint that point of view.'
He will not find this easy. One senior Greek conservative politician reckons
that, at best, 'it will be a mediocre but uneventful presidency'. But
predictably, he warns that Mr Papandreou, in frail health and in the past
unwilling to delegate, has a record of being unpredictable.
Mr Pangalos believes that the resurgence of Greek socialism discomfits those
who had written off the European left. 'The presidency will be one of the
Union, not one representing Greek interests,' he states.
'Greece offers a challenge for the EU,' he says. It is far away, it enjoys
little more than half the EU's average per capita wealth, and its debt,
budget deficit and inflation far outstrip the average in a Union set on
economic and monetary convergence.
Greece is the largest net recipient of funds from the EU budget, standing to
receive some Ecu20bn in regional aid over the next six years. But two thirds
of this flows back to German, British and French contractors, Mr Pangalos
says. 'We are a good client of the EU because we are such lousy exporters,'
he adds.
The wars in former Yugoslavia have caused a rift between Athens and its
partners, not only over the Macedonia question, but because of Greece's
close ties with Serbia, the target of international sanctions as a result of
its aggression in Bosnia.
But before that, Greece managed to keep many of its partners in episodic
irritation by blocking aid to Turkey, and therefore the 12's attempts to
develop a more coherent Mediterranean policy. Turkey not only aspires to
membership of the Union, but after the collapse of the Soviet Union is seen
by leading EU members as having a pivotal role in the former Soviet
republics of central Asia.
Standing in the way of closer links is historic Greek-Turkish enmity, which
Mr Pangalos, for one, has done nothing to play down. In another notorious
recent comment, he described the Turkish government as 'muggers', who were
'dragging bloody boots across the carpets of Europe'.
Aged 55, Mr Pangalos is a French-trained lawyer and economist. His roots are
as colourful as his rhetoric. His father was a fighter pilot, and his
grandfather was an anti-monarchist general who carried out a celebrated,
bloodless coup in 1925.
Unlike most Pasok luminaries, emigres to socialism from the old Centre
parties, Mr Pangalos was until 1968 involved in Greece's once-powerful
Communist movement. Deprived of his Greek citizenship by the colonels'
junta, he spent 1969 to 1978 teaching at the Sorbonne in Paris, and
organising opposition in Europe to the dictatorship. He was elected to
parliament when Pasok came to power in 1981, soon becoming deputy trade
minister and then European Affairs minister.
This will be the third Greek presidency he has been closely involved in. The
first Greek presidency, in 1983, was 'correct', he says, but ended in
deadlock because of the Anglo-French row over the UK's refund from the
European budget. The Papandreou government, he says, was successful in its
second stint in the chair in 1988, and, he adds with a glint in his eye,
received a letter of congratulations from Mrs Margaret Thatcher.
Mrs Thatcher possibly discerned in Mr Pangalos the pragmatic core behind the
bombast. On Macedonia, he said last month that the name controversy was 'a
lost cause for Greece', provoking calls for his resignation. He argues that
'we should get rid of the pending issues'.
The Macedonian government has 'never said that is the border. We live in a
dangerous neighbourhood,' he says. 'Their flag' - the emblem of a Macedonian
dynasty founded 50km south of Salonika - 'is a provocation. Claiming you are
descendants of ancient Greeks is very flattering for us, but please find
something from your own territory.'
Settle this, he says, and the rest will fall into place. 'We recognise the
(Macedonia/Skopje) state, and we want the state to be there. We'll be the
ones with the conflict on our border, not you,' he fires back. 'What we ask
is not much: they have to abandon the dream of uniting Macedonia under their
leadership.'
Mr Pangalos has identified the main challenge of Greece's presidency as
bringing the accession negotiations with Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway
to a successful conclusion. A success in the enlargement negotiations would
signal Greece's real arrival in the Euro-club. And maybe then the rule book
some of Greece's partners are now waving censoriously at Mr Pangalos could
stand some colourful additions.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Gaidar's Russia - the dangers
inherent in 'shock therapy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof ALAN W CAFRUNY and Mr MAURICE GLASMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We note with interest your description of Yegor Gaidar's 'Russia's
Choice' party as 'the voice of reason' ('Gaidar calls for anti-fascist
front', December 14). In the aftermath of the elections Gaidar is certainly
correct to draw a parallel between the strong showing of neo-fascists and
developments in Weimar Germany.
Many Russians believe, however, that Gaidar's draconian reforms represent an
'economic Versailles'. Under strong pressure from the west, the Yeltsin
government has made deep cuts in the state budget and in subsidies to heavy
industry as well as to consumers. These cuts have contributed to the
impoverishment of millions, and the crippling of the welfare state,
including the virtual collapse of health services.
Some of the consequences of these policies were cited in a recent report,
The Distributional Consequences of Russia's Transition, by Dr Chris Doyle,
reported by the FT ('Pay gaps threaten to split Russia', October 14).
Between 1985 and 1991-92, real household wealth declined by 86 per cent and
incomes plunged by up to one-half. Many pensioners have seen their incomes
reduced to half of the official 'physiological minimum'. Privatisation is
not leading to a dispersion of income or wealth, but rather to the
'concentration of ownership into a few powerful institutions', such as
pension funds and conglomerates.
The message widely disseminated in the media and by influential economists
is that although these policies are regrettable, no other strategy can
secure a democratic transition from state planning to markets. Yet this
assumption runs counter to historical experience. After the second world
war, the economies of western Europe and Japan were gradually opened up
thanks to generous aid, state controls designed to maintain production and
employment; protectionism; and redistributive measures. These policies were
rightly seen not as impediments to fledgling market democracies, but as
essential components of them.
The losers of the cold war have been subject to harsher treatment. Economic
reform is surely a prerequisite of democracy, but only if it is acceptable
to the Russian people. The resort to 'shock therapy' as a means of social
engineering is no less dogmatic, and no less antithetical to democracy, than
the blind faith of Soviet commissars in the state to which it bears more
than a passing resemblance. The election results should encourage the west
to reconsider its policies towards the east as well as to the institutional
realities of economic success in the west.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Fight against art tax fallen on deaf
ears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NICOLAS NORTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Antony Thorncroft ('UK wins 2.5 per cent VAT for works of art',
December 18) appears to misunderstand why the art trade fought so hard to
resist the imposition of value added tax on works of art imported into the
UK from outside the EU.
Our battle over two decades has been to protect the future of an open and
free domestic market for the benefit of collectors and dealers and as a
means of strengthening the cultural inheritance of future generations.
Had we been forced to settle for a once and for all 2.5 per cent tax, across
the whole EC, we would reluctantly have had to accept this as a regrettable
but inevitable step in the relentless harmonisation sought by the European
Commission. However, we have now lost the principle of the well-tried and
successful free market. We are also left with uncertainty about future
levels of this new tax.
It is disingenuous of the auction houses to say that 'the dealers are crying
wolf' and unhelpful to make suggestions that would further encourage the
market in New York at the expense of that in London. At a time when the art
market is showing signs of recovery, this repatriation tax is a most
unwelcome development.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Gifts to get your teeth into: The world's best-selling
Christmas presents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW and EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Soap or socks are not the only Christmas presents for those who have
everything. There are still a few surprises.
One gentleman from the United Arab Emirates has bought a life-like,
automated baby tyrannosaurus rex from the catalogue of Neiman Marcus, the
Texan Christmas mail order book for the truly rich and famous. At Dollars
63,000 (Pounds 42,300) the model has darting eyes and moving head, legs and
tail, and the mouth opens and closes.
For those with a big enough home, Neiman Marcus still has the baby
dinosaur's partner for sale - a Dollars 93,000 model of a full-grown
triceratops, nearly 7ft high and more than 12ft long.
Elsewhere in the US, the promise of a robust economic recovery is filtering
through into the high street. At New York department store Bloomingdale's
some of the most popular presents this year are cashmere sweaters, gloves
and scarves.
The 'hemline index', which dictates that when times are good, skirts get
shorter, appears to be holding true. Bloomingdale's reports the surprise of
the season is the continuing demand for the '16-inch micro-mini skirt'.
In Europe, too, sales of Christmas gifts are higher than in previous years.
At Harrods, still one of London's grandest stores, managers are keeping
their fingers crossed for the shop's best ever Christmas. They have sold out
of their seasonal food hampers, which cost up to Pounds 1,000 a time, and
staff have been put to work filling more.
Fashion jewellery has proved particularly popular, with 10,000 pairs of
earrings - a quarter of the department's annual sales - sold in the run-up
to Christmas.
At Giorgio Armani in Milan, sales are booming of traditional Christmas gifts
such as accessories and perfume. Perfume, not surprisingly, also tops the
list in Paris at the high-class Printemps store.
Meanwhile, in Germany many consumers will find a telephone among the piles
of seasonal favourites this year. The big demand follows the recent
liberalisation of the local telephone system, according to Kaufhof, the
Cologne-based stores group.
In Europe, customers appear to be turning their backs on opulence only at
the gift department of Paris's Galeries Lafayette. Staff report a rush for
imported ethnic garments and household goods. Customers are also keen, they
say, on ecologically sound items such as recycled writing paper.
In Australia, traditional presents such as writing paper are also selling
well. But it is French perfume that has surprised Australian re-tailers with
an 'extraordinary comeback', says Don Grover, general manager of one of the
David Jones stores in Sydney. He believes this is because of the launch of
several new perfumes in Australia over the past year. The number one slot,
however, is still held by Chanel.
With Christmas taking place at 300C, many Australian women can look forward
to getting a pair of lady's boxer shorts. For Australian men ties are big
news, with one designed to celebrate the staging of the Olympic Games in the
year 2000 selling well. (Presumably its popularity will run and run.)
Elsewhere, the less favourable economic mood has reduced the chance of
receiving an expensive or exotic Christmas present. In Japan the current
economic downturn is taking its toll.
During the 'bubble' period of the late 1980s, the winter gift-giving season
was a chance for both ordinary Japanese people and corporations to overwhelm
relatives and clients with tasty foods: expensive liquors, live crabs and
lobsters, and carefully wrapped fruit.
This year many people are not sending the customary gifts, and those that
are tend to choose basic products such as soy sauce and soy bean paste.
Takashimaya, the upmarket retailer, says it is the first time in 10 years
that customers have chosen such products.
One of the few pieces of good news is for the pearl industry, thanks to this
year's Imperial wedding of Crown Prince Naruhito and Princess Masako, the
former career diplomat. She is often seen wearing pearl earrings and
bracelets, and as a result many men are buying pearls to send their
girlfriends and wives.
For the kids, taste and incomes vary. Computers and computer games head many
lists. A survey by market researchers Mori shows that one in three British
families will buy a computer-related present this Christmas, a finding borne
out by London toy shop Hamley's, where Sega games machines top the list of
purchases.
But whereas this year's Mortal Kombat game has hit the headlines with its
seemingly gratuitous violence, and its password to bar younger children from
the higher levels of gore, gentler games have proved popular in Europe. Fifa
International Soccer and Jurassic Park are the big sellers this Christmas in
the UK, for example.
For Australian children rollerblades and golf clubs are among the most
requested presents in the 'Dear Santa' letters analysed by Australia Post,
while many youngsters requested their own mobile phone. Dinosaurs (the
remote-control version) are also much in demand.
In the US it is not the mobile phone but the pager that is the latest
high-tech addition for the with-it kid on the street. Discredited for many
years because of their association with drugs dealers, pink, blue or yellow
pagers are now proving so popular that some schools are having to ban them
to prevent them bleeping during lessons.
And for those that cannot afford a Neiman Marcus mechanised dinosaur, there
are alternatives. The merchandising opportunity of the year has been Barney,
an insipidly sweet, purple, stuffed toy dinosaur. Youngsters, it would seem,
just cannot get enough of him.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: A seriously centralised vision of
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALASTAIR GUNN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, 'This Gallic craving for order' mentioned by David Buchan ('Balladur's
bravura balancing act', December 11) is going to have a lasting impact on
British life. Rules, regulations and a deep, deep mistrust of the instincts
and passions of its own people are part of the French tradition.
It is interesting to see how the present-day nation of France was composed.
Independent or semi-independent states, Normandy, Brittany, Languedoc,
Burgundy, were gradually added to the core state, which was the region
around Paris. After the revolution, under various republics, local languages
were forbidden or heavily discouraged. The importance and unity of the
French state as well as the superiority and vocation universelle of French
civilisation were and are strongly emphasised in school textbooks.
The French elite, whether inclined to the right or to the left, are
completely impregnated with this traditon. They feel, instinctively, that a
similar process will be repeated in the creation of the European state. They
have never been encouraged to understand other traditions and ways of doing
things, only the superiority of their own culture and history.
People like Jacques Delors, Francois Mitterrand, and also Edouard Balladur
and Alain Juppe only see Europe in terms of their own history. All this is
understandable, but as the bureaucracy at Brussels is dominated by the
French, their highly centralised vision of a future Europe should be taken
very seriously.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Closing the yawning gap in seasonal
generosity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STEWART PROSSER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your Observer column, under the headline 'Changing places' (December
20), kindly made note of Chase's unprecedented seasonal gesture of an extra
day's holiday and Dollars 300 for all 34,000 staff worldwide.
However, comparing this generosity with that of the recent Goldman Sachs
bonuses is a slight case of apples and oranges. Chase's 'thank you' for a
remarkable year is, in fact, in addition to the performance-related bonuses
the bank will be paying at all levels.
If this really is, as you said, a 'symbol of the yawning gap between
commercial and investment banks' then reaction to it here certainly suggests
it is one that the investment banks might well consider closing.

The term 'directed by Ken Campbell' is in theory relative and in practice
absolutely chaotic in the Battersea Arts Centre's Christmas show, Beauty and
the Beast. There is little evidence of Campbell's own brand of strategic
lunacy. But it has moments of glorious fun all its own.
Of course there is no plot, and only a stab at continuity. The performers
(Chris Lynam, Kate McKenzie, Berny Richards and Kevin Sargent) are uncertain
about when the show begins, but this is probably when a box of beach is
dragged across the stage; or when it ends, possibly when the audience starts
heckling over the fate of a watch smashed in one of Lynam's non-magic
tricks.
Each actor tries a variety of roles, with Lynam roaming around like a
night-club compere high on drugs. Opposite him the silver-voiced McKenzie
sings as a chanteuse, Carmen, a figurehead on a ship's prow, and as a club
duettist with Lynam in 'Stars Fell on Alabama', the show's closing number
during which the credits are held up on cardboard flaps.
But to reach the nirvana of the ending, what trials have we to suffer? Lynam
plunges the action into chaos by his virtuoso unpredictability. His first
entrance as a gibbering figure of anger gives way to his second, crabwise in
a cardboard bicycle box. The other performers (and Richards takes the prize
for versatility as a maid, delivery boy, deep sea fish and Russian acrobat)
should be straighter against Lynam's madness, but still sustain the fiction
of each unconnected scene.
In a show of this sort, the audience has to assert itself, join in, play
along, shout out, interrupt and give the performers back some of the madness
they have been dishing out. Passivity means discomfort.
At the start of the second half, Lynam skims a washing bowl into the
audience, urging us to throw it to each other; 'I invented the game myself,'
he boasts.
He has already blindfolded a volunteer and put her on a swing which whisks
her, screaming, up above the stage while he smashes her watch down below.
She is then asked to hold the scenery for the next scene, a tender deep-sea
romance.
Of course there is an escaped German gorilla, a sailing tableau that evolves
into a French cafe song, and some wonderful kitchen sink drama which erupts
into domestic violence, shootings and pulped melons. The pantomime horse is
part-naked, and a Beatnik painting scene collapses when Lynam removes his
clothes, rolls in the paint and, Tarzan-like, propels himself at the canvas.
The show runs until December 23. It is the nuttiest thing I have seen this
year, and manages to combine genuine talent with specious nonsense. It takes
risks and is a challenge to see. Not for children or Rolex wearers.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Arts: Romantic comedy dealt a heavy hand / Review of
Smetana's 'The Two Widows' at the Coliseum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For anyone who loves Smetana's fifth opera as much as I do, and who was
looking forward to its first professional mounting in London as much as I
was, the actuality may well be classified the number one operatic
disappointment of 1993. At the Coliseum on Monday The Two Widows - a
light-as-air romantic comedy with a treasure trove of melodies, a spring in
its heel and a loving heart - emerged horribly overblown. It seemed cruelly
weighed down by garish production, lumpen, out-of-balance conducting, and a
fatal determination to blow up a small-house confection into the ENO's
house-filling Seasonal Sizzler.
At the heart of the performance there struggles an interestingly cast
central trio - Marie McLaughlin as the land-owning widow Karolina,
Anne-Marie Owens as her cousin, the sad, self- repressing widow Anezka, and
David Rendall as Ladislav, secret object of Anezka's affections, whose ruse
to gain admittance to Karolina's estate is the hinge on which the
drawing-room comedy plot turns. Their grasp of roles and music seemed on
Monday already honourably tenacious, in spite of all the hazards thrown in
their way by Adam Fischer's woefully lax baton beat and the keep-it-moving
exertions of David Pountney's insensitively boisterous staging.
Later in the run they may well succeed in establishing even more firmly the
characters and the situations. For the rest - well, autopsy could be thought
more in order than conventional criticism. The sharpest blow seems to have
been directed to the heart of the score, for in the right, sympathetic
circumstances Smetana's flexibility of form, rhythm, instrumentation and
vocal writing can be heard and seen to mirror the plot shifts of atmosphere
and mood with delicious, heart-lifting ease.
Crudely blared out by the ENO orchestra, whose brass appeared on Monday to
be having a communal off-night, the quicksilver sonorities swiftly turned
leaden - and, in all-too-exact parallel, the gentle heartbeat of an opera
about bruised adults learning to love again simply got smothered.
The point needs to be underlined: The Two Widows is a small-house opera, and
its transfer to a Coliseum-sized theatre is fraught with risk. During the
interval more than one voice could be heard sadly recalling the precise
pleasures, festive merriments and tender emotions of the 1978 production in
the tiny theatre at Wexford. That was staged by - good heavens, can it
really have been the same David Pountney now responsible for this
poster-paint-coloured knees-up, in sets by Mark Thompson that effect an
unholy alliance between GMTV notions of design and a cut-price provincial
revival of Oklahoma?
We all know that Pountney's light touch deserted him during his long stint
as ENO director of productions; we have grim memories of Orpheus in the
Underworld (to name only a single instance) to draw on in support of that
sad assertion. Even so, how is it possible that a man capable of proclaiming
with such warmth the qualities of the work in this month's issue of Opera
(and capable of translating it into English with such a deft command of
rhyming patter), should then coarsen his affections so pitilessly in the
theatre?
Oh dear. On Monday neither Miss Owens (a sumptuous mezzo of wit and
disciplined stage style) nor Mr Rendall (a tenor with a bright ring to his
top notes) proved always able to strike the centre of their notes with
unfailing aim - the uneasy atmosphere of a difficult first night must no
doubt bear much of the responsibility. But already the sense of their
characters' complex relationship was being communicated with a true, sure
touch.
Miss McLaughlin has to struggle a good deal harder with a Merry Widow
characterisation of the free-spirited Karolina which is in danger of
rendering the singer's bounteous natural charms hard, forced and irritating.
She must also beware of the neo-Schwarzkopf mannerisms (in particular a
heavy reliance on 'white', whisked-away high phrases) that do duty for
spontaneous command of the music. More matter, less art, please: even in
these depressing circumstances a performer so fully equipped for a role must
be encouraged to work much less hard.
ENO at the London Coliseum, WC2. Co-production with Welsh National and
sponsored by Guinness plc. In repertory until January 20

FT  22 DEC 93 / Arts: The Tale of Tsar Saltan - Opera in Berlin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While fairy tales have become a welcome part of the Christmas diet for
British opera companies, most German theatres are too blinkered to venture
beyond Hansel und Gretel. That may explain why Rimsky-Korsakov's The Tale of
Tsar Saltan has been so well received at the Komische Oper in Berlin. With
its Cinderella-like characters and exotic musical pictures, Tsar Saltan
deserves to be better known. This was its Berlin premiere.
Like so much of the Komische Oper's repertory, the work was performed in a
'Neufassung' - in other words, it was doctored to suit the way Harry Kupfer
wanted to stage it. Tsar Saltan emerged mercifully unscathed. Kupfer cut
some of the obscure corners of a circuitous plot, but otherwise preserved
its charm and humour.
Reinhart Zimmermann's decor captured the stuffy, snowy atmosphere of the
Tsar's court as effectively as the sunny freedom of the paradise to which
the heroine Militrisa and her son Guidon were banished. Reinhard Heinrich's
costumes were colour-coded - pink and purple for the court, blue and green
for the desert island - which made their coming together for the final scene
a visual symbol of harmony. The production was naive in the best sense of
the word.
Sabine Passow was the blonde and gracious Militrisa, Donald George a
bright-eyed, bright-voiced tenor prince. Hans-Martin Nau's dopey Tsar made
up in blundering comedy what he lacked in largesse. The company showed off
its depth and experience in the ensemble scenes, but some parts - notably
the Swan-Princess - were poorly sung. One expects as much at the Komische
Oper, where dramatic expression has always been more highly prized than
musical purity. What was not expected was the quality of orchestral playing
under the young Australian conductor Simone Young. The audience loved every
minute. And so did I.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Arts: Today's Television

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In The LSO Sibelius Cycle Colin Davis conducts Rakastava, and then the 4th
symphony followed by the 2nd: essence of pine trees and fiords for an hour
and three quarters (7.30 Radio 3). If you also happen to admire Tina Turner
(it is hard not to, given the way she reconstructed her life after the break
from her violent husband, and turned herself into one of the world's most
successful solo rock stars) then you can switch to Channel 4 at 9.00 for The
Complete Story Of Tina Turner.
Best things yet about Ben Elton's apocalyptic environmental thriller Stark
are the hippy Vietnam vets Walter and Zimmerman, a couple of 20th century
musketeers who seem equally expert on dope and ballistic missile technology.
Today's final episode is going to have to be awfully good, though, if it is
to save the entire venture (9.25 BBC2).
Good to see that the 'Christmas Special' edition of Michael Aitkens'
excellent comedy, Waiting For God, is only half an hour as usual: those
stretched episodes are usually a disaster (9.30 BBC1).

FT  22 DEC 93 / Arts: It is all a question of taste - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Poor little French television producers and film directors: great big Yankee
bullies are forcing unwilling Frenchmen to sit down and watch Hill Street
Blues and coralling them into cinemas to watch Basic Instinct when all they
really wanted to do, left to their own devices, was luxuriate in French
television's literary marathon Apostrophe and watch exciting Jean Luc Godard
films? There there. Never mind, the exclusion of film and television
programmes from the new Gatt agreement will no doubt enable you to put a
stop to all that. If by some wild chance it does not, and your fellow
countrymen wilfully persist in watching Miami Vice and Terminator Treize you
will just have to pass a few laws banning Hitchcock movies and rationing
viewers to one American sitcom a week. To ensure they are doing as they are
told you may need to install home monitoring devices to watch all viewers as
they view. You could call this 'Grand Frere'.
Can there really be anybody in France, even the most heavily bearded,
thickly tweed jacketed, Gitane smoking director of art house movies, who
seriously believes that you can legislate for taste? Or is the idea to build
a cultural Berlin Wall to restrict the French to French culture and stop
them being seduced by another, more attractive? To ask such sarcastic
questions is not to imply that Shane is 'better' than The Three Musketeers
(though that is not inconceivable) or that The Golden Girls is superior to .
. . well, whatever the French equivalent may be. Significantly the French
equivalent has not exactly taken the world by storm, though that is not
because other countries have erected tariff barriers to exclude French
comedy. The sarcasm is prompted by the bizarre sight (whoops, sorry, cannot
have French words invading the English language - the peculiar sight) of an
ancient European culture attempting, at the end of the 20th century, to use
tariff barriers to stop its people experiencing a newer, younger, culture
which is seen to be (presumably, otherwise why all the anxiety?) more
powerful and more popular.
None of which is to deny sympathy for the protectionists' object; only for
their methods. Of course any intelligent viewer wants to see preserved and
even extended that part of the culture which is full of insight, beauty,
truth, enlightenment, joy, curiosity, revelation, and artistic sensibility
and not merely that which is entertaining, scandalous or shocking. Anyone
living in the UK, and especially in the capital city, during the past year
must have noticed the signs that, at least as far as television is
concerned, Britain is drifting, or perhaps steaming, in a similar direction.
Programmes on the ITV network in general and on Carlton, the new London
weekday station in particular, have been not so much slipping down market as
galloping. The network which used to bring us such serious current affairs
series as First Tuesday, This Week and Viewpoint now brings us The Big
Story, Blues And Twos ('See the old lady trapped under the lorry] Hear her
whimper]') and Hollywood Women which might have been better entitled
Hollywood Boobs.
It would be absurd to suggest that everything appearing on the old ITV was
magnificent and everything appearing on the new version is appalling. For
years the old ITV got away with screening Crossroads not once but twice and
even three times a week. Much of the embarrassing rubbish they show today
was developed under the old system: Blind Date, Beadle's About, Prisoner
Cell Block H and much more. Conversely, some of the programmes shown by ITV
in the past 12 months, whether from long established series or new ones,
have been excellent. The drama series that has just finished, All Or Nothing
At All, about a City charmer who tries to make others happy by providing 100
per cent per annum interest for his friends and colleagues, and then blows
all their investments on the horses was, by any reckoning, impressive.
Cracker was outstanding. A recent report by Trevor Phillips in The London
Programme, about black people systematically defrauding the social services,
and organised corruption among blacks in local government, was astonishing.
Had it been made by a white man it would never have been screened. Phillips
is a brave man.
But whatever the exceptions they are memorable because they do prove the
rule: that whereas the people in ITV used to be interested in competing with
the BBC for kudos as well as audiences, today their eyes are fixed
unswervingly on the ratings. Once upon a time when the BBC rejected The
Naked Civil Servant, declaring it untransmittable, Carlton's predecessor,
Thames TV, commissioned the drama and won worldwide admiration and shelves
full of awards. It is inconceivable that Carlton would do the same today:
even if someone inside the company recognised the quality and wanted to
commission the programme, the risk (which is to say the chance of failing to
make a large profit) would be too great. This indicates a radical and sad
change, due almost entirely to Thatcherite broadcasting legislation.
Tell that to today's ITV executives and they run their thumbs down the backs
of their Armani lapels, smile (you may say 'sneer' but I could not possibly
comment) and tell you that they simply do not make programmes for television
critics any more. This is their way of agreeing that considerations of
quality and prestige have now gone by the board and ratings are indeed the
sole criterion. And why is that? For a while they will try to maintain that
their only aim is to satisfy the largest possible number of viewers, but
later in the evening, when they become honest, they will admit that all that
really counts is making the largest possible amount of money. And why not?
Do not grocers and hairdressers maximise profits by satisfying as many
people as possible? Of course . . . as do drug dealers and prostitutes.
Perish the thought that one should compare ITV executives to such people,
but the idea that they are culturally neutral suppliers of services like
grocers or hairdressers is disingenuous.
Perhaps it does not matter; perhaps such a change is desirable. Rupert
Murdoch and others have always claimed that too many of the programmes on
British television, so obviously a mass medium, are made by middle class
trendies for middle class trendies. If ITV as a federal network (even though
it still includes companies such as Granada where quality counts for a lot)
continues to jettison its old high quality series and goes all out instead
for ratings using scandal, hypnosis shows, cringe-telly, ambulance chasing,
and big breasts, why should that matter? In a sense it does not. We tolerate
vulgar trash in newspapers, books, music and most areas of our culture and
nobody assumes that the hideous rubbish which comprises so much popular
music will somehow destroy Verdi operas or Beethoven symphonies. In this we
seem to differ from the French.
The important thing, surely, is to see that the cultural influences
available to us are wide ranging. The danger is that television is a very
young medium, still developing, and has not yet escaped from government
control. The baby could be lost with the bath water. So long as we continue
to have the BBC providing a full range of programmes, including those of
very high quality, perhaps it does not matter if ITV lowers its sights and
throws in its lot with the comics, paperbacks and pop concerts which
constitute so much of mass culture. It would certainly be both pathetic and
patronising to attempt to legislate for public taste a la Francais. But we
should be open and honest about what is happening. If ITV moves off
determinedly down market, so be it. We should note the move, plot it with
care, and take greater trouble than ever to sustain the BBC.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Business and the Environment: Wood out of waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SPARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you eat a hamburger at McDonald's, you could be sitting at a table made
partly from waste polystyrene packaging and throwaway razors. Brothers
Andrew and Robert Billson have developed a process in the UK for blending
polystyrene wastes to make a hardwood substitute ready for immediate use
without further machining. McDonald's and the Alton Towers amusement park
are among their first customers.
The Billsons have cracked one of the main problems of recycling: how to
achieve a product valuable enough to cover the costs. Their Durawood sells
at a price comparable with that of hardwood after finishing. It never needs
painting, does not rot and resists insects.
Robert Billson, who took a degree in recycling, likens their
polystyrene-blending process to those he used when making alloys for cars
and aircraft from waste metal at the original Billson family company.
Andrew Billson was a shipwright's apprentice, before managing the fitting
out of shops, restaurants and the Heathrow Penta hotel. After coming across
some plastic wood made from polystyrene and using it to construct a picnic
table, he asked Robert to join him in setting up Savewood Products which is
based on the Isle of Wight.
Polystyrene in its crude state is denser than water, and pentane, an
inflammable gas, has widely been used to reduce its density. The Billsons
looked for something safer and found an agent which generates carbon
dioxide. As the plastic is drawn through an extruder to form lengths, carbon
dioxide bubbles inside are stretched, so they resemble the vessels in wood
and give a graining effect.
Wood made from polystyrene requires flame retardants, usually including
poisonous antimony trioxide, but the Billsons again found a safer
substitute. They also decided to colour their wood with iron oxide, rather
than organic or cadmium dyes.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Business and the Environment: Roll your dice, save the
planet - Victoria Griffith unwraps some ecological board games in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the presents and Christmas pudding, environmental concerns may be far
from the thoughts of most holiday revellers - unless, of course, some
well-meaning gift-giver has placed an ecological board game under the tree.
In that case, the dilemmas of pollution may soon be bearing down over an
after-dinner game.
A simple roll of the dice in Pollution Solution, an ecological board game
for adults, could land a player in a tough spot. 'Farmers use electricity
from coal to run irrigation equipment,' reads one card ominously. The player
has to guess the solution printed on the back, which suggests that farmers
use windmill power instead.
Dozens of ecological board games are appearing in US toy and hobby shops,
and many are big sellers. Family Pastimes, a Canadian group which makes A
Beautiful Place, says it can hardly keep up with orders. Other manufacturers
include Aristoplay, Family Games and Ravensburg, a German-based group.
The names of the games are certainly catchy - Colourful Kingdom, Feeding
Frenzy, and Bottles &amp; Bins to name a few. Because the stated goal of the
games is to teach children and adults about the environment  - while having
fun, of course - the manufacturers have some clear messages to pass on. Most
of the games assure consumers that recycled materials were used 'wherever
possible'.
Many of the games are 'co-operative', meaning no one can lose - or win,
depending on how you look at it. 'When we recycle, everyone wins,' says the
box of the recycling game Bottles &amp; Bins. A Beautiful Place is more
sensational: 'Players work together, not against each other to restore
beauty. Can they do it before the looming Dark Clouds surround our special
Beautiful Place?'
A Beautiful Place has players clear away a Gotham-like drawing of a city,
piece by polluted piece. The players get points for good deeds, such as
turning off electric lights, planting a tree, or using public transport.
Feeding Frenzy tries to increase awareness about endangered sharks by
turning the players into sharks. There is no doubt who's the bad guy.
Players lose points based on scenarios such as: 'Humans hunt you for meat,
shark fin soup, oil, leather, and sometimes just for sport,' or: 'Toxic
Waste] Chemicals dumped by humans kill your prey.'
Humans do have an occasional soft spot: 'Humans lure you close by throwing
fresh meat overboard. You end up starring in a nature film. Congratulations]
You win five points.'
Some games may be guilty of over-simplifying environmental issues. Problem
26 of Pollution Solution, for instance, reads: 'Leaky faucets (taps) and
running toilets waste energy.' The easy answer? 'Residents fix plumbing.' Or
take Problem 12, which says: 'This section is overpopulated. Risks to
environment and health.' Solution? 'Couples agree to have no more than two
children.'
Players may take exception to manufacturers' opinions. One five-year-old
playing Colourful Kingdom, made by Family Games of Quebec, was disturbed at
the classification of a penguin as a 'water animal'.
It may be no coincidence that most of the games are aimed at youngsters.
Children seem especially receptive to the games, maybe because they can
blithely ignore the underlying political issues. After a lively game of
Bottles &amp; Bins, in which children try to sort plastic bottles, food waste
and other items into the appropriate recycling containers, I saw a group of
children sit through a lecture on the difficulties of battery recycling only
to return blissfully to their battery-operated toys.
If the game doesn't make the point, you can always recycle the wrapping
paper. A childrens' paper recycling kit is another best seller this
Christmas.

<TEXT>
Ian Plaistowe, a senior partner with accountants Arthur Andersen, is to
become chairman of the Auditing Practices Board, the standards-setting body
for auditors.
He will take over in April next year from Bill Morrison, who retired
recently as deputy chairman of KPMG Peat Marwick. Michael Boyd, a partner
with Ernst &amp; Young, is also resigning as vice chairman of the APB at the
same time, and will be replaced by Ian Percy, a partner with Grant Thornton.
Michael Chamberlain, chairman of the Consultative Committee of Accountancy
Bodies, which funds the APB, says he sees two roles for Plaistowe: 'The
first is to continue its programme of revising and tightening up existing
auditing standards and guidelines; the second is to look forward and deal
with the expectations and issues of the future.'

<TEXT>
Stockbroker Graham Ross Russell, 60, who has been associated with media
group EMAP since the early 1960s, is to hand over the chairmanship to
Burton's chairman Sir John Hoskyns, 66, at the start of EMAP's financial
year next April.
It is over a year since Ross Russell, who has been chairman since 1990,
announced that he was looking for a successor. 'My real love is medium and
small companies,' says Ross Russell, who joined the board of Emap when it
was making profits of just Pounds 150,000.
He has not said whether he will retire from the EMAP board but indicates
that he does not think it is a good idea for ex-chairmen to remain,
especially when they had been on the board for 23 years.
Ross Russell says Sir John has been picked partly for his knowledge of large
companies, which he acquired during his stint as director general of the
Institute of Directors, and for his City connections. He is a director of
Clerical Medical &amp; General Life Assurance.
Although Sir John is reasonably old to be taking on another non-executive
chairmanship, Ross Russell says he 'does not act or appear his age'. Sir
John will be expected to spend 'one or two days' a week on EMAP business.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Business and the Environment: Ripples stir the green breeze
 -Blight on the countryside or important renewable energy source? / A look
at wind farms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MARTINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Bernard Ingham, Lady Thatcher's former press officer at Number 10, has
found a new role in retirement: as opponent of the growing fashion for wind
farms. These 'bog-brushes', he says, are 'creating a blight on the British
countryside for next to nothing'.
Earlier this month, Sir Bernard attended the first national meeting of
Country Guardians, a group which he helped to set up to co-ordinate local
opposition to wind farms. He says reports from local chairmen revealed 'an
advancing rash of wind farms right across the country, an horrendous picture
of visual intrusion in areas of outstanding natural beauty'.
Country Guardians aims to increase public awareness about the 'danger' of
this form of renewable energy. It wants to stop 'brainwashed' local
authorities giving developers the go-ahead and the government from providing
this 'sop to the greens', says Sir Bernard, who is a public relations
adviser to the nuclear power industry.
He claims to see the first signs of success. Last month, a Welsh Office
inspector rejected an appeal for a wind farm on Anglesey. That decision,
made partly on the grounds of visual impact, is the first rejection of an
appeal by a government office.
John Gummer, the environment secretary, has so far overturned four decisions
taken by local planning authorities against wind farms. Another six are on
appeal. Policy planning guidelines (PPG) produced by the Department of the
Environment, assert a presumption in favour of wind farm developments. PPG
22 is the tool with which local planning authorities are being
'brainwashed', according to Sir Bernard. But the DoE has no plans to update
the guidelines, issued in February this year.
The development of wind farms received a big boost last July when Tim Eggar,
energy minister, announced the third in the government's series of Non
Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) Renewables Orders which provide subsidies for
renewable energy forms. The first two in 1990 and 1991, allowed for 58 wind
farms. But where these provided subsidies for eight years, the third extends
them to 20 years.
The NFFOs support the government's aim of achieving 1,500MW of renewable
electricity generating capacity by 2000, and of reducing carbon dioxide
emissions in line with last year's Earth Summit commitments.
Although support is given to the industry on the understanding that prices
will come down as technology is developed, the advantages for developers are
substantial. The November deadline for applications for the third NFFO order
attracted what the Non Fossil Fuel Purchasing Agency chief executive, David
Walton, calls a 'great deal of interest'. Almost three times as many
projects applied for funding than under the previous NFFO order.
However, Sir Bernard and his colleagues may be able to draw comfort from the
fact that some environmental groups are also beginning to express qualms
about the pace of developments. At the end of November, the Campaign for the
Protection of Rural Wales, alarmed at an escalating number of applications
for wind farms on Welsh hillsides, called for a moratorium on all future
schemes until 'wind power generation is proven to be cost-effective'. In
future, it will oppose all wind farms in Wales.
Friends of the Earth, a firm supporter of wind energy in principle, has
criticised developers for their lack of sensitivity to local people's
feelings. The group is to issue guidelines before the end of the year
highlighting the importance of early consultation.
Signs that this opposition has penetrated government circles came when Eggar
opened Britain's largest wind farm at Cold Northcott, Cornwall, last month.
He used the occasion to 'clarify' the government's position on targets.
'The government does not have a specific target for wind energy, and its
success will depend on developers finding sites acceptable to the public and
to planning authorities,' he said. 'NFFO does not override the planning
process and government is concerned as much about the local environment as
the global one. The planning guidance in PPG 22 requires planners to balance
the government's policies for renewables with those of the countryside.'
A DTI strategy document on renewable energy was due to be published before
the end of this year, though it has now been delayed. It will be the first
such document since the influential report of the government's Renewable
Energy Advisory Group last year. A DTI spokesman said the document would not
represent any dramatic shift in policy. 'We don't need to radically change
our policy because of opposition because we have always said that the
go-ahead for developments is dependent on the relevant planning permission,'
he said.
A substantial test of government policy is a proposed wind farm at Humble
Hill in Tyneside, 13 kms from the historically important Hadrian's Wall. The
scheme will involve up to 267 turbines with a capacity of 80MW, above the
50MW threshold which requires specific approval from the DTI.
Michael Jefferson, director of the British Energy Association, the trade
group for the UK energy industry, is urging a more cautious approach by
developers. In a speech to the British Wind Energy Association's annual
conference in October, he said: 'My underlying worry is that if accelerated
development of wind energy is to be maintained, and in a manner consistent
with broad environmental principles, then the industry and the nation cannot
afford to have two or three apples which threaten the larger crop.
'There is a risk that a few unwise schemes may provoke a backlash and
undermine the pace of sounder developments.' He singled out Humble Hill as a
project that was unacceptable in terms of visual intrusion and other
interference.
But developers disagree that wind farm applications are being rushed
through. The Humble Hill developers, Trigen (a consortium of EcoGen Ltd, Sea
West of the US and Tomen of Japan), held a month-long exhibition and various
local meetings to raise public awareness in the area.

FT  22 DEC 93 / People: Law Debenture's new chairman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
John Kennedy, 59, who will shortly step down as senior partner of Allen &amp;
Overy, is to take over as chairman of the Law Debenture Corporation, which
owns Britain's biggest independent corporate trustee business.
Kennedy, who has been a partner of Allen &amp; Overy for over 30 years, replaces
Raymond Cazalet, on the board for 20 years, and chairman for the past two.
Law Debenture, founded in 1889 by a group of prominent businessmen,
politicians and lawyers, is an unusual City animal. It is a small but
successful investment trust, managed by Michael Moule, which also owns a
corporate trustee operation which competes with big international banks such
as JP Morgan.
Cazalet, like his predecessor, Sir Anthony Touche, came from the investment
trust side of the business. However, the choice of Kennedy, senior partner
of one of Britain's most profitable law firms, suggests that Law Debenture
is keen to develop the trustee side of its business. It services over 1,800
issues with a nominal value of over Pounds 90bn and caters for over 700
banks and companies in over 50 countries.
Christopher Duffett, Law Debenture's managing director, says he was keen to
recruit a well known City figure who was familiar with Law Debenture's
business. The new chairman has many years' experience of the domestic and
international capital markets and also knows about the problems and
difficulties of running a people-based business.
Kennedy, who has recently joined the Securities and Investments Board, is
following in the footsteps of one of the founders of Allen &amp; Overy, George
Allen, who was also chairman of Law Debenture. He says Law Debenture's big
attraction over other corporate trustees was its unmistakeable independence.
'You do not have a conflict of interest when making a decision.'
Rob Williams, who has recently retired as a partner of Linklater &amp; Paines,
has joined the board as an executive director, replacing Clive Rumbelow, a
former partner of Slaughter &amp; May.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Management: Programmed for success - So you're thinking of
taking part in a business broadcast? Simon Ellis offers some guidance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When sizing up a possible appearance on a business programme there are four
important things you need to know: What is the audience? How big a ration of
airtime are you likely to get? How much of your time is going to be taken up
by filming/recording? And to what extent are the journalists/producers known
for putting their slant on the programme, giving interviewees a rough ride,
and heavy editing?
Broadly there are two types of factual programme. First there are the daily
news-driven variety which set out to report what is happening, offer
succinct analysis and look forward to what may be about to happen. Second,
there are weekly current affairs, documentary and investigative programmes
which often set out either to prove a thesis, make a point or nail a
villain.
The first may seem more enticing, but just because a programme appears
hard-hitting it does not mean you should avoid it. Also, satellite channels
should not be overlooked. They have lots of airtime needing to be filled
cheaply and are keen to get established in the potentially lucrative
business market.
Producers therefore need to persuade well-known business figures to be
interviewed reasonably often - . they cannot afford to upset interviewees by
roughing them up. Their lean resources mean they have to move quickly -
inconveniencing you less - and they lack time to attempt any severe editing.
The following, read in conjunction with the table, is a personal rating of
the best-known business broadcast slots.
MONEY PROGRAMME (BBC2). Its line will generally have been decided before
filming and, if necessary, will have been approved higher up the BBC's
editorial chain.
It is essential to be clear about exactly what story they are telling before
deciding whether to take part. Also, be clear about your role in the plot:
are you Expert? Pundit/Critic? Victim/Loser? Target/Baddie/Aggressor?
Running a stopwatch over two recent programmes showed that 14 of the 25
interviews lasted 30 seconds or less. In contrast, the reporter was speaking
for roughly 60-70 per cent of the report.
Bear in mind that the Money Programme, like other BBC current affairs
programmes, may consume much time in fixing locations and interviews. On the
plus side, it has the biggest UK audience for a business programme (1.3m
viewers). It is also the most upmarket of all BBC Television News and
Current Affairs programmes, beating Newsnight and Panorama with an audience
which is 26 per cent AB.
INVESTIGATIVE PROG-RAMMES, such as Watchdog and Checkpoint, are often fairly
entertainment driven. They need a strong storyline and preferably a clear
baddie to keep ratings and budget high. The higher the entertainment factor
and the stronger the goodies and baddies element, the more careful you must
be.
There is a built-in tendency to see things from the standpoint of the
consumer underdog rather than the corporate fat cat.
BUSINESS BREAKFAST (BBC1). Criticised for too many features, not enough City
news and too small an audience (average 300,000 at any moment), the show is
nevertheless beamed to Europe and Asia on World Service Television's growing
business output. Interviews are sometimes repackaged for later WSTV business
bulletins if relevant to overseas viewers.
You can expect a much better airtime ration than on the Money Programme. The
most benign slot is the chatty review of the business pages which normally
includes two appearances of up to three minutes each. Other items are of
similar length. Interviewing style is a mixture of chatty and formal, and
all straight down the line.
FINANCIAL WORLD TONIGHT (BBC Radio 4). The late transmission time limits the
audience (250,000), while the length (14 minutes) limits the number of
reports.
But the programme does offer the most comprehensive roundup of the day's UK
business news on British airwaves. It is a news-driven programme which does
not impose its own slant on events. Many reports use just a couple of clips.
Straight interviews last 2-3 minutes.
IN BUSINESS (BBC Radio 4). This programme has found that there is a craving
for coverage of management issues, trends and fads. It steers clear of the
City and economics and concentrates on the nuts and bolts of being in
business.
The programme is good at listening to interviewees and gives them time to
develop their point.
It gets a very good response from its audience (500,000 on Wednesday and
Sunday combined) - with up to 1,500 letters and 300-400 requests for tapes
and transcripts each time.
MONEY BOX (BBC Radio 4). This long running personal finance programme -
audience 750,000 - has a clearly established remit to provide independent
advice about savings, investment, tax and benefits.
It approaches from the consumer's point of view so expect tough but fair
questioning if your charges or products are under fire from customers. Most
straight interviews last two to three minutes.
WORLD BUSINESS REPORT (BBC World Service Radio). The audience is motley but
massive (120m). Popular in those parts of the developing world where
domestic broadcasting is state-controlled or newspapers are slow to arrive.
This is a fast-moving 24-hour operation pumping out three ten-minute
programmes of business and market news plus shorter bulletins in the main
World Service News Programmes. The World Service is justifiably renowned for
impartiality and accuracy.
THE NAMES AND THEIR COMPANIES (LBC). Chairmen or chief executives (no junior
ranks) can expect an unrivalled opportunity to talk at length (15-18
minutes) about their company in relaxed fashion, but to a relatively small
audience (30,000-35,000).
SKY NEWS. Most of its business slots last between three and six minutes.
Interviewees' clips generally last 15-20 seconds, although economists and
analysts can expect up to 2 1/2 minutes to foreshadow the day. Most
interviews are on location.
WORLD BUSINESS REPORT. (BBC World Service TV). A 26-minute flagship
programme, claiming the most comprehensive global audience, including
President Yeltsin's economic adviser. Produced by the team which puts out
BBC Business Breakfast, the approach is similar although the perspective is
more international.
EUROPEAN BUSINESS TODAY, FT REPORTS, WEST OF MOSCOW (all FTTV). All three
are unashamedly international with a European flavour. They are interested
only in big multinationals, especially the leading European players. There
is less original shooting and heavier reliance on relatively long
interviews.
WORLD BUSINESS TODAY (CNN International). Two pacey half-hour roundups of
the financial market from a US perspective. Claims one in three European
business executives watch at least once a week.

programme. He now heads the London-based media training consultancy Studio

FT  22 DEC 93 / Management: Doctrines to salve corporate souls - Tim Dickson
considers the Christian view of modern business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Commercial interest in one of the most important Christian festivals reaches
fever pitch this week. But turning the spotlight the other way, what about
the Christian view of modern business?
This issue was addressed last month in a lecture to the Christian
Association of Business Executives by the Reverend Jack Mahoney, professor
of business ethics and corporate responsibility at the London Business
School.
Mahoney argued that Christian beliefs underpin a variety of attitudes, but
that giving 'due weight' to all of them permits encouragement for what
business is capable of doing, tempered by criticism and impatience for what
it is not doing, or doing to an insufficient degree. He outlined several
ways - among them ethical shopping and whistle-blowing - in which Christians
can promote business conduct in accordance with their values and principles.
To a large extent, Mahoney explained, Christian attitudes reflect the
emphasis individuals put on the four leading doctrines of Creation, Sin,
Salvation and Completion.
Traditional beliefs about death, judgment, heaven and hell, for example,
have often turned people's attention to the future and to the way in which
God will bring human history to 'completion'. This has led some Christians
to regard with suspicion, or at least moral reserve, all secular or worldly
activities, including business and the enterprise of wealth creation.
Completion admittedly took on a more dynamic expression with the development
of Christian political theology in the 1950s, partly in dialogue with
post-war Marxism. Hope, as Mahoney put it, 'was no longer a sedative or
spiritual aspirin' but a prescription for working to enable all people to
live lives worthy of their destiny. Liberation theology was just one of
several social and religious movements to find inspiration in this approach,
betraying not so much hostility towards business as such as indignation at
the unrelieved plight of the world's poor.
Sin is seen by many Christians as the outstanding characteristic of society,
with life viewed as a series of spiritual pitfalls - nowhere more evident
than in the world of business. Mahoney, however, rejects this absolutist
view, suggesting that the denunciation of consumerism may 'conceal a deeper
suspicion of material creation which at times verges on the heretical in
Christian terms'. He says New Testament warnings against individual
accretion of wealth should be put in the context of early Christians' lack
of interest in social ethics. The Gospel, he adds, has nothing to say about
the spiritual and moral dangers arising from poverty.
It is the doctrines of Creation and Salvation, though, which Mahoney says
most effectively counter the stress put on the role of business as social
villain and exploiter. The theology of the former shows that 'wealth and
riches should not be considered demonic or evil, but as having a positive
and God-given social purpose in the continuing work of advancing human
society'. Salvation contributes 'a note of Christian optimism . . . a belief
that even given the influence of sin there remains a radical goodness about
creation'.
Turning to ethics, Mahoney examined the responsibility of the three big
stakeholders in business: customers, investors and workers. While not
aligning himself formally with the 'vigilante' consumer movement in the US,
he nevertheless stated that the 'socially responsible use' of personal or
family resources was a 'Christian way of using one's economic purchasing
power to influence markets and guide business'.
He said shareholders should see themselves as 'trustees of an organic
ongoing enterprise rather than simply as the absolute possessors of inert
property'.
Mahoney also urged labour to mobilise its influence and power on behalf of
other stakeholders. Whistle-blowing may popularly be equated with
disloyalty, but 'it expresses a wider loyalty to society'.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Education department shake-up announced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department for Education yesterday announced a package of radical
internal reforms aimed at answering the claims of rightwing educationalists
that national curriculum reforms have been sabotaged by civil servants.
Officials admitted that reforms had been 'bogged down in detail', and
restructuring would allow civil servants to discover more of what was
happening 'at the ground level and in the regions'.
The changes, which follow a review by the consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand,
will be backed up by replacement of the department's two most senior
personnel to allow more direct ministerial control. From the end of next
month the department will have both a new permanent secretary - after the
departure of Sir Geoffrey Holland to the University of Exeter - and a new
deputy secretary in charge of the sensitive issues of the national
curriculum, teacher-training, and teachers' pay.
Both appointments will be filled from outside the department, with Mr Peter
Owen moving from the Cabinet Office to take up the post as deputy secretary,
and Mr Tim Lankester moving from the Overseas Development Administration to
become permanent secretary.
Task forces will be created to tackle key issues, while officials will have
individual responsibilities for different regions.
Mr John Patten, the education secretary, said: 'The changes in the education
world mean that the department itself needs to be even more flexible and
responsive.'
Quangos have been created to cover grant-maintained schools, the curriculum,
further and higher education, student loans and teacher-training.
The Department for Education is also for the first time creating an
international relations branch. This will deal with the European Union,
which has an increasingly important role in education, and promote
educational exports on the international market.
Mr Tim Boswell, further and higher education minister, said that the UK was
attempting to boost exports by attracting foreign students and exporting
educational materials such as books and software.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Chief executive hails gamble that paid off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The consensus at the London headquarters of British Gas yesterday was that
the gamble of placing the company's future in the hands of the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission and the government had paid off.
Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive officer, said he 'felt totally vindicated
in having sought a broader MMC review' than proposed by the government.
He said the decisions by Mr Michael Heseltine not to break up the company
and to remove the company's mainly residential monopoly by 1998 would 'move
us forward towards longer-term regulatory stability and a balance of
interests between consumers, shareholders and employees'.
Fears of a competitive free-for-all in which British Gas would be left as a
supplier of last resort to unprofitable customers were swept away by Mr
Heseltine's insistence that all gas suppliers take on social obligations to
groups such as the disabled and elderly.
The seasonal display of goodwill at British Gas even extended to Ofgas, the
industry regulator. British Gas's senior management had engaged in a war of
words for much of the past 18 months with Mr James McKinnon, the previous
Ofgas director.
Relations with his successor, Ms Clare Spottiswoode, have clearly improved.
Both sides said yesterday they would work closely to iron out details of
British Gas's corporate restructuring and preparations for greater
competition.
Unresolved issues which will impinge heavily on British Gas's profitability
include the question of whether the formula for the maximum price rise
allowed should be relaxed. It is set at the retail prices index minus 5
percentage points, a level which British Gas says was appropriate for an
integrated company with a secure monopoly, not one facing a big
restructuring and early competition.
Changes in British Gas's corporate culture clearly influenced the thinking
of Ofgas and the government. Ms Spottiswoode said the rejection of the MMC's
recommendation of divestment was due in large part to 'rapid changes' in the
company's culture.
In his statement Mr Heseltine welcomed the corporate restructuring announced
last week. It will result in British Gas abandoning its traditional regional
structure in favour of five business units. These will focus on:
Gas transportation and storage.
Public gas supply to mainly residential customers.
Contract trading with large commercial users.
Installation and servicing of gas central heating.
Retailing.
The recent appointment as chairman of Mr Richard Giordano, the highly
regarded former chairman and chief executive of British Oxygen, also sent a
signal to the government and the City that British Gas was moving quickly
towards a more commercial culture.
The speed and enthusiasm with which that culture permeates the company will
be a big factor in preparing the company for future competition. It is
likely to be complicated by the company's need for a cost-cutting programme.
The DTI decision to opt for early competition puts additional pressure on
British Gas to develop non-regulated businesses, including its worldwide oil
and gas exploration and production division and Global Gas, which oversees
international distribution and power-generation projects.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Break-up of British Gas ruled out: DTI rejects two main
recommendations of Monopolies Commission report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision on British Gas yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and
industry secretary, means that he has rejected the two main recommendations
of August's Monopolies and Mergers Commission report - the first time he has
gone against the MMC in a significant inquiry.
He commended the commission on the 'high quality' of its reports, but made
it clear he disagreed with its analysis of the priorities in dealing with
the problem of British Gas's monopoly. He also felt a break-up of the
company was impractical and unnecessary.
Instead, he is proposing British Gas should have separate internal
businesses to overcome the conflict between its dual role as transporter and
trader of gas.
The MMC had said that true competition could never develop as long as
British Gas wielded such power over the market.
Mr Heseltine said: 'My view is that complete separation of the two
businesses within continued British Gas ownership is likely to be sufficient
to overcome the obstacle to competition which the MMC identified. I have
therefore decided not to require divestment.'
He was prepared, he said, to see how the restructuring on which British Gas
had already embarked would work. If it was unsatisfactory it would be up to
Ms Clare Spottiswoode, the gas regulator, to take appropriate action.
What seems to have tipped the balance against break-up is the speed with
which British Gas has changed since the MMC inquiry was launched more than a
year ago. As one person close to the decision said yesterday, the inquiry
was like 'a giant consultancy exercise' which forced British Gas to confront
tough issues and push through reforms in management and structure.
On the abolition of the monopoly, Mr Heseltine said he wanted a faster
timetable than that proposed by the MMC because of the government's strong
commitment to improving competition in gas supply. 'I am keen to make
further progress in reducing the monopoly as rapidly as possible. I do not
believe that the removal of the monopoly needs to be delayed as the MMC
envisaged.'
Ministers also wanted to get the gas market opened up at the same time as
electricity - in 1998. But a key point was that while independent companies
should be admitted to the franchise market, constraints on British Gas's
operations in the non-franchise market should also be removed.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
                     HESELTINE MAKES HIS CHOICE

MMC recommendation:                   Michael Heseltine's decision:

FT  22 DEC 93 / Net sales of unit trusts fall to Pounds 407m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Net sales of unit trusts in November dropped to Pounds 407m, the lowest
monthly figure this year, figures from the Association of Unit Trusts and
Investment Funds show.
The association said the drop was due to institutional holders, who
accounted for net repurchases of Pounds 43m. Retail demand, at around Pounds
450m of net sales, was still strong. The monthly figure still represented
the best November total since 1986 and net sales of trusts for the year, at
Pounds 8.2bn, are the best ever.
Investment trusts have also had their best year for raising new money. The
Association of Investment Trust companies said new issues had so far raised
nearly Pounds 1.49bn. The total reaches Pounds 2.19bn when the new Lloyd's
trusts are included.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Labour admits it held BNP inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Labour party was yesterday forced on to the defensive when it admitted
that its inquiry into the Tower Hamlets racism row had failed to identify
who had leaked 'inaccurate' canvass returns.
These had talked up the chances of the British National party winning the
recent by-election in the London borough. The party yesterday confirmed that
the Bow and Poplar branch, under instructions from the Greater London Labour
party, held an inquiry into the leaking of the canvass returns which failed
to identify the culprit.
Mr Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrats' campaign co-ordinator, asked why
the Labour inquiry had not been open and why its existence had been denied
by Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman.
Mr Straw recently said that Labour had had no internal inquiry because
'there was nothing to inquire into'.
However, Labour yesterday said there had been an inquiry into 'the
mechanisms of the campaign' which it said was different to the Liberal
Democrats' inquiry into racism.
The Liberal Democrats' inquiry recommended the expulsion of three party
members after controversial leaflets were published.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Lottery licence to be longer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Lottery licence has been extended by six months to a full seven
years to give whichever operator wins it a better chance of recovering the
money invested.
The change was made by Mr Peter Davis, director-general of the lottery, in
the formal application documents published yesterday.
In November Mr Davis said the licence would expire on March 31 2001, which
meant the licence would run for no more than 6 1/2 years because the winner
will probably not be chosen until next May and is unlikely to launch before
late 1994.
The licence will now run until September 30 2001, making it at least
possible that the licence will cover seven years.
Mr Davis also confirmed yesterday that he was giving applicants the right to
publish as much or as little about their applications as they wanted to.
'The level of interest in and enthusiasm for the National Lottery,
demonstrated by potential applicants and other interested parties has been
very encouraging,' Mr Davis said. Those interested in applying to run the
lottery must submit a letter of intent by January 14 and full bids by
February 14.
At least eight applications are expected from groups ranging from The Great
British Lottery Company, which includes Granada, to Camelot, a consortium
including Cadbury Schweppes, The Rank Organisation, and Mr Richard Branson's
UK Lottery Foundation.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The housing market has been subdued over recent weeks but is poised for
further recovery next year, a survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors of more than 120 estate agents has found, Andrew Taylor writes.
The institution said: 'Buyers were nervous in the run up to last month's
Budget and the market - in spite of some flurries of activity - remains
quiet in the approach to Christmas.' Although the market had improved in
1993 it was still being held back by too many sellers asking high prices.
Almost 85 per cent of agents reported that prices had remained static in the
past three months. Another 10 per cent reported price falls with just over 5
per cent reporting price increases.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Price Waterhouse wins deferment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Price Waterhouse, the former BCCI auditors, yesterday won a deferment,
probably into the next century, of a disciplinary inquiry by the Institute
of Chartered Accountants into its role in the bank's collapse, John Mason
writes.
Three Court of Appeal judges ruled unanimously that to allow the inquiry to
proceed while civil litigation against the firm by BCCI's liquidators was
continuing could cause substantial prejudice.
The court granted an order quashing a decision by Sir John Bailey, the
inquiry chairman, for the ICA's investigation to start immediately. It ruled
that the inquiry could not start until the end of the civil litigation. This
is not likely before 2000.
The liquidators are claiming damages for negligence in connection with the
1985, 1986 and 1987 audits. The claim in regard to the 1985 audit is for
more than Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.3bn).
Lord Justice Nolan said there was no urgency since there were no allegations
of misconduct and no questions about the firm's fitness to remain registered
auditors.

More than one in three of drivers' records and one in four of vehicle
records kept by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency are inaccurate, says
the National Audit Office.
A report published yesterday by the office adds, however, that a number of
the errors are 'relatively minor'.
Large trade users of the agency's data, such as the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders, are generally dissatisfied. The society said 3.6m
of the 34m vehicle records had wrong or missing information at the time of
the last vehicle census.
The audit office also consulted the agency's institutional and commercial
customers such as the associations of chief police officers. Eight of the 10
asked about driver data said they were satisfied or very satisfied while
five of the six consulted on vehicle data were satisfied.
The audit office was critical of the agency's failure to identify what level
of accuracy was required by its customers or assess the cost involved.
The agency deals with 12m driver and 60m vehicle transactions each year. It
employs 4,500 people.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Decision opens the way for independents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's decision opens the way for independent gas companies to enter
the domestic gas market, something they have been pressing to do for years.
'This is good news for all consumers across the country,' said Mr Peter
Bryant, deputy chairman of United Gas, the independent gas supplier which
had anticipated yesterday's developments by linking up with several regional
electricity companies to sell gas to private homes.
Mr Heseltine's proposals match almost exactly a blueprint that a group of
independent companies, including United Gas, put forward earlier this year
for a free market in gas, backed by promises that prices for consumers would
come down.
The trade and industry secretary has opted for abolishing British Gas's
monopoly rather than breaking it up, as recommended by the MMC. This means
independents will get into the market sooner. Mr Heseltine and Ms Clare
Spottiswoode, the gas regulator, are also proposing a relatively free
regulatory regime, with independent companies defining their own geographic
markets.
Any aspiring gas supplier will be able to apply for a licence to serve an
area of its choice. Provided it can demonstrate financial strength and
access to adequate gas supplies it should be authorised as a public gas
supplier (PGS). It can then solicit business. The gas would be supplied
through existing pipes and meters which the company would rent from British
Gas.
The main licence condition will be adherence to a network code. PGSs will
have to supply gas to anyone in their area who asks for it, and all on the
same terms. This is to ensure that de-regulation does not lead to 'cherry
picking' by independents seeking only well-heeled customers.
The main aim is to force through competition and bring wider choice and
lower prices to households. The independents have been claiming that gas
bills could go down by 10 per cent or more because their operating costs are
only a fraction of British Gas's.
These claims have been challenged by British Gas and greeted with some
scepticism in the market. 'The single issue for consumers is whether wider
choice means lower gas bills,' said Mr Ian Powe, director of the Gas
Consumers Council.
The National Consumer Council is also worried. The director Ms Ruth Evans
said free competition could mean larger customers benefiting at the expense
of the smaller.
There is a strong likelihood that some areas will attract more competition
than others, so some consumers will get more choice and possibly lower
prices. Ms Spottiswoode said that prices might vary around the country, but
only by about 2 per cent. She also thought it likely that several companies
would apply to serve the whole of the UK.
Some 80 companies currently have licences to supply the non-franchise
market, though only 30 or so are active. They have already taken 20 per cent
of the segments of the non-franchise market that have recently been opened
to them.
Mr Norman Ellis, managing director of Kinetica - a joint venture between
Conoco, the US oil company, and PowerGen, the UK power generator - predicted
a structural change in the gas market as a result of yesterday's decision.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Abu Dhabi set to sue auditors linked to BCCI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder of the collapsed Bank
of Credit and Commerce International, is preparing to sue the firm of
accountants that audited the investments it handed to the bank for
management.
It is preparing legal action against J B Benbow &amp; Co and its successor firm
Benbow Anderson &amp; Co, the small firms based in Grand Cayman that audited Abu
Dhabi's account with ICIC Overseas, a BCCI subsidiary.
A writ may be issued in the English courts as soon as spring, in an action
designed as much to gain access to documents as to recover assets from the
firm.
Mr David Sandy, a partner with Simmons &amp; Simmons, Abu Dhabi's lawyers in
London, said: '(Benbow) is firmly in our sights. Our client has told us to
go ahead. They are our next target.'
On Monday Abu Dhabi launched action against 13 former BCCI executives for
Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.6bn), claiming that it recovered less than Dollars
600m of Dollars 2bn it invested in the 1980s.
Benbow was appointed auditor to account 20071 at ICIC Overseas in Grand
Cayman in 1988 after what Mr Sandy said was four years of pressure from Abu
Dhabi to appoint an independent adviser to study the figures.
Mr Swaleh Naqvi, chief operating officer of BCCI, drafted a letter in
November 1989 to Abu Dhabi which was never sent, but laid out a number of
reasons for not appointing a larger firm of auditors.
He argued that 'there is no guarantee of secrecy in big firms . . .
particularly when their staff come and go and it had been often found that
they talk irresponsibly'.
J B Benbow's first audit of the financial position of the portfolio with a
valuation of Dollars 3.5bn in the year to June 30 1988 was signed off as
showing 'a true and fair view' in a statement dated July 11 1988.
The firm also provided a detailed valuation report on the account at March
31 1989. An invoice in August that year shows it charged Dollars 58,600 at a
'concessional rate' for the work and expenses.
Benbow Anderson &amp; Co, its successor firm, verified the value of portfolio
balances as Dollars 3.9bn at June 30 1989. It provided a further audit for
the portfolio valued at Dollars 4bn for the period to December 31 1989. The
two audits and additional work during the period were billed at nearly
Dollars 33,000.
Mr John Benbow, a partner with the firm, yesterday said he could not comment
without approval of ICIC's liquidator.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Abandoned pits pour out a toxic threat: After British Coal,
it is unclear who will be responsible for preventing minewater pollution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Rivers Authority, the river pollution watchdog, has warned the
government that it has inadequate powers to deal with pollution caused by
water from abandoned mines. Such water is a growing threat as British Coal
rapidly contracts.
The rundown of deep mining and British Coal's forthcoming privatisation has
thrown into doubt the future of its costly minewater pumping operations,
currently paid for by the corporation to protect working pits.
Without constant pumping, minewater in coalfield areas can rise into disused
workings and become contaminated with metals before leaching out into
rivers, killing wildlife and contaminating drinking water.
In County Durham, now without a single operating deep mine, studies have
suggested that discharges of polluted minewater into the River Wear would
begin three months after British Coal's Pounds 6m-a-year County Durham
pumping programme ceased.
The NRA, which has mounted no prosecutions over pollution by water from
abandoned mines since its formation in 1989, says the law hampers it from
taking action in such cases.
It says the problem is the 1991 Water Resources Act which states that
'permitting' water from an abandoned mine to enter controlled waters is not
an offence, although 'causing' it to do so is. Also, under the act the NRA
is not allowed to recoup the cost of clearing up after such incidents.
NRA chief scientist Mr Jan Pentreath says the law in this area is deficient
and must be altered. 'The NRA has said this publicly again and again.'
The NRA's plea for stronger powers comes as MPs, environmentalists and
industry - including the water industry - together with rural interests,
including the National Farmers' Union, are increasingly expressing concern
about potential minewater pollution.
Nobody knows precisely how great the threat is. British Coal's present
pumping regime has, until now, helped to prevent pollution from
long-abandoned workings. But a 1991 incident in which 80m gallons of water
contaminated with toxic metals spewed out of the Wheal Jane tin mine in
Cornwall, turning the River Carnon red and endangering marine life,
illustrated minewater's hidden power.
In its coal privatisation bill, the government proposes that a new
public-sector body, the Coal Authority, take over British Coal's
responsibilities for the physical legacy of historical mining not
transferred to the private sector.
The 160-page bill sets out a framework for licensing of mining, safety,
pensions, concessionary fuel, coal-bed methane exploitation and subsidence,
but does not mention minewater pollution or pumping. 'This kind of detail is
worked out during the passage of the bill,' the Department of Trade and
Industry said.
Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, last week said the NRA's complaint that the
law is deficient was a Department of the Environment matter.
County Durham Labour MPs and councillors have met Mr Eggar to express
disquiet. Conservative MPs in mining areas, such as Mr Richard Alexander, MP
for Newark, Nottinghamshire, are also worried.
'British Coal is apparently overlooking the likelihood of their underground
water, which may be contaminated with metals, leaching into the rest of the
water and consequently the water supply,' he says. With other MPs he has
lobbied Mr John Gummer, environment secretary. 'Clearly the state has a
responsibility,' says Mr Alexander.
Mr Howard Gill, regional operations adviser at Northumbrian Water's sewage
and water arm, says: 'These discharges are a direct result of the closure of
an industry; the costs should be recognised as part of that closure
programme. They shouldn't fall on water consumers in a few years' time.'
There were suspicions, he adds, that the 1991 act was phrased so as not to
saddle companies with long-term minewater pollution responsibilities. There
is evidence of the deterrent effect of pumping costs - RJB Mining dropped
its bid for Easington pit in County Durham for this reason.
Mr Gill says the water industry fears that hard-won improvements in river
quality may be lost. North East Water has warned that if pumping ceases,
possible minewater pollution in the River Wear could force it to spend
Pounds 25m on new treatment facilities.
Minewater pumping is also sometimes useful to water companies in maintaining
environmental standards. The Clean Rivers Trust, a Nottinghamshire-based
environmental group committed to working with industry, says that without
regular inflows of pumped minewater some stretches of rivers in its area
would consist mainly of treated sewage.
Mr Harvey Wood, trust co-ordinator, says minewater has implications
nationally for many industries, including agriculture, tourism and brewing.
'I don't think it's being taken seriously at the moment,' he says.
Minewater, he adds, is unpredictable. 'It has a very nasty habit of popping
up where it's least expected.'
One man who knows this to his cost is farmer Mr Peter Raine. In 1979 a
concrete plug on a disused pit shaft near his farm at St Helen Auckland, an
area of County Durham once extensively mined, was blown off by the pressure
of underground water. Since then his field drainage ditches have begun
overflowing with water, turning 10 acres into bogland. It is land where once
he grew winter barley, grazed cattle and made hay. Now it squelches, sodden
and useless, over the top of his gumboots.
Mr Raine is certain the water has risen through abandoned mineworkings. His
worries were heightened by the death of five cattle from poisoning several
years ago. Fearing contamination, he has zoned off a further 10 acres of
grazing land.
Yet, in spite of the anxiety and lost income, he has found no means of
redress and no way of stopping the flow of water. 'How do I prove it's
coming from a pit shaft?' he asks. 'And who's going to take responsibility
for the problem, especially after British Coal's privatisation?'

FT  22 DEC 93 / Companies 'still set pay centrally'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Payroll budgets are still centrally determined by the finance department in
most large companies, in spite of the trend towards decentralised
bargaining, a survey by Warwick Business School shows.
The survey, of 176 companies each employing more than 1,000 people, also
found that only 30 per cent have a main board personnel director and that
the personnel department has a greater role in policing rather than in
setting paybill objectives. Personnel staff play the lead role in setting
budgets in only 7 per cent of companies.
The survey is the first of its kind to interview finance directors as well
as personnel specialists, and confirms the view that decision-taking in UK
companies is shaped by the organisation's system of financial control.
More than half the companies set a target for unit labour costs. In the
1991-92 pay-round, for example, most companies assumed a 'going rate' of 4
per cent to 5 per cent for pay increases, a median productivity increase of
3 per cent and a median headcount decrease of 4 per cent.
The survey also shows that negotiations are not a formality and that in just
more than half the companies they led to substantial changes in budgets. In
most cases, however, the change was to reduce the budget assumption, not to
increase it.
Half of the companies had no separate budgets for training and only half of
respondents on the finance side were able to put a figure on what they spent
on training. Evaluation of the effectiveness of training expenditure took
place in only 13 per cent of companies.
Trade unions were recognised in 69 per cent of companies, with more than
half of them bargaining on a site-by-site basis. Nearly one-in-five
companies had wholly or partially de-recognised unions at existing sites in
the past five years.
Sixty per cent of large companies in the UK are multi-nationals and
one-fifth are foreign-owned. Foreign-owned companies were more likely to
have a personnel director on the main board, spend relatively highly on
training and communicate frequently with employees.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Industrial action by public-sector workers 'absolutely
inevitable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Industrial action by Britain's 5.8m public-sector workers against the
government's three-year pay freeze is 'absolutely inevitable' from next
April, Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, said
yesterday, Robert Taylor writes.
Announcing his union's part in a prolonged campaign with other unions
against the freeze, Mr Morris predicted 'an explosion of anger' in the
spring when most public-sector pay bargaining takes place and when tax
increases come into force.
He was keen to emphasise that the unions would not be launching the kind of
damaging conflict seen in 1978-79 which helped destroy the Labour
government. Mr Morris said, however, that unions were planning a campaign
that could last until 1996.
All public-sector unions are deciding whether to back action on April 11.
The TGWU's finance and general purposes committee will decide on January 13.
There are signs that it will back away from a one-day general strike in the
public sector.
The executive committee of Unison, the largest public-sector union, has
already endorsed action.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Whitehall clash on Post Office rules: DTI defies Treasury
over commercial freedom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Department of Trade and Industry is backing the Post Office's call for
more commercial freedom, in spite of Treasury opposition.
DTI officials are working on a report contrasting the position of hospital
trusts and grant-maintained schools with that of the Post Office. They feel
that under the present rules some schools and hospital trusts have more
opportunities than the Post Office to involve the private sector.
The DTI wants to relax restrictions which prevent the Post Office from
forming international joint ventures to compete with the Dutch post office,
which is being privatised early next year.
The Treasury opposes any change to the status quo while the Post Office
remains in the public sector. According to Whitehall officials, the Treasury
is adamant that unless the Post Office is privatised, the corporation should
'not be entitled to any commercial freedom whatsoever'.
The two departments are so far apart on the issue that Mr Michael Portillo,
chief secretary to the Treasury, has blocked a move by Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary, to allow post offices to sell angling
licences, currently available from angling shops.
Treasury ministers do not believe post offices should have more scope to
compete with shops while the corporation remains state-owned. The DTI has
yet to announce the outcome of its long-awaited review of the Post Office.
An early draft of the report, not expected to be published until the end of
February, has come out against full privatisation but is known to be
sympathetic to the Post Office's call for greater freedom.
Mr Patrick McLoughlin, DTI minister responsible for the Post Office, is also
understood to be strongly supportive of its demand to be allowed to sign
international joint ventures with private companies.
Mr Mike Heron, Post Office chairman, and Mr Bill Cockburn, its chief
executive, fear that its investment plans and profitability are at risk
because of the cash taken by the Treasury.
The Post Office's external finance limit target - the amount it has to pay
the government - has risen to Pounds 230m in 1994-95 and is set at Pounds
210m for the following year.
It was announced yesterday that Post Office pre-tax profits fell from Pounds
135m to Pounds 59m in the six months to September, reflecting the impact of
the two-year freeze on letter prices.
Mr Cockburn has warned that in the long term, stamp prices may have to rise
to meet the Treasury's demands for cash. He said yesterday the Post Office
should be freed from the commercial constraint of helping to finance the
public sector borrowing requirement.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Bomb alerts hit London again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bomb alerts paralysed much of London's train and Underground systems
yesterday as the IRA's campaign of disruption continued to punctuate the
talks on Northern Ireland.
Police searched 200 miles of track between London and Sevenoaks in Kent
after receiving coded telephone calls from Dublin.
Some 37 stations were closed, including the main London stations of
Victoria, Blackfriars, London Bridge, Charing Cross, Cannon Street and
Waterloo East.
The disruption was the latest in a series of random terrorist activity -
either acknowledged by the IRA or attributed to it - that has provided an
unsettling backdrop to the talks between London and Dublin.
The anti-terrorist branch of the Metropolitan Police has joined forces with
the British Transport Police to deal with the disruption, aimed at Christmas
shoppers and retailers as much as commuters.
Mr John Wyatt, an anti-terrorist expert with a security consultancy, said
the latest campaign of disruption suggested a deep-rooted fragmentation
within the IRA that reflected the allegiances of the small cells which made
up the organisation.
He said that the IRA's command structure did not have 'full control' of all
the cells. Nor did Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, speak for the
entire organisation.
'Part of the IRA wants to keep the pressure up because they do not think
that the concessions offered go far enough,' Mr Wyatt said. 'But they don't
want to do anything too radical. The latest disruption is not intended to
lead to serious loss of life and doesn't pose much threat of injury either.'
All British Rail lines except those between London and Sevenoaks were
running normally by early afternoon.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Birmingham Tories urge land deals to aid schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Derelict or under-used public land should be made available at no charge to
construction companies if, in exchange, they repair and refurbish rundown
schools, Birmingham Conservative councillors suggested yesterday.
Mr Bernard Zissmann, leader of the Conservative group on Birmingham city
council, advanced the idea to put pressure on the Labour-led council and to
offer 'a new dimension in tackling a national problem'.
The city council has been told by a commission of advisers of its own choice
that it has been under-spending on education. The commission noted that over
the past five years the council has pushed money into projects such as the
International Convention Centre but spent Pounds 236m less on education than
the government thought it should have done.
The advisers called for a Pounds 250m five-year programme to repair the
city's schools.
Mr Zissmann said: 'I don't think the city council will ever commit enough
money, not because it doesn't want to, but because it hasn't got the money.'
He said the Conservative suggestion would improve the infrastructure without
increasing the public sector borrowing requirement. Derelict land would also
be developed and the public stock of land reduced, in line with government
wishes.
Under Mr Zissmann's plan, a school needing repair would be identified and a
nearby vacant site located. A tender among construction companies would be
held and the land provided with outline planning permission as a quid pro
quo for the refurbishment of the school.
The council dismissed the scheme as one of 'Heath Robinson complexity which
will only increase red tape and bureaucracy'. All the council wanted, it
said, was an increase in its borrowing limits so that it could have the same
kind of rolling programme for school repairs enjoyed by the shire counties.
'The idea has the smell of a pre-election gimmick,' the council said. The
Conservatives need to gain four seats at next May's elections to take
control of the city - the UK's largest metropolitan authority - for the
first time in 10 years.
The land-for-school-repair scheme is, said Mr Zissmann, 'the main plank of
our election platform. If we can't get education right, there's not much
point in bothering about anything else'.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Ailing shipyard wins EU lifeline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder in receivership, yesterday won
eligibility for Shipbuilding Intervention Funding subsidy which will be paid
by the UK government.
The decision, taken by European commissioners in Brussels, improves the
company's prospects of finding a buyer by enhancing its competitiveness in
bidding for merchant ship orders.
But restrictions placed on fund eligibility mean that the concession,
although a political triumph, only offers a breathing space while the
company tries to secure its future.
The company's eligibility for the 9 per cent subsidy is limited to a maximum
of Pounds 7m for a two-year period, and will be applied to no more than two
to three merchant orders. The European Commission described the conversion
back to a merchant yard as 'partial and limited'.
Factors behind the Commission's decision included the UK government's
commitment that this was a 'one-off' request which did not set a precedent
for other military yards, the limited effect on the EU's production capacity
and the effect eligibility would have in increasing the receivers' chances
of finding a purchaser for the yard.
The decision was warmly welcomed by unions, local MPs and MEPs, local
authorities and industry minister Mr Tim Sainsbury. Swan Hunter, he said,
played a vital role in the UK's ability to maintain its naval defence
capability.
Mr Ed James of Price Waterhouse, the receivers which are running the company
and are seeking to sell it as a going concern, said the news must increase
its attractiveness to prospective purchasers. 'We hope that it will
encourage them to develop an interest in what is a lean, fit and
increasingly competitive yard.'
Mr Steve Byers, Wallsend Labour MP, said yesterday: 'A prospective buyer can
now see the whole picture. We are now waiting in the next six weeks for a
buyer to come forward. If that doesn't happen, I think we have seen the end
of shipbuilding on the Tyne.'

FT  22 DEC 93 / Adams demand for talks strains peace initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, yesterday put further strain on the
Anglo-Irish peace initiative by calling for 'direct and unconditional
dialogue' with the two governments.
In his second statement in two days, Mr Adams criticised London and Dublin
for 'contradictory statements' on the issue of self-determination. He said
the peace process would be 'difficult, dangerous and protracted'.
Downing Street brushed aside Mr Adams' demands, saying it would not 'enter
into exchanges with Sinn Fein through the media'.
Both British and Irish officials said Sinn Fein's inclusion in talks was
'predicated upon a true cessation of violence'.
Mr David Trimble, Ulster Unionist home affairs spokesman, described Mr
Adams' comments as a 'cynical manoeuvre' to try to 'suck the government into
direct negotiations while violence is continuing'.
However, the gulf between the province's two unionist parties was reflected
in a comment by Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist
party. He accused the Ulster Unionist party of 'prostituting' itself by
going along with the initiative.
Mr Adams said Sinn Fein would not be 'intimidated by any threats'. But he
expressed optimism that 'if properly managed' a process to bring lasting
peace could be established. He said Sinn Fein wanted to make the
Major-Reynolds declaration 'the beginning of the end'.
Downing Street said there was 'no question' of Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish
prime minister, attending talks that the British government has offered Sinn
Fein within three months of an end to violence. Fifty-six per cent of people
in Northern Ireland approve the joint declaration, according to an ITN poll
released last night. However, twice as many nationalists (87 per cent) as
unionists (43 per cent) give it their support. A total of 61 per cent said
they would vote in a referendum for the province to remain in the UK, with
25 per cent supporting the idea of it becoming part of an all-Ireland
republic.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Treasury reshuffle targets efficiency: Changes signal intent
to focus on wealth creation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Treasury has launched its most sweeping reorganisation for a decade in a
bid to improve management efficiency and counter criticism that it is out of
touch with the business world.
The moves, announced yesterday, will give more responsibilities to
relatively junior officials and set up a new directorate to handle policies
affecting industry, including education and employment.
Sir Terry Burns, Treasury permanent secretary, will link more closely with
officials lower down the department who will report directly to him.
The shift, to take effect next month, is intended to make the Treasury more
receptive to events outside Whitehall.
It is the strongest signal yet from the government's most powerful
department that it intends to change its culture to focus more on wealth
creation.
The changes come after criticism from industrialists and non-government
economists in recent years that the Treasury has developed too few contacts
with the business world and has been slow to react to outside events.
In particular, critics have said the department failed to wake up early
enough to the seriousness of the recession, and also to sense the pressures
on sterling prior to Britain's departure from the European exchange rate
mechanism 15 months ago.
Sir Terry has spent the past 18 months refining ways to reform the
Treasury's management.
He has recently been working with Ms Wendy Pritchard, a management
consultant, on ways to alter the department's culture.
The biggest element of the change is the regrouping of the Treasury's
financial services and industry divisions into one directorate under Mr
Steve Robson, a high-flying Treasury official currently in charge of
industry policies.
Mr Robson will take charge of the Treasury's responsibilities for
supervising financial institutions, and also for policies to help industry
work more effectively. Such 'supply side' policies include ways to attract
more private-sector involvement into large projects normally funded by the
government.
On the same deputy-secretary level as Mr Robson will be three other
officials who cover civil-service pay and management, public services, and
fiscal and monetary policy.
As part of the reshuffle, two of the Treasury's current deputy secretaries -
Ms Rachel Lomax, in charge of financial institutions, and Mr Huw Evans,
number two to Sir Nigel Wicks in overseas affairs - are moving to new jobs
and are not being replaced.
Ms Lomax is to become economic adviser at the Cabinet Office while Mr Evans
is to become the UK's representative at the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank.
Mr Brian Fox is moving to the Cabinet Office from his current Treasury job
as head of establishments and organisation.

FT  22 DEC 93 / South Korean leader replaces 14 ministers

South Korean President Kim Young-sam replaced his top economic planner and
13 other ministers yesterday in a reshuffle designed to restore his
credibility after breaking campaign promises to keep the rice market closed,
Reuter reports from Seoul.
Transport minister Chung Jai-suk replaced Lee Kyung-shick as deputy premier
and economic planning board chief. Mr Chung's promotion made room at
transport for Mr Oh Myung, former communications minister and chief
organiser of the 1993 Taejon world expo.
A presidential spokesman said the moves were made in the light of the Gatt
world trade pact, to 'concentrate national energies and strengthen the
economy through full-fledged reforms now that a new world economic order is
being shaped'.
Under Gatt, South Korea agreed gradually to open its politically sensitive
rice market from 1995, sparking widespread protests by farmers and students.
The way for the reshuffle was cleared last Thursday when Mr Hwang In-sung
resigned as prime minister, saying he took the blame for failure to prevent
the market opening. He was replaced by Mr Lee Hoi-chang, who has spearheaded
President Kim's anti-corruption drive.
Contrary to expections, Mr Kim retained finance minister Hong Jae-hyong and
trade minister Kim Chul-su, moves seen as a desire to maintain economic
policies.
The new unification minister is Lee Yung-dug, a professor at a Seoul
university who once served as a chief negotiator in talks with North Korea.
Mr Rhee Byoung-tae, a former general who previously headed the agency for
patriots and veterans affairs, became the new defence minister in place of
Kwon Young-hae.
The defence ministry has recently been under fire for an alleged
multi-million dollar arms procurement swindle.
Mr Choi Hyung-woo, regarded as one of Kim's closest confidants, became the
new interior minister, replacing Mr Lee Hae-koo.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Clinton woos environmentalists: Washington seeks support in
Congress for Gatt accord
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Clinton Administration yesterday continued to woo the US environmental
lobby in the hope of attracting support from some of the more conservative
organisations for Congressional approval of the Uruguay Round package.
'We are struggling not to oppose the Round,' said Mr David Schorr, trade
policy specialist for the World Wildlife Fund, 'but we are disappointed with
insufficient concrete progress in the Round.'
The National Wildlife Federation, one of the largest environmental groups,
joined with the WWF and four other environmental groups to support the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
But the NWF lost no time in condemning the Round. On December 15 Mr Jay
Hair, NWF president, said Gatt was not prepared for the 21st century.
'Instead of retooling for today's challenges, the negotiators have held on
to yesterday's obsolete approaches.'
To US environmentalists one of the more disheartening results was failure to
agree to more transparency and public participation in Gatt's settlement
panels. The formation of public panels was agreed, but proceedings will
still be closed to outside observers.
Some hint problems in the current pact can be corrected in negotiations to
be continued until the ministerial declaration on April 15. They praise the
Clinton Administration for linking trade with environmental protection but
say it was unable to overcome an entrenched bias in Geneva which considers
trade liberalisation the goal to be achieved rather than a tool for creating
and distributing wealth.
In a future work programme to be negotiated, Mr Schorr is hoping for 'an
agenda that contemplates actual reform.' He would like the establishment of
a permanent body which 'places environmental issues at the core of the world
trading organisation.'
Mr Kantor is clearly listening. The administration, he said, will seek 'new
initiatives in the environment' as well as in competition policy and also in
worker rights.'
Whatever he offers will not be enough for some environmentalists,
particularly those which opposed Nafta. But he he can bring on board those
who hope to see in Gatt the same convergence occurring in the US between
economists, who recognise the desirability of environmental protection, and
environmentalists, who understand the need to create wealth to pay for it.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Aboriginal land bill passed by Canberra Senate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A native title bill, which sets up a system for deciding land claims by
Australia's Aborigines and Torres Strait islanders, was approved by the
Senate yesterday.
The legislation, passed after a marathon parliamentary debate that began on
Friday, will come into effect on January 1. Mr Paul Keating, the Australian
prime minister who took a personal role in negotiating the bill with
Aboriginal leaders, described it as 'a turning point for all Australians'.
'This has been the longest continuing problem that Australia has faced for
200 years, recognising that indigenous people, that native people, had the
right to their own soil,' he said.
For two centuries Australia's land management system has operated on the
principle that the land was uninhabited before European settlement. This
concept was overturned in a High Court ruling last year, which said native
title could exist where there had been 'close and continuing' association
with the land in question. However, the court added that land titles
acquired under accepted law since European settlement should not be
disturbed. The native title bill tries to marry these two rulings.
The bill has been highly controversial. Mining companies argue it will mean
that exploration becomes more costly and unpredictable. But the government
and Aboriginal groups say the number of successful land claims will be
small, benefiting perhaps 10 per cent of the Aboriginal population and
mainly involving vacant crown land.
Over one-seventh of Australia's 1m square miles has already been set aside,
in one way or another, for the country's 265,000 aboriginal and Torres
Strait islander people.
The bill, debate over which had threatened to continue over the holiday
period, passed the Senate 34-30 just after midnight. The lower House of
Representatives, where the government holds a majority, is scheduled to
approve the bill this morning.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Indian MPs savage the financial establishment: The Bombay
stocks scandal inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rarely can a parliamentary inquiry into a financial scandal have produced
such a comprehensively damning report as that published yesterday by Indian
MPs examining last year's Rs40bn (Pounds 850m) Bombay stock market scandal.
The committee criticised almost every aspect of India's financial markets -
its banks, brokers, leasing companies, industrial groups, state-owned
industry, the Reserve Bank of India and the government. It catalogued
hundreds of sins of commission and omission in language bordering on the
Biblical and called for punishment with a withering disregard of extenuating
circumstances. As one Indian newspaper editor said last night: 'It's full of
simulated moral outrage.' The scandal involved the illegal siphoning of
funds from banks to the stock market through the collusion of bankers,
brokers, and public and private sector companies. MPs pull their punches in
respect of only two people - Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, and
Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister. In Mr Narasimha Rao's case they
refrain from commenting on the explosive allegations made this summer by Mr
Harshad Mehta, the broker at the centre of the scandal, that he tried to
bribe the prime minister with a suitcase full of money.
In Mr Manmohan Singh's case, the committee avoids holding him responsible by
name for his ministry's alleged failings - though the report does say in
scarcely veiled language that 'the responsibility and accountability of the
minister of finance to parliament cannot be denied.'
Mr Narasimha Rao and Mr Manmohan Singh escaped because of their political
importance. Opposition members of the committee said yesterday they would
have pursued both ministers more vigorously given the chance.
The ruling Congress (I) party's success in keeping Mr Narasimha Rao and Mr
Manmohan Singh's names off the list of the guilty indicates that the
political impact of the report may be limited.
Nevertheless the committee was fiercely critical of virtually everyone
concerned:
Mr Manmohan Singh's plea that a distinction be drawn between his direct
responsibilities and those of the ministry and institutions he oversees was
rejected. 'Such a distinction cannot be sustained by the constitutional
jurisprudence under which the parliamentary system works.'
The finance ministry failed to anticipate the scandal, to respond to it
properly, to manage the effects, to apply the necessary post-scandal reforms
and to punish the guilty resolutely. Among other shortcomings, the committee
found that the ministry's representative attended only 15 of 49 meetings of
the Reserve Bank of India's central board in 1986-92. MPs say this was
negligent.
The Reserve Bank of India (the central bank) was accused of ignoring warning
signs as far back as 1986; of not following up the findings of inspection
reports; of turning a blind eye to irregularities and of being soft on
foreign banks for fear of upsetting India's international creditworthiness.
Three present or former senior officials are accused by name of 'gross
dereliction of duty.' MPs recommended establishing a Board of Financial
Supervision inside the central bank to assume from the main board overall
responsibility for banking supervision.
Banks were accused of management failings, including lax checks on
transactions and book-keeping. The finance ministry was accused of being
negligent in its role of appointing the senior director of the many
state-owned banks. MPs recommended reform of the recruitment procedures to
bring in candidates from outside the civil service.
Foreign banks were blamed for originating the scandal and becoming the
biggest players in it, and for throwing overboard 'all principles of
prudence and safety.' Standard Chartered Bank, ANZ Grindlays, Citibank and
Bank of America, the main operators in the inter-bank securities market
among foreign banks, were singled out for particular attack for allegedly
breaking Indian laws and infringing laws in their own countries.
Public Sector Units were criticised for allowing their funds, mostly secured
via cheap government-backed credits, to be recycled into stock market
investments. 'All this was public money and all who were playing with it
were public servants.'
The Bombay Stock Exchange was second only to the foreign banks as a target
for the committee's venom. Insider trading by brokers, reluctance to publish
price data openly, ineffective audits and tax returns and virtually
non-existent punitive action on the part of the stock exchange authorities
were all highlighted.
The committee urged the finance ministry to crack down quickly and heavily
on individuals involved in the scandal and still occupying senior positions
in banks, brokers and elsewhere. The banking laws should be strengthened to
include harsher penalties for wrong-doing. Stringent penalties should be
imposed on foreign banks 'including suspension of their licences'.
MPs accepted that the creation of the Securities and Exchange Board of
India, the markets watchdog which started operating after the scandal, would
improve regulation. But they said it had come too late and needed to be
tough.
The committee wrongly linked the scandal to the economic liberalisation
which started in mid-1991.
In fact, the origins of the affair pre-date reform and its causes lie in the
complex mix of restrictive regulations and ineffective supervision which
characterised the pre-reform financial system.
MPs urged the government to give full weight to improving supervision saying
'deregulation without effective checks and balances would be an unmitigated
disaster.'

FT  22 DEC 93 / Israel and Palestinians edging towards compromise on borders
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation appeared to be edging
towards a compromise in deadlocked peace negotiations as the two sides
resumed top-level talks in Paris last night.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, said his government would accept
Palestinian co-ordination at border crossings 'as long as we will be able to
control, for the sake of security, everybody that crosses'.
In Tunis, PLO officials indicated that Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, had
agreed to back down on his demand for full Palestinian control of border
crossings between Egypt and the Gaza Strip and the West Bank area of Jericho
and Jordan.
The officials said the PLO was prepared to concede control in return for
extensive powers for Palestinian police at checkpoints.
The issue of border control has been the main point impeding the
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord's implementation.
Israel has insisted the peace deal left external security exclusively in the
hands of the Jewish state and has accused Mr Arafat of trying to win
important concessions over sovereignty, which the agreement left to later
negotiations.
Mr Rabin told the foreign affairs and defence committee of Israel's
parliament yesterday that the US, European Union, Egypt and Morocco
supported Israel's interpretation of the peace accord as did Mr Mahmoud
Abbas, the PLO official who signed the agreement with Israel in September.
Israeli officials said the inclusion of Mr Abbas in the Palestinian team
meeting Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, in Paris last night was a
sign of progress.
Mr Abbas has reportedly been at loggerheads with Mr Arafat for several weeks
over the PLO chairman's management of peace talks.
Officials said that once a compromise was found on the border issue,
resolution of the other key obstacle - the size of the Jericho area - would
be relatively quick.
Meanwhile, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Gulf Arab states yesterday discussed the
possibility of easing the Arab economic boycott of Israel. Mr Youssef Bin
Alawi Bin Abdullah, Omani foreign minister of state, said: 'Lifting the
boycott could be in our favour.' Diplomats, however, said it was unlikely
the Gulf states would lift the boycott before there was a united Arab
decision through the Arab League.

FT  22 DEC 93 / US telecoms controls face overhaul: Clinton administration
aims to ease competition rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Clinton administration aims to introduce legislation next month
overhauling the tight controls on competition in the telecommunications and
information industries.
Faced with advancing technologies that have blurred the traditional lines
between sectors such as local and long distance telephone, or cable and
broadcast television, the administration plans to rewrite the 1934
Communications Act that still provides the framework for most of the rules
governing telecommunications.
The new legislation would also ease restrictions imposed by the 1982 court
judgment that broke up the AT&amp;T telephone monopoly into a group of 'Baby
Bells' providing local telephone service and a separate AT&amp;T offering long
distance service.
Vice-President Al Gore yesterday outlined the administration's ideas on
telecommunications reform, and was expected to give greater detail at a
speech in Los Angeles on January 11.
Mr Gore's aim is to establish new regulatory models that will take
technological changes into account and pave the way for much more open
competition in all sectors.
'The desired end point is to move to a point ultimately where any company
can offer any services through any network to any set of consumers,' an
administration official said.
The administration is expected to draw heavily on separate bills that have
already been introduced in Congress. One Senate bill would allow the Bell
companies to offer cable television, while also requiring all telephone
service providers to open their networks to rivals, and guaranteeing
universal local telephone access.
Separate bills in the House would progressively ease the ban on Bell
companies making telecommunications equipment or offering long distance
service and allow telephone and cable companies to compete in each other's
markets.
Officials say that developments such as cellular telephone networks and
fibre optic television links have made it possible to have full competition
in every segment of the telecommunications business, so that the rigid rules
designed to prevent abuse of the local telephone monopoly were no longer as
necessary.
'Everything we do now through wires in the ground we are going to do in the
air, and everything we do now in the air we are going to do through wires in
the ground,' an administration official said.
Some of this blurring of lines is already in progress with moves such as
AT&amp;T's Dollars 12.3bn deal to buy McCaw Cellular Communications, the largest
US cellphone operator, or the proposed Dollars 22bn takeover of
Tele-Communications Inc, the largest cable television company, by Bell
Atlantic, one of the Baby Bells.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Clinton shrugs off sex and money smears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Bill Clinton's popularity has rebounded to levels close to those
he enjoyed shortly after assuming office, according to a new opinion poll by
the Washington Post and ABC News.
A string of victories in Congress, notably the North American Free Trade
Agreement and the Brady handgun control bill, and an improving economy were
the principal reasons for a rise in his approval rating to 58 per cent from
the 50 per cent range of the previous three months.
The high point of his year was the 63 per cent of February and his nadir 43
per cent in June in the survey's findings. At least one other poll has
recorded a comparable improvement.
On three specific counts he reversed poll results of November. His handling
of the economy was approved by 53-44 per cent, against 43-50 per cent, of
foreign affairs by 49-44 per cent (39-53 per cent) and crime 49-45 per cent
(39-52 per cent.) Only in the west, where California is still stuck in
recession, was his management of the economy disapproved, by 44-50 per cent.
Mr Clinton's end-year rating is nothing like as high as Presidents Kennedy
and Bush, who both recorded more than 70 per cent after their first 12
months in office, but it is comparable to President Carter's (57 per cent)
and above President Reagan's (49 per cent).
Ironically, in some respects Mr Clinton is winding up 1993 much as he
started it. Retired Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, the secretary of
defence-designate, has admitted failing to pay social security taxes for
household help, an offence that undid the chances of Ms Zoe Baird and Judge
Kimba Wood becoming attorney general. The prevailing Washington view,
however, is that neither this, nor his less than glittering record as a
businessman over the last decade, will disqualify him from taking office.
'Nannygate,' in particular, seems to have been last winter's catharsis.
Charges of Mr Clinton's extra-marital affairs have also resurfaced in a
right wing magazine and been picked up by the tabloid press, some television
networks and conservative talk show programmes. But the suspect nature of
his accusers in Arkansas, one a long-time political enemy representing two
state troopers apparently in pursuit of a lucrative book contract, has
induced extreme circumspection to date in the heavyweight media.
A more persistent story concerns a real estate investment by the Clintons in
Arkansas in the mid-1980s. The White House said on Monday night that a file
covering details of financial transactions between the Clintons and their
principal partner, who ran a now-defunct savings and loan operation, had not
gone missing but was with the Clintons' lawyers.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Mobil becomes first US oil group back in Vietnam: 50%
interest in offshore exploration venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mobil is set to become the first US oil group to return to Vietnam since the
war ended in 1975, signalling a further defrosting of commercial relations
between the two countries.
The Virginia-based oil company said it had received a licence from the
Treasury Department to take part in the exploration of the Blue Dragon
block, off the coast of Vietnam.
However, under current US regulations Mobil would not be able to take part
in any future production from the field.
Mobil said it hoped US restrictions would be relaxed further in future. If
not, it would have to dispose of its interest should the field prove
commercially attractive.
Mobil's 50 per cent interest in a consortium formed to explore the area,
alongside three Japanese companies, follows the oil group's involvement in
Vietnam in the early 1970s.
At that time it conducted the exploratory drilling in the White Tiger field,
a moderately sized off-shore development which is now the Vietnam's only
oil-producing field.
Vietnam's award of the exploration contract to the Mobil consortium, and the
US's decision to grant a licence, comes at a time when US energy groups are
investing heavily overseas in search of large-scale finds to replace their
dwindling US reserves.
Most other international oil companies have already been awarded exploration
contracts in Vietnam.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Greenspan put to the test: Pressures confronting the Fed
chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The year is ending on a sour note for Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US
Federal Reserve. Abroad, he is hailed as one of the most successful central
bankers of recent times; under his leadership the US defused an ominous
credit crunch and then became the only large economy to reduce its inflation
rate while enjoying a robust recovery.
At home, however, he is assailed on all sides. President Bill Clinton and Mr
Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, have taken to lecturing Mr Greenspan on
monetary policy.
It would be a 'mistake' to raise interest rates because inflation is clearly
under control, Mr Clinton said last week; the priority was jobs and higher
incomes. According to Mr Bentsen (who sounds increasingly like his
predecessor, Nicholas Brady) there is absolutely no reason for an increase
in rates 'this quarter or next'.
Other pressures on Mr Greenspan are mounting. The White House is planning a
sweeping rationalisation of bank regulation that would strip the Fed of its
powers as a regulator.
Mr Henry Gonzales, the powerful head of the House banking committee,
meanwhile, is stepping up his campaign for reforms that would reduce the
Fed's independence and force it to conduct monetary policy more openly.
Mr Greenspan also faces a change in the composition of the Fed's
seven-member board that will further increase the White House's leverage
over interest rate policy. Mr Clinton will shortly announce a replacement
for Mr Wayne Angell, an 'inflation hawk' whose term as governor is about to
expire. The appointee will probably become the Fed's vice-chairman when Mr
David Mullins's four-year term ends in 1995.
The Treasury's short-list of candidates includes Ms Alice Rivlin, the deputy
budget director, and several respected academics. There is no reason to
believe the new governor will be especially soft on inflation, but a Clinton
appointee is bound to feel a stronger obligation to toe the White House line
on interest rates than a long-serving Republican appointee.
The debate on rates is over the timing and size of an increase. Even the
White House does not expect the Fed to hold rates at 3 per cent
indefinitely, regardless of the strength of the economy or the inflation
outlook.
The White House sees no evidence of any increase in inflationary pressures.
The annual rate of consumer price inflation has drifted below 3 per cent.
Strong productivity gains are more than offsetting moderate wage increases,
causing a decline in unit labour costs. In the short term the fall in world
oil prices is putting further downward pressure on US inflation.
Administration economists concede the pace of economic growth has
accelerated markedly in the current quarter. But, given that similar spurts
proved temporary in previous years, they urge the Fed to wait until GDP
figures for the first quarter are available before adjusting monetary
policy.
If growth slips back to 3 per cent from the current estimated annual rate of
4-5 per cent, the case for higher rates will look less pressing.
Many private sector economists concur. Mr Charles Schultze, a senior fellow
at the Brookings Institution, believes the Fed should err on the side of
caution. But since 'we're not on an inflation hair-trigger', it need not act
'this month or next'.
The counter argument, popular on Wall Street, is that the Fed should tighten
policy well before inflationary pressures become evident. Indeed, far from
being content with inflation of about 3 per cent, the Fed should be aiming
for the 'price stability' long promised by Mr Greenspan.
The sooner the Fed begins to tighten policy, say inflation hawks, the lower
will be the eventual increase in rates during this business cycle. They
point out that a small in-crease in short-term rates could promote growth
because, by reinforcing the Fed's anti-inflation credentials, it would spark
a bond market rally that would reduce long-term rates.
Signals from senior Fed policymakers are ambiguous. Some probably favour an
early increase in rates; others favour waiting until the economy's strength
early next year can be gauged.
At the very least, most analysts believe the Fed's policy-making open market
committee will have shifted to a bias toward raising rates at this week's
meeting - if it did not do so in November. Such a bias would lay the ground
for tightening next year.
But the Fed's task is undoubtedly made harder by the growing political
pressure. So far Mr Clinton has refused to support congressional proposals
to reduce the Fed's independence. But if the central bank were to defy the
White House and raise rates, Mr Clinton's attitude might change.
Similar considerations apply on banking regulation: if the Fed co-operates
on interest rates, Mr Clinton is more likely to be sympathetic to Mr
Greenspan's plea (most recently expressed in a signed Wall Street Journal
editorial) for a continued 'hands on' role for the Fed as a reg-ulator.
It all adds up to a 'no win' situation for Mr Greenspan. If he raises rates,
he risks retaliation on several fronts. If he does nothing, out of genuine
conviction that action is not yet needed, he will be accused of bowing to
White House pressure.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Japan's bureaucrats find their citadel under siege
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's bureaucrats, who believe they have run the country successfully for
more than four decades, are suddenly under attack from a new coalition
government that wants to weaken their grip on power.
A dispute has arisen between Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, minister for international
trade and industry, and his ministry, which likes to think it guided
Japanese industry's remarkable rise from the wartime ashes.
Mr Kumagai has demanded the resignation of one of the ministry's most senior
officials, Mr Masahisa Naito, who is alleged to have unusually close ties to
some companies and to have promoted unfairly another bureaucrat just before
he left the ministry to stand as a candidate for the Liberal Democratic
party.
'Enforcement of official discipline at administrative bodies is a big
challenge for the government,' Mr Kumagai said. 'We have to correct these
practices.'
The issue of appointments is particularly sensitive for bureaucrats, who
have traditionally arranged their own promotion ladder and sought soft
landings in industry after retiring from the ministry. While claiming to be
non-political, senior bureaucrats have often looked ahead to a second career
as a politician, generally with the LDP.
Mr Naito, director-general of the industrial policy bureau, denies having
unusually close ties to industry and argues he should not resign for
continuing the tradition of promoting a fellow bureaucrat leaving to become
a politician. The idea is that a promotion, if in name only, would improve
the candidate's chances of election, though it would also give an enduring
sense of obligation to the ministry.
Behind the row is an attempt by Mr Kumagai, a former Miti man himself, to
strengthen the control of the Japan Renewal party over a bureaucracy
sympathetic to the LDP. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the leader of a
separate party, said he would let the minister solve the dispute, while LDP
officials complained that the case was an 'unprecedented political intrusion
into the bureaucracy'.
Mr Hosokawa had promised to reduce the influence of Tokyo bureaucrats, but
his inexperienced government has been accused of being even more dependent
on them than the LDP. However, the government is attempting to cut
bureaucratic collusion in awarding construction contracts and to reduce
powers through deregulation.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Leading index falls again: Jobs at risk as companies review
workforce needs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan's economy is weakening because of faltering consumer demand and a drop
in capital spending, the Economic Planning Agency said yesterday after its
leading economic index showed another fall for the month of October.
The index slipped from 33.3 per cent in September to 30 per cent. The EPA
regards any reading lower than 50 per cent as an indication of weakness.
In August the index had risen to 50 per cent, inspiring government hopes of
a recovery, but economic activity has since slowed and the coalition
government is under pressure to introduce a new stimulative package.
Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan said yesterday that no clear signs of recovery
had emerged, and companies were reviewing their workforce needs, which could
lead to a rise in unemployment.
In its report for December, the bank agreed with the EPA that declining
personal consumption and capital spending were holding back the economy,
although slow lending growth by banks is attributed more to weak corporate
demand than to the wariness of banks.
Business leaders have called for another cut in the official discount rate,
but bank officials said yesterday they were still studying the effects of
the most recent reduction, in September, when the rate was cut to 1.75 per
cent.

Hopes for a pre-Christmas peace settlement in Bosnia were boosted yesterday
evening after an announcement by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman that
Serbs and Croats had reached agreement on a three-way carve-up of Bosnia
which would satisfy Moslem demands for a third of the country.
Mr Tudjman was speaking after a day of talks with his Serbian counterpart,
President Slobodan Milosevic. The two leaders, and their Bosnian Serb and
Bosnian Croat proteges, had been asked to come up with a plan in line with
European Union-backed peace proposals.
Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators for
former Yugoslavia, had urged the two leaders to agree to a proposal giving
the mainly Moslem republic an extra 3-4 per cent of territory, in addition
to that offered under a previous plan.
This would bring the republic's share of Bosnian land to one third, a demand
already conceded in principle by the Serbian and Croatian sides. The EU has
promised an end to economic sanctions against Serbia and economic aid for
Croatia in exchange for a lasting peace settlement in Bosnia.
Mr Tudjman said that, under the deal reached with Mr Milosevic - which has
still to be approved by the Moslems - Bosnian Croats would receive 17.5 per
cent of the territory, leaving Bosnian Serbs with slightly less than 50 per
cent of the former Yugoslav re-public.
Mr Mate Boban, Bosnian Croat leader, also told reporters that Croats would
satisfy Moslem demands for access to the Adriatic Sea.
The Croat side had offered the Moslems land on the Prevlaca peninsula. But
the offer was rejected by the Bosnian government yesterday.
Its spokesman noted that the peninsula was more than 100km from the proposed
Moslem republic. The government has demanded land near Neum, further north
on the Adriatic coast.
The talks are due to move to Brussels today, where they will be joined by EU
foreign ministers.
Meanwhile, the UN yesterday suspended its humanitarian airlift to the
Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, after one of its aircraft was hit by machinegun
fire.
In Serbia President Milosevic's Socialists announced they had won 122 of 250
parliamentary seats contested in weekend elections, with 90 per cent of the
votes counted. But party officials privately predicted that they would
capture 126 seats, which would give them an absolute majority.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Craxi may be tried for insurance carve-up
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Milan magistrates yesterday asked that Mr Bettino Craxi, former leader of
the Socialist party, be sent for trial along with 12 others on corruption
charges related to an L17bn (Pounds 6.77m) insurance deal.
The deal was for a carve-up of the lucrative insurance business covering the
130,000 employees of Eni, the state oil concern, in favour of Sai, an
insurance company controlled by Mr Salvatore Ligresti, the Milan
construction magnate.
Mr Craxi, along with Mr Severino Citaristi, former treasurer of the
Christian Democrat party, was described as instigator of the arrangement
that also envisaged subsequent inclusion of Salomon Brothers in any
insurance business.
Mr Ligresti, known as the 'king of Milan concrete', was also one of those to
be sent for trial. Others included Mr Rinaldo Petrignani, former Italian
ambassador in Washington who was working for Salomon Brothers, Mr Alberto
Grotti, former deputy chairman of Eni, and Mr Sergio Cusani, consultant
close to Socialists standing trial in Milan on separate corruption charges.
Last week Mr Craxi admitted he was fully aware of illicit financing of
political parties while giving evidence during the Cusani trial that centres
on illicit political contributions by Ferruzzi-Montedison. But Mr Craxi
denied taking any money himself or receiving money on behalf of his party
from businessmen.
Yesterday, Milan magistrates said they would be asking him to return to the
witness box.
In a separate development, it emerged yesterday that the Vatican had
responded to Milan magistrates' requests for information surrounding L92bn
in treasury bills that were cashed by the IOR, the Holy See's bank. The
treasury bills formed part of the bribe paid by Ferruzzi-Montedison to the
political parties to ensure the group extricated itself from its Enimont
joint chemical's venture with Eni.
The European Commission yesterday gave the go-ahead to the acquisition by
Pilkington, the British glassmaker, and Techint Finanziaria of Italy, of
Societa Italiana Vetro. The Commission said it had completed its
investigation under the merger control regulation and decided not to oppose
the transaction.
Arrangements have been made to complete the acquisition later this week.

<TEXT>
Belgium's French-speaking socialists are bracing themselves for a troubled
new year, after a magistrate asked for parliamentary immunity of three
socialist ministers to be lifted so she could pursue her investigation into
a political scandal.
Mrs Veronique Ancia, an investigating magistrate from Liege, is following up
allegations that francophone socialists were bribed to award a 1988 contract
for military helicopters to Agusta, the Italian aircraft manufacturer.
On Monday, she asked the Belgian parliament and the assemblies of the
Walloon region and French-speaking community to lift the immunity of Mr Guy
Coeme, Belgian communications minister, Mr Guy Spitaels, minister-president
of Wallonia, and Mr Guy Mathot, Walloon minister of internal affairs.
The request - which should be answered by the end of January - was not
unexpected. But it could herald a new phase in the complex inquiry, which
has been hampered by lack of resources. Parliament officials said the case
did not imply that the trio were under suspicion themselves. The officials
said if immunity was not lifted, the Liege authorities would be restricted
in use of evidence supplied by the ministers.
Mrs Ancia's inquiries have already taken her to Italy, where she questioned
Mr Bettino Craxi, former Italian socialist leader. She also spoke to Mr
Roberto d'Alessandro, chairman of Agusta, who was imprisoned earlier this
year in connection with separate bribery allegations. Mrs Ancia is also
examining links with the unsolved murder in 1991 of Mr Andre Cools, a
prominent Liege socialist politician.
The ministers will only be asked about the Agusta dossier. At the time, Mr
Coeme was Belgium's defence minister, and Mr Spitaels was head of the
French-speaking socialist party. Mr Mathot was described in a 1988 fax sent
from Agusta Belgium to the company's headquarters in Italy as 'one of the
levers' in award of the contract.
Mr Spitaels said on Monday he and senior party officials were not involved
in the Agusta decision. Mr Mathot has also denied involvement. Mr Coeme
claims 'not one centime' was incorrectly spent on the helicopter deal.
The Agusta contract was for 46 helicopters, the last of which should be
delivered to the Belgian army next month. Agusta has repeatedly declared it
was 'completely unconnected with any financial dealings directly or
indirectly aimed at illegal purposes'.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Commission wants equal tax treatment in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday heralded a new approach to tax
harmonisation by adopting a recommendation aimed at ending discrimination
against non-resident taxpayers.
The Commission is calling on member states to grant the same tax benefits to
200,000-300,000 EU citizens working beyond the borders of their home country
as they currently do to residents. Many cross-border workers are unable to
claim family and married couple tax allowances at home or abroad.
The Commission has asked governments to bring national legislation and
bilateral tax agreements with other EU members into line with the
recommendation by 1995. If national rules are not harmonised, a formal
directive could be proposed. Brussels will continue to pursue governments
through the European Court of Justice, using the recommendation as a basis
for complaints.
Senior Commission officials said yesterday the approach was one way of
unblocking proposals on tax, which require unanimous approval from member
states. Such measures are often opposed by governments which fear losing
revenue and sovereignty over tax matters. A broad recommendation could be
used, for example, to speed harmonisation of tax treatment for small and
medium-sized companies.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Greece's constitutional study fails to impress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Greece yesterday proposed setting up a committee of 'wise men' to study a
future European constitution when it takes over the presidency of the
European Union in the New Year, but the plan met a cool response.
Britain, France and Germany yesterday all expressed polite reservations
about the idea floated in Brussels by Mr Theodoros Pangalos, Greek minister
for European affairs.
The idea of opening up a 'post-Maastricht debate' on the future of the EU
has been circulating recently, driven partly by fears that the 12-strong
Union could become unwieldy if it takes in Austria, Finland, Sweden and
Norway.
Mr Pangalos, an outspoken Greek socialist, said his idea of a high-powered
independent group of constitutional experts was modelled on the 'Dooge
committee', which paved the way for the 1985 Single European Act creating an
integrated market by 1992.
He added that he was frustrated by recent debate about the institutional
impact of enlargement, because it focused on secondary issues such as the
number of European Commissioners and the balance of voting power between
large and small states.
He suggested that the committee could produce a report for heads of
government at the European summit in Corfu in June, well in advance of the
scheduled 1996 conference which will review Maastricht. 'It is better to
have talks about institutional questions now rather than have the question
rise up continually like the Loch Ness Monster,' he said.
Greece takes over the EU presidency on January 1.

The offensive reverses an 11-month truce between the Commission, which is

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French retail prices were virtually static last month with a rise of just
0.1 per cent, according to Insee, the state statistics institute, writes
Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. The figures partly reflected the sluggish state of
the French economy.
The negligible rise in November's prices means that French retail price
inflation has risen by a modest 2.2 per cent since the start of this year.
The retail sector has come under intense strain and manufacturers in some
sectors, notably food and clothing, have been forced to cut prices.
Strains on the consumer sector were underlined by publication of a Paris
Chamber of Commerce and Industry study showing that retail sales fell in
November compared with October. Hypermarkets and supermarkets were worst
affected, with department stores mustering a slight rise.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Brussels clears aid for Aer Lingus
</HEADLINE>

   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday authorised a IPounds 175m (Pounds 168m)
equity injection by the Irish government into Aer Lingus, its troubled state
airline, as part of a big restructuring package to return it to commercial
viability.
However, the Commission has attached strict conditions over the use of the
aid 'to avoid any effects which could be contrary to the common interest'.
These include:
Aer Lingus must not expand its operating fleet during the two-year
restructuring plan.
Aer Lingus' European operations, transatlantic operations and a proposed
'low-cost, no-frills' operation known as Aer Lingus Express - planned for
the Dublin-London route - will be operated as separate legal entities with
separate accounts.
Aer Lingus Express must only use existing aircraft in its fleet if
established during the restructuring period.
No additional seating capacity will be placed on its Ireland-UK routes
during the restructuring programme.
The equity is to be used only for restructuring and not for acquiring
shareholdings in any Community carrier.
No further grant aid is to be given to Aer Lingus.
Sir Michael Bishop, the chairman of British Midland, Aer Lingus' main
competitor on the busy Dublin-Heathrow route, yesterday welcomed 'the strong
and meaningful conditions imposed by the Commission' and called it a
'landmark decision in staunching the unconditional flow of money into
loss-making European state-owned airlines by national governments'. But he
warned that if it transpires that the aid is used other than solely for
restructuring 'we will consider legal action'.
He said that concerns expressed by Aer Lingus' competitors over the danger
of cross-subsidising of 'uneconomic fares' by Aer Lingus on the
Dublin-London route 'appears to have been ignored by today's ruling'.
Aer Lingus, which has debts of IPounds 550m, yesterday welcomed the
Commission decision. It said the restrictions on the aid would affect its
ability to compete and that it expected to return to 'modest profitability'
in 1994-95.
The equity is to be paid in three tranches. The first of IPounds 75m will be
made before the end of the year; IPounds 56m of this is to be used to
finance redundancies, the remainder to reduce debt. The two other tranches
of IPounds 50m each will also be used for debt reduction and will be made in
1994 and 1995.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Walesa tells how to handle Zhirinovsky: Anthony Robinson and
Christopher Bobinski hear how the west should react to Russia's vote winner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The people of Poland were shocked three years ago when a quarter of them
voted for an obscure Polish-Canadian called Stan Tyminski in the elections
which brought Lech Walesa to the presidential palace. Mr Vladimir
Zhirinovsky won a similar share in last week's Russian elections. But when
Poles voted again three months ago Stan Tyminski and his 'Party X' won less
than 5 per cent of votes and thus failed to gain any representation in the
new parliament.
Is Mr Zhirinovsky destined for a similar descent into obscurity? According
to President Walesa what happened in Russia was no surprise. 'I have said a
thousand times that events in the post-communist world follow a different
logic than to those in the west.'
Economic deprivation makes the electorate vulnerable to the sort of populist
'solutions' offered by people like Mr Tyminski and Mr Zhirinovsky. 'This is
a phase which the post-communist countries go through,' Mr Walesa said.
'It does not lead to a return to communism, but it does open the way for the
return to power of the 'activists' I mentioned earlier, people who will do
everything necessary, including turning their party cards from red to green,
in order to regain power.'
So does this mean that the market reformers should slow their pace? Mr
Walesa thinks not. 'In Poland's case, Leszek Balcerowicz (the architect of
Poland's shock therapy reforms) did a good job. A man like him is needed in
every post-communist country. But I said from the start that men like
Balcerowicz need a twin, a whole group of people, who come after him, to
pick up the pieces.'
Poles are acutely aware of the differences between their country, with its
Catholic faith and traditional western orientation, and Russia with its
imperial past, weak democratic traditions, huge size and ethnic complexity.
They recognise differences between the unknown, rootless Tyminski and the
better educated, better known and more deeply rooted Zhirinovsky with his
gut feel for the depth of Russian self-pity and resentment.
But, having been the pioneers of economic shock therapy only four years ago,
Poles empathise with the struggling citizens of Russia and other former
Soviet states. Polish economists in particular are aware that the really
painful stage of structural reform, involving mass redundancies and soaring
unemployment, has hardly even begun in Russia or in neighbouring Ukraine.
Asked how the west should react to the snapshot of Russia presented by the
election results, President Walesa returned to his view that the west had
failed to work out a constructive policy towards the former communist world
and remained hobbled by attitudes formed during the cold war.
Like his counterparts throughout central Europe and the Baltic states, Mr
Walesa argues that the former Soviet-controlled states of the region are
best equipped to become a channel of western support for continuing reform
in Russia. But he adds that the former Soviet satellite countries will only
be able to play such a role if they are securely integrated into hitherto
exclusively western structures like the European Union and Nato.
'In the old days when Europe was divided into hostile blocs it made sense
not to admit poorer, less-developed states who would perhaps weaken the
overall strength of the western bloc. But now that the Warsaw Pact has
disappeared this argument no longer applies and we should be admitted into
the European house even though we are poorer cousins,' he said.
'The top priority now is to stop Russia falling prey to anarchy and the most
effective way would be to channel assistance through countries like Poland.
We not only have recent experience of market reforms but also open borders
with the eastern countries. We offer the best and cheapest way of reducing
the security risks in this region and help strengthen Russia's reformers.'
This view is shared by many other leaders in the region who fear being left
in limbo between east and west. After the Russian elections their views will
not be so easy to ignore when Nato leaders meet in Brussels for their summit

<TEXT>
The European Commission has extended the system for providing subsidies to
European Union shipbuilders for another year, and called on non-EU
governments to make greater efforts to cut anti-competitive practices before
the end of next year.
The Commission agreed to maintain production aid for new ships at 9 per cent
of the value of contracts after January 1 1994. Aid for ship conversions and
the building of small ships will be limited to 4.5 per cent.
The EU had hoped to eliminate all shipbuilding subsidies in the Union by the
end of this year, but it was decided in May that the deteriorating economic
position of EU shipbuilders made that politically impossible.
In a statement, the Commission said the EU was looking to end subsidies by
January 1 1995, but only if other parties eliminated all their trade
distorting measures and regulations such as injurious pricing, home credit
schemes and domestic-build requirements.
The Commission singled out the US, Japan and Korea for particular criticism,
and also attacked 'high aid levels' available in certain Efta countries.

Talks to enlarge the European Union were given a boost yesterday when
Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway agreed a formula to accommodate their
environmental, health and safety standards.
All four candidates also agreed they would fully support the foreign and
security policy of the Union. EU negotiators said alarm over the swing
towards the neo-fascists in the Russian elections had enhanced the desire of
the four to belong to a common European security framework. All except
Norway had previously been neutral countries.
Yesterday's breakthrough - described by the EU and candidate countries as 'a
Christmas present' - keeps alive hopes of concluding negotiations by March,
in order to get the four in by January 1995.
'We are very much encouraged by what we have done today,' said Mr Bjorn Tore
Godal, trade minister and chief negotiator for Norway, the most difficult
candidate for the EU to take in, because of a range of special demands on
fish, energy and agriculture.
But all four candidates had felt vulnerable before their electorates on the
environment, where the EU was seen as demanding lower standards in order to
remove impediments to trade.
In the event, EU negotiators came up with a three-pronged approach which on
the face of it looks as though the 12 are adjusting upwards to higher Nordic
and Alpine standards.
If standards are equivalent, even though different - for example on car
emissions - Brussels refused to budge. The candidates get transitional
exemptions where the EC has decided to raise standards, but not yet (for
instance on safety belts). Crucially, to deal with the most sensitive areas
such as health labelling on products and pesticides, the candidates will get
transitional exemptions with a review after four years, by when all four
said yesterday they expected to be inside the EU with a full vote.
Among other issues settled yesterday was a derogation to the Swedes on snus,
or oral moist snuff, regarded as a health hazard outside Sweden and Norway.
Mr Ulf Dinkelspiel, Sweden's minister for Europe, said it had 'saved my
Christmas'.
The accords received an enthusiastic welcome from Sweden's mainstream
parties, with the leadership of the opposition Social Democratic party
adding crucial support.
Opposition to Sweden's membership stands at near 50 per cent, with less than
30 per cent in favour. As a result, winning over opposition among supporters
of the Social Democrats, Sweden's biggest political party, is seen as vital
to securing a 'yes' to membership in a planned referendum.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Kravchuk confident of nuclear accord
</HEADLINE>

   KIEV, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Leonid Kravchuk claimed last night that an agreement had been
reached with the US and Russia to dismantle Ukraine's nuclear arms - but
Washington was more cautious, saying only that progress had been made.
Mr Kravchuk told reporters: 'We have already agreed with the US and Russia
that there will be a tripartite agreement on compensation, (security)
guarantees, technical and scientific aid.'
He said he and US Vice President Al Gore discussed the agreement during a
brief meeting in Budapest on Saturday. But the Ukrainian leader did not say
when such an agreement would be signed.
A Ukrainian government official said at the weekend there was preliminary
agreement with Russia and the US on the idea of compensation for Ukraine's
nuclear arsenal. Mr Kravchuk's reference to security guarantees and
dismantlement aid went much further.
The Ukrainian parliament, during its ratification of the Start-1 nuclear
arms reduction treaty last month, put three main conditions on relinquishing
all its 176 long-range missiles and 37 strategic bombers: uranium
compensation, dismantlement aid and security guarantees. Parliament has not
retreated from its conditions and at a session yesterday it questioned the
government's decision to take 17 nuclear missiles off military alert without
parliament's approval.
On Monday Ukraine announced that 20 of its 46 modern SS-24 missiles would be
deactivated by year's end. The rest could be taken off military alert by the
end of 1994. Ten of Ukraine's 130 SS-19s have already been dismantled.
Officials in Washington said that although significant progress had been
made in the talks between Ukraine, Russia and the US in recent days, Mr
Kravchuk's comments last night represented a wish list rather than an
agreement.
Mr Strobe Talbott, the State Department's special adviser on the former
Soviet Union, said that he was 'somewhat encouraged,' but that the talks so
far could not be described as reaching a final agreement.
'The two sides are moving closer together,' he said.
Ukraine has told Russian and US envoys that it wants a formal document
spelling out the compensation and security guarantees it will get in
exchange for giving up the nuclear weapons on its territory, but Russia
would like a less formal understanding.
While Russia believes its own security guarantee should be enough for
Ukraine, the Kiev government has asked the western nuclear powers for a
commitment, since it is reluctant to accept a guarantee from the nation it
views as the greatest threat to its security.
But the US is unlikely to agree to anything as binding as a treaty
commitment to defend Ukraine in the event of attack.
US officials have held out the carrot of financial aid, but they argue that
Ukraine must first dismantle the missiles on its territory, as it has
already promised to do, before such aid can start to flow.
President Bill Clinton phoned Mr Kravchuk last month to express
disappointment that the Ukrainian parliament voted for only partial
implementation of Start-1. But US officials were more encouraged this week
by Mr Kravchuk's decision to deactivate some of Ukraine's SS-24s.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Greece's idea of EU future fails to impress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Greece yesterday proposed setting up a committee of 'wise men' to study a
future European constitution when it takes over the presidency of the
European Union in the New Year, but the plan met a cool response from larger
member states.
Britain, France and Germany yesterday all expressed polite reservations
about the idea floated in Brussels by Mr Theodoros Pangalos, Greek minister
for European affairs.
The idea of opening up a 'post-Maastricht debate' on the future of the
European Union has been circulating recently, driven partly by fears that
the 12-strong EU could become unwieldy if it takes in Austria, Finland,
Sweden and Norway.
Mr Pangalos, an outspoken Greek socialist, said his idea of a high-powered
independent group of constitutional experts was modelled on the 'Dooge
committee', which paved the way for the 1985 Single European Act creating an
integrated market by 1992.
He added that he was frustrated by recent debate about the institutional
impact of enlargement, because it focused on secondary issues such as the
number of European Commissioners and the balance of voting power between
large and small states.
He suggested that the committee could produce a report for heads of
government at the European summit in Corfu in June, well in advance of the
scheduled 1996 conference which will review Maastricht.
'It is better to have talks about institutional questions now rather than
have the question rise up continually like the Loch Ness Monster,' he said.
The Greek government takes over the EU presidency from Belgium on January 1.
Mr Pangalos described the presidency's goals as tackling unemployment,
implementing the European Commission White Paper on competitivness and
growth, and producing new initiatives on health, education, culture and
consumer protection.
On external affairs, he hinted at plans for a new EU 'joint action' on
nuclear non-proliferation and new measures to strengthen the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
Yet Mr Pangalos accused the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia of
harbouring territorial claims against the northern Greek province of
Macedonia and of engaging in other 'provocations' through the design of its
flag.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Commission finds tax harmony
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission yesterday heralded a new approach to tax
harmonisation by adopting a recommendation aimed at ending discrimination
against non-resident taxpayers.
The Commission is calling on member states to grant the same tax benefits to
200,000-300,000 EU citizens working beyond the borders of their home country
as they currently do to residents. Many cross-border workers are unable to
claim family and married couple tax allowances at home or abroad.
The Commission has asked governments to bring national legislation and
bilateral tax agreements with other EU members into line with the
recommendation by 1995. If national rules are not harmonised, a formal
directive could be proposed. Brussels will continue to pursue governments
through the European Court of Justice, using the recommendation as a basis
for complaints.
Senior Commission officials said yesterday the approach was one way of
unblocking proposals on tax, which require unanimous approval from member
states. Such measures are often opposed by governments which fear losing
revenue and sovereignty over tax matters. A broad recommendation could be
used, for example, to speed harmonisation of tax treatment for small and
medium-sized companies.
A similar proposal on non-resident taxation was first proposed by the
Commission in 1979 and held up by member states until last year, when it was
abandoned. Court cases against individual governments were hampered by the
Commission's lack of clear principles about how to harmonise such taxes.
The Commission is recommending that citizens who receive at least 75 per
cent of their income in a member state other than their home country should
be eligible for residents' benefits in the state where they work. Mrs
Christiane Scrivener, tax commissioner, said yesterday the proposal would
benefit EU citizens who live on one side of a border and work on the other,
and those who take advantage of the single market by working away from home.

</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
France should be more selective in its military equipment programmes and
organise better 'a division of labour' with its EU partners, a high-level
planning body recommended yesterday.
The report on the French defence industry's future by the Commissariat
general du Plan, an official think-tank, says international co-operation is
difficult in nuclear weapons but France will have to 'redefine its concept
of near-total independence in armaments'.
It suggests Paris should define the military technologies it wants to retain
in France and what it is prepared to buy from other EU countries without
endangering 'national autonomy' in exports.
Direct employment in the French arms sector has fallen by 80,000 in the past
decade to 230,000 this year, and could decline by up to 93,000 by 1997.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Inflation in France at 0.1% in November
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
French retail prices were virtually static last month with a rise of just
0.1 per cent, according to Insee, the state statistics institute. The
figures partly reflected the sluggish state of the French economy.
The negligible rise in November's prices means that French retail price
inflation has risen by a modest 2.2 per cent since the start of this year.
The retail sector has come under intense strain and manufacturers in some
sectors, notably food and clothing, have been forced to cut prices.
The price of private sector manufactured goods fell 0.2 per cent last month,
according to Insee, mainly due to the cut in clothing prices. But the cost
of unseasonal perishable products, notably fresh fruit and vegetables, rose
sharply.
Strains on the consumer sector were underlined by publication of a Paris
Chamber of Commerce and Industry study showing that retail sales fell in
November compared with October. Hypermarkets and supermarkets were worst
affected, with department stores mustering a slight rise.
However, the French franc strengthened again on further evidence of the
impact of France's economic rigour. The franc, which recently returned to
its old European exchange rate mechanism trading bands for the first time
since the summer currency crisis, rose to FFr3.4063 against the D-Mark from
FFr3.4079.

FT  22 DEC 93 / German miners take pay cut in bid to save jobs

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
West Germany's 87,000 coal miners have agreed to take a pay cut and work
fewer hours in a last ditch attempt to stave off tens of thousands of
redundancies.
IG Bergbau und Energie (IGBE), the miners' trade union, and the Association
of German coal producers have agreed a pay cut of 9 per cent for two years
starting on January 1. In return, each miner will work 120 fewer hours per
year - equivalent to a four-day working week.
The new model follows an agreement in November between the IG Metall
engineering union and Volkswagen which will introduce a 28.8 hour week and
lower wages and save up to 30,000 jobs.
IGBE hopes the new deal will save 10,000 jobs in the Ruhr valley mines. But
coal industry officials say the measures will only 'temporarily delay
inevitable lay-offs'.
German mining companies plan to axe 22,000 jobs by the end of 1995. Of
these, 10,000 go next February when Ruhrkohle, the largest company and
producer of 80 per cent of west German coal, partially closes three pits in
order to reduce output by 3m tonnes of coking coal. The new wage agreement
will allow the 10,000 miners to continue working in the pits or be
transferred to other pits where working time has been reduced.
Meanwhile engineering workers in south-west Germany have been offered a pay
and conditions deal which will reduce their income by 15 per cent, IG Metall
union officials claimed yesterday.
They said earnings would be cut by employers' proposals to limit overtime
entitlements, reduce holidays and scrap holiday bonuses.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Yeltsin hint of new economic course
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
President Boris Yeltsin yesterday foreshadowed a shift in Russian economic
policy away from fighting inflation in favour of more emphasis on investment
and production.
The Russian leader said the large vote won by the neo-fascist Liberal
Democratic Party of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky was 'a vote against poverty' by
those on low incomes.
'Do not forget the poor, there are many of them,' Mr Yeltsin said while
touring a building exhibition.
Later, Mr Yeltsin told the presidential council of advisers he intended to
'co-operate constructively' with the new parliament - without specifying
with which parties he meant to work. Council members said the president
wanted the reforms to take on 'a more social orientation', Itar Tass news
agency reported.
Presidential aides said a struggle was going on last night over whether the
president should use a press conference today to say he is ready to work
with 'constructive' forces in the new parliament - but it is not clear
whether this term will include Mr Zhirinovsky's party, or only the four
reformist parties.
The Interfax news agency reported that Mr Zhirinovsky held a long
conversation on Monday night with Mr Nikolai Medvedev, Mr Yeltsin's head of
administration - a sign that Mr Yeltsin is anxious to explore all options.
The new parliament is unlikely to have a majority for either pro- or
anti-reform parties as there will be around 140 independent deputies.
However, it is likely the anti-reformers will be the largest single bloc -
and the signs were yesterday that they are trying to work together.
Mr Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist party, the third largest bloc
in the lower house, said yesterday he was ready to work with any party which
'struggles for the integrity of our country, peace and well-being of every
family'. He said he did not believe the Liberal Democrats were a fascist
party, and said the formation of an anti-fascist front, proposed by Mr Yegor
Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, would lead only to civil war.
Mr Yeltsin's comments on the poor came after an indication from Mr Gaidar
that he would consider moving the government's priorities away from fighting
inflation to increasing investment and raising production. This in turn
followed comments by Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, that the
strategy of fighting inflation associated with Mr Gaidar had failed and that
he 'had better think again'.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister in charge of foreign economic
relations, said yesterday many underutilised resources could be brought into
production without increasing inflation. 'That means of course choosing
which enterprises to support, rather than supporting all even if they are on
the verge of bankruptcy,' he said.

FT  22 DEC 93 / EU grants aid to London's inner city boroughs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
London has become the first European Union capital to be given financial
help from EU aid funds reserved for areas blighted by industrial decline.
Six inner London boroughs - Hackney, Haringey, Newham, Tower Hamlets,
Enfield and Waltham Forest - yesterday joined the traditional industrial
areas of the north and Scotland in being made eligible for substantial
regional aid grants which are devoted to areas hit by high unemployment.
The six boroughs, plus the Isle of Thanet in Kent, should get EU structural
aid worth about Ecu130m (Pounds 99m) over the next three years, out of about
Ecu2bn earmarked for the UK as a whole.
Other cities covered by the same funds include West Berlin, as part of the
Union's attempt to help with the costs of German reunification, and
depressed satellite cities around Madrid.
In allocating the funds, the European Commission resisted UK government
efforts to transfer substantial aid funds to southern England at the expense
of traditional industrial areas in the north and Scotland.
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, said yesterday the Commission's
response to the government's case for London had been wholly inadequate. The
Commission's proposals included only parts of the areas put forward.
The EU allocations announced yesterday total Ecu7.2bn and are designed to
help areas in industrial decline in 1994-96. That is a small amount of the
EU's Ecu156bn regional aid budget for 1994-99, about 70 per cent of which
goes to the four poorest member states (Portugal, Greece, Ireland and Spain)
and the most backward regions in the other eight countries, under the
so-called Objective 1 aid programme.
But yesterday's Objective 2 share-out is of particular significance to areas
in the most developed economies that have suffered from urban decay and the
decline of traditional industries.
The UK and France, both expecting more than Ecu2bn after the first main
share-out for backward regions, were the main winners yesterday because of
their high industrial unemployment. Both had their initial bids cut sharply.
The Objective 2 pot is limited to no more than 15 per cent of the EU
population, and the member states had put in bids covering 23 per cent of
their inhabitants.
The UK had put in a bid covering 40 per cent of its population, and France
wanted 33 per cent coverage. In the event, they received well over the
average, at respectively 31 per cent (17.7m Britons) and 26 per cent (14.6m
French).
The Commission rejected British claims for special status for areas ranging
from the Isle of Wight to the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea.

FT  22 DEC 93 / British Gas to lose household supply monopoly: Government
clears the way for introduction of consumer choice by 1998
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government yesterday cleared the way for the introduction of full
competition in gas supply to 18m households by 1998 but decided to allow
British Gas to remain a single company.
Independent suppliers, which have been clamouring for early entry into a
market that was worth more than Pounds 5.6bn to British Gas last year, said
competition could bring households average annual savings of Pounds
35-Pounds 40.
Competition will also bring an end to the common national tariff. Ofgas, the
industry regulator, says regional variations in gas prices are likely to be
within 'a couple of percentage points'.
Yesterday's announcement was made by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, who rejected two central recommendations from a recent
Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the gas industry.
The MMC had called for the divestment by 1997 of British Gas's
transportation business from its trading division. It also recommended
delaying the abolition of British Gas's monopoly over the mainly household
market until 2000 or beyond.
But the government said the gas market should be opened up to full
competition by 1998, when consumers will be able to choose between different
suppliers of electricity. 'Choice for consumers is the best possible
guarantee that they will obtain value for money,' said Mr Heseltine.
Under the plan, 5 per cent of the market will be opened in 1996 and 1997 to
ensure that the system is ready for full competition.
Mr Heseltine said the complete separation of the transportation and trading
arms of British Gas, as envisaged in the company's restructuring plan
announced last week, was likely 'to overcome the obstacle to competition
which the MMC identified'.
British Gas yesterday welcomed both decisions, although Mr Cedric Brown,
chief executive, called on Ofgas to relax the financial regulation which has
dampened the company's profitability since its privatisation in 1986. The
timetable to abolish the monopoly was welcomed by independent suppliers.
Some, however, were less enthusiastic about British Gas remaining intact.
Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director, said she reserved the right to call
for divestment 'if there was any sign of accounting or cultural fiddling'
between the separated business units.
The Gas Consumers Association described the government plan as a 'masterly
compromise between the evolution or revolution' of the domestic gas market.
But Mr Ian Powe, its director, said Ms Spottiswoode was likely to come under
pressure to ensure that the new gas suppliers served all customers within a
market, and not just the most profitable.
She said an insurance scheme would have to be set up to ensure that
customers were protected in the event of a supplier going out of business.
Details of a new gas supply licence will be proposed early next year.
Companies which want to enter the market will have to show financial
strength and access to gas supplies.
Ms Spottiswoode said she was determined that British Gas's national monopoly
would not be replaced with regional energy monopolies, although she conceded
that the regional electricity companies would be in a strong marketing
position.
British Gas shares closed yesterday at 347p, down 10p.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Western banks blamed for Bombay securities scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Four foreign banks were accused by Indian MPs yesterday of being 'the
originators' and 'the biggest players' in last year's Rs40bn (Pounds 850m)
Bombay securities market scandal.
An all-party committee of MPs said the banks - Standard Chartered of the UK,
Australian-owned ANZ Grindlays, and Citibank and Bank of America of the US -
should have their licences suspended.
The MPs issued a damning report on the country's financial system and called
for reform and for severe punishment of those held responsible for the
affair.
The report also rounded on Indian banks, stockbrokers, the Reserve Bank of
India - the country's central bank - and the Ministry of Finance for failing
to regulate and supervise the markets properly.
It fell short of criticising Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, by
name but said he was responsible to parliament for his ministry's
shortcomings.
Analysts in Delhi last night were busy digesting the 322-page document,
which has taken more than a year to produce. The initial reaction was that
political impact would be limited because Mr Manmohan Singh, the architect
of India's economic reforms, would be most unlikely to resign, nor would any
of the three present and former ministers named in the report.
Government ministers were meeting late last night under the chairmanship of
Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, to consider their reaction.
Analysts said the government would have to take serious note of the
committee's recommendations on financial reforms and on punishment for
alleged wrongdoers, including the foreign banks.
Standard Chartered said it was wrong to single out foreign banks for
punishment when Indian banks were equally involved in the scandal.
Suspension of bank was an 'extreme' punishment that would not square with
India's planned globalisation of its economy.
Citibank and BankAmerica were both guarded in their reaction.
Citibank, however, hinted that it would be a mistake for India to throw out
some of its biggest foreign banks. It said it could make a 'special
contribution' to India's banking sector, especially with the development of
services such as credit cards, automated teller machines, corporate finance
and corporate cash management.
Evidence emerged in April 1992 that funds were being illegally siphoned out
of the banking system into the stock market through the collusion of
brokers, banks and public and private-sector companies. As the huge scale of
the abuses emerged, a cabinet minister resigned and about 20 people were
arrested.

FT  22 DEC 93 / Hope of deal with S African right revived
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CAPE TOWN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Negotiators appeared last night to step back from the brink of failure in
talks aimed at persuading rightwing parties to accept South Africa's
transition to majority rule.
The crucial talks broke down earlier in the day, dealing a blow to prospects
for peace ahead of next year's all-race elections. But hopes were raised
again late last night when negotiators from the so-called Freedom Alliance
agreed to submit a compromise proposed by the government and the African
National Congress to their leaders.
If accepted, this proposal would bind the right wing, provided its
constitutional demands are met, to support the transition to democracy and
to participate in the all-race elections.
Parliament will today pass a post-apartheid constitution which has been
rejected by the Freedom Alliance, which comprises black and white groups,
including the Inkatha Freedom party of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and the
Afrikaner Volksfront of General Constand Viljoen.
The government last night arranged for a special sitting of parliament early
next year which could be used to vote amendments to the constitution if they
can be negotiated by then.
Previously negotiators had until last night to amend the constitution to
satisfy rightwing demands for greater regional autonomy, but talks ran into
difficulties before substantive amendments were discussed.
The chief government negotiator, Mr Roelf Meyer, said later that negotiators
had found a way to keep talking after missing the Tuesday deadline for
amendments to the transitional constitution due for adoption today.
'We have agreed tonight on a way forward regarding further negotiations.
We've got the best deal we could get,' he said.
When the talks broke down earlier, Gen Viljoen warned this 'may have dashed
the chance of a peaceful solution in South Africa'. Gen Viljoen, whose party
is believed to represent a majority of conservative Afrikaners, said the
stalemate made it impossible for him to sign a provisional accord with the
ANC endorsing an Afrikaner 'homeland'.
The agreement was published by the two groups yesterday, and verbally
endorsed by them, but Gen Viljoen refused to sign it.
He implied that he was not willing to split the Freedom Alliance by making a
separate peace with the ANC. He blamed the ANC and the government for
undermining yesterday's talks by insisting that the alliance commit itself
to participating in elections and the Transitional Ex-ecutive Council before
constitutional amendments could be discussed.
Mr Tom Langley, a Freedom Alliance negotiator, said the ANC and the
government were trying to humiliate his group: 'The ANC were, as always,
arrogant and uncompromising as if the country belongs to them and them
alone.'
Meanwhile, the ANC-dominated Transitional Executive Council continued on its
collision path with the KwaZulu homeland of Chief Buthelezi, summoning the
KwaZulu commissioner of police to appear before it and sending South African
police to intervene in KwaZulu.

FT  21 DEC 93 / International Company News: Axa 1993 results forecast to
surpass expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Axa, the second largest French insurance group, is likely to fare better
than originally expected in 1993, according to Mr Claude Bebear, chairman.
Mr Bebear, at a conference in Paris, said that although the performance of
the core French business was 'still inadequate', the 1993 results of both
the French group and Equitable, its US associate, should surpass
expectations.
Axa, like other French insurers, has been affected by the economic recession
and also by the precarious state of the property market, which has limited
its ability to raise capital through asset sales. It has also been blighted
by the poor performance of Equitable in the US.
The group warned this autumn that it did not expect its net profits for 1993
to be much higher than the FFr1.5bn (Dollars 257m) it produced in 1992.
However Mr Bebear yesterday indicated that the final result would be higher.
Mr Tim Dawson, European insurance analyst at Lehman Brothers in London,
forecasts net profits of FFr1.8bn for Axa in 1993 with further recovery to
around FFr2.4bn for 1994.
'Frankly it's always difficult to forecast Axa's results because of its
traditional reliance on capital gains,' he said. 'It's difficult to imagine
a significant change on the operating front. The implication of Mr Bebear's
remarks must be that it has made higher capital gains in the final weeks of
the year.'
Canal-Plus, the French media group, is launching two new television channels
in Spain as part of its strategy of expanding its interests outside France.
The new channels - Minimax for children and Cine-Classics for classic movies
 -will be launched on New Year's Eve and will form part of a package of
programming for Canal-Plus's Spanish subscribers.
Canal-Plus has for the past few years been building up its international
interests by 'exporting' the pay-TV service and thematic channels originally
developed for the French market into other European countries, notably
Spain.
The initial rationale for this expansion was to counter the inevitable
slowdown in growth of Canal-Plus's original French pay-TV service, which is
now approaching maturity. However, Canal-Plus is also anxious to build up
other sources of revenue as it prepares to renegotiate its pay-TV franchise
with the French government. The terms of the new franchise are expected to
be considerably less favourable than the existing agreement.
As a result, Canal-Plus is accelerating its expansion plans. Last week it
warned that it may face a sharp fall in net profits for 1994.

FT  21 DEC 93 / UN appeal for end to Bosnia arms embargo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS, UN Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The UN General Assembly last night appealed to the Security Council to lift
the arms embargo against Bosnia Hercegovina, a step long proposed by the US.
The resolution, which is only a recommendation and which the Council is free
to ignore, was adopted as Bosnia agreed to drop charges that Britain, by
supporting the embargo, violated the Genocide Convention.
Bosnia had prepared a case for submission to the World Court on the grounds
that Britain, as the most ardent objector to lifting sanctions, was
primarily responsible for their retention.
It was evident from a joint UK-Bosnian statement which was issued shortly
before the Assembly vote, that a strong inducement not to proceed with the
case was Britain's pledge to ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid as well
as a renewed commitment to a negotiated political settlement.
The Assembly resolution, adopted by 109 votes to none with 57 abstentions,
called for an end to the 'working status' of Belgrade's UN delegation.
In 30 operative paragraphs, it also called on the Security Council to ensure
that Belgrade halted all military aid to the Bosnian Serbs and demanded an
end to the siege of Sarajevo and other UN-designated 'safe areas'.
Also proposed was the urgent reconvening of the London conference on former
Yugoslavia to try to work out a settlement.
The Security Council was called upon to ensure that the proposals in the
'Geneva peace package' conformed with the UN Charter, its previous
resolution and the London conference principles.
Bosnia has repeatedly charged that the plan prepared by Lord Owen and Mr
Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators, violated the Charter and
Council decisions.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Bundeswehr to pull out of Somalia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The German cabinet last night decided to pull its 1,700 troops out of
Somalia months after the country embarked on its first peace-keeping mission
with the United Nations.
The decision coincides with the phased withdrawal of US troops due to be
completed next March.
The troops were primarily involved in logistical, medical and infrastructure
activity and had not been based in Mogadishu, the capital.
They were dispatched to Somalia after a long political debate about
Germany's military role in the post-cold war era. Its activities had been
restricted by the constitution, which confined all military operations to
Nato territory.
Chancellor Helmet Kohl's governing Christian Democrats have lobbied hard for
Germany gradually to play a more active role internationally.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Spanish movie-goers locked out: Protest over law against
non-EU films
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A government attempt to keep out US films yesterday prompted Spain's cinema
theatre owners to lock out film-goers.
The unprecedented protest, which closed down all the country's 1,807 cinemas
for 24 hours, followed emergency legislation that aims to protect the
domestic film sector by forcing exhibitors to screen one production
originating from the European Union for every two produced outside the EU.
The new law was hurriedly drafted in the mistaken belief that the Gatt
agreement would include the audovisual industry in the trade liberalisation
measures. The legislation, which was approved by the cabinet as a decree law
just five days before the December 15 Gatt deadline, is due to be ratified
by MPs tomorrow.
If the law stands and is rigorously implemented it is likely to keep the
cinema public, which prefers Hollywood productions, at home and drive many
exhibitors who depend on US films for the bulk of their profits, out of
business.
The law states that distributors seeking a dubbing licence for a non-EU film
must satisfy the authorities they have earned Pta20m (Dollars 143,000) from
screening a Spanish or EU-produced film.
The regulations for obtaining a second non-EU licence are convoluted: the
distributors must have earned a minimum of Pta50m from screening the EU film
in question in more than 10 cinemas in population centres of more than
45,000 and they must also have previously dubbed the EU film into one of
Spain's minority languages such as Catalan or Basque.
Under the previous guidelines distributors got licenses to dub four foreign
films for every one Spanish production they marketed. US films account for
nearly half the 990 films shown in Spain during 1992, to 62.5m customers
representing 77 per cent of the film-going public and for 75 per cent of the
Pta36.2bn total box office takings.
The Spanish film industry, which the government subsidises and now seeks to
protect further, is on the whole meagre and of low quality. Of the 320 new
productions released in Spain last year, only 32 were Spanish and of these
only nine grossed more than Pta100m.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (18): Cost-cutting path to profitability -
Forestry industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dark days seem to be over in Swedish forestry, but it is no thanks to
the market.
The country's leading pulp and paper groups have forged a path back to
profitability, despite the widespread overcapacity which continues to
afflict the industry and a two-year downward spiral in prices. Any hope that
the sharp depreciation of the krona would bring rapid gains has already been
dispelled.
A combination of cost-cutting, lower interest rates and a strong dollar have
brought the turnround which the market has failed to provide. They explain
why Stora, Europe's biggest pulp and paper group, will be back in profit
this year after last year's SKr1.36bn loss and why SCA, Sweden's
second-biggest forestry group, is looking for profits of SKr1.1bn after a
SKr451m surplus in 1992. MoDo, the third-largest company, will improve its
result after last year's SKr1.7bn loss, but a deficit of about SKr600m is
still anticipated.
Mr Jan Remrod, director-general of the Swedish pulp and paper association,
acknowledges the general turnround, but says profitability is still not
satisfactory. Pointing to combined industry profits of SKr12bn in 1989 -
this year the figure is more likely to be in the SKr1bn-2bn range - he notes
'there is still a long way to go.'
Cost-cutting has been the single biggest factor in the revival. Stora
estimates it will have cut costs by SKr4bn in two years by the end of this
year. Most of the sum derives from staff reductions, but there has also been
a SKr1bn benefit from lower wood prices. Similar factors have driven down
MoDo's costs base by SKr1.5bn since 1990.
Additional help has come from the strong dollar, which has brought two
benefits. It has decreased the flow of North American exports to Europe,
while also enabling Swedish producers to increase their exports to
non-European markets.
Vastly improved as the Swedish competitive position now is, there are
several reasons why 1993 has turned out to be a more disappointing year than
was anticipated. The main factors have been the recession in key European
markets and the continuing collapse in hard currency prices, which has
eroded many of the anticipated devaluation gains.
Another reason for the disappointment is that some of the big Swedish groups
have a high percentage of production based in 'hard currency' countries such
as France and Germany, following an acquisitions binge in the late 1980s.
This has made devaluation a disadvantage rather than an advantage in these
areas. Stora, for example, has 20 per cent of its production based in
Germany, 8 per cent in France and 5 per cent in Belgium.
The sharp contrast between the improvement being experienced in Sweden and
difficulties being faced on the continent was highlighted by MoDo, when it
indicated at the nine-month stage that Swedish operating profit had risen by
SKr814m to SKr890m, while operating losses in France doubled to SKr369m from
SKr183m.
The Swedish forestry sector has responded to the situation in a number of
ways. First, there has been an effort to compensate for the depressed state
of the European market by lifting exports to other areas. In percentage
terms the development is striking, even though the EC remains by far
Sweden's most important export market, accounting for 76 per cent of total
exports. In the first 10 months, deliveries to the EC fell 0.3 per cent to
4.49m tonnes, while exports to other markets rose 20.7 per cent to 1.43m
tonnes.
Secondly, forestry groups have virtually suspended investment in new
capacity: where they have invested it has been to improve product quality
and for environmental reasons.
Finally, towards the end of the year there was a concerted effort to lift
prices. Stora led the way, announcing increases for a range of products
including pulp, newsprint, fine paper, and coated magazine paper (LWC). It
calculates that every 5 per cent average rise in prices adds SKr1.4bn to the
bottom line. A 5 per cent increase in volumes, meanwhile, only adds SKr500m.
The key question for 1994 is whether the price rises will stick. In some
cases, the reasons for believing that they will have less to do with market
factors, than with financial ones. In pulp, for example, prices have fallen
so far, that virtually all mills are now operating with negative cash flow.
Numerous observers express cautious optimism that prices have already
stopped falling and they even suggest they have started to rise again for
products such as newsprint and LWC. 'There are many signs that we have seen
the worst,' says Mr Lars-Ake Helgesson, president of Stora.
If the judgment is correct, it will increase the momentum of the recovery
that already looks set to make 1994 a better year for the Swedish forestry
industry than 1993. Yet, caution remains simply because it is still unclear
how Europe's economy will perform next year. Besides, the scope for further
cost-cutting is limited, and pressures are building up for higher wood
prices and wages.
Swedish forestry groups are determined to resist such demands, arguing that
competitive gains have too easily been squandered in the past. In any case,
they stress they need to retain financial muscle to respond to challenges
such as recycling.
It is partly to meet these challenges that SCA and MoDo both announced hefty
rights issues in 1993 and, gratifyingly, found them fully subscribed. It may
also explain why the Swedish government announced a significant
restructuring of its own interests in the sector as a prelude to its biggest
privatisation to date.
The aim is to merge Assi, Doman and Ncb early next year to create Sweden's
fourth-largest forestry group and one of the top 10 in Europe. Following
this, a 49 per cent stake in the combined company will be sold, mainly to
the Swedish public, with targeted receipts of between SKr5bn and SKr8bn.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (19): Hygiene and packaging helps SCA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong bias towards hygiene products and packaging has helped SCA to
become the most profitable of the Swedish forestry groups, writes
Christopher Brown-Humes. Last year when most of its competitors in Finland
and Sweden were heavily in the red, it managed a SKr451m profit. This year
it is set to boost its surplus to about SKr1.1bn.
Hygiene and packaging, which account for about two thirds of SCA's sales,
have felt the effects of fierce international competition far less than
other sectors of the pulp and paper industry, such as pulp and fine paper.
Molnlycke, SCA's hygiene division, has proved a particular success story,
even though it too has started to experience stiffer competition in the
nappies market.
SCA is building on its performance with a SKr3bn investment programme. Half
the amount will be spent on a newsprint plant, based on 100 per cent
recycled paper, at Aylesford in southern England. The South African group
Mondi will be a joint venture partner in the project, which will have a
capacity of 280,000 tonnes a year.
By building the plant in the UK rather than in Sweden, SCA is acknowledging
the fact that it is far more economic to locate newsprint production close
to big population centres in Europe, rather than relying on virgin fibre in
more sparsely-populated Scandinavia.
The company calculates that it will cost SKr2,300-SKr2,500 to produce a
tonne of newsprint in the UK, compared with about SKr3,000 in Sweden.
'Continuing with newsprint production in Scandinavia based on virgin fibre
is going to be risky long-term due to the competitive pressure from
low-priced, waste-based producers. In Sweden we have to concentrate on
products which will give us a competitive edge,' says Mr Sverker Martin-Lof,
SCA president.
Underlining the point, the group is converting one of its existing Swedish
newsprint mills to production of coated magazine paper.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (17): Strong domestic base -
Pharmaceuticals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sweden's cluster of large pharmaceutical companies remains one of the most
promising of its industrial sectors for future expansion on global markets.
The country's advanced technology base of research and development with an
emphasis on high quality and ethical standards provides a strong domestic
base for growth.
Astra and the 'new' Pharmacia are the country's two most highly regarded
pharmaceutical companies and with their differing interests and strategies
they look likely to thrive during the 1990s.
Astra has enjoyed almost unbroken success in recent years and there is no
good reason to believe its fortunes are about to wane. Through the prolonged
Nordic gloom of the current recession, the company has often been the toast
of both the stock market and its own shareholders.
Mr Hakan Mogren, the company's president, told a meeting of London analysts
last month that although this year's sales figures would be affected by the
weakened Swedish krona, the company was expecting a 20 per cent growth in
real terms. 'We continue to rank among the fastest-growing pharmaceutical
companies in the world market', he added.
In the first nine months of the year, Astra enjoyed a 43 per cent increase
in sales - up to SKr16.07bn from SKr11.21bn for the same period of 1992.
Its net earnings shot up by 86 per cent to SKr4.1bn from SKr2.24bn while
earnings per share grew by a similar per cent to Skr6.79 from Skr3.66.
Unlike many of its global competitors, Mr Mogren claimed, Astra is going to
be able to avoid cuts in personnel and downward pressure on its prices. 'We
have good prospects for attaining strong volume growth based on innovative
products and continuing geographical extension of our operations', he said.
The company's success is based on its three core product areas -
gastrointestinal, respiratory and cardiovascular.
A third of Astra's sales in the first nine months of this year came from the
success of Losec, its anti-peptic ulcer agent, which enjoyed total sales
amounting to SKr9.1bn. The drug was launched only two years ago but it has
made impressive strides on world markets, particularly in Europe where it
accounts for a third of sales.
The company's anti-asthma agent Pulmicort increased its sales by 54 per cent
in the first nine months to SKr2.08bn, mainly due to a favourable growth in
sales of its Turbohaler, especially in Spain, France and Italy. Sales of
both Plendil, an anti-hypertensive agent, and Seloken, a beta blocker, have
also proved satisfactory.
Astra hopes to see substantial future growth in the all-important Japanese
and US markets for its core products. By contrast, the 'new' Pharmacia -
which hopes to emerge from state ownership next spring into a fully-fledged
private pharmaceutical and biotechnology company with Volvo as its largest
shareholder - has gone through a confusing period of corporate restructuring
over the past three years.
Over the first nine months of this year the company - as part of Procordia -
made a profit, after financial items, of SKr2.475bn. It ranks among Europe's
top 10 pharmaceutical concerns, with 20,000 employees. Pharmacia is now
Italy's second-largest company in pharmaceuticals since its Dollars 1.5bn
acquisition earlier this year of Erbamont, the Montedison health care
subsidiary of the Italian Feruzzi group with 4 per cent of the market.
Pharmacia's wider range of products are focused on niches across global
health care markets which include growth hormone treatment, ophthalmic
surgery, nutrition and drug delivery, allergy diagnostics, anti-smoking
drugs, prevention and treatment of blood clots and drugs to prevent diseases
of the central nervous system. 'We are striving now for stability despite
the uncertainties about the market,' says Mr Gilles Pajot, head of the
company's corporate business management. 'Not only are we one of the leading
European companies in hospital care products but we have a strong base in
bio-technology know-how.' Pharmacia's short-term strategy is to defend its
existing market positions, grow more in selective areas and rationalise its
portfolio. 'After 1996, we have to grow at least as fast as the market', he
adds. 'But we are laying the foundations for the future.'

FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (15): Monument to reckless lending -
Profile: Securum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Lars Thunell, president of Securum, is gaining a reputation for being one
of Sweden's best-travelled business executives. When your asset portfolio
includes the British Embassy building in Burma, an air charter operation in
Zimbabwe, a skiing lodge in the US, an airport operator in the UK, scores of
properties around Europe and huge real estate and industrial operations in
Sweden, it is easy to see why.
It is not an empire which was built up by design; rather one which was
dumped unceremoniously into Securum's lap a year ago when it was established
as a home for the failed loans within state-owned Nordbanken.
'We are a super conglomerate. The only thing the assets we own have in
common is that they were used as collateral for credits in Nordbanken,' says
Mr Thunell.
Long after Nordbanken has been returned to the private sector, Securum will
stand as a monument to the reckless lending which made the bank the single
biggest casualty of Sweden's financial crisis. It has the dubious
distinction of being Europe's biggest 'bad bank' and one of its largest
property groups after taking over a whopping SKr67bn in sour and
non-strategic credits from Nordbanken. Nordbanken, meanwhile, has made a
rapid and controversial return to profit and could well be re-privatised
during 1995.
By the time Securum has foreclosed on all its properties in the middle of
next year, its total portfolio will be worth between SKr40bn and SKr45bn.
Real estate accounts for 50 per cent of the total, comprising some 2,000
buildings across Sweden, the UK, the US, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain and
other European countries. The rest of the portfolio consists mainly of
industrial operations, hotels, and financial investments. The aim is to get
rid of them lot quickly and efficiently, while maximising the returns for
the taxpayer.
The second part of this equation is crucial to Securum's strategy. The bad
bank concept was pioneered in the US, partly as a result of the crisis in
the savings and loans sector. But Securum has taken the development a stage
further and has a far bigger operational role than its predecessors.
'We want to take an active role and create value. We are not purely a
liquidating company,' says Mr Thunell. With SKr24bn in equity backing, the
company has deliberately been structured for a 15-year wind-down. The
timetable ensures that it is not a distressed seller. More importantly,
given its market position as one of Sweden's leading real estate groups, it
has prevented a flood of new properties on to the market which would only
have depressed values further.
The idea of 'creating value' was clearly demonstrated last month when a
SKr16.6bn merger between Nobel Industries, in which Securum held 72.9 per
cent, and the Dutch chemicals group Akzo was unveiled. Securum won many
plaudits for the way in which the deal was constructed and the differing
concerns of taxpayers, employees, and minority shareholders were addressed.
Securum itself gained a stake of about 20 per cent in Akzo as a result of
the merger, and an unrealised capital gain worth SKr5bn.
Another example of the group's active management style was the way it
restructured the Kramo construction equipment and renting group by putting
four different companies together to give them a better chance of weathering
the deep recession in the Swedish building market. The result is that a
group of companies which last year lost SKr160m will this year break even.
So many differing calculations had to be made at the outset, covering
everything from interest rate and currency trends to property market
developments, that it is difficult to say whether Securum will eventually
need more equity from the government
All but SKr8.9bn of the original SKr24bn of equity had been wiped out by the
mid-year. But that reflects the SKr12bn of credit losses which the group
took during its most intensive restructuring phase. Losses in the second
half of the year and henceforward will be considerably less.
The success of the Nobel deal and the downward trend in interest rates means
that the group is ahead of where it expected to be at this stage.
Mr Thunell stresses that the company is run as a commercial enterprise, not
as semi-political institution. 'We receive minimal interference from the
state,' he asserts. But it is the state which will call the shots at the end
of the day.
What happens to the company in 10 to 15 years' time?
'Either they sell off all or part of Securum, or they instruct us to sell
down to the last share or building, and we can eventually turn off the light
and go home,' says Mr Thunell.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (16): Clear winner of the crisis - Profile:
Svenska Handelsbanken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Svenska Handelsbanken is one of the clear winners of the Nordic banking
crisis. It has suffered much lower losses than its rivals and is the only
leading bank in Sweden, Norway or Finland which neither received nor sought
any form of state assistance.
The bank's reputation has clearly benefited, enabling it to pick up market
share. It also fares better than most of its rivals in terms of credit
rating and customer satisfaction. And yet, with clear signs that the worst
of the Swedish banking crisis is over and many competitor banks
recapitalised, it remains uncertain whether the bank will derive any
significant long-term commercial advantage from its performance.
Signs that Handelsbanken had turned the corner to better times have been
clear since the first quarter. By the nine-month stage, profits had reached
SKr1.39bn compared with a SKr883m loss in the same 1992 period. The
improvement can be attributed to a 30 per cent rise in profits before credit
losses to SKr6.67bn and to a 12 per cent fall in credit losses to SKr5.28bn.
Analysts are now predicting a full year profit of about SKr1.8-2bn, after
last year's SKr840m deficit.
So what did Handelsbanken do right, when so many other Nordic banks
foundered on the rocks of financial deregulation? In one sense, it simply
benefited from having weathered a crisis of its own in the early 1970s which
led to tighter credit control procedures. This meant that when the Swedish
financial market was deregulated in 1985, it did not chase new business as
aggressively as other banks, putting its emphasis on profitability, not
volume.
A significant result of the strategy was that Handelsbanken lent less to
property companies and therefore it suffered less from the collapse in
property values which lie at the heart of Sweden's banking crisis. Last
year, for example, real estate accounted for 60 per cent of the bank's
SKr8bn lending losses, compared with the Swedish average of 75 per cent.
The bank highlights two other reasons for its success. One is an emphasis on
competence and decision-making at branch level. 'If you look at the
financial crises in different western countries, you often see that some of
the worst credit decisions have been taken by banks without local
knowledge,' says Mr Arne Martensson, the bank's chief executive
The other is a relentless drive to cut costs. Handelsbanken already claims
to have the lowest cost base of any Nordic bank, because it has held down
staff numbers even though it has maintained a large number of branches as
part of its emphasis on local market expertise. Far from being complacent
about its market position, it promises further cost-cutting to maintain its
competitive edge.
The question now is whether Handelsbanken will benefit from the goodwill
associated with its performance. It has certainly gained market share in the
past three years - its share of total lending among Swedish banks rose from
16.5 per cent to 17.3 per cent between 1990 and 1992, while its share of
total deposits increased to 15.3 per cent from 13.9 per cent.
Making further gains, however, will be harder, as Mr Martensson
acknowledges, now that the bank's competitors are showing clear signs of
recovering their strength. SE Banken has rebuilt it balance sheet with a
SKr5.3bn rights issue, while state-owned Nordbanken, stripped of the bulk of
its bad loans, has rebounded strongly into profit. Mr Martensson says
bluntly that the state gave Nordbanken too much support to the clear
competitive disadvantage of the country's other banks.
One sign that Handelsbanken is determined not to lose out in the battle for
business as the Swedish economy recovers was its decision to launch a
SKr2.7bn rights issue during the autumn. This lifted its capital adequacy
ratio to 12.4 per cent, far higher than the 9.4 per cent level it reached in
1989 when bank profits were at a peak.
Part of the reason the bank wanted such a strong balance sheet was to
improve its credit rating, but it also wanted funds to help build up its
bank network throughout the Nordic region.
It already has seven branches in Norway, following the acquisition of Oslo
Handelsbanken in 1990 and Stavanger Bank in 1991, and it has started up
operations in Denmark and Finland.
'Our ambition is to build up the type of operation which we have in Sweden
in other Nordic countries,' says Mr Martensson.
Here, too, the bank is unlikely to have things all its own way because SE
Banken has recently announced plans to set up offices in Oslo and Helsinki.
But Mr Martensson believes Handelsbanken has gained a head start on its
rivals, partly because it was able to exploit the banking crises in both
Norway and Finland to get an earlier foothold on better terms.
The bank is also aiming to build up its life insurance business in Sweden.
It is already the country's fifth-largest life insurer with a 7 per cent
market share.
Given that Handelsbanken is also seeking to develop its banking operations
in Sweden, it came as some surprise when it pulled out of the bidding for
Gota Bank, the state-owned bank, earlier this month. Mr Martensson said the
price being sought by the government was 'far too high' and the bank would
be risking its credit rating and international competitiveness if it went
ahead with the purchase.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (14): Clear evidence of a turnround - The
Banking Sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Swedish banks are emerging from crisis as rapidly as they plunged into it.
The doom-laden atmosphere of the early part of the year, when record losses
were being unveiled and banks were falling over each other in the queue for
state hand-outs, has rapidly given way to a mood of optimism. The feeling is
not just that the worst is over but that the path to recovery is firmly
entrenched.
Much-improved results are the clearest evidence of the turnround and these,
together with the buoyant stock market, have enabled banks to recapitalise
by turning to their shareholders and other institutions, rather than relying
on the state.
All three banks which applied for state aid at the start of the year -
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Foreningsbanken, and Swedbank - had withdrawn
their requests by the year-end.
The government has reason to congratulate itself over developments, even if
the main reason for the upturn is the sharp lowering of interest rates which
has followed the humiliating decision to float the krona in November 1992.
The measures the government took to tackle the crisis - providing a blanket
safety net for the entire banking system, encouraging banks to dig their own
way out of trouble, using the 'bad bank' formula for problem loans - have
proved effective both in maintaining confidence and securing the recovery.
Yet the process has not been without controversy. Nordbanken, the first and
biggest casualty of the crisis, has almost certainly been treated too
generously by the state to the distortion of wider competition. After nine
months it was Sweden's most profitable bank with a SKr2.5bn operating profit
 -quite a turnround on the SKr16bn record-breaking loss it recorded for the
whole of 1992.
Now Nordbanken is to be slung together with Gota Bank to create Sweden's
biggest bank in terms of market share with a likely privatisation of the
combined entity in 1995. Although presented as the best solution for the
taxpayer, it represents something of a defeat for the government's earlier
hopes of getting a significant foreign presence into the market to bolster
competition.
The danger is that the bank crisis will pass in Sweden without a significant
increase in the market competition, even though more domestic players -
including insurance groups - are entering the field.
Now that Gota's problems have been resolved, at a total cost of SKr30bn, the
government's biggest banking crisis outlays are behind it. So far, the state
has provided a total of SKr92.1bn in support, by way of cash infusions,
equity, loans and guarantees, although only SKr71.3bn of the total has
actually been paid out. One estimate is that the net outlay will be about
SKr50bn once the government has recouped funds from Nordbanken's
privatisation and the sale of assets within the bad banks.
So is the crisis over? Not if the size of the credit losses and problem
loans still being reported is anything to go by. In the first half of this
year, credit losses amounted to SKr39bn, compared with SKr74bn in the whole
of 1992. The trend should be lower in the second half, but it is clear that
full-year losses are going to be in the region of SKr60-65bn.
'Credit losses will still be above normal levels in both 1994 and 1995,'
warns Mr Peter Mansson, financial analyst at ABB Aros Securities in
Stockholm.
Another sign that the market is still thought to be unstable is the fact
that the blanket guarantee which the government was forced to place under
the entire banking system in late 1992 is still in place, and there are no
signs of its early removal.
One measurement shows why this is the case: there is still an estimated
SKr100bn of problem loans in the Swedish banking system, while banks'
primary capital at the end of the third quarter amounted to only SKr67bn.
Even allowing for the recapitalisation measures in the final three months,
there is still a shortfall.
If interest rates went back up again, things could certainly go wrong. But
even if they did, the big groups are now far better placed to withstand
heavy losses without breaching the 8 per cent minimum capital adequacy
level. Capital adequacy ratios at both SE Banken and Svenska Handelsbanken
are now above 12 per cent after they raised SKr5.3bn and SKr2.7bn
respectively in rights issues during the autumn.
Swedbank, the Nordic region's biggest bank in asset terms, will have capital
cover of more than 10 per cent if plans to strengthen its capital base by
SKr8bn are fully implemented.
The recovery undoubtedly leaves a more limited role for the bank support
authority, the Bankstodsnamnden, which was only formally set up in May. Its
main task will be to take care of Nordbanken; its bad bank, Securum; and
Gota's bad bank, Retriva. In general, the authority will act more as a
holding company than be active and 'hands-on' in its approach.
The 10-15 years envisaged for the sell-off of assets within Securum and
Retriva indicate that the legacy of the banking crisis will last into the
next century. The fall-out has also led to the scrutiny of SKr37.8bn of
loans for evidence of wrong-doing and, in some cases, individual board
directors may be held to account for the decisions which they took.
One obvious worry is that with many of Sweden's banks so strongly
recapitalised, the whole cycle of misery will simply repeat itself in a few
years as the leading groups make another grab for market share. The danger
is the greater for the fact that Sweden has a small domestic market, which
may force banks to push into areas or countries with which they are
unfamiliar.
For the moment most believe that lessons have been learned and that credit
control procedures have been tightened. 'Banks are much more cautious now
and I don't believe they will start recklessly chasing volumes again,' says
Mr Claes Norgren, head of the country's finance inspection board.
Not everyone takes this view, and they back their case by saying that many
of the people who took the decisions which brought disaster last time round
are still in place.

FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (13): Changes leave their mark - Profile:
The Wallenberg empire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just as Sweden itself has undergone the pains of recession and structural
change over the past three years, so it has been a tricky time for the
Wallenberg family, owners of the country's dominant industrial empire.
Earlier this year, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's leading bank and
a traditional jewel in the Wallenberg crown, plunged so drastically into
losses that it was forced to appeal to the government for aid and appeared
to be close to being nationalised.
Meanwhile, profits have been sagging badly at Investor, the flagship holding
company for the Wallenbergs' battery of blue-chip industrial investments, in
large part due to falling earnings at Saab-Scania, the vehicle and aerospace
group which Investor took over as 100 per cent owner in 1991.
All this has happened at a time when the Wallenberg family, headed by Mr
Peter Wallenberg, has had to adjust to the consequences of a spate of
deregulation that has opened up Sweden's previously well-protected stock
market to foreign investment.
Although weighted voting rights have in many cases ensured Wallenberg
control has not been shaken, Wallenberg-affiliated companies such as Astra,
the pharmaceuticals group, and Ericsson, the telecommunications company,
have been key targets for a flood of foreign buying of Swedish stocks. This
has driven up share prices dramatically this year - but it has also
introduced much greater volatility than previously was the case.
The changes have left their mark on the Wallenberg empire. For Mr Wallenberg
there was also the personal alarm of a bungled kidnap attempt by Russian
mafia men during the summer. But under his direction, with his son Jacob and
nephew Marcus closely involved, the family has so far largely sustained the
remarkable extent of its power and influence in Swedish corporate life, a
role that dates back to the end of the last century.
Indeed, as the year draws to a close, the outlook across the extensive
Wallenberg portfolio - which accounts for about one third of the Stockholm
stock market's total capitalisation - is turning up somewhat.
The threat that hung over S-E Banken earlier in the year has all but
dissipated. Although the Wallenbergs hold slightly less than 8 per cent of
the bank, it was a central pillar in the building of the family's industrial
holdings and remains a prestigious part of the empire. Peter Wallenberg is
chairman and has his office at the bank's staid headquarters near
Stockholm's waterfront.
S-E Banken, rescued from crippling loan losses by falling interest rates,
staged an impressive surge back to operating profits in the middle of the
year and was able to withdraw its request for state support in August. The
Wallenbergs had to stump up their share of a SKr5.8bn share offering to help
recapitalise the bank, but the prospect of its break-up or effective take
over by the state has receded.
Results at Incentive, an industrial group junior to Investor but an
important part of the Wallenberg sphere, are also improving. Despite the
dampening effects of recession in Europe, the benefits of the sharp
devaluation of the Swedish krona over the past 12 months are paying off,
along with those of internal cost-cutting measures. Profits in the first
nine months of SKr345m were up 55 per cent compared with the same period
last year.
The Wallenbergs are determined also to hold fast to their core holdings
through Investor. Here the outlook is less certain, with analysts querying
whether a spate of portfolio rationalisations over the past two years will
have to continue if the Wallenbergs are to sustain sufficient financial
strength within the group.
Investor is the muscle of the empire, grouping holdings in most of Sweden's
best-known big companies. Saab-Scania is the only one 100 per cent-owned,
but through Investor the Wallenbergs exert controlling or powerful influence
in a list that includes Astra, Ericsson, Electrolux, the world-leading white
goods manufacturer, Stora, Europe's biggest forestry group, Atlas Copco, the
engineering group, and SKF, the world's largest maker of roller bearings.
Slumping markets for its trucks and civilian aircraft have hit Saab-Scania
this year, knocking a hole in profits and the intention that Saab-Scania
would be the cash-generating engine of a streamlined Investor. Investor's
pre-tax profits were down almost 90 per cent in the first nine months of
this year to SKr216m.
With net debt around the SKr8bn mark, Investor has this year stepped up a
disposal programme, selling out its 10 per cent holding in Asea, the Swedish
half of Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering giant, and a 2 per
cent chunk of Stora. The company says it would like to get its debt level
down to about SKr6bn, raising the question of whether another round of asset
sales is necessary - and if so, whether a core asset may have to go.
But Mr Claes Dahlback, the chief executive, is at pains to deny persistent
market rumours that he is ready to sell a part of Investor's holding in
Astra, which has rocketed in value on the stock market this year to the
point where Investor's 10 per cent of the capital is worth 40 per cent of
the company's total portfolio.
What's more, Mr Dahlback says he is happy with the structure of the group at
present. 'We are pretty close to where we should be. I don't see any major
changes of portfolio in the pipeline,' he said.
He appears confident that Saab-Scania will soon return to being the income
generator it was always intended to be - generating the cash to drive down
debt levels. 'We will stick to our guns. We are glad we own Saab-Scania.
Maybe the timing (of the full takeover) was a bit unfortunate. But Scania is
the Rolls-Royce of heavy trucks and I think the future is bright.'
If, indeed, the Wallenbergs do emerge from the difficulties of recent years
with their empire substantially intact, it is clear that its survival will
owe much to the maintainance of the weighted share system. A threat at one
time of regulatory moves in the European Union, which Sweden aims to join,
to establish a 'one share, one vote' system now appears distant, if not
invisible.
It seems the Wallenbergs can continue to enjoy a system which, for example,
gives them 45 per cent of the voting rights at Electrolux with a puny 1.3
per cent of the capital, and 22 per cent of the voting rights at Ericsson
with only 2 per cent of the capital. When Investor sold out of Asea last
June, the Wallenbergs ensured that their control of the company was
maintained by a shuffle of weighted shares which beefed up Incentive's Asea
holding.
Mr Dahlback makes no apologies for the weighted share system, although he
acknowledges that Investor would not exist in its present form without it.
'I get upset when I hear criticism of the system. This is a system that
works well. In our view, companies benefit from having strong, responsible
ownership.'

FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (12): Rivals gathering strength - Motor
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The drama of Volvo's failed plan to merge with France's Renault and -
earlier - the launch of a new car billed as a make-or-break model for Saab
has evoked much worried concern in Sweden this year about the future of the
country's motor industry.
A close look behind the headlines suggests, however, that both Volvo and
Saab are in positions of gathering strength, at least in the short to medium
term.
In contrast to the formidable structural problems facing such European
giants as Volkswagen, Fiat and Mercedes, both Swedish companies have already
been through a painful process of rationalisation and are beginning to reap
the benefits.
'I think both Saab and Volvo are in rather good industrial shape at the
moment,' was the somewhat surprising remark of a Volvo car company executive
in the aftermath of the Renault merger collapse.
Not that there is any complacency in the two western cities of Gothenburg
and Trollhaten, where Volvo and Saab have their respective headquarters and
main plants.
In the long term, a big question mark hangs over Volvo's strategy now that
the merger with Renault is off. Volvo readily acknowledges that it needs a
partner to ensure its long-term stability in a world motor industry carrying
heavy overcapacity.
It is worried that Renault will gradually reverse out of their
three-year-old alliance after the snub of rejection delivered by Volvo
senior management and its shareholders.
Saab Automobile, which is jointly owned by General Motors of the US and
Sweden's Saab-Scania group, also has a long way to go to prove its long-term
viability after five successive years of losses and tumbling sales.
But for the time being the graph is pointing up for both the long-time
rivals, despite the toughest recession for years in the wider European
market and especially at home, where annual car sales have plummeted from
340,000 in 1988 to about 125,000 this year.
Indeed, a surge back into profits at Volvo in recent months was one of the
factors cited by those who opposed the merger with Renault, which has
suffered sharp reverses in profitability this year.
In the first nine months, the Volvo group reported a SKr2bn improvement in
operating profits, swinging from a SKr1.52bn loss in the same period in 1992
to a Skr445m profit.
Both the car and truck divisions were profitable, with the long-running
trend of falling unit sales shifted back to growth, albeit very small. Car
sales were up to 229,400 from 228,900.
In the car operations, Volvo attributes a good deal of this turnaround to a
tough programme of restructuring. In response to mounting losses in the
early 1990s, Volvo is shutting two of its three Swedish plants and by 1995
will have cut 15,000 staff from the workforce.
Meanwhile, efficiency has been sharply improved, with the number of hours
taken to make a vehicle tumbling from 70 to 40.
At Saab, which ran up losses totalling SKr10bn over the past four years,
there is a similar story. Losses are down sharply this year and the company
expects to return to the black in 1994 for the first time since 1988.
If so, it will be the result of a severe restructuring that required the
injection of SKr8bn in new capital from GM and Saab-Scania.
Production has been concentrated in three plants and the workforce halved to
about 7,300. Production time for the new 900 model, launched in July, is
down to about 30 hours compared with figures as high as 110 hours a few
years ago. Sales, which have slumped from 109,500 in 1989 to 75,000 this
year, have begun to turn around.
The company projects sales of the 9000 and 900 to total 87,000 next year,
ahead of the break-even level of 80,000.
Both Saab and Volvo, which export the big majority of their cars, are
benefiting strongly from the windfall effects of a 30 per cent fall in the
value of the Swedish krona since last year. Both have narrow model ranges
limited to the middle and upper market tiers. Their traditional competitive
advantages of safety and environmental friendliness are fast being caught up
by their competitors. Volvo has taken a dangerous leap in the dark by
tearing up the Renault merger plan.
The two rivals still have to prove that Sweden can be a competitive location
for vehicle making in the long term. But the progress they have made in 1993
has at least set them up with a chance of success.
