FT  05 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Foreign investment draws US converts -
Bessemer Trust finds attraction in emerging markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Trott invests big bucks in international equities for the rich and
famous, most of them American. He has nothing in Japan and nothing in German
manufacturing industry; but he exemplifies the US conversion to foreign
portfolio investment, and to emerging markets in particular.
Mr Trott manages, from London, the Dollars 1bn international component of
the US-based Bessemer Trust, which has Dollars 8.5bn under direct management
and numbers Mr George Bush, the former US president, among its clients. Mr
Trott says that expectations in Japan and Germany for the next five years
are just too high.
Bessemer was founded in 1906 by Mr Henry Phipps, one of Andrew Carnegie's
partners in the development of the US steel industry, to manage Phipps
family money. The name marks the process of converting molten pig iron into
steel which the Carnegie interests licensed from Sir Henry Bessemer, the
British metallurgist, who invented the process.
The group recommends to its clients that 40 per cent of their equity
investment funds go into international markets. The international fund
itself has about 40 per cent of its money in emerging markets, although
these account for not much more than 5 per cent of EAFA (Morgan Stanley
Capital International's Europe, Australian and Far East index, a standard
measure for US investors active overseas).
John Trott came to Bessemer at the beginning of 1992, extending a trend
which began in 1975 when Mr John Whitmore, now chairman of Bessemer, joined.
One reason for Mr Whitmore's recruitment was to widen the trust's client
base; outside investors' money is now important in the overall scheme of
things.
Mr Trott came in from Kleinwort Benson, which formerly managed the
international fund, to increase further the international presence of the
group. When he joined, Bessemer had Dollars 500m in non-US securities; he
has lifted that to just over Dollars 1bn in less than two years.
Emerging markets, says Mr Trott, are at much the same stage now as Japan was
in the 1960s, when it put up its best equity performance: what it had
included a growing economy, the work ethic, a strong currency, relatively
undervalued equities and a government which provided the framework for
economic growth.
Bessemer will not put more than 10 per cent of the international fund into
any one emerging market. It does, however, have 10 per cent in Hong Kong,
which is not classified traditionally as an emerging market, although Mr
Trott thinks that the colony recently has behaved like one, and that it will
do so in future.
He is keen on Hong Kong, from which, he says, the wealth of China will
initially flow to the outside world. China's nascent mainland markets in
Shanghai and Shenzhen will develop, he says, but at this stage they are
relatively illiquid. He does not think Hong Kong is as potentially volatile
as Mr Peter Everington, managing director of Regent Fund Management,
indicated recently.
In effect, Mr Everington said the Hang Seng index, which peaked at 9,642.91
this week, up by more than 25 per cent since the end of September, could hit
12,000 soon on the tremendous inflow of US funds into the colony, or fall to
5,000 in relatively short order on a more bearish assessment which includes
the future of the Hong Kong dollar-US dollar peg.
Bessemer is bearish on Japan. Mr Trott estimates that the Tokyo market is on
a p/e ratio of around 85, and says its supporters tell their friends to look
at prospective earnings: if these get back to the peak returns of the late
1980s, they say, the p/e would cut to a third of its present level.
That, says Mr Trott, would still be 28; and in any case, he argues, there is
no way that the Japanese corporate sector will get back to those exceptional
rates of return, which came from an undervalued yen, economic growth and a
cost of capital which virtually came down to nil. In addition, he does not
like the apparent public funds support for the market.
Bessemer has been out of Japan for the past six months. This may look silly,
given that the FT-Actuaries indices, in dollar terms, show Japan with a gain
of 40 per cent on the year to date, 19 percentage points of that advance
coming from the appreciation of the yen against the dollar.
But, says Mr Trott, in the 12 months to September 30 last, Bessemer's
international fund shows a gain of 29 per cent against the EAFA benchmark
figure of 26 per cent. Within the EAFA figure, he notes, the Japan weighting
was 50 per cent.
While Bessemer looks after international equities from its London office, 95
per cent of its clients invest US dollars, and have US dollar liabilities.
'We have to look after that,' says Mr Trott. 'If we believe the dollar is
undervalued, we will have to hedge our foreign currency investments back
into dollars - although we will take the currency risk if it looks good.'

FT  05 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Overseas weakness leaves
senior bourses in decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN overnight fall in Tokyo and a weak Wall Street opening led most bourses
lower, writes Our Markets Staff.
AMSTERDAM eased back slightly in spite of a warm reception for Philips'
third quarter results. The CBS Tendency index lost 0.5 to 139.5, after a
day's high of 139.8.
Mr Ian Blackford of NatWest Securities said that the results were in line
with expectations, suggesting that restructuring and cost-cutting measures
were now paying off. The shares added Fl 1.10 to Fl 41.40 and Mr Blackford
saw the results providing an impetus for the price to test the Fl 50 level.
Polygram put on 30 cents to Fl 74.10.
KLM, which released satisfactory second quarter figures but cautioned
against expectations of substantially stronger full year results, lost 20
cents to Fl 41.70, after an earlier high of Fl 43.70. Mr Richard Brakenhoff
of brokers Pierson noted that the airline's fate depended either on the
success of the Alcazar talks or its ability to form links with another
European airline. 'It needs a European market share of about 10 per cent,'
he said, 'and at the moment it has just 3 per cent.' He remained a seller of
the stock and commented that the airline had a long way to go in reducing
its cost base.
Akzo, confirming that it was holding merger talks with Nobel Industries of
Sweden, gained Fl 5.30 to Fl 199.50.
FRANKFURT moved from consolidation to correction as the DAX index dropped
21.75 to 2,062.61, turnover falling from DM8.9bn to DM8bn.
Economic indicators were not good. The director of the German Chambers of
Commerce and Industry (DIHT), Mr Franz Schoser, said on Wednesday that he
saw a 0.5 per cent contraction in western Germany in 1994, compared to the
German economic research institutes' 1.5 per cent growth estimate.
Among blue chips, a minor chemicals leak at BASF's main plant followed
Wednesday's news that talks to sell its acrylics business had broken down.
The shares fell DM5 to DM275.
PARIS fell back in the absence of major corporate news. The CAC-40 index
shed 35.19 or 1.6 per cent to 2,135.97 in turnover of some FFr4.4bn.
Roussel-Uclaf, which pleased analysts with its nine month results after
hours on Wednesday, went against the trend with a rise of FFr10 to FFr693.
Goldman Sachs upgraded its earnings, said that it should outperform the
market and looked for a 12-month price target of around FFr855.
MILAN had a day of political high drama after President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro's television appearance to deny corruption allegations, claiming
that they were part of a plot to destabilise the country.
The Comit index shed 10.99 to 567.69 in thin trading. Mr John Stewart of
InterEuropa in Milan commented that the market had held up well in the face
of the day's events although he noted that the index had finished at a
technical support level.
Mr Stewart added that the developments had complicated the country's
political and economic outlook. A volatile political situation was likely to
delay passage of the budget, which in turn could hold up planned elections
next year.
Stet fell L114 to L4,002, dragged down by an anti-trust ruling that prevents
Sip from developing or marketing its digital phone system. Sip fell L49 to
L3,440 in heavy volume of 16m shares.
ZURICH shed 1.6 per cent as foreign investors took profits in blue chips,
leaving the SMI index 43.7 lower at 2,706.6.
Among the most actively traded blue chips, Roche certificates fell SFr110 to
SFr5,745, Nestle gave up SFr19 at SFr1,774 and Zurich Insurance SFr15 at
SFr1,410.
Swiss Re registered shares eased SFr10 to SFr3,870 as the company forecast
improved 1993 figures and good prospects for 1994.
BRUSSELS closed at a new high for the third time this week, edging up 3.12
to 1,391.99 in turnover of some BFr1.9bn. Options-linked basket buying
reversed early losses in the cash market, following major transactions in
the Bel-20 index contract. Industrials led the gains with Bekaert, the steel
cord and wire maker, up BFr525 to BFr20,350.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: Dollar rises ahead of jobs data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR picked up against the D-Mark and Japanese yen yesterday as banks
fine-tuned their strategic currency positions ahead of today's all-important
US employment figures, writes Peter John.
Most economists expect the October figure for all employment except
agriculture to rise by between 145,000 and 175,000. If the increase is
significantly higher, say around 200,000, that could help the dollar break
through its recent range against the D-Mark.
However, according to Mr Adrian Cunningham, economist with UBS, any strength
in the US currency yesterday had little to do with a shift in fundamental
investor perception.
'The dollar perked up a bit on the latest data for jobless claims and
factory goods orders, but it was really a reflection of day-to-day interbank
movements,' he said.
In Tokyo, the dollar was caught in tight ranges against the yen and D-Mark,
held in by mild short-covering on one side and interbank offers on the
other.
However, a 430-point fall in the Nikkei stock index underlined the worries
over the Japanese economy and fuelled calls for a further reduction in
interest rates from their already low level of 1.75 per cent. In Europe, the
dollar closed at Y108.30, up from Y107.25 previously. Against the D-Mark, it
rose to DM1.6960 from DM1.6930. New York trading finished with the dollar at
Y108.15 and DM1.6956.
Its movement against the German currency was also underscored by D-Mark
weakness. Following changes to the European exchange rate mechanism at the
beginning of August, the importance of Germany as a financial anchor has
diminished and investors have been selling the currency.
Dealers added that fund managers with a calendar year end were already
beginning to balance their books and take profits after a volatile year in
the foreign exchange market.
The decision by the German Bundesbank to leave its discount and Lombard
rates unchanged at 5.75 per cent and 6.75 per cent respectively was already
factored into investors' calculations and had no apparent effect on the
currency.
The D-Mark was soft against the Danish krone in spite of the possible impact
of Wednesday's cut in the Danish discount rate. It also gave up earlier
gains against the French and Belgian francs.
It even failed to make significant inroads against the Italian lira,
overshadowed by a corruption scandal, and only rose to L968.90 from L965.30.
Late on Wednesday Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, the Italian president, made a
surprise address on television denying involvement in illegal activities.
Sterling continued its recent trend of weakness against the dollar and
firmness against the D-Mark as the debate over whether interest rates will
fall maintained centre stage. The pound finished at Dollars 1.4795, down
from Dollars 1.4805, and at DM2.51, up from DM2.5075.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Money Markets: Short lira sold down
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN short-term interest rate futures slipped sharply yesterday in
reaction to growing worries over corruption in the country.
Eurolira futures were down almost 20 basis points from Wednesday's closing
level at one stage although the currency held up relatively well.
International money market dealers said the selling was a response to a
sharp fall in the government bond market which tends to reflect confidence
in a country's political and economic stability.
It began after Italy's president Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro gave a television
address late on Wednesday denying allegations that he had been involved in
any illegal activities.
'The main selling has come from Italians. They suddenly started to fear they
would be left without a president,' said one London trader.
The Eurolira contract for December delivery was marked down at the opening
and hit 91.30 at its weakest point late yesterday afternoon.
Elsewhere, there was some disappointment that the Bank of France left its
intervention rate, the rate which sets the floor for French money market
operations, unchanged at 6.45 per cent.
There had been a slim hope that it might follow the lead set by the Danish
central bank which cut its discount rate by 0.25 per cent to 7 per cent on
Wednesday.
In the UK, period lending rates were lower on the ripple-through effect of
the third comfortable day in a row for interbank operations.
The Bank of England provided Pounds 950m of assistance at the earliest
opportunity and at established rates after forecasting a liquidity shortage
of around Pounds 1.2bn, later revised to 1.3bn.
The Bank provided Pounds 125m in the morning and a further Pounds 223m in
the afternoon bringing total help to Pounds 1.298bn.
The ease with which the operations proceeded saw overnight money rates as
low as 3.5 per cent and generally trading around 5.75 per cent.
One month and three-month rates were also lower across the board. Three
month interbank rates were down  1/8 on the week at 5 5/8 per cent.
However, dealers said there was no conclusion to be drawn over the direction
of future lending rates. 'The Bank of England is being studiously neutral
over base rate at the moment,' said one trader.

London Metal Exchange COPPER prices were buoyed up yesterday by market talk,
confirmed after the close, of a force majeure at the Ok Tedi mine in Papua
New Guinea. Traders said sizeable orders came from both sides of the market
during a busy afternoon session and three-month copper closed at Dollars
1,649.75 a tonne, up Dollars 7. Ok Tedi produces about 200,000 tonnes a year
of copper in concentrates but has had difficulty shipping cargoes since
August because of low water levels in the Fly River. 'All important
customers will have been aware of the situation for a while. It could cause
a bit of a squeeze on smelters, but buyers have had time to take action,'
said one trader. World OIL prices held much of the gain made in an explosive
rally earlier this week. December futures for the world benchmark Brent
Blend of crude oil traded late in London's afternoon around Dollars 16.15
per barrel. This was down from Wednesday's closing Dollars 16.22 but
comfortably above Dollars 15.60, the low from which the Wednesday rally
began. SILVER closed in London up 17 cents at Dollars 4.415 an ounce and
PLATINUM gained Dollars 6.35 an ounce to Dollars 375.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US aluminium industry looks to
Clinton - Producers argue western aid should be used to encourage the CIS to
cut exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They say that President Clinton understands the economics of the aluminium
industry very well. In the early 1980s, as governor of Arkansas, he pleaded
with Reynolds Metals, second-largest of the US aluminium producers, not to
close both the smelters in his state. But the smelters - Jones Mills and the
Patterson - had been made completely uneconomic by the steep rise in energy
costs and were permanently shut down in 1985 despite his pleas.
Reynolds closed two other smelters at about the same time, the San Patricio
in Texas and Listerhill in Alabama, taking a total of 462,000 tonnes of
high-cost US capacity out of production.
Mr Richard Holder, now chairman of Reynolds, remembers those difficult
meetings with the president-to-be. He feels sure Mr Clinton remembers them
too and this will stand the US aluminium industry in good stead in its
current fight for survival and the efforts it is making to prevent itself
being burried under a deluge of metal exported from the Commonwealth of
Independent States.
However, the US Aluminium Association, where Mr Holder is also currently
chairman, will have to work hard to educate some of Mr Clinton's officials
in the ways of the industry before December 2, when crucial meetings with
government representatives from the CIS and the western world's other big
aluminium producing countries take place in Washington.
Senior aluminium industry executives have been invited to sit in at those
talks as advisers to the US government. Before the December meeting the US
association will put to its government a plan which will almost certainly
suggest that the CIS producers be encouraged to cut output in return for
financial and technical help from western countries.
Some of the aid the US is ready to give to the CIS to help smooth its path
towards a market economy should be linked specifically with programmes to
modernise the former Soviet Union's heavily-polluting aluminium smelters, Mr
Holder suggests.
He says that, if the industry's proposals are accepted by government
officials, he would be very surprised if they did not go to the president's
desk for a final decision.
There is little more the US industry can do to help itself except close a
great deal more production capacity at the cost of many more jobs. US
anti-trust legislation makes it virtually impossible for the country's
aluminium producers to get involved in joint discussions about actions that
might lead to the production cuts needed for higher prices.
This is why the US industry must rely on its government to do the talking
and, if necessary, take action to stem CIS exports. Convincing the
government will not be easy, given that the US places the highest priority
on supporting the political changes taking place in Russia and would not
want to disturb those changes by heavy-handed action in the aluminium
sector, which analysts reckon has been earning the CIS Dollars 1bn to
Dollars 1.5bn a year in foreign currency.
Mr Holder says something must be done because there has been yet another
surge in CIS exports to the west this year - exports that were running at
200,000 tonnes in 1990 are likely to reach 1.6m tonnes in 1993, according to
his association's estimates. This compares with western consumption of about
15m tonnes.
This helped to drive stocks on the London Metal Exchange to a record 2.3m
tonnes and prices to their lowest-ever level in real terms, so that most
smelters are not even covering their cash costs of production. Mr Holder
says: 'I believe CIS exports have cut 10 to 15 cents a lb off the aluminium
price.'
If the price continues to drift down to 45 cents a lb, described by some
analysts as 'a crisis level', there will be big casualties and 'I'm afraid
that some of the companies that will suffer do not deserve to suffer'.
The western industry must find a formula to persuade the CIS producers to
cut exports, he suggests, and the only sure way that can be done is for
output at the smelters to be reduced.
Some ideas have already been contributed by individual members of his
association in response to a US government's request. One suggestion is that
work should begin immediately to modernise some of the CIS smelters, doing
away with the out-dated Soderberg technology, which would take about
one-third of the capacity of each plant selected for upgrading temporarily
out of production. This idea is put forward by Alumax, a subsidiary of Amax
and the US's third-largest aluminium producer.
Alumax says the upgrading would take five years, during which the aluminium
industry's situation would improve markedly and 'thus allow for the orderly
re-introduction to western markets of Russia's exportable surplus aluminum.
It would be, essentially, a new, efficient and environmentally acceptable
source of supply.'
Alumax suggests the first smelters to be dealt with should be the biggest
and the worst polluters: those at Bratsk and Krasnoyarsk in south central
Siberia. It points to a Metallegesellschaft study which indicates that these
two plants alone emit more than 24 times the maximum safe levels of
fluorine.
Irkutsk, in the same general area, is also a prime candidate, according to
Alumax, because it is near Lake Baikai, a sensitive environmental area. The
Volgograd smelter to the west should also be modernised.
The US group proposes that output at three old, highly-polluting smelters
near the Kola Peninsula, on Finland's border, be cut by half but they should
not be upgraded.
All this would take about 600,000 tonnes a year out of production, it
calculates. 'This, together with strong controls on legal and black market
exports, would improve fundamentals of the world aluminium market
significantly within 18 months to two years.'
The big difficulty with this approach is the cost of upgrading the smelters
 -up to Dollars 6bn. Alumax says, however, these projects could be financed
via government-to-government aid, supplemented by the expertise of various
western aluminium producers. Repayment could be in the form of aluminium for
government aid assistance, and in either aluminium or equity shares for
participating western producers.
Kaiser Aluminium, in its proposals to Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade
representative, suggests that CIS aluminium exports be restricted to 800,000
tonnes a year - 520,000 tonnes to pay for the CIS industry's imports of
essential raw materials and 280,000 tonnes to be held in trust in secure
western warehouses. This metal would be used to pay for priority projects to
improve environmental, health and safety standards.
Kaiser says that because of the time taken for modernisation, on average
this metal in western warehouses will be off the open market for two years
from the start of each programme year.
In addition, warehoused metal could be used as collateral for money borrowed
by the CIS smelters to cover part of the rouble production costs of the
metal held off the market. Loans could run for three or four years and would
be repaid from the sale of metal remaining after payment for capital
projects.
Financing could be supplied by private international banks or trading
companies or, more likely, provided or guaranteed by individual governments,
or it could be arranged through one of the multilateral financial
institutions.
Mr Bond Evans, Alumax president, says the western industry has cut output
substantially already and, in spite of the recession, demand for aluminium
has held up remarkably well. The western market would be in balance were it
not for CIS exports.
This metal is available because of the virtual collapse in domestic demand
in the CIS. Mr Evans says this makes it logical for the next production cuts
to be made in the CIS but, more importantly, 'it is senseless to shut
efficient, clean plants in the west to make way for inefficient, polluting
plants in the CIS.'
He suggests the logic is so compelling that the multilateral government
efforts now under way will result in a logical outcome - cuts in CIS
production - in a few months time. 'Otherwise it will be Darwinism inverted
 -the strong will go to the wall and the weak will survive.'

FT  05 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC lead-zinc producers ask for
protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE IS building for the European Commission to take action to
'safeguard' the Community's lead-zinc producers, who claim their survival is
at risk from the strong surge in imports from the former eastern bloc
countries.
Yesterday the German metals industry association added its voice to the
debate. 'Lead and zinc are being produced in the east under ecologically
irresponsible conditions and then dumped on to EC markets. Producers here
are having to shut modern, expensive and environmentally-sound plants and
cut jobs,' said Mr Rudolf Gabrisch, president.
The German call for action came only two days after EC zinc producers agreed
to work out details of a scheme to permanently close one or two smelters to
bring capacity more into line with demand.
While the producers seem united over the smelter 'shut-down' scheme, there
is a split about whether they should urge the Commission to restrict zinc
imports from the former eastern bloc.
The Commission recently placed temporary restrictions on aluminium imports
from the Commonwealth of Independent States and has started negotiations to
persuade the CIS to limit exports in future. Some zinc producers are
preparing a dossier in the hope that they can convince the Commission to
take similar action on their behalf.
Other companies argue, however, that zinc is a commodity and restrictions on
imports to the EC would have virtually no impact on the global availability
of the metal.
The eastern bloc used to be a net importer of lead and zinc. But the
International Lead &amp; Zinc Study Group estimates that the region will export
140,000 tonnes of lead and 355,000 tonnes of zinc to the west this year.
Kazakhstan, a big producer, now directs lead exports to the west to earn
dollars rather than to Russia where battery producers are reported to be
short of what for them is an essential material.
The zinc market has been particularly hit by a reversal in Chinese trade:
China imported about 300,000 tonnes a year in the mid-1980s but, after
expansion of its domestic industry, now has about 100,000 tonnes to export.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Candidates to lead FAO stress
reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOOD and Agriculture Organisation, the United Nations' biggest
specialised agency, meets tomorrow to choose a successor to its
director-general, Mr Edouard Saouma, who has held the post for 18 years.
Mr Saouma's leadership and in particular the FAO's bloated administrative
budget have been widely criticised. Several countries channeling aid through
the FAO - particularly the Nordic countries - have withheld funds because of
their lack of confidence in his leadership.
The successful candidate will have a tough job re-establishing the
organisation's credibility with its sponsors and most of the nine candidates
are campaigning on a reform ticket.
The election comes as the FAO is predicting a 0.5 per cent decline in world
agricultural production this year.
Front-runners stress their willingness to concentrate resources on tackling
world hunger and environmental problems, while also shaking up the FAO
administration.
Mr Geoffrey Miller, who until recently headed Australia's department of
primary industries and energy, wants to send more officials out to work in
the field rather than in the organisation's huge Rome headquarters, where
some 3,000 of the FAO's 5,289 staff are employed.
The other two leading contenders come from within the FAO's ranks. Chile's
Mr Rafael Moreno is currently assistant director-general and has gained
support from most Latin American countries. He highlights the need to tie
environmental legislation more closely to the FAO's projects.
Mr Maharaj Muthoo from India has been director of the FAO's forestry
operations for the past 14 years. He stresses the need to tackle hunger in
Africa as a top priority.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Comex rally pushes gold to
Dollars 372.50
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD PRICES rallied strongly yesterday and closed in London last night at
Dollars 372.50 a troy ounce, up Dollars 8.05.
Traders said the move was started by investment funds on the New York
Commodity Exchange but activity in London was negligible. The rally was
helped by rumours - not widely believed - that the high-profile investor Mr
George Soros was selling bonds and buying gold. 'The bond market is weak and
that is helpful to gold. But the rally was technically based and there was
no fundamental news to move the market,' said one dealer.
Ms Rhona O'Connell, in a special report for stockbrokers T Hoare &amp; Co,
suggests gold's price will average Dollars 360 an ounce this year, 'only 5
per cent up on 1992 - but not a bad performance after hitting a low of
Dollars 326 in March'. Ms O'Connell looks for an average of Dollars 390 next
year and Dollars 420 in 1995.
She suggests demand for physical gold in jewellery in the western world,
after falling from 2,270 tonnes in 1992 to 2,030 tonnes this year, will
recover by 1995 as the developed economies pull out of recession. Also,
Russian production and exports are falling; forward selling by producers has
recently been noticeably absent and she expects central bank selling to be
more muted.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Retention scheme fears hit
coffee price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE PRICES in London slipped by Pounds 17 a tonne yesterday to Dollars
1,216 a tonne for the second position futures contract at the London
Commodity Exchange. Trading was lacklustre as buyers became nervous about
the small amount of purchases made by Brazil on Wednesday when the coffee
producers' retention scheme came into force.
Brazil is co-ordinating buying on behalf of the world's main producers, who
want to boost prices by holding back supplies. Brasilia has said it wants to
purchase 200,000 bags of coffee, but it only picked up 1,750 in its first
foray into the market on Wednesday.
Market traders say producers will have to pay higher prices for the
retention scheme to succeed. Traders will be watching Brazil's moves today
when it makes its next purchases.
'If the Brazilians only buy 1,750 bags again, the market will fall on
Monday, but it could buy, say 50,000 bags, and we'd see a complete
reversal,' one trader said.
Producers are hoping they will erode stocks in consuming countries by
holding back supplies. Stocks in the US - the world's largest consuming
nation - have been drawn down in the past two months as the market enters
the peak consumption period of the northern hemisphere's winter.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: JGBs at six-year high as Nikkei falls
below 19,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE government bonds climbed to a six-year high yesterday, taking their
cue from the weakness of the Tokyo stock market and the generally gloomy
economic background.
The December futures contract opened at 114.98 and rose to a high of 115.29
before ending Tokyo trading at 115.20.
In the cash market, the No 145 JGB's yield opened at 3.505 per cent and
closed at 3.43 per cent, corresponding to the high price of the day.
The trigger for the bond rally was the sharp decline in the Nikkei 225
average index, which dropped 431.45 to end below the psychologically
important 19,000 level at 18,949.79 for the first time in eight months.
The stock market's weakness kindled hopes of a further easing in open money
market interest rates. The overnight call rate is currently at 2.5 per cent,
while the rate on three-month certificates of deposit slipped a further 2
basis points to 2.34 per cent yesterday. Both rates are expected to slip
lower in the near future, dealers said.
'There's been a lot more concern about the state of the economy in recent
weeks, and net new money which would have gone into equities has found a
home in bonds instead, given the economic environment,' said Mr Gerard
Lyons, chief economist at DKB International.
He added that if the economy is still very weak in the second quarter of
next year, it could possibly prompt another cut in the official discount
rate (ODR), which is currently at 1.75 per cent.
HIGH-YIELDING European government bond markets took a knock as domestic
political and economic worries grabbed the attention of investors.
Italian government bonds suffered a sharp fall in the wake of new corruption
allegations. Although President Scalfaro made an unexpected television
appearance late on Wednesday in order to deny the allegations, dealers said
the market appeared nervous, wiping out the previous day's gains. The
December BTP contract on Liffe settled at 115.19, against its opening level
of 115.90.
Rumours circulated that the Italian Treasury may issue 30-year lira
government bonds, helping to extend the maturity profile of the domestic
debt market. According to a report from Reuter, the 30-year issue would be
for L2,000bn and would carry the same 9 per cent coupon as the recent
10-year issues.
However, dealers pointed that in order to make the issue attractive to
investors, the bonds would have to be offered at a discount, thereby
providing investors with a pick-up in yield over the 10-year government
issue.
SHORT-DATED UK government bonds outperformed the long end of the market,
buoyed by hopes of a cut in the base rate, possibly around the time of the
November 30 Budget.
Dealers said that shortening trades were the main theme of the day. The 7
1/4 per cent gilt due 1998 rose  1/8 to trade at 104 5/16 by late afternoon.
Meanwhile, long-dated issues held steady as dealers pointed out that
concerns about inflation have abated slightly.
Earlier this week, the governor of the Bank of England, called for companies
to help curb inflation by generating higher profits through increased output
and capacity use, rather than higher prices.
Mr Simon Briscoe of SG Warburg Securities said the market was encouraged by
the governor's speech and that this week's news of a supermarket price war
is also likely to be good for gilts, as it should help to subdue inflation.
THE German government bond market ended little changed as the Bundesbank
left its key interest rates untouched at yesterday's council meeting.
In the absence of interesting domestic economic data, dealers said the bund
market is likely to be watching today's release of the US employment data
with keen interest.
LONGER-dated US Treasury securities dropped sharply in heavy futures-led
selling as a nervous bond market readied itself for today's jobs data.
In late trading, the 30-year government bond was down 1 3/8 at 100 9/16,
yielding 6.203 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down 3/32
at 99 7/16, to yield 4.156 per cent.
News of a 10,000 decline in weekly jobless claims contributed to early
losses at the long end, primarily because attention was focused on the
October employment report, due today. The jobless claims data hinted that
labour market conditions are continuing to improve, albeit gradually.
Prices dropped even further during the afternoon as selling led by the
futures market sent the long bond into a tailspin. Analysts are predicting
that the jobs report will show a 160,000 rise in non-farm payrolls, but
there were plenty in the market who believed the figure will be much higher.

FT  05 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Indian telecoms network to
make Dollars 500m offering
</HEADLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VIDESH Sanchar Nigam, the Indian state-controlled international
telecommunications network, is planning a USDollars 500m international
equity issue, the biggest-ever share offer by an Indian company and the
first from the public sector.
The plan highlights the increasing ability of Indian companies to raise
funds in international markets as a result of economic reforms. Videsh
Sanchar Nigam follows about 10 other Indian companies into the international
capital markets. Together they plan to raise about USDollars 1bn by the end
of January.
This surge of issues is matched by a wave of interest among overseas fund
managers in the Indian stock market. India has attracted about USDollars
270m this year in foreign financial investments, according to finance
ministry figures, though stockbrokers put the total as high as USDollars
450m.
VSNL, which has been partially privatised over the last two years, is one of
the most profitable enterprises in the generally poorly-performing Indian
public sector. In the year to last March, it made net profits of Rs1.12bn
(Dollars 35.7m) on sales of Rs7.4bn.
The company plans to sell 20m shares in the international markets and 16m in
a separate domestic share offering, which will raise a further USDollars
400m. The state's holding will fall from 85 per cent to 52 per cent.
Mr BK Syngal, chairman, said he had 'many exciting plans', including
investments in international satellite communications links. VSNL has also
invested USDollars 100m in a submarine cable running from Bombay to
Marseilles in the west and Singapore in the east, which would connect India
with high-speed international digital connections.
Other plans include expansion in video conferencing, mobile
telecommunications, electronic mail and high-speed data transfer. VSNL also
plans to lay domestic optical fibre links, partly to improve India's
international links and partly for lease to the Department of
Telecommunications for domestic use.
VSNL is considering joint ventures in these fields with overseas
telecommunications groups, among them British Telecom and Cable &amp; Wireless
of the UK and AT&amp;T from the US. Mr Syngal said the possibility of an
investment by a foreign group in VSNL had been discussed but none was
planned.
Under government rules, registered financial institutions are the only
foreign investors allowed to buy stock in the Indian market and are limited
to a maximum holding of 5 per cent.

TURKIYE Garanti Bankasi, Turkey's fourth biggest private sector bank, has
raised Dollars 103m through an issue of shares to foreign institutional
investors.
The deal, in the form of American depositary receipts, is only the second
time Turkish shares have been issued internationally - the first was a small
ADR issue by the privately owned Net Holding.
Advisers say the Garanti deal was three times subscribed. 'We've had a
presence in the international debt markets, now we want to establish
ourselves in the equity markets,' said Garanti's chief executive, Mr Akin
Ongor.
The shares were sold by Garanti's major shareholder Mr Ayhan Sahenk, head of
the Dogus Group of companies. The offering reduces his holding to around 51
per cent.
The bank made pre-tax profits of TL 1,230bn (Dollars 96m) in 1992. It has
assets of TL 20,539bn.

FT  05 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Korea Electric Power prepares to launch
first global deal

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KOREA Electric Power, South Korea's partially-privatised power utility, is
in the final stages of preparation for its first global bond offering.
Lehman Brothers is thought to be arranging the deal.
Kepco, which has a high single-A credit rating, is likely to file a shelf
registration with the US Securities Exchange Commission today for a
financing of at least Dollars 1bn and with an intermediate maturity.
The offering is expected to be launched at the end of an international
roadshow which should start next week.
Syndicate managers noted that Kepco was already relatively well-known by
international investors through its bond offerings in the Eurobond market
and in the Yankee market, the US domestic bond market for foreign borrowers.
They added that the city of Seoul was also looking to tap the international
bond market in the near future.
Among yesterday's new issues, Depfa, Germany's largest mortgage bank, took
advantage of current investor demand for long-dated Canadian dollar paper to
meet its D-Mark funding requirements.
Mr Frank Ruhland, Depfa's treasurer, said it was becoming difficult to raise
D-Mark financing with a maturity of more than eight years in the domestic
German bond market. This is because investors are now focusing on the
shorter end of the yield curve, which they believe will perform better in
the event of further interest rate cuts than the long end.
However, Depfa was able to solve this problem by swapping part of the
proceeds of yesterday's CDollars 200m offering of 15-year Eurobonds into
fixed-rate D-Marks.
The bonds were priced to yield 36 basis points over the benchmark 7 1/2 per
cent Canadian government bond due 2003 and 22 basis points over the
interpolated 15-year area of the yield curve.
Lead manager Goldman Sachs said the yield on Depfa's bonds was equivalent to
the current yield on the Kingdom of Sweden's recent issue of 15-year
Canadian dollar bonds.
Depfa is expected to continue its international fundraising spree next week
when it launches an offering of 10-year Eurobonds which should raise between
FFr2bn and FFr3bn.
The Canadian province of Alberta made a rare appearance in the Eurobond
market yesterday with a Dollars 275m offering of four-year Eurobonds. Lead
manager SBC said the issue was a refinancing of a high-coupon Swiss franc
offering which Alberta called last month. This explains the unusual size and
maturity of the deal.
SBC said the 5 per cent coupon on Alberta's new bonds prompted some
investors to switch out of their holdings of short-dated collared floating
rate notes.
Before the recent weakness in the US Treasury market, investors had been
keen to buy collared floating-rate notes (FRNs) because the minimum coupon
on the notes was higher than the coupon available on short-dated dollar
bonds.

HONGKONG Telecommunications, the colony's monopoly telephone utility which
is 57.5 per cent owned by the UK's Cable &amp; Wireless, yesterday posted a 15
per cent rise in interim net profit to HKDollars 3.65bn (USDollars 472.8m)
due to continuing strong growth in calls to China, writes Simon Davies in
Hong Kong.
Profits were up from HKDollars 3.17bn in the six months to September 1992.
Sales rose by 13 per cent to HKDollars 11.95bn, with revenue from
international telephone services up by a similar proportion to HKDollars
7.53bn. The interim dividend is 23.4 cents a share, up from 20.3 cents in
1992.

CONTINENTAL Airlines, the US carrier which emerged from bankruptcy
protection for the second time in April, yesterday joined other US airlines
in reporting a sharp financial recovery in the third quarter.
It made net profits of Dollars 12.4m in the three months to September,
compared with net losses of Dollars 29.5m last time. Turnover rose from
Dollars 1.4bn to Dollars 1.6bn, and net income per share was 53 cents (no
comparable figure was available because of the reconstruction).
Like other US carriers, Continental has benefited from cuts in operating
costs, a fall in fuel prices, and a favourable comparison with last year's
third quarter, when a price war was being waged.
Mr Robert Ferguson, president and chief executive, said the impact of the
new Continental Lite services introduced in the east had exceeded
expectations.

OCTOBER sales figures reported by some of the larger US retailers yesterday
were reinforced by a warning from Kmart, the discount store and specialty
retailing group, that its third-quarter results would show a decline in net
income.
Although Wal-Mart, the biggest US retailer, reported relatively good growth,
with same-store sales 8 per cent higher than in the same month last year,
figures from several other large retailers were weak.
Kmart said the first half of October had gone well, but unseasonably warm
weather in the second half interrupted the improvement in clothing sales
experienced since early September. Overall, same-store sales were only 1.4
per cent ahead of last year's figure.
Federated Department Stores, owner of Bloomingdale's and other chains,
reported a 1.5 per cent decline in same-store sales.
Woolworth, which last month announced the closure of 970 stores in North
America, said total same-store sales were only 0.9 per cent up.
Better figures came from Sears, Roebuck, the Chicago-based department store
group, which reported a 12.7 increase in same-store sales. There was modest
growth from the JC Penney stores group.

SOUTHWESTERN Bell, the regional telecommunications company, and Cox
Enterprises, the privately-owned US media group, may be on the verge of
forming America's latest multi-media alliance, according to a report
yesterday in a Cox-owned newspaper.
However, Cox, expressing surprise at the report, said the group had reached
no agreement with Southwestern Bell. It was continuing in talks on strategic
alliances with a number of telecommunications companies. Southwestern Bell,
one of the seven Baby Bell local telephone companies, declined to comment.
The Atlanta Journal and Constitution reported that the two companies were
expected to announce a definitive agreement near the end of this month.
Under the deal, Southwestern Bell would make an investment of over Dollars
1bn in Cox's cable unit.
The report comes amid a rush by US local telephone and cable television
companies to form alliances in preparation for the growth of an interactive,
multi-media home entertainment industry.
The biggest alliance so far is the planned takeover of Tele-Communications
by telephone group Bell Atlantic for up to Dollars 22bn.
Southwestern Bell and Cox are already partners in the UK, where Cox last
spring took a 25 per cent stake in cable television and telephone operations
owned by Southwestern. They have some 1.1m UK cable homes under franchise.
Cox, with US interests including 17 daily newspapers and seven television
stations, runs the sixth-largest cable system in the US, with some 1.7m
subscribers.
Southwestern Bell, based in San Antonio, Texas, provides telecommunications
services in Texas and neighbouring states. Early this year it became the
first US regional telephone company to enter the cable business when it
agreed to buy two systems in suburban Washington, DC, for Dollars 650m.
Analysts speculated yesterday Cox might spin its cable systems off into a
separate, and possibly public-quoted, company in which Southwestern Bell
could invest. This would preserve the private nature of the rest of the
group.

Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman and chief executive, said: 'More seasonable

However, he warned that an expected large loss at its Pace Membership
Warehouse subsidiary - sold this week to the rival Wal-Mart Stores -
together with the effects of a 1 per cent increase in the rate of US
corporate tax, would produce a fall in net income.
Federated Department Stores, owner of Bloomingdale's and other chains,
reported a 1.5 per cent decline in same-store sales, blaming sluggish
economic conditions.
Woolworth, which last month announced the closure of 970 stores in North

Better figures came from Sears, Roebuck, the Chicago-based department store
group, which reported a 12.7 increase in same-store sales. There was modest
growth from the JC Penney stores group, reporting a 3.6 per cent increase.
But The Gap clothing chain saw a 2 per cent sales decline on a like-for-like
basis.

HONGKONG Telecommunications, the colony's monopoly telephone utility which
is 57.5 per cent owned by the UK's Cable &amp; Wireless, yesterday posted a 15
per cent rise in interim net profit to HKDollars 3.65bn (USDollars 472.8m)
due to continuing strong growth in calls to China.
Profits were up from HKDollars 3.17bn in the six months to September 1992,
while turnover increased by 13 per cent to HKDollars 11.95bn, with revenue
from international telephone services growing by a similar proportion to
HKDollars 7.53bn.
The interim dividend is 23.4 cents a share, up from 20.3 cents in 1992.
Mr Michael Gale, Hongkong Telecom's chief executive, said he believed the
rate of earnings growth could be maintained for the full year. Calls to
China rose by 48 per cent in the first half of the year, accounting for 30
per cent of international phone revenues.
The company is emphasising its strategy of diversifying its income stream
away from international telephony. It loses its international monopoly in
2006, while its monopoly on its domestic network will be removed in 1995.
Hongkong Telecom completed the digitalisation of its telephone network in
July, and plans to capitalise on this by focusing on the development of
interactive multimedia services, thereby keeping the company a step ahead of
competition.
This week Hongkong Telecom said it had applied for a licence to operate a
cable TV network after mid-1996. It is already investigating the potential
for a video-on-demand service, which could be carried via the existing
telecommunications network.

FT  05 NOV 93 / International Company News: Big US airlines pull out of
losses spiral - The troubled carriers are showing signs of renewed growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may be the wrong time of the year for green shoots to appear, but it
appears the beleaguered US airline industry is at last showing signs of
renewed growth.
The grounds for optimism lie in the industry's third-quarter results. This
time last year, it was hard to find a large US carrier reporting anything
other than the latest in a long series of losses. However, this year's
third-quarter results have shown a turnround. Suddenly, the airlines are
making profits again.
Admittedly, the profits are not huge. United Airlines, the best-performing
of the large carriers, produced third-quarter net income of only Dollars
149m on turnover of Dollars 3.6bn. However, the figures are notable in that
they follow a three-year period in which US airlines have together produced
losses totalling more than Dollars 10bn.
The airlines' troubles stem partly from too much capacity chasing too little
demand. New aircraft ordered during the boom years of the late 1980s arrived
at a time when passenger numbers were falling because of recession.
Company failures, which might otherwise have brought supply and demand back
into kilter, were prevented by US bankruptcy laws giving companies
protection from their creditors.
Even more serious, however, has been the success of small, upstart carriers
like Southwest Airlines, which have eaten heavily into the big companies'
domestic markets by offering no-frills services at rock-bottom prices.
The large carriers have been unable match the small companies' low operating
costs and therefore to compete profitably at the same fares.
The recovery showing through in the latest quarterly results is the result
of a sustained effort by the larger airlines to bring capacity into line
with demand, bring costs down to competitive levels, and abandon
unprofitable operations.
For example, United - the biggest US airline in terms of passenger miles
flown - has accelerated the grounding of older aircraft, cut wages, and
announced 2,800 job losses. American Airlines, the second biggest, has given
up competing with Southwest on many short-haul routes and grounded more than
30 aircraft from its fleet. Delta, ranking third, has cut more than 6,000
jobs since June last year.
For most airlines, the cost-cutting measures are just the beginning.
Virtually all the big carriers plan to increase productivity through further
heavy job cuts and changes in working practices. In theory, the combination
of lower costs and rising passenger numbers should bring a return to healthy
profits.
Some airlines, however, are unlikely to have it so easy. Most employees of
the big carriers are heavily unionised and are digging their heals in over
some of the changes. American's 21,000 flight attendants are threatening an
all-out strike later this month over cuts in staffing levels, changes in
holiday arrangements, and other productivity-enhancing measures being
introduced by the company.
United, too, is at loggerheads with employees over radical plans to set up a
low-cost airline-within-an-airline to compete head-on with Southwest and its
ilk.
Although employees are being offered a majority stake in United if they
agree to the deal, their union representatives have baulked at some of the
more far-reaching changes in working practices.
Meanwhile, the competitive pressures are intensifying. Southwest's success
is spawning low-cost imitators, such as Kiwi International, Republic Air,
UltrAir, MarkAir and RenoAir. And Continental Airlines, now largely
non-union after emerging from its second bankruptcy, has just launched its
own no-frills operation called Continental Lite.
Daily US newspapers are carrying pages of advertisements from small and
large airlines, each trying to outdo the other with outlandish fare offers.
Republic Air, for example, is advertising a New York-Los Angeles fare of
Dollars 99, with no requirement for advance purchase or a Saturday night
stay. Continental invites readers to combine an ultra-low 'Peanuts Fare'
with another offer called Add-A-Penny-Add-A-Pal, under which the passenger's
companion flies for 1 cent each way.
So while the third-quarter profits offer a glimmer of hope for the airlines,
they fall far short of what is required to restore the industry to health.
Demand remains poor, and those that buy airline tickets want the cheapest
deal they can get.
In this market, it is the lowest-cost operator that makes the money - and
the big carriers have yet to show they can bring their costs down to where
they can not only compete, but win.

<TEXT>
NYNEX, the regional telephone company serving the north-eastern US, is
taking a fourth-quarter after-tax charge of between Dollars 250m and Dollars
275m. The charge relates to the sale of most of its information products and
services businesses.
The company said yesterday it was withdrawing from the information services
business to concentrate on communications opportunities around the world.
It expected to generate some Dollars 300m in cash from the disposal
programme.
As part of the divestment strategy, it also announced the sale of the
information services businesses of AGS computers for an undisclosed sum to
Keane, a Boston, Massachusetts, company specialising in information systems.
Earlier this year, Nynex sold the BIS group, a British-based information
services company, to ACT Group. Meanwhile, this month Apertus Technologies
of Minnesota said it planned to buy Systems Strategies, a Nynex company
providing multi-vendor computer software.
Nynex recently agreed to invest Dollars 1.2bn in Viacom, the cable
television company, as part of its bid for entertainment group Paramount
Communications.

FT  05 NOV 93 / International Company News: Mitsubishi expansion ends as
earnings fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEVEN years of sales expansion at Mitsubishi Motors ended when the Japanese
carmaker saw first-half sales and pre-tax profits slip against a depressed
domestic market and pressures from a rising yen.
In the first six months, Mitsubishi's sales declined 1.6 per cent to
Y1,217bn (Dollars 11.33bn) from Y1,237bn, with every product category except
mini vehicles suffering a downturn in volume.
Operating profits suffered a sharper fall of 18.8 per cent to Y19.2bn
(Y23.6bn) which mirrored both the fall in sales and the impact of the yen's
sharp appreciation against other major currencies.
Mitsubishi made up for the fall in operating profits partly through
cost-cutting efforts and price increases which helped the company to keep
the drop in pre-tax profits to 6.2 per cent at Y17.2bn from Y18.3bn.
A sharp decline in the sale of trucks led to a 38 per cent fall in the
number of vehicles sold.
Export sales increased slightly, while sales of car components to overseas
subsidiaries in the US and the Asia Pacific region increased by 30 per cent.
In the year to March, MMC expects sales to decline 2.5 per cent to Y2,550bn
and pre-tax profits to fall 9.8 per cent to Y42bn.
'It is very difficult to expect sales to increase under the current
circumstances,' the company said.
As part of its cost-cutting efforts, capital expenditure will be lowered to
about Y98bn compared with an initially forecast Y150bn.

equities count their profits - Choices shareholders face after a record year
in the region's stock markets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THERE is nothing like sitting on a fat, unrealised profit to make an
investor nervous, and a fat paper profit is precisely what you should have
if you put your money into south-east Asian equities at the start of the
year and kept it there.
The phenomenon of soaring stock prices has not been confined to Hong Kong,
the biggest market in the region. Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the
Philippines have all repeatedly reached record highs; Manila's composite
index, for example, is up 75 per cent from its year's low in January.
Indonesia, although not yet in record territory, has risen 70 per cent.
Trading volumes have swollen too. In Kuala Lumpur, the number of shares
traded has sometimes exceeded levels in New York and Tokyo, forcing
stockbrokers to sleep in their offices at night as they struggled to keep up
with the paperwork; earlier this year some of them even chartered
helicopters to shift scrip around Malaysia.
The Stock Exchange of Thailand is planning to extend trading hours from the
current five hours a day. Singapore, extended its trading to 12-hour
sessions on two days this week to cope with the start of trading in the
newly-privatised Singapore Telecom.
Investors, who are understandably considering selling their south-east Asian
shares to realise profits, are faced with a familiar dilemma: they cannot
think of anything they would rather buy, but they fear a regional
stock-market crash or at least a sharp correction in the weeks ahead.
Indeed, this week has seen reverses in many of the region's markets as
investors have decided to book some of the profits following the recent
strong advances.
Most of the stockbrokers analysing such risks start by looking at the
reasons for this year's extraordinarily robust performance by south-east
Asian equities. Some of them are obvious. Except in the Philippines, the
region's economies have shrugged off recessions in the Japanese, US and
European markets and are typically growing by 8 per cent a year.
Some of the causes are peculiar to particular markets. In Malaysia, stock
market activity has been fuelled by political manoeuvring and the
distribution of financial favours ahead of this month's elections for posts
in the United Malays National Organisation (Umno, the dominant party in the
government). In Singapore, the government has launched a campaign to promote
share ownership and freed an extra SDollars 20bn for investment in equities
by relaxing controls on the use of money from the Central Provident Fund,
the social security system to which citizens are obliged to contribute.
Such special factors, however, are only part of the story. Stock market
analysts agree that south-east Asian markets, like equity markets elsewhere,
are 'liquidity-driven'. In other words they are beneficiaries of the
worldwide fall in interest rates which has tempted large sums of money out
of bank deposits and into equities.
Previous rallies in south-east Asia have often been prompted by local
speculators driving up the price of secondary stocks, with foreign investors
tagging along behind saying: 'We know this company is fundamentally unsound,
but we're going to buy it anyway because we know local share-ramping will
increase the value of the shares.'
This time, the situation is different. Foreign investors, particularly US
mutual funds increasing their exposure to the economies of south-east Asia,
have led the charge, buying blue chip shares such as Bangkok Bank or
Philippine Long Distance Telephone.
The new money makes a profound impact. Although the capitalisation of
south-east Asian markets is growing fast - and some of them can now absorb
the Dollars 1m plus buy orders demanded by big international investors -
their small size means that a rush of foreign buying can have a
disproportionate effect on share prices and market indices.
'The reason that it has a dramatic influence in these markets is that they
are small,' says Mr Nigel Wightman, chief executive of Rothschild Asset
Management Asia Pacific in Hong Kong. Indonesia's market capitalisation, he
points out, is about the same as Chrysler's.
Tight restrictions on foreign access to stocks in South Korea and Taiwan
further accentuate the rise in the other fast-growing equity markets of
Asia.
Mr Korn Chatikavanij, managing director of Jardine Fleming Thanakom
Securities in Bangkok, says low world interest rates are the basic reason
for the rapid rise of stock market values in south-east Asia, as elsewhere.
'But we've always in this region been like a warrant to the world stock
markets,' he says. 'We go up more and we go down more.'
Mr Korn and other analysts say the principal risk of a sharp fall in the
value of south-east Asian stocks will come from abroad. If world interest
rates rise, foreign money may try to get out of Asian stocks as quickly as
it is now trying to get in; just as demand for relatively illiquid stocks
forces prices to rise exceptionally sharply, so selling pressure forces
prices sharply down.
A further problem in south-east Asia, with the notable exception of
Singapore, is that several markets are poorly regulated. Foreign investors
are partly shielded from this by the preponderance of blue chips in their
portfolios, and both Thailand and Malaysia have recently established
securities commissions in an attempt to improve company disclosure and
control insider dealing.
In Bangkok, however, it is still common for a company's shares to rise or
fall sharply shortly before the disclosure of a good or bad item of news
about the company. 'The foreigners realise that they (the Thai Securities
and Exchange Commission) have a difficult job to do and they are not going
to do it overnight,' says Mr Neil Semple, senior analyst at HG Asia in
Bangkok. 'Probably there's a lot of people they should throw in jail, but
realistically that's not an option.'
No-one would be surprised if a sharp fall in regional equity values revealed
a few companies with difficulties that they were able to hide in a bull
market. 'At the moment, the tide is rising and all boats are rising with
it,' says Mr Wightman. 'At some stage in the next year or two some of the
dodgy stuff is going to be found out.'
In spite of such fears, in spite of this year's sharp rise in regional
markets, and in spite of the vulnerability of equities to interest rate
rises, many stockbrokers remain bullish about south-east Asia.
Some have uprated the region, arguing that it is no longer self-evident that
Asian companies - which operate, after all, in fast-growing economies -
represent riskier investments than companies in Europe, the US or Japan.
Price/earnings ratios are not excessive either in comparison with the
industrialised world or when compared with previous ratios in the Asian
markets themselves, and price levels can be justified by strong corporate
earnings growth. 'I don't sense that any of these markets is yet
overbought,' says Mr Wightman.
In Bangkok, Mr Semple, postulating a future Stock Exchange of Thailand index
level of about 1,400 (this week it has been around the 1,300 level, closing
yesterday at 1,284.93) estimates a modest average Bangkok price/earnings
ratio of 16 in 1995, against about 20 at present.
Any fall in Asian stock markets prompted by an outflow of foreign funds is
likely to be limited by the fact that Asians are becoming increasingly
wealthy and active in their own markets. Even during the recent surge of
foreign buying, foreign investors in the Thai market were accounting for
only about a fifth of turnover.
Nor is there much evidence that foreigners are losing interest. US fund
managers are looking closely at emerging sectors across the region as
governments privatise everything from airlines to petrochemical plants.
Only a rash investor, however, would rule out the possibility of a sustained
sharp downward correction in equity values across the region after such a
bull market. 'The Americans and Japanese are buying. That could be a sign
that we are at the top of the market,' said the director of one stockbroking
firm in Bangkok. 'They are always in last.' He laughed at his own joke and
put the phone down. Stockbrokers in south-east Asia are busy right now.

FT  05 NOV 93 / International Company News: Christiania Bank fails to agree
public offer terms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CHRISTIANIA BANK, Norway's second biggest bank, has failed to reach
agreement with the government, its principal shareholder, on the terms for a
public offering of new shares.
The terms of the issue were expected to be announced yesterday when the bank
published its nine-month result. Christiania said nine-month net profits of
NKr566m (Dollars 77m), against losses of NKr785m last year, were helped by
low interest rates and gains on securities and foreign exchange.
Net interest income rose to NKr2.36bn from NKr2.29bn as non-interest income
 -gains on securities, foreign exchange, and fees - increased to NKr1.76bn
from NKr997m. Operating profit, before loan losses and write-downs, rose to
NKr1.99bn from NKr1.16bn.
Write-offs rose by NKr82m to NKr124m as losses on loans and guarantees were
cut by NKr624m to NKr1.24bn.
Analysts and government officials say the bank will seek to raise up to
NKr2bn, but Christiania refuses to be drawn on details of the offering until
the plans are finalised.
The launch of the offering is being held back until bank officials can reach
agreement with the state over pricing of the new shares.
'What we have is a difference of perspectives concerning the pricing of the
new shares. The bank would like to be in a position to give a decent return
on capital invested while the owner would like to make sure they don't give
the bank away,' a Christiania official said yesterday.
The state owns all but 9.2 per cent which is in the hands of 6,500 private
shareholders. It took control in October 1991 after Christiania was declared
technically insolvent and has made a series of cash injections.
The privately-owned shares are traded outside the Oslo bourse at about NKr17
a share. Analysts say the pricing of the new shares could range anywhere
from NKr6 to NKr16 each.
They forecast the bank will make an initial issue and seek a listing in an
attempt to improve its market valuation before a second tranche is launched.
Christiania said it would be natural to expand the bank's foreign ownership
quota to the legal limit of 33.3 per cent from 23.6 per cent.
Mr Borger Lenth, Christiania's president, said the bank will release details
of the offering as soon as a number of outstanding issues relating to terms
and pricing are agreed between state and bank officials.

FT  05 NOV 93 / International Company News: Philips returns to the black as
tax bill falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics company, swung into a net profit of Fl 133m
(Dollars 70m) in the third quarter from a net loss of Fl 139m the previous
year, helped in part by a significant drop in tax bills and financial
expenditure.
The company continues to suffer from slack markets in Europe, where it
generates just over half of its annual sales. A better performance in other
markets such as North America helped to offset weak conditions closer to
home.
Despite difficulties in Europe, third-quarter operating profit rose to Fl
560m from Fl 345m a year earlier. However, Philips also benefited from a
sharp drop in financing charges to Fl 296m from Fl 475m. The decline is due
to Philips' continued progress in reducing its heavy debt burden as well as
to the decline in worldwide interest rates.
Losses in consumer electronics narrowed, while higher results were achieved
by the components and semi-conductor division. However, professional
products suffered a setback caused by reduced investments by Germany's
telecommunication authority.
Group sales totalled Fl 14.13bn, up 4 per cent from the 1992 third quarter,
but sales for the first nine months were steady at Fl 41.4bn. The company
continues to face strong downward pressure on selling prices, particularly
in lighting and consumer electronics, two businesses which account for
nearly half of total sales.
Net profit for the first three quarters soared to Fl 1.45bn from Fl 102m,
reflecting an extraordinary gain of Fl 1.1bn booked in the second quarter on
the sale of Philips' stake in a semi-conductor joint venture to Matsushita
of Japan.
Mr Dudley Eustace, finance director, said Philips had realised Fl 400m in
extraordinary gains from the recent share issue by PolyGram, the group's
London-based music company. The gain has been set aside to pay for divesting
unprofitable businesses in Europe as part of Philips' 'portfolio choice'
programme. 'Under the current recessionary circumstances, it is becoming
increasingly difficult to sell off businesses and get even book value in
exchange,' he said.
Philips stands to receive 'several hundred million guilders' in January
under a lease-back transaction with Rabobank, the co-operative bank.

SWISS Reinsurance, the world's second largest reinsurance group after Munich
Reinsurance, is raising up to SFr700m (Dollars 466m) in 1994 and 1995
through option-based rights issues. These would be in addition to the
previously announced 1-for-10 rights issue later this year to raise SFr575m.
Mr Arnold Saxer, chairman, said the funds were needed to strengthen the
group's capital base.
He forecast that 1993 net income would be at least 10 per cent higher than
last year's SFr281m. Premium income was expected to rise 15 per cent.
The capital raising for 1994 and 1995 is by way of two sets of options, one
exerciseable until end-1994, the other until end-1995.
The options will be on the basis of one option of each type per bearer or
registered share held. Every 20 options will entitle the holder to buy one
registered share.

FT  05 NOV 93 / International Company News: KLM advances 20% to Fl 204m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KLM, the Dutch national carrier which is closely involved in talks aimed at
a four-way European airline merger, reported a 20 per cent rise in
second-quarter profit. However, it cautioned that full-year 1993-94 results
would be 'marginally positive' at best.
Net profit in the latest quarter, which covers the period from July to
September, totalled Fl 204m (Dollars 107m) compared with Fl 170m in the same
period of 1992-93.
Passenger traffic climbed by a strong 18 per cent, but the trend towards
cheaper fares and the shift away from business class travel left its mark,
with passenger yields down 9 per cent. 'Unrelenting competition and shifting
demand continue to pressure yields negatively,' it said.
KLM did not comment directly on the progress of merger talks with Swissair,
Scandinavia Airlines System and Austrian Airline. But it noted that the
airline industry was still 'marked by major uncertainties'.
KLM said results in the 1993-94 second half were expected to show a clear
loss, reflecting the seasonal nature of the air travel industry.
It noted that its expectations of a marginally positive result for the full
year were due partly to the pension contribution holiday negotiated earlier
this year with unions representing flight attendants and pilots.
Yesterday's figures took first-half net profit to Fl 245m, a rise of 18 per
cent, on sales up just 1 per cent at Fl 4.5bn.
KLM is eager to join forces with its three European rivals in order to trim
costs and to fight competition from bigger airlines. The carrier, which has
been seeking to cut costs throughout the early 1990s, said the productivity
of workers at KLM and its subsidiary KLM Cityhopper increased by 14 per cent
in the quarter. The KLM group also includes a number of foreign carriers
such as Northwest of the US.

FT  05 NOV 93 / International Company News: Volvo urged to drop Renault deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AKTIESPARARNA, the Swedish small shareholders association, yesterday urged
Volvo to abandon a planned merger of its car and truck operations with
Renault, arguing that the agreement was too seriously flawed for
renegotiation.
The organisation was the first Swedish group to openly criticise the accord
last month, setting in train a wave of domestic criticism which earlier this
week forced Volvo to postpone a shareholders meeting called to approve the
deal.
Aktiespararna members hold up to 10 per cent of Volvo's shares - not enough
to sink the deal, but influential enough to increase the pressure on Volvo
and Renault to clarify details of the accord.
'There are so many deficiencies in this proposal that it's not realistic to
expect the two parties to be able to negotiate any major improvements,' said
Mr Lars-Erik Forsgardh, Aktiespararna president.
He said it made more sense for the two groups to continue with their
three-year alliance and start new talks which took the main objections to
the merger into account.
The criticisms centre on valuation, the timetable for Renault's
privatisation and the French 'golden share' which could compromise Volvo's
35 per cent ownership of the new company.
Mr Forsgardh warned that Volvo shareholders risked losing SKr9bn (Dollars
1.1bn) if the merger went ahead. 'The fundamental point is that Volvo has
not succeeded in showing that this deal is good for its shareholders,' he
stated.
Volvo has resheduled the shareholders meeting for December 7. If it wins
backing for its plans, Aktiespararna is threatening a legal challenge on the
grounds that the merger contradicts the vehicle company's articles of
association.

decisions'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN yesterday appointed Mr Juan Llorens, a well-known Spanish auto
executive, to head Seat, its troubled Spanish car producer.
He warned that he would take 'tough and unpopular' decisions to return the
company to profits after estimated losses this year of Pta100bn (Dollars
738m).
Mr Llorens, 56, is the chairman the Spanish Automakers Federation. He was
deputy chairman of Enasa, a state-owned truck producer that was sold to
Fiat, as well as board member of Seat between 1982 and 1986, the date when
VW acquired the car manufacturer from INI, Spain's state holding company.
He replaces Mr Juan Antonio Alvarez who resigned as Seat's chairman at the
end of September when VW rejected his plans to slim the Spanish company's
labour force by 5,000 jobs.
VW has drawn up a viability plan for its Spanish subsidiary which foresees
the closure of Seat's 40-year-old plant in Barcelona's Zona Franca area and
the switch of its production to a new manufacturing plant.
Seat is planning to shed 9,000 jobs.
Mr Llorens said that Seat will 'continue as a separate company and not just
as a factory'. This pledge addressed fears in Spain that the German group
would absorb Seat outright, close down its trade mark and its design centre
and use the Spanish company's remaining labour force to merely assemble VW
vehicles.
VW is hoping that as many as 2,000 Seat employees that are due to be made
redundant will be rehired by the Spanish company's suppliers.
Unions have opposed any closure of the Zona Franca factory in Barcelona and
have imposed an overtime ban in Martorell, the new production base opened
this year, and at Pamplona, Seat's third plant. Half-day protest strikes
against VW's viability plans took place last week and a 24-hour stoppage is
planned for next week.

AKZO, the Dutch chemicals group, is holding merger talks with Nobel
Industries of Sweden. It plans to give details of their progress on Monday.
The Dutch company, which is by far the larger of the two European chemicals
companies, said yesterday morning that the talks 'may or may not lead to the
announcement of a merger'. Last night, it said it would be holding a press
conference in Amsterdam on Monday.
Analysts said it was not yet clear whether Akzo was interested in acquiring
parts or all of Nobel, a speciality chemicals producer which also has
high-technology and medical activities.
They said Akzo would probably be most keen to acquire Nobel's
paints/adhesives and industrial coatings divisions, which last year
accounted for nearly one-third of Nobel's group sales of SKr21.5bn (Dollars
2.7bn). It may be less interested in Nobel's high-technology division,
Spectra-Physics.
Akzo, which has annual sales of Fl 16.9bn (Dollars 8.9bn), is active in
chemicals, coatings, fibres and pharmaceuticals.
The companies were forced to disclose the talks after Swedish media reported
on Wednesday evening and Thursday morning that Akzo may be seeking to
acquire certain Nobel businesses.
Akzo's shares rose strongly on the news to close at a record Fl 199.50, ex
its Fl 1.50 interim dividend. Yesterday's gains come on top of a Fl 13.30
surge on Wednesday following Akzo's release of better-than-expected figures
for the third quarter.
Nobel's shares were suspended on the Stockholm Stock Exchange at SKr22 each
on Tuesday, when the group's market capitalisation amounted to SKr10.4bn.
Nobel is 61.4 per cent owned by Securum, a special unit set up to house the
problem credits of Nordbanken. It had to be rescued by the bank after being
threatened with bankruptcy in 1991 following the collapse of Gamlestaden, a
finance company in which it had a 48 per cent stake.
The group has been through significant restructuring culminating in the sale
of its defence electronics interests to Celsius Industries for SKr1.55bn
earlier this year.
Of Akzo's four main businesses, the fibres sector is the only one operating
at a loss. In recent years Akzo has pruned its fibre activities and focused
on bolstering its fast-growing pharmaceuticals business.
Nobel is near to finalising a deal to buy Akzo's paper chemicals operations,
which have annual sales of SKr350m. This is a separate deal, underway before
yesterday's announcement.

AHOLD, the Dutch food retailer, has received permission from the New York
Stock Exchange to move its existing American depositary receipts on to the
exchange starting on November 15, writes Ronald van de Krol.
Yesterday, an extraordinary Ahold shareholders meeting approved a 2-for-1
share split, designed to bring the company's share price into line with that
of other food retailers quoted on US stock exchanges. The split, which
halves the nominal value of Ahold's shares to Fl 1.25 (Dollars 0.65), also
takes effect on November 15.

FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Glynwed disposes of lossmaking US arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLYNWED, the international engineering group, has sold its lossmaking US
metals distribution business for Dollars 15.4m (Pounds 10.9m) and expects
its 1993 pre-tax profits to be Pounds 2m higher as a result.
The buyer is Samuel, Son and Co of Mississauga, Ontario, one of the biggest
metals distributors in North America and the company which bought Glynwed's
Canadian distribution business in 1991.
For Glynwed, the US metals distribution business has always been peripheral
to its main interests.
The companies it is selling came with Amari when it was acquired in 1988.
But it is selling the assets at less than their book value of Dollars 18.6m.
Ultimately Glynwed should receive about Dollars 20m, given that it is
retaining business debtors and there is a formula which, should Samuel's
return on the assets exceed a certain percentage over the next three years,
it will pay Glynwed additional sums.
For each of the last two years the businesses Glynwed has sold have lost
about Pounds 2m.

FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: WPP agrees sale of US agency for Dollars
55.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WPP, the heavily-indebted marketing services group, announced yesterday that
it had agreed the sale for Dollars 55.5m (Pounds 36.70m) of its 80 per cent
stake in Scali, McCabe, Sloves, the New York-based advertising agency group.
The sale is to The Lowe Group, a subsidiary of Interpublic, the US marketing
group.
The deal, which had been expected for some time, excludes Scali's operations
in Brazil, the Netherlands and Germany. It also excludes Fallon McElligott,
the US agency, for which WPP obtained Dollars 14.6m following a management
buy-out last month, and some New York property interests.
As part of the latest sale, a total of Dollars 34.9m will be paid in cash to
WPP and a further Dollars 8m will be phased in payments over two years.
Assumption of liabilities will total Dollars 12.6m.
In the half year to June 30 WPP's average net debt was Pounds 372m. As well
as the sale of its 64 per cent interest in Fallon in October, WPP recently
sold Seiniger Advertising, the Los Angeles-based producer of marketing
campaigns for films, for Dollars 6.9m.
No further divestment is expected in the immediate future; longer term, WPP
has said it is considering the flotation of the group's market research
activities and operations in south-east Asia.
Scali was acquired by WPP in 1989 as part of the Ogilvy group and from that
time it has been known that the agency was for sale.
The part of the operation that comes under the current deal had billings of
more than Dollars 550m in 1992, generated revenues of Dollars 73m and
recorded a net pre-tax loss of Dollars 2.8m.
Analysts had expected the sale of Scali to raise between Dollars 50m and
Dollars 70m. Given that WPP had already sold its interest in Fallon, which
was 80 per cent owned by Scali, for Dollars 14.6m, the total sale price is
seen as being at the top end of the scale.
The Lowe Group said that the acquisition would more than double the size of
its North American operation.
Mr Marvin Sloves, currently Scali chairman, will join the Lowe Group board
as vice chairman.

FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Man United defeat hits shares
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Manchester United tumbled 52p to 527p yesterday in the wake of the
English Premier League champions' elimination from the European Champions
Cup. They recovered to 545p at the close.
The defeat - over two legs and on the away goals rule - at the hands of
Galatasaray, the Turkish champions, meant that the UK club failed to qualify
for the lucrative mini-league stage of the competition. United would
automatically have accrued some Pounds 1.27m for qualifying to this later
play-off stage and then television fees and gate receipts could have brought
in a further Pounds 4m.
In the year to July 31, United lifted profits before transfer fees from
Pounds 7.68m to Pounds 8.19m. Touche Ross estimated that the aggregate value
of the first team squad rose to Pounds 30m (Pounds 24m).
The club currently leads England's senior league by 11 points.

FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Westbury 45% up at Pounds 3.7m as house
sales rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTBURY, the Cheltenham-based housebuilder, yesterday announced a 45 per
cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.7m in the six months to August
31 compared with Pounds 2.56m.
Earnings per share increased more modestly to 3.7p (3.5p) reflecting the
exceptional tax credit which significantly reduced the tax charge in 1992.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.75p.
Turnover in the first half increased by 8 per cent to Pounds 70m (Pounds
64.5m), buoyed by higher house sales which grew to 1,201 compared with 1,115
in the first half last year.
The average selling price in the group's core private housebuilding
activities was Pounds 60,628, down 1 per cent from a year earlier, even
though prices in the market as a whole fell by about 4 per cent.
Westbury managed to offset the decline by changing its product mix and
reducing the proportion of first-time buyer homes from 80 per cent to 70 per
cent of the total.
Mr Richard Fraser, chief executive, said house prices appear to have
stabilised in June. 'They are not going up, and they are not going down,' he
said.
Nevertheless, he said sales incentive discounts had fallen marginally, from
Pounds 2,800 to Pounds 2,350 a house.
The operating margin on house sales for the period was 6.2 per cent, in line
with a year ago but a significant increase over the 5 per cent achieved in
the six months to the end of February.
Operating profits increased from Pounds 3.63m to Pounds 4.2m more than
offsetting an increase in losses from the group's interests in associated
undertakings which climbed to Pounds 642,000 (Pounds 493,000).
Pre-tax profits also benefited from the turnround from Pounds 583,000 in net
interest costs to net interest receipts of Pounds 145,000.
During the six months Westbury acquired over 1,200 plots boosting its land
bank to 6,050 against 5,850 at the year end.
Mr Fraser said there was no general increase in land prices although there
was upward presure in some areas.
The group ended August with net borrowings of Pounds 4.2m, down from Pounds
7.4m at the year end, equivalent to gearing of 4 per cent.

FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Gartmore to be floated - Banque Indosuez to
sell 25% holding for Pounds 75.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANQUE INDOSUEZ, the French bank, is to raise Pounds 75.7m via the sale of
25 per cent of its UK fund management company, Gartmore, through a flotation
at 168p a share.
The sale values Gartmore, the UK's fourth largest pension fund management
company, at Pounds 338.6m, well above the company's own internal estimates
prior to flotation of between Pounds 270m and Pounds 300m.
Of the 45m shares to be sold, 3 per cent will be bought by Gartmore
directors at the offering price.
Of the remainder, 14 per cent are to be placed with institutional
shareholders in the UK and Europe and 8 per cent will be offered publicly.
In its prospectus, issued yesterday, Gartmore said its funds under
management had risen to Pounds 18.1bn by the end of September, up Pounds 2bn
in three months.
In the first nine months of this year, its funds under management have
soared by 41 per cent, according to Mr Philip Gibbs, financial industry
analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
By contrast, Mercury Asset Management, which is also 25 per cent publicly
owned and is the UK's largest pension fund manager, has been growing at an
annual rate of 4 to 5 per cent, he said.
The surge in Gartmore's business has been driven by the pension fund
consultants, who have been impressed with its consistently above-average
performance in recent years. In 1992, Gartmore's median fund outperformed
the industry median by nearly 4 percentage points.
Gartmore is forecasting earnings for 1993 of Pounds 24.5m or 8.4p per share,
and said it intended to issue a notional net dividend for the year of 4p per
share. The notional gross dividend yield will be 3 per cent.
Mr Paul Myners, Gartmore's chairman, said that the company's earnings could
be hurt if there were to be significant changes in the way pension funds
were regulated.
COMMENT
Gartmore's shares, at 20.7 times earnings, look expensive when compared to
those of, say, MAM, which trades at a more modest multiple of 16.7 per cent.
But the growth in Gartmore's business is staggering, and if you believe it
will continue to grow at its present rate the shares look cheap. However, it
is unlikely Gartmore's chief marketing edge, the superlative results of last
year, will be repeated. But even average results for the next two years will
still give it an impressive three-year returns picture to sell to
prospective clients. The big questions for Gartmore are whether it can keep
its returns up over the long haul and whether it has allowed itself to
become too dependent on a single source of new business, the UK pension fund
market.

FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Greycoat survival more likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE survival of Greycoat, the property company struggling to fend off
receivership, was more likely last night as the UK value fund appeared on
the verge of a rescue refinancing.
Lawyers and advisers for the fund, which is advised by corporate financiers
Mr Julian Trager and Mr Bryan Myerson, who advise the UK Active Value Fund,
were concluding details of a complex package that will have to reconcile the
conflicting interests of two sets of bond holders, preference and ordinary
share holders.
Last month a similar deal proposed by Postel, the UK's largest pension fund
and recommended by Greycoat's management, foundered when preference
shareholders and holders of zero coupon bonds rejected the offer on the
grounds that it undervalued the company's property assets.
The deal emerging last night appeared likely to raise more money through a
rights issue and to improve terms for bond holders while ordinary
shareholders would do slightly worse.

FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Throgmorton launches new trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW investment trust from fund management group Throgmorton aims to fill
the 'financing gap' faced by many smaller companies. The Throgmorton
Preferred Income Trust will buy preference shares issued by companies which
wish to raise new capital.
Throgmorton argues that 'despite the improvement in the economic outlook, it
would appear that smaller companies are currently experiencing difficulties
in obtaining borrowings on acceptable terms.'
Raising money via an ordinary share issue on the stock market is expensive
and Throgmorton believes that issuing preference shares will be a
cost-effective alternative for companies raising sums of Pounds 2m-Pounds
3m. The costs to the company of an issue will be about Pounds 50,000
compared with between Pounds 300,000 and Pounds 400,000 for a rights issue.
The trust will buy the whole of each preference issue, which will be
redeemable in five to seven years. The yield on each issue will be
negotiated with each company, but Throgmorton expects to receive a
substantial margin over gilts with the same maturity.
The trust will also take warrants to subscribe for about 5 per cent of each
company's shares, in order to provide the prospect of capital growth.
Preference shares were traditionally a main part of the UK stock market but
since the second world war the ravages of inflation have reduced their
appeal to investors. There is only about Pounds 2bn of straight
(non-convertible) preference share capital outstanding.
Shares in the Throgmorton trust are being placed with institutional
investors at 100p each, and will offer a higher than average yield.
Dividends will be paid twice yearly. Throgmorton hopes to raise between
Pounds 30m and Pounds 60m to invest in 20 to 30 companies.
Mr David Hughes, formerly director of corporate finance at venture capital
group 3i, will manage the trust. He says the money will be gradually
invested over the first year.
Expenses of the issue are being restricted to 1.8 per cent (assuming the
trust raises Pounds 30m). The annual management fee will be 1 per cent. The
trust will be wound up after seven-and-a-half years.

FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Bulmer sells pectin business for Pounds
8.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HP BULMER, the Hereford-based cider group, has sold its pectin business to
Citrus Colloids, a management-led consortium, for Pounds 8.5m.
Pectin, a natural product extracted from citrus fruit peel and apples, is
used as a gelling agent and stabiliser in a variety of foods and
pharmaceuticals.
Bulmer, though one of the world's largest pectin producers, has decided to
dispose of the business to concentrate resources on its core drinks
operations.
The sale includes its UK manufacturing plant and its 50 per cent stake in
Braspectina, a Brazilian pectin producer.
The business, which employs 270 people, made a profit before interest of
Pounds 1m on turnover of Pounds 12.5m in the year to end-April. After a long
period of steady volume growth, the pectin market has been hit by worldwide
recession, decreased demand from the former Soviet Union, and growing
competition in the past 18 months.
However, Mr Brian Carver, managing director of the Bulmer business since
1983 and leader of the buy-out, said yesterday: 'Bulmer's decision has
presented us with a tremendous opportunity. We have, over several years,
built up a balanced worldwide market and this, together with the cost
advantages of Braspectina, will give us a strong competitive advantage.'
Citrus Colloids has been backed by 3i, the investment capital group, and
Lenice, Bulmer's Brazilian partner, from which the management consortium is
also acquiring the balance of Braspectina.
Bulmer will receive Pounds 8.5m cash on completion, subject to an adjustment
based on the value of the net assets of the UK pectin operation.
A deferred consideration, equal to the fair value of 7.5 per cent of the
ordinary shares in the pectin business, will become payable in cash on the
sale of shares in Citrus Colloids.

FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Wilson Bowden seeks Pounds 57m to acquire
land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILSON BOWDEN yesterday became the sixth UK housebuilder this year to
announce a rights issue. It is raising Pounds 57.1m to buy land to take
advantage of the housing market recovery.
This will take the total raised by housebuilders to Pounds 470m in the first
10 months of the year. This includes Pounds 215m from Tarmac and Pounds 104m
from Wimpey. Four of the companies, Wilson Bowden, Countryside Properties,
Berkeley Group and Bellway, also had rights issues in 1991.
In its latest offer, Wilson Bowden is inviting shareholders to buy one new
share at 375p for every five shares already held.
The company's share price slid by 8p to 439p following the announcement.
The family interests of Mr David Wilson, chairman, which own 57.5 per cent
have placed their nil paid rights at 32.2p a share which will reduce their
holdings to 48.6 per cent.
The latest offer price is only 15p more than the 1991 rights price of 360p,
when the company raised Pounds 34.1m in a 1-for-7 issue.
Since then the company has raised output from 1,300 homes a year to about
1,800 this year. The number of housing plots it owns that are available for
development has also risen, from 8,000 to more than 10,000.
Mr Wilson said the company planned to increase output to 2,500 homes a year
by 1995-96. The rights issue cash would be used to help fund the expansion.
In particular, the company wanted 'to take advantage of Pounds 30m of land
buying opportunities already identified'. It was becoming increasingly
difficult to win planning permissions for building and therefore
opportunities to acquire development land should not be missed.
Mr Wilson said: 'Although economic recovery in the UK remains hesitant,
positive features are beginning to appear in the housing market.'
The company had completed 1,471 homes in the first 10 months of this year
compared with 1,060 at the corresponding stage last year - a rise of 39 per
cent. After allowing for first time gains from new sites the underlying
volume sales improvement was probably between 15 to 20 per cent, said Mr
Wilson.
He added that new house prices had stopped falling, although they had still
to start rising. The group was operating from 77 housing sites in 25 English
counties and sales outside its East Midlands base now accounted for half of
all housebuilding profits.
The company intends to recommend a final net dividend of 6.65p making a
total for this year of 9.3p, an increase of 6.3 per cent. The rights issue
has been underwritten by Schroders and brokers are James Capel.
COMMENT
That Wilson Bowden shareholders will most likely take up their rights on a
slim 15 per cent discount to an ex-rights price of 433p illustrates the
strength of a company which has consistently out-performed the sector. Its
strength is its long land bank which is about to grow again. The cash call,
given gearing is under 25 per cent, may be a little opportunistic but the
money, as in the 1991 rights, will be used to buy assets rather than simply
strengthen balance sheets as housebuilders did two years ago. Pre-tax
profits this year including a Pounds 5m pension fund credit should be about
Pounds 30m. The company deserves its reputation as one of the best in the
sector.

FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Bellway up 28% on the back of rising house
sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits at Bellway, the north-east-based housebuilder, jumped 28 per
cent to Pounds 16.73m during the 12 months to the end of July.
The company was helped by a rise in sales to private house owners and to
housing associations which this year have benefited from increased
government aid.
Turnover rose by 13 per cent to Pounds 147.16m on the back of a record 2,299
house sales, a rise of almost a quarter on the 1,841 sold the previous year.
Mr Kenneth Bell, chairman, said the company proposed to increase its final
dividend by 0.5p to 8p, in line with the forecast made when it raised Pounds
33.6m in a 2-for-7 rights issue in February. That makes a 12p (11.5p) total.
To improve the marketability of its shares Bellway is recommending that the
25p ordinary shares be split into 12.5p units 'to double the number of
shares in issue.'
Mr Bell said operating margins during the 12 months had risen by almost a
fifth, from 8.3 per cent to 9.9 per cent, reflecting the benefit of higher
sales volume and also the replacement of more expensively bought land which
had been acquired during the late 1980s. The company's share price slipped
2p to 455p after the results. This compares with an issue price of 320p at
the time of the rights offer.
The group intends to use its improved financial muscle - it had net cash of
Pounds 44m at the end of July - to expand sales. Since the summer it has
committed a further Pounds 30m on land acquisitions. The number of plots
owned by the group with planning permission has risen from 5,500 since July
1991 to about 10,000 currently.
The number of sites from which the group sells has risen from about 100 to
120.
COMMENT
Bellway, like Wilson Bowden, has used rights issue cash raised in 1991 and
again this year to finance expansion. Sales are planned to rise to 4,000 a
year in England and in Scotland by the mid-1990s. Any short-fall on housing
association work in the current year should be more than made up in improved
private sector sales as the number of sites the group operates from
continues to expand. Margins are on the mend and should improve further as
the housing market recovers. The balance sheet also is in good shape.
Bellway deserves its premium rating with pre-tax profits likely to reach
Pounds 22m to Pounds 23m in 1993-94 but its strengths are already recognised
in the share price.

FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Warning clips FNFC shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST NATIONAL Finance Corporation, the consumer credit group, said
yesterday that it expected losses in its commercial lending division to be
'somewhat higher' for the 12 months to October 31 than for the previous
year.
The shares reacted via an 11p fall to 75p.
Last time the commercial lending bank activity, FNCB, incurred a deficit of
Pounds 19m. For the year just ended a loss of between Pounds 20m and Pounds
30m is expected. The extent of the losses is seen as the result of
continuing difficulties in the property market.
Along with the appointment of a new executive vice-chairman FNFC also
announced that it had decided to underline the statement that accompanied
its first half results in July that 'further substantial provisions and
losses' were expected in its commercial lending division and discontinued
activities.
There had been concern within the company that the scale of the losses had
not been fully appreciated by analysts.
Mr Tim Ingram, finance director, said the 'clarification' of the earlier
statement had no implications for FNFC's ability to fulfil the terms of the
refinancing deal agreed in July for its Pounds 1.1bn debt owed to 107
international banks, and through which it narrowly avoided collapse.
The results for the year to October 31 1993 are due to be announced in
January.

FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: More funds for Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SYNDICATE Capital Trust, the Lloyd's investment vehicle sponsored by Rafael
Zorn Hemsley, the stockbrokers, yesterday became the fourth Lloyd's
investment company to raise capital from institutional investors this week.
In the last two weeks institutional investors have committed more than
Pounds 500m in corporate capital allowing the insurance market to underwrite
an additional Pounds 1bn in insurance premiums next year. Two other trusts
plan formal launches today, raising a further Pounds 80m in funds.
Rafael Zorn Hemsley placed Pounds 32.5m of shares in Syndicate Capital
Trust, with institutions and was seeking to raise a further Pounds 17.5m
through an open offer for subscription. SCT has secured some Pounds 60m of
capacity on 15 Lloyd's syndicates. The trust's capital will be managed by
John Govett.
Abtrust, the Abderdeen based fund management company, expects today to
publish full listing particulars for Abtrust Lloyd's Insurance Trust. A
Pounds 30m placing and intermediaries offer is to be handled by Peel Hunt,
the stockbrokers. The trust has Pounds 30m in allocated capacity.
Delian Lloyd's Investment Trust, sponsored by Hill Samuel, also expects to
complete a placing with institutions to raise up to Pounds 50m in capital
today.
Meanwhile two other trusts both published pathfinders yesterday. Nelson
Lloyd's Trust, yesterday issued a pathfinder prospectus. It plans to raise
Pounds 60m through a placement and offer for subscription and will provide
Pounds 113m in capacity for Lloyd's syndicates.
Premium Trust and Premium Underwriting also issued a pathfinder and said it
had raised its capital raising target by 10 per cent to Pounds 33m.

FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Hambro Insurance at Pounds 3.25m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS at Hambro Insurance Services, the insurance services company which
obtained a stock market listing in March, have been dented by a fall in the
number of claims handled by the group's loss adjusting subsidiary.
For the six months to September 30 pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 3.25m
(Pounds 4.02m). Earnings per share fell to 3.05p (4.25p) and the interim
dividend is 1.85p.
Turnover in loss adjusting increased marginally to Pounds 18.91m (Pounds
18.89m), but profits fell from Pounds 1.82m to Pounds 372,000. The group's
UK loss adjusting subsidiary, Cunningham UK, has handled an average of 4,600
claims a month, compared with 5,200 this time last year.
As a result, 46 of the loss adjusting staff have been made redundant, saving
the group some Pounds 700,000.
Elsewhere, turnover at Hambro Legal Protection, which operates legal advice
and other telephone helplines, increased by 17 per cent to Pounds 6.12m
(Pounds 5.22m), with profits up to Pounds 2.09m (Pounds 1.62m).
The group's second hand endowment policy business also performed strongly,
with turnover up 29 per cent to Pounds 8.08m (Pounds 6.29m) and profits up
to Pounds 567,000 (Pounds 521,000). Profits at Berkeley Insurance, a
specialist broking consultancy, were also ahead of last year, rising to
Pounds 71,000 (Pounds 58,000).
Interest receivable by holding company net of overheads amounted to Pounds
146,000.

FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Wm Low edges ahead to Pounds 21m - Growing
competition behind food retailer's sluggish growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WM LOW, the Dundee-based food retailer facing growing competition from both
discount chains and superstores, yesterday reported a modest 2.4 per cent
increase in full year pre-tax profits boosted by two new store openings.
Pre-tax profits edged up from Pounds 20.6m to Pounds 21.1m in the 52 weeks
to September 4. Turnover increased by 6.4 per cent to Pounds 447m (Pounds
420m) mainly reflecting the opening of the new stores.
However, on a like-for-like basis sales grew by just 0.5 per cent. The group
acknowleded that several factors limited growth during the year including
consumers' down-trading to cheaper products, low inflation and 'increased
price competition in all sectors of the market and the continuing increase
in new forms of food retailing.'
Nevertheless, Mr Philip Spicer, chief executive, emphasised that despite
these tough new trading conditions the group had been 'squeezed not
squashed.'
However, static or falling store volumes resulted in higher operating cost
ratios both in the branches and in head office. As a result, net operating
margins in the second half were 5.1 per cent compared with 5.9 per cent in
the same period last year but 0.3 per cent ahead of the first half.
Operating profits increased to Pounds 22.1m (Pounds 20.6m) but interest
costs jumped to Pounds 992,000 (Pounds 1,000 interest receipts) after
capitalising Pounds 2.32m (Pounds 3.03m) of interest on borrowings incurred
to finance the group's development programme.
Capital expenditure for the past year was Pounds 41.7m but is expected to be
scaled back to about Pounds 29m this year. This expenditure will be partly
offset by the estimated Pounds 9m proceeds from the sale of a retail park
development and other disposals.
The group ended the year with net borrowings of Pounds 55.5m, equivalent to
gearing of 33 per cent. Earnings per share edged ahead to 28.52p (28.22p)
and the proposed final dividend is held at 5.7p making an unchanged total of
8.4p. The shares fell 6p to close at 154p.
COMMENT
Wm Low is being squeezed at both ends of the fast changing retail food
sector in the group's traditional heartland. The deep discounters like
Shopright are going head-to-head on price while the superstore operators
like Sainsbury, which are expanding in Scotland, can overwhelm on range.
Although capital spending is being slowed pre-tax profits this year could
fall to about Pounds 17m producing earnings of about 18.2p and a prospective
p/e of 8.5, a significant discount to an already battered sector.

FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Raglan back in profit and calls for Pounds
19m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAGLAN Property Trust yesterday called for Pounds 19.3m net via a 2-for-1
rights issue and also reported a swing from losses of Pounds 1.47m to
profits of Pounds 89,000 pre-tax for the six months to end-September.
The proceeds of the issue will enable Raglan to acquire selective investment
properties 'on attractive terms'.
It is currently negotiating the acquisition of a number of commercial
property portfolios which, if completed, would have an aggregate cost of
Pounds 31m.
A contract for the purchase of one of these portfolios, comprising 16 shops
and five offices, is expected to be exchanged before the end of the year at
a cost of Pounds 12m.
The group recently agreed to acquire a 150-year leasehold interest in the
existing Castle Centre shopping precinct in Banbury, near Oxford, from
Cherwell district council. The stake will entitle Raglan to 39.5 per cent of
the total rents received from tenants in the centre.
The shopping precinct is located immediately adjacent to land and property
that Raglan proposes to develop.
Some Pounds 8.5m of the money being raised has been earmarked to acquire the
interest in the Castle Centre and to fund Raglan's development proposals in
Banbury over the next two years.
The rights issue, which is being underwritten by NM Rothschild, is of 62.45m
new ordinary shares at 32p per share. The existing shares slipped 2p
yesterday to 45p. Brokers to the issue are Cazenove &amp; Co.
Turnover for the opening half year totalled Pounds 4.93m (Pounds 187,000).
Interest charges were cut from Pounds 337,000 to Pounds 67,000 and earnings
per share emerged at 0.3p (losses of Pounds 20.91p).
Mr Charles Cecil, the chairman, said the return to profitability was a
'welcome sign that the plans put in place at the time of the restructuring
in April were beginning to bear fruit'.

FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Euromoney shows 28% rise to Pounds 17.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROMONEY Publications, the information group 75 per cent-owned by the Daily
Mail and General Trust, lifted pre-tax profits by 28 per cent from Pounds
13.8m to Pounds 17.7m in the year to September 30.
All parts of the group increased profits, except transport and leasing
publishing. This, Mr Richard Ensor, Euromoney managing director, ascribed to
the flatness of the aviation industry.
Operating profits in the group's core activity, international financial
publishing, grew to Pounds 9.54m (Pounds 8.79m). Mr Ensor said that this
area had been steadily rising over the years and profits were not simply
derived from Euromoney magazine.
Another engine behind the profits advance was training, which was swelled by
the Pounds 3.7m acquisition of the banking and management training arm of DC
Gardner in June. It was now Euromoney's second main activity and lifted
operating profits to Pounds 2.71m (Pounds 1.34m).
Mr Ensor said that Gardner had only contributed for its poorest quarter and
that there had been some disruption from moving following the purchase.
Mr Ensor saw scope for both organic and acquisition expansion, though any of
the latter would be in 'niche' training - either in geography or subject.
Profits were also boosted by a greater contribution from associated
undertakings, up to Pounds 1.27m (Pounds 237,000). This was partly due to
AIC, the international seminars business. In July, Euromoney lifted its
stake in AIC from 40 per cent to 60 per cent.
Indeed, the group said it had paid Pounds 14m for 33 businesses since
September 1989 and expected to spend a further Pounds 18m over the next two
years increasing its stakes in them.
Mr Ensor said that this gradual method of acquisition gave vendors an
incentive to manage the businesses as well as possible in the earn-out
period.
Group turnover expanded to Pounds 49.7m (Pounds 44.9m), with Pounds 4.05m
coming from acquisitions during the year. Earnings were up at 56.84p
(44.41p) per share and the dividend is increased to a proposed 38p (29.5p).

FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Smaller companies trusts to raise Pounds
70m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO SMALLER companies investment trusts announced plans to raise up to
Pounds 70m of new capital yesterday. Both Foreign &amp; Colonial Smaller
Companies and Amicable Smaller Enterprises are issuing C shares in a
combination of a placing and open offer.
F&amp;C Smaller Companies was ranked fourth among 29 smaller companies trusts in
the year to November 1, according to Micropal, a performance ranking
service; Amicable Smaller Enterprises was ranked fifth. UK smaller company
shares have outperformed their larger brethren this year, after four
successive calendar years of underperformance.
The F&amp;C fund is international in scope, and buys shares in emerging markets.
It says it will use the capital raised to 'look at nearly new issues which
have come to the market within the last two years and have achieved solid,
but unexciting share prices.'
F&amp;C will issue up to 40m C shares at 100p, via a combination of a placing,
open offer to existing shareholders on a 1-for-6 basis, and an
offer-for-subscription. The C shares will convert into ordinary shares
before March 25, 1994; issuing shares is a common device used by trusts when
raising new capital, and is designed to avoid dilution of the net asset
value of existing shares.
Amicable Smaller Enterprises is placing 25.15m C shares and making an open
offer of a further 5m C shares at 100p each. The directors believe 'there
are currently favourable opportunities for investment in UK smaller
companies and therefore that it is an appropriate time to expand the capital
base of the company.' The Amicable C shares will convert before December 31.
Both issues will need to be approved at extraordinary meetings - on November
29 for Amicable Smaller and on December 2 for F&amp;C Smaller. Shares in F&amp;C
Smaller fell  1/2 p to 168p yesterday; Amicable Smaller shares were
unchanged at 121p.

FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Medeva court setback over drug infringement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEDEVA, the rapidly growing pharmaceuticals company whose shares halved this
summer after a profits warning, yesterday suffered a further set back in the
High Court.
Mr Justice Aldous ruled that Medeva's activities had infringed a patent held
by US drug company Biogen for a Hepatitis B vaccine.
The vaccine, bought by Medeva last year, was the company's best early
opportunity to produce a block-buster drug and demonstrate it could market
products it had developed.
Mr Bernard Taylor, chairman, said Medeva was 'disappointed and surprised by
the decision' and the company would appeal. When the vaccine was bought for
an initial Pounds 3.86m in 1992, Medeva expected a fight with Biogen but had
expected to win. Last year the European Patent Office revoked Biogen's
patent over Hepatitis B, a decision which the US company is also appealing
against.
A Medeva spokesman said that if the EPO rejected this appeal when it passed
judgment next year, the decision would over-rule whatever had happened in
the British High Court.
Medeva's shares had a roller coaster day, rising sharply initially on
anticipation of the judge finding in Medeva's favour. The shares then fell
to 109p in heavy trading before recovering to close at 119 1/2 p, a loss of
5 1/2 p on the day.
The judge held Biogen's patent partially valid on the Hepatitis B vaccine
which is licensed to Merck and SmithKline Beecham. Medeva said it would
continue to develop the vaccine, sales of which were not due to start until
1995-96.
The company has adopted a novel strategy that includes buying portfolios of
drugs in late stages of development to take them through the regulatory
procedures to market.
Just as the strategy was beginning to convert some of the sceptics in the
summer, Medeva warned that profits this year would rise but still be well
below expectations.
There was a write-down of previously reported profits in MD Pharmaceuticals,
its Californian subsidiary, but the company also said MD had been forced by
the Food and Drug Administration to close temporarily to deal with
production shortcomings.
In September, Medeva's hopes of launching a generic metered dose inhaler
which would have challenged markets dominated by proprietary anti-asthma
products, also suffered a setback.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Volvo chairman confident of allaying merger fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR PEHR Gyllenhammar, the chairman of Volvo, insisted yesterday that the
chances were 'very good' of overcoming shareholder resistance to the
proposed merger of the Swedish group's car and truck operations with
France's Renault.
He said he took seriously the criticism in Sweden of his role in the affair.
He intends to stay on as chairman and retain his designated role as head of
the supervisory board of the merged company until it has achieved 'a
successful departure'.
One of Mr Gyllenhammar's toughest critics, the small shareholders'
association Aktiespararna, yesterday called on Volvo to drop the merger
plan. Its opposition was instrumental in forcing Volvo's decision last week
to postpone until December 7 a vote on the deal by its shareholders.
But Mr Gyllenhammar said, in an interview with the Financial Times, that the
company was optimistic about overcoming shareholder objections, which focus
on the lack of information on the value of the merger, the timetable for
Renault's privatisation and the French government's plans to hold a golden
share in the merged company.
'We find very little opposition to the industrial logic. We find very few
who don't believe we can make more money for shareholders together than
separately. If we can address these other concerns - give more
clarification, perhaps get positive news on privatisation - then we think
the chance is very good.'
Mr Gyllenhammar said Volvo was seeking help from Paris on the golden share
matter, in spite of French insistence that it is non-negotiable. Swedish
shareholders are alarmed that the terms could mean Volvo being forced to
lower its proposed 35 per cent share in the merged company to 20 per cent.
'We are trying to get an interpretation or assurances that it would only be
applied under certain circumstances.'
The Volvo chief, who has headed the company for 22 years, cheerfully
admitted that 'many people dislike me'. He has said he will drop all
executive roles at Volvo from next year, but he was unhesitating in saying
he wanted to stay on as chairman.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Sandner in Globex initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JACK Sandner, chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, yesterday
tried to gain the initiative in the struggle for control of Globex, the
troubled electronic futures system.
He suggested that Globex be governed by a 'consortium' of exchanges, each
with an equal voice in the system's affairs.
Under his proposal, the CME and the Chicago Board of Trade - the world's
largest futures exchanges - would give up their management of the system,
which was developed jointly with the UK-based news and information group
Reuters. But he rejected the idea that Reuters should run Globex as a
utility.
If agreement is not reached before April, Reuters is widely expected to
strip control from the Chicago exchanges when their contract comes up for
renewal.
The plan addresses issues that have kept Liffe, London's futures exchange,
from participating in Globex, and threaten to drive the Matif, the French
futures exchange, off the system.
Disputes between the three Globex partners have hampered the system's
international expansion, leading to losses for Reuters, Globex's largest
investor.
The CME's face-saving proposal was given a non-committal welcome by the
other players, who said they had not discussed details with Mr Sandner.
Any change would have to be palatable to Liffe, whose volume is sorely
needed to revive the system, and to the Matif, which currently generates 85
per cent of Globex's volume. 'It sounds very interesting, but we need to
study the detail,' said Mr Daniel Hodson, Liffe's chief executive. Reuters
would study all proposals.
It is not surprising that the CME is attempting to broker an end to Globex
disputes. Unike the world's other main futures exchanges, the CME depends
solely on Globex for after-hours trading, and would be at a competitive
disadvantage without it.
The 20-point CME plan provides a means for dispute arbitration; forbids
Reuters from negotiating with exchanges not party to the consortium; and
shortens exchanges' commitments to Globex to three years. It sets technical
performance standards for Reuters and removes a requirement that the
exchanges pay several million dollars per year to Reuters if they fail to
sell their quota of Globex terminals.

FT  05 NOV 93 / End of Manoplax pulls Boots down by 6%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 35m CHARGE to cover the cost of withdrawing the heart drug Manoplax
pushed interim profits at Boots, the retailing and pharmaceuticals group,
down 6 per cent to Pounds 174.6m.
There was a further Pounds 14m charge in Boots Pharmaceuticals division to
cover redundancy costs and the completion of clinical trials, although there
were matching savings on aborted research and marketing costs. Boots also
wrote off Pounds 5.1m relating to Asilone, an antacid product purchased for
Pounds 12.5m, following a review of brand strategy. Sir James Blyth, chief
executive, said Boots was conducting a 'fundamental reappraisal' of its
pharmaceuticals business following the withdrawal of Manoplax and no options
were ruled out. He refused to say when this might be completed. 'This is not
something we are going to rush.'
He was confident Boots' gross margins, which increased 0.5 points in the
first half, would not be affected by the escalation in price competition
between UK grocery retailers. Boots' strength, he said, was its own-label
products, which accounted for about 45 per cent of sales. 'That means our
ability to protect our margins is greater. It gives us the opportunity to
price tactically when we need to.'
Group turnover increased from Pounds 1.85bn to Pounds 1.99bn in the six
months to September 30, in spite of what Boots called 'dull market
conditions'.
Exceptional items pushed Boots Pharmaceuticals' profit down to Pounds 2.1m
from Pounds 58.4m last year. Sales increased 9.5 per cent to Pounds 252.8m,
but when adjusted for devaluation of sterling, they fell 2.8 per cent. There
was further bad news at Do It All, the DIY joint venture with WH Smith,
where Boot's share of losses increased from Pounds 4.9m to Pounds 7.9m, on
sales down from Pounds 113.1m to Pounds 107.4m. Elsewhere, the outlook was
brighter. Boots the Chemists lifted sales 5.8 per cent to Pounds 1.3bn, and
profits by 13 per cent to Pounds 132.7m, while profits at Halfords, the
motor accessories chain, almost quadrupled to Pounds 5.8m from sales up 9.6
per cent to Pounds 174.1m.
The overall figures also included an exceptional gain of Pounds 9.8m on the
disposal of Sephora, the French perfumes chain, and Boots print packaging
business.
The interim dividend was lifted from 4.6 to 4.9p, although the exceptional
charges resulted in an 8 per cent fall in earnings to 11.5p. Stripping out
exceptionals, the results were broadly in line with forecasts, and Boots
shares gained 6p to 511p.

FT  05 NOV 93 / BP nearly doubles profits in quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BP nearly doubled replacement cost profits to Pounds 332m in the third
quarter, shrugging off weak oil prices and sluggish economic conditions.
Excluding exceptional items, the rise in replacement cost profits - which
leave out swings in inventory values - was 51 per cent. Reduced losses on
disposal of businesses in the third quarter of 1993, compared with the
previous year, and increased tax credits were responsible for much of the
difference. For the first time since 1991 the company saw a cash inflow from
operations excluding disposals. Cash inflow was Pounds 733m while disposal
proceeds were Pounds 522m.
Better-than-expected progress was made in reducing debt, which fell by
Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) during the quarter to Dollars 13.1bn - gearing of
86 per cent compared with 102 per cent a year ago.
The reduction in debt was helped by an accelerated programme of disposals of
non-core assets. These totalled Dollars 2.4bn in the first nine months, well
ahead of a full-year target of Dollars 1.5bn-Dollars 2bn. Mr Simon said
disposals for 1994 would 'probably be about Dollars 1bn'. Earnings per share
for the quarter were 6.2p, while the third quarterly dividend was unchanged
at 2.1p. The shares rose 10p to 357p.
BP's operating profit for the first nine months of the year was Pounds
1.89bn, 44 per cent up on the same period last year.
Mr David Simon, chief executive, said BP's strong performance reflected cost
savings, improved oil marketing margins and a stronger dollar. The company
also received a Pounds 50m after-tax benefit from changes made by the
government last March to petroleum revenue tax.
The star performer for the quarter was refining and marketing. BP attributed
its success to improved margins, although analysts thought BP's cost-cutting
in the division may have been particularly successful.
Mr Simon said the latest results showed that BP was on track to make profits
of Dollars 2bn a year by 1995.
Chemicals lost Pounds 16m in the third quarter against a loss of Pounds 1m
in the same period last year. Mr Simon pinpointed Europe's over-capacity in
ethylene as a problem and said BP might 'look to its own solutions' if there
was no early pan-European agreement to cut capacity.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Exchange acts to curb price-sensitive leaks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London Stock Exchange yesterday issued proposed guidance intended to
curb selective leaking of price-sensitive information which could give rise
to insider dealing.
However, the guidance stops short of defining price-sensitive information or
requiring quarterly financial reporting, measures sought by investor groups.
Requirements for unaudited quarterly reporting were also supported by
members of the exchange's own Large Companies Advisory Committee,
particularly those which are quoted in the US and have coped with quarterly
reporting there.
The guidance is the result of an initiative launched in late summer, in
conjunction with the 100 Group of Finance Directors as well as shareholder
and analyst associations.
That move followed the stock exchange's first ever censure of a traded
company, LIG, the world's leading branded condom maker, for telling selected
analysts of its financial condition, and concerns about insider dealing
rules in the government's new criminal justice bill.
Mr Martin Hall, director of policy at the stock exchange, said the committee
rejected quarterly reporting because too many changes in accounting policy
were pending. 'There is a feeling that requiring quarterly reporting would
be the straw that broke the camel's back.'
However, the guidance, which will be adopted formally early next year after
consultation, does go some way towards helping companies decide when they
need to make a public announcement and urges them to issue more of them. For
instance, it encourages companies to issue unaudited quarterly reports or to
make a statement about trading conditions immediately after the close of the
reporting period.
It also reminds companies that there is no such thing as a 'close period'
immediately prior to publication of profits which prevents the dissemination
of price-sensitive information. The close period merely limits the time in
which directors may deal in their own company shares.
The guidance also reminds directors they may not leak price-sensitive
information to Sunday newspaper journalists - often used to lessen the
impact on share prices of negative or controversial information. Exchange
rules require that information must also be distributed simultaneously to
two wire services and two national newspapers.

FT  05 NOV 93 / BT warns on outlook for dividends: Improvement in profits,
volumes and advertising demand - Shares slip 7p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST-HALF results at British Telecommunications reflected a modest recovery
in the UK economy, with improvements in profits, call volumes and demand for
Yellow Pages advertising.
The shares slipped 7p to 469 1/2 p, however, on warnings that the present
rate of dividend growth was unlikely to be maintained.
Mr Iain Vallance, BT chairman, announced an interim payment of 6.65p, up 8.1
per cent. But 'future dividend policy will need, more than ever, to take
account of continuing low inflation, harsher regulation, tougher competition
and emerging long-term needs and opportunities'.
The City interpreted his remarks to mean that current market expectations of
secure dividend growth of 8.5 per cent or so with a dividend cover of about
1.7 times, were unrealistic.
Under the terms of its licence, BT must keep increases in its main prices to
the rate of inflation minus 7 1/2 per cent. BT has been making clear the
difficulty of meeting a formula set when inflation was significantly higher
than now. Last week it announced the first Pounds 125m of Pounds 500m worth
of price cuts to stay within the limit.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to September 30 grew almost 50 per cent to
Pounds 1.5bn from Pounds 1.02bn. After adjustments for redundancy charges
and losses on disposals, however, the true increase was only 2.5 per cent.
In the first six months of 1992, the company took redundancy charges of
Pounds 442m and disposal losses of Pounds 135m, compared with Pounds 150m
and a profit of Pounds 2m respectively this time.
Turnover was up 3.5 per cent to Pounds 6.76m. Earnings per share came out 45
per cent ahead at 15.6p - but leaving aside charges and disposals the
increase was only 0.3 per cent.
Inland call volume grew 1.4 per cent in the half year and 3.5 per cent in
the second quarter, compared with a decline of about 1 per cent a year ago.
The increase in call volume more than compensated for volume discounts
introduced through the year, BT said. On a 12-month moving average, there
was a 3 per cent increase in inland call turnover and a 7 per cent increase
in international call turnover. During the first half 4,400 people left the
company. Some 30,000 are expected to leave within two years.
Mr Vallance said the company was in continuous talks with a broad range of
prospective partners in new businesses including multimedia and
entertainment.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Fresh fall in bond prices hits US shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US STOCK markets fell heavily for the second consecutive day yesterday as
fresh declines in government bond prices and rising long-term interest rates
rattled Wall Street.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 36.89 points at 3,624.98,
matching Wednesday's losses. The Dow has fallen more than 70 points in the
last two days.
The heavy selling of stocks was triggered by the fifth day of sharp declines
on the US bond market. The fall in bond prices pushed long-term interest
rates, as measured by the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond, up to 6.2 per
cent. Last week, before the latest selling bout, the 30-year bond was
yielding 5.9 per cent.
It is this sudden and sharp rise in long-term interest rates that has
unnerved stock market investors, even though the bond market has been in a
free fall primarily because of signs that US economic growth is improving.
Evidence of renewed growth concerns bond investors, who worry that a
stronger economy will eventually lead to higher inflation, which undermines
the value of their fixed-rate investments. Yesterday's plunge in the bond
market was sparked by news of a decline in the number of people claiming
unemployment insurance last week, and steady growth in September factory
orders and third-quarter industrial productivity.
Investors also sold bonds because they feared the October employment report,
due out today, would detail further improvements in job growth.
Normally, good economic news would lift share prices. Stock market
investors, however, have ignored signs of economic growth in the last few
days and concentrated instead on the rise in long-term interest rates.
Higher interest rates are unpopular with the stock market because they put
up the cost of corporate borrowing, which can depress company spending on
future expansion and lower corporate profits. Rising interest rates also
make stocks look less attractive than other investments.
The Nasdaq composite of secondary stocks fell 15.69, or two per cent, to end
at 757.26.
Yesterday's losses on stock and bond markets heighten the significance of
the October monthly employment report. If it shows an increase in non-farm
jobs greater than the 160,000 forecast by Wall Street, bond prices could
fall further, prompting a fresh round of selling in stock markets.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Yeltsin thwarting free and fair election, EC delegation told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin is thwarting a free and fair election by depriving
opposition parties and groups of media coverage and facilities to organise
ahead of the polls due in December, a European parliamentary delegation was
told in Moscow this week.
Allegations of corruption have also been made against some of the parties
trying to collect the required 100,000 signatures needed by midnight tonight
to qualify for registration.
At least 32 main parties are trying to gather the signatures and most are
likely to qualify.
Ms Magdalena Hoff, leader of a delegation of European Community
parliamentarians which visited Moscow this week, heard a litany of
complaints about the electoral process, the most serious from parties on the
communist left and nationalist right.
The strongest allegation came from Mr Sergei Baburin, leader of the Russian
National Union and a former hardline deputy, who said that his telephone and
those of all the deputies who had stayed in the Russian parliament
throughout the siege had been cut. He had been told he could only meet
foreign correspondents in his home with the permission of the authorities.
The loss of communications made it difficult to organise the collection of
signatures, he said.
Mr Genady Zyuganov, leader of the Russian Communist party, said he had
written to Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, first deputy prime minister, asking for a
meeting to protest against media bias - but had received no reply.
'At the moment, news broadcasts begin with (Mr Yegor) Gaidar (the first
deputy prime minister and head of the liberal Russia's Choice group) and end
with Gaidar.'
From the centrist groups Mr Arkady Volsky, leader of the Civic Union, said
that the press - much of it still subsidised by the state - was heavily
biased in favour of the pre-presidential groups, such as Russia's Choice.
He had told Ms Hoff, he said, that 'we don't need observers on election day,
we need them now'.
Mr Nikolai Travkin, leader of the Democratic party, said calling elections
on a tight schedule with unclear rules 'had one justification - securing the
legitimacy of the current power. It is political piracy.' He admitted,
however, that it offered a chance to avert a social explosion.
Most of the main groups now claim to have or be near to securing the
signatures needed - but there are numerous allegations of buying votes.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Molyneaux optimistic on talks: Ulster Unionist party leader
says N Ireland assembly is possible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JAMES MOLYNEAUX last night gave a substantial boost to the Anglo-Irish
initiative for peace in Northern Ireland by delivering a surprisingly upbeat
assessment of its prospects for success.
In his first public comments since Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr
Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, launched the initiative in Brussels
last week, the leader of the biggest political party in the province, the
Ulster Unionist party, suggested a Northern Ireland assembly could be set up
'in the fairly short term'.
He also responded positively to the six-point plan set out recently by Mr
Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, saying it was a 'hopeful sign'.
His remarks came as Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social
Democratic and Labour party, sought to revive his joint peace initiative
with Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, by claiming the offer of a
'total cessation of violence' was on the table as a result of their
dialogue.
Mr Hume said there would be 'peace within a week' if his initiative was
embraced. 'My conclusion is that that is now a real possibility - a total
cessation of violence, not a ceasefire.'
But after an hour-long meeting between Mr Hume and Mr Major, Downing Street
issued a fresh rebuff to the SDLP leader, insisting it was last week's
statement by Mr Major and Mr Reynolds that had set out the basis for 'peace,
stability and reconciliation' in the province.
Further cold water was poured over the Hume-Adams plan by Mr Molyneaux, who
said it was 'six bridges too far'.
In a move likely to inflame Unionists further, Mr Hume said he intended to
brief Mr Adams on his meeting at Downing Street.
The session was also attended by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland
secretary. Mr Hume indicated later it would no longer be possible for Sir
Patrick to say he did not know details of the Hume-Adams initiative.
Mr Major is seeing leaders of the province's four constitutional political
parties over the next few days. Yesterday's meeting with Mr Hume was
followed by a similar session with Mr John Alderdice of the Alliance party.
Last night's Downing Street statement emphasised that the government was
'ready' to table proposals to give 'focus and direction' to talks involving
the four parties once they agreed to resume negotiations.
It emerged yesterday that the Irish government believes it will become clear
by early December if there is to be a breakthrough on the Major-Reynolds
peace initiative. Mr Reynolds told the Irish parliament he intended to meet
Mr Major again on December 3, before the next meeting of the European
Council.
Dublin also acted to clear up ambiguity over Mr Spring's six points, one of
which was that Unionist consent would be required for any constitutional
change in the north. Mr Reynolds made it clear this was not meant as an
additional concession.
In Commons exchanges with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, Mr Major said he
intended to take 'a very direct interest' in peace efforts, while hinting
that an early return to round-table talks was unlikely.
'I don't want to see an artificially staged event where the talks are called
together with no probability of them making progress,' he said.

BT's share price fall yesterday afternoon suggests US investors took fright
at Mr Iain Vallance's carefully-worded caution on the dividend. They
probably need not worry much. BT cannot allow dividend expectations to get
out of hand, and an 8.1 per cent increase looks generous with inflation
below 2 per cent. But its strictures also serve to impress upon Oftel that
the new price controls are biting.
The underlying reality is that BT faces little cash constraint. Gearing is
only 14 per cent even after large payments to its pension fund and on MCI.
Perhaps BT also wants to silence calls for a large hand-out to shareholders.
The looser the dividend discipline, though, the greater the temptation to
fritter away its surplus unwisely.

FT  05 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Boots
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Boots has struggled before to spend its surplus cash wisely. It may soon
confront that challenge again thanks to its ever-dependable chemists chain.
Having paid its interim dividend early, Boots was able to use Pounds 67m of
its Pounds 201m cash flow to reduce debt. By the year-end, Boots should have
made a big dent in its remaining Pounds 137m of net borrowings, if not
eliminated them entirely. Cash would then start accumulating rapidly,
especially now the pharmaceuticals division's needs have subsided following
the failure of Manoplax.
There may be several short term demands on the money. The costs of closing
some Do It All stores will consume a fair dollop. The modest expansion of
the chemists chain and the acquisition of more OTC medicines and retail
properties would represent a more worthwhile use of funds. Even so, Boots is
likely to generate cash at a far faster rate than it can spend it. A
Reuters-style share re-purchase scheme may represent the most sensible means
of addressing the issue. Rather that, after the Ward White deal, than making
charitable donations to other company's investors.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's figures from BP saw the prospect of a rights issue finally
disappear below the horizon. The company's disposal programme is ahead of
schedule and debt is now down to Dollars 13.1bn. Even more encouragingly,
the company saw a net cash inflow before counting disposals for the first
time since 1991. Much of the benefit of retrenchment also seems to be
sticking to the company, at least for now. Cash inflow from operations in
the first nine months was Pounds 3.4bn against Pounds 3.5bn for the whole of
1992.
Next year, net cash will flow regularly from operations. That will show that
the company is back on to a sustainable path, and bring closer the time for
a debate on the dividend. An increase will be an important psychological
signal to the market, yet it makes little sense to drain substantial cash
from the company when it can usefully be spent on longer term development.
Balancing the needs of the business and shareholders will be a ticklish
decision for the board next spring. Given the progress made on sorting out
problems, and the way in which BP has set its face against further equity
funding, the company is entitled to retain much of the fruit of its labour.

FT  05 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: UK water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rumblings from deep underground have long signalled that Mr Ian Byatt,
Ofwat's director general, would get tough with the water industry. Concern
over rapidly rising bills meant that action was required. The lowish rate of
return of between 5 and 6 per cent which Mr Byatt suggested is part of the
squeeze. His efforts to defer part of the capital programme required by EC
directives should also slow the rise in bills. Mr Byatt clearly wants higher
borrowing by companies to take part of the strain.
Yet the industry is waving rather than drowning. The rate of return is more
like 5.5 to 6.5 per cent when it is adjusted for the fact that, unlike
British Gas, water companies pay no mainstream corporation tax. The
timescale for reducing returns has been extended to 10 years and the asset
base on which they will be calculated will also be more generous than
originally assumed.
That much flexibility will be needed since some companies will see interest
cover fall and gearing rise sharply in the next few years. Excessive
tightness now could make the strain on balance sheets intolerable. Further
reductions in required capital expenditure and efficiency gains will help,
but several companies will still need price rises significantly above the
rate of inflation. Mr Byatt may be forced to accept either that he cannot
hold down prices as much as he would want, or that water charges will vary
substantially across the country.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The luminaries on the stock exchange's working party on disclosure must
enjoy their peace and quiet on Sundays. Their objection to leaking market
sensitive information to weekend newspapers stands out in yesterday's woolly
consultative paper. Look again, though, and other useful nuggets appear.
Profit warnings should not be buried in otherwise anodyne statements. If
sensitive information is inadvertently leaked, immediate steps must be taken
to issue a full statement - take note, Shanks &amp; McEwan. The close season is
no excuse for witholding a statement if new developments warrant.
That is all good stuff, but more work is needed to resolve the broader issue
of ensuring that companies continue to communicate with the market while
treating all investors fairly. The document leaves companies enormous leeway
in deciding what constitutes price sensitive information. Delay is
apparently permissible in announcing unexpected losses. Even unaudited
quarterly trading statements are simply an option.
However much finance directors huff and puff, increased formal disclosure is
an inevitable part of the answer. The more information in the public domain,
the less they have to fear from talking to analysts. That applies even to
innocuous sounding details which, put together, could produce a
market-sensitive conclusion. When in doubt, put the information out. That is
the best prescription. It is in this document, but buried like a profit
warning in a six page statement about a small joint venture in Siberia.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Bid to revive Ulster peace plan: Hume holds out prospect of
total cessation of violence after talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN HUME, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party,
sought yesterday to revive his joint peace initiative with Mr Gerry Adams,
president of Sinn Fein, by claiming the offer of a 'total cessation of
violence' was on the table as a result of their dialogue.
Speaking after a meeting with Mr John Major, the prime minister, Mr Hume
said there would be 'peace within a week' if the initiative was embraced.
'My conclusion is that that is now a real possibility - a total cessation of
violence, not a ceasefire,' Mr Hume said.
But in a move likely to infuriate Unionists, whom London and Dublin are
trying to lure back to the negotiating table, Mr Hume said he intended to
brief Mr Adams on his hour-long meeting at Downing Street last night.
The session was also attended by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland
secretary. Mr Hume indicated afterwards it would no longer be possible for
Sir Patrick to say he did not know details of the Hume-Adams initiative.
Mr Major is seeing leaders of the province's four constitutional political
parties over the next few days. Yesterday's meeting with Mr Hume was
followed by a similar session with Mr John Alderdice of the Alliance party.
It emerged yesterday that the Irish government believes it will become clear
by early December if there is to be a breakthrough on the London-Dublin
peace initiative for Northern Ireland announced by Mr Major and Mr Albert
Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, in Brussels last week.
Mr Reynolds told the Irish parliament he intended to meet Mr Major again on
December 3, before the next meeting of the European Council, to discuss the
peace process.
Dublin also acted yesterday to clear up ambiguity over the six-point plan
set out last week by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister. One of Mr
Spring's points was that Unionist consent would be required for any
constitutional change in the north.
But Mr Reynolds made it clear yesterday this was not intended as an
additional concession. 'I would like to make it very clear that what we are
talking about here is the consent of a majority to constitutional change, as
precisely defined in Article 1 of the Anglo-Irish agreement,' he told the
Irish parliament. 'The government have in no way departed from that
position.'
In the Commons, Mr John Smith, Labour leader, urged Mr Major to 'take the
lead' in efforts to persuade the province's political leaders to return to
talks, saying there was an 'inescapable moral obligation' on them to
'co-operate in a new dialogue'.
Mr Major, who held cabinet discussions on Northern Ireland yesterday
morning, said he intended to take 'a very direct interest' in efforts to
bring about a lasting peace, while hinting that an early return to
round-table talks was unlikely.
'I don't want to see an artificially staged event where the talks are called
together with no probability of them making progress,' he said.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Personal View: Step in the right direction of renewal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR HAUSNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK government has just taken an important step towards developing sound
local and regional economic development in England. Its announcement
yesterday of a single regeneration budget, to be administered by integrated
government regional offices, introduces measures that will reinforce the
trend of innovative local initiatives in a number of British cities. It also
heralds the movement towards strategic development in London.
It is legitimate to express concerns about this introduction of increased
local competition for limited funds while there is a need to deal with the
persistent problems of deprivation. There may also be difficulties involved
in using administrative reorganisation to achieve intra-governmental
co-ordination.
However, it is also important to welcome measures that increase the
potential for ambitious and effective long-term local development efforts
that address the substantial economic changes occurring and make more
significant contributions to local and national economic renewal. Equally,
it is crucial that communities make the most creative use of these
opportunities, and further strengthen the framework for local development
that has emerged in recent years.
The City Challenge programme launched by the government in 1991 introduced
several of the features of this framework. There were concerns about the
short-term, fragmented, project-based, crisis-oriented, property-led and
limited nature of earlier urban policies. In response, City Challenge
focused support on longer-term, more strategic, comprehensive and integrated
area development programmes. These were designed by local partnerships and
administered by dedicated local organisations involving public, private and
community sector participation.
The programme has stimulated substantial development planning and activity
in successful and unsuccessful bidding communities alike. And it has
continued to generate innovative approaches to urban development.
The principles and experience of City Challenge are highly relevant to the
future development of regeneration policy. At the same time, the new
regeneration programme provides the opportunity to advance much further. It
enables critical city-wide regeneration issues and the international
competitiveness of cities and regions to be addressed. Development must be a
permanent feature of urban governence, addressing the city and metropolitan
area as a whole and strengthening its regional, national and international
roles. It must promote specific business and development opportunities, and
modernise the city's underlying foundations for economic renewal. This means
promoting human, physical and institutional development.
The single regeneration budget provides the opportunity for joint investment
by government departments in significant customised, flexible, comprehensive
longer-term urban and regional regeneration programmes developed and
administered by local development partnerships. The Urban Regeneration
Agency, private finance initiatives, training and enterprise councils and
one-stop shops provide other tools to be mobilised to provide the property,
infrastructure, labour, business development and financing requirements of
regeneration.
Some recent regeneration initiatives provide examples of what might be
possible under the new integrated approach; the establishment of a
comprehensive urban development agency and programme for Coventry; an
integrated regeneration strategy addressing industrial restructuring in east
Manchester; and city centre redevelopment in Birmingham.
In London, the new programme could lend vital support to the movement to
manage renewal through regeneration programmes for the capital's 'strategic
wedges', such as the Lea Valley.
This initiative should provide opportunities to encourage lateral thinking,
innovation and flexibility in the main functional programmes of government.
The single regeneration budget should serve as a 'test bed' for specific
improve-ments in the linkage of these programmes to broader regeneration
objectives.
The initiative should also seek to strengthen the technology that is
developing for practical and ambitious joint public/private investment in
regeneration projects. Local development partnerships must work with the
government to realise the potential of these new initiatives. The
preparation of sound local regeneration proposals will be an important
vehicle for defining and achieving this potential

BUSINESSES, LOCAL authorities and voluntary organisations wanting access to
UK government money for economic regeneration face a bewildering variety of
programmes. Several government departments have cash to spend, each with
their own priorities, and each jealously guarding their prerogatives. The
creation of a single regeneration budget for England, announced yesterday by
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, is therefore a welcome step.
The move will bring together 20 programmes from five government departments
to create a fund worth Pounds 1.4bn for economic regeneration. A new cabinet
sub-committee will control the budget and set overall priorities for its
use. To avoid confusing lines of accountability, Mr Gummer will be
accountable for all five departments' share of the budget - an unusual and
sensible innovation.
Bringing together these programmes will also make it easier to integrate
regeneration projects. Restoring a run-down housing estate can currently
mean applying to the environment department for Estate Action money, to the
Home Office for Safer Cities funding and the employment department for
business start-ups. In future, a single bid will suffice.
Equally welcome is the accompanying reorganisation of the local offices of
the Whitehall departments involved. Ten government regional offices will be
created, each headed by a senior civil servant. These regional directors
will provide a single point of access for those wanting a share of the
unified regeneration budget, and will monitor progress locally.
The third leg of yesterday's announcement is City Pride, an invitation to
city leaders to create a vision of where they want their cities to be in 10
years. Ministers have been impressed by the way that Manchester's Olympic
bid succeeded in creating new alliances between business, community groups
and the local authorities to improve the city. Creating similar alliances in
other cities will help in drawing up local priorities and in formulating
bids for the regeneration budget.
Ministers have heralded yesterday's package as a small constitutional
revolution, delegating responsibility for spending the economic regeneration
programme from Whitehall to the regions. That may be over-egging the
pudding: it will still be central government that holds the purse strings.
And it is unlikely that departments will be able to resist introducing new
programmes in the future to deal with specific problems. Ministers may also
find new initiatives and new programmes irresistible, especially around
party conference time.
Yet the new structure announced yesterday is an improvement on the old
multiplicity of programmes. It will bring a new coherence to government
spending on regeneration and further encourage the partnerships which are
central to success in local economic development.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Byatt's water escalator
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK WATER customers have had a poor deal on prices since privatisation. While
telephone prices are falling by 7.5 per cent a year after inflation, and gas
consumers' bills are coming down by 5 per cent, water charges are rising by
5 per cent. This price escalation must be stopped, Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's
director-general, said yesterday.
Such words will be music to customers' ears. But unfortunately it is
doubtful that Mr Byatt, who is responsible for regulating water charges, can
deliver an end to above-inflation price increases. His freedom of action is
constrained by expensive obligations to clean up sewage and improve water
quality imposed by government and the European Community. In setting
charges, he is required to ensure water companies earn sufficient returns to
finance investment - now Pounds 3.5bn a year but slated to rise by Pounds
1.5bn if obligations agreed since privatisation are maintained.
Mr Byatt has for the past year campaigned against some obligations on the
grounds that they are unnecessary to improve public health and too
expensive. Ministers, influenced by the fact that escalating water charges
are a political issue, are coming round to his view. But given that the
obligations are enshrined in Community law, renegotiating them will be
difficult.
Mr Byatt is therefore turning his attention to those areas where he does
have authority. He plans to bear down on the industry's profitability,
arguing that current levels of profits are not needed since the industry's
cost of capital is only 5-6 per cent in real terms. That compares with the 7
per cent the government thought necessary at privatisation and the 6 1/2 -7
1/2 per cent advocated by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in its
recent review of British Gas.
The discrepancy between Ofwat and the MMC's figures is largely explained by
the fact that water is an even lower risk business than gas. The prospects
that competition will develop are slim, while it is hard to envisage the
demand for water being undermined by technological developments. The higher
government figure reflects the fact that the water industry was fattened up
for flotation in 1989. The consequence is that water shares have risen by
about 130 per cent since privatisation. Now Mr Byatt plans to reduce those
excess margins, although the change will be phased in over a decade.
The effect of this tough but fair approach is that Ofwat will be able to
slow down the price escalator but not stop it entirely. To achieve that,
ministers will have to work harder to reverse EC directives. To give them an
incentive, Mr Byatt might consider splitting the K-factor, specifying how
fast prices can rise, into two parts when he sets new price controls next
year. An X-factor would show price cuts flowing from improved efficiency and
lower profitability, while a Q-factor would show increases due to
obligations agreed by ministers. That way, customers would know whom to
blame for higher bills.

that it has counted 106,010 wealthy souls with assets in excess of DM1m in

comparison. Stuttgart possesses the highest density of such well-heeled
citizens, followed by Munich and then Dusseldorf. How is it done?
Mostly by taking figures that relate to er, 1989. Asked the reason for this

It is true that a bookish egg-head is about the last thing Pentos needs in
its new chief executive - but does Bill McGrath, currently in DIY and
timber, have any affinity with reading material at all? McGrath himself was
yesterday making sure his own literary habits remained a closed book for the
time being. Enquiries elsewhere, though, did establish that for seven years
from the late 1960s he had been the buying controller at GJ Keddie &amp; Sons, a
department store in Southend, which, according to a spokeswoman for Pentos,
'sells rather a lot of books'. He then moved to Asda, where one of his jobs
was to introduce 'browser bars for books', whatever they may be. Lovers of
the grand old Hatchard's premises in Piccadilly are permitted a quiet
shudder.

A ticklish problem for Norway's Santas.
Once the European Economic Area trade pact between the EC and Efta is
implemented, how will Norway's 1,472 Jule Nisser, as they are called
locally, wriggle out of EC regulations for Santa costumes and maintain their
Norwegian identity? At present, the Norwegian version sports rather boring
black trousers, white shirt, red stocking cap, and, of all things, a mask.
But they are rather attached to the apparel, and, despite the chill northern
winds, would hate to be seen disappearing down a chimney in the cuddly red
fleece suits and black patent belts of their Anglo-American counterparts.
At their annual gathering this week, the Yuletide folk heard of a second,
still chillier, prospect, namely that EC equal opportunity legislation will
force them to allow women a turn with the gift sack.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Observer: Gift of the gab
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
How far the Treasury's seven-strong panel of outside advisers has raised the
tone of economic debate in the UK is open to question, but the panel
members' own public profiles have certainly improved. According to the FT's
fame ranking, now entering its second year, no fewer than five of the wise
men, who have been sounding off for nearly 12 months, feature in the top
seven.
This invidious table rates UK economists according to the numbers of times
their names have been mentioned in Britain's non-tabloid newspapers in the
year to November 1.
This time, arch-monetarist Tim Congdon tops the pile with 263 mentions.
Joint fourth in the rankings previously, he knocks fellow wise man Gavyn
Davies off his number one perch; Davies slips to third place. Patrick
Minford, joint fourth last year, comes in second. But how about Andrew
Sentance, who has zoomed up from 21st, with a piffling 29 mentions, to joint
fourth, with 176 articles featuring his name? Note too the rise of Wynne
Godley, who comes in at fifth, up from 16th.
David Currie and Andrew Britton are a trifle more taciturn. They rank 12th
and 15th in this year's survey, still an improvement on their previous
positions of 24th and 25th respectively. Among the economists outside the
Treasury panel, honourable mentions go to Roger Bootle of Midland Bank, up
one notch at sixth, and David Kern of National Westminster Bank, at seventh,
after ranking 10th.
Meanwhile, Kleinwort Benson's Peter Spencer and UBS's Bill Martin - both
apparently on the shortlist for the Treasury panel first time round - could
try harder. While Spencer has fallen from 10th place last year to 21st in
the latest rankings, Martin has plummeted from second place to an
ignominious 14th.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Laying the ghost of engines past: The hopes riding on
Rolls-Royce's new Trent 800 expose nervousness about a solo strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On giant test beds in Derby, in the British Midlands, Rolls-Royce has begun
running the Trent 800: the most powerful commercial aircraft engine it has
ever built. The last time it developed a new high-thrust civil aero-engine -
the original RB211 - it went bust.
For any aero-engine manufacturer, this is the moment of truth. It is a
critical period when a company's new technologies in aero-engine design and
manufacturing, developed over several years at a cost of about Dollars 1m a
day, come to a head. In short, the next few months will confirm whether the
Trent 800 is any good as a flying device.
The tests could not come at a more difficult time for Rolls-Royce. 'Life has
become very tough,' concedes Sir Ralph Robins, the company's chairman. 'We
haven't had any serious surprises with the Trent 800, but the market is the
big worry. I can't see any recovery before 1995 or 1996.'
Rolls-Royce launched its ambitious Pounds 400m Trent engine programme in the
boom days of 1988, when airlines went on an unprecedented spending spree for
new aircraft and engines. 'We did not expect the severity of the downturn,
but we undertook commitments to develop the Trent and we are keeping them,'
says Mr Stewart Miller, the company's head of engineering.
The difficulties are not confined to Rolls-Royce: its two bigger US rivals,
General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney, are also developing competing
high-thrust engines to power the new generation of widebody airliners, which
will start entering airline service in the next two years. The immediate
problem for all these companies is that development spending is peaking in
the middle of the worst recession in the industry's postwar history.
'We won't see any massive Trent business for three to four years, but it is
sustainable,' says Sir Ralph, whose company recently bolstered its balance
sheet with a Pounds 307m rights issue.
Mr Keith Hodgkinson, London aerospace analyst with US investment house
Shearson Lehman, explains: 'They have been caught in the classic pincers,
with research and development costs running very high at a time when cash
flow is inhibited by poor trading conditions.'
The stakes are even higher for Rolls-Royce than for its two big US
competitors. Despite efforts during the past five years to diversify into
the industrial power sector, the UK company continues to rely far more
heavily on its aero-engine business than the US companies, both part of
larger, diversified industrial groups.
For Rolls-Royce, the battle for the big engine market has also assumed a
peculiar psychological dimension. Although it is reluctant to acknowledge
it, the company is still haunted by its past.
Twenty-two years ago, it was forced into receivership and subsequent public
ownership when it attempted to enter the then rapidly expanding long-range
civil jet market. By its own admission, the company overstretched itself
technologically and financially with the RB211, the progenitor of the Trent,
which it now hopes will secure its long-term future.
The company is in a much stronger position today, says Mr Miller. 'Our
success to some extent stems from the difficult technical situations we
recovered from,' he explains. 'Some of our difficulty with the original
RB211 was the lack of the detailed technical capability to do justice to the
concept of the engine; but the concept itself proved absolutely right.'
From the original RB211 stemmed all the company's high-thrust commercial
engines. Together with its smaller power plants, this has enabled
Rolls-Royce to expand its product range and increase its share of the world
civil aero-engine market in the past 10 years, from only 8 per cent to 22
per cent.
At the same time, the company has sought to broaden its base, by enlarging
its activities in the industrial power business with its 1989 merger with
Northern Engineering Industries. Industrial power now accounts for about 40
per cent of Rolls-Royce's Pounds 3.5bn annual sales. In the first half of
this year, with aerospace earnings squeezed by the prolonged recession, it
provided the bulk of the company's profits before interest: Pounds 35m out
of a total of Pounds 40m.
But much of the company's long-term future rests on the Trent. Rolls-Royce
predicts that, in 20 years, 50 per cent or more of the airline market will
be powered by engines with thrusts greater than 60,000lb, predominantly for
larger twin-engined aircraft.
'It was evident that it was fundamental to the continued success and indeed
long-term survival of Rolls-Royce and of its UK suppliers that a substantial
share of this market should be secured,' the company told a House of Commons
aviation committee this summer.
Three versions of the Trent have been launched. However, work on the first
and smallest model - the Trent 600 for the McDonnell Douglas MD11
three-engine aircraft - has been halted because of the collapse in 1991 of
the Air Europe airline, the launch customer, and low demand for the MD11,
which has been badly hit by the slump in aircraft orders.
The other two models are the Trent 700, with 72,000lb of thrust, for the
Airbus A330 twin-engine airliner and the Trent 800, with more than 80,000lb
of thrust, for the Boeing 777 twin jet.
But the company's recent technical achievements (the first tests on the
Trent 800 last month were successful) have failed to produce any immediate
financial benefits. Even after a sweeping cost-reduction programme and
favourable foreign currency swings, the aero-engine activities mustered a
profit of only Pounds 5m on sales of Pounds 1.078bn in the first half of
this year.
Fierce commercial pressures are likely to continue during the next two
years. All three big aero-engine makers are locked in combat to win new
business in a diminishing market depressed by airline losses and
overcapacity.
In the meantime, Rolls-Royce is having to spend a large amount developing
its new generation of high-thrust engines. 'The high rate of R&amp;D was exactly
what we predicted and it is now peaking,' says Sir Ralph, adding that annual
R&amp;D expenditure was expected to decline gradually, from Pounds 240m-Pounds
250m today to about Pounds 150m in 1998.
Two separate factors have put additional pressure on the company's R&amp;D
resources.
The post-cold war decline in the defence sector has seen the company's
military business shrink. In turn, this has meant a reduction on
government-funded aero-engine R&amp;D programmes, which have traditionally had
important spin-offs for commercial engines.
Concurrently, Rolls-Royce has had to increase the thrust ratings on its new
Trent family much faster than expected, because of earlier than anticipated
demand for the heavier, longer-range version of the Boeing 777, adding to
its already substantial R&amp;D effort.
Although risk-sharing partners, including BMW, Lucas and Japanese
manufacturers, have invested in up to 25 per cent of the Trent programme,
this still leaves Rolls-Royce with a heavy burden. The question is whether
it has the necessary resources to undertake on its own the next step in the
competition to take engine thrusts even higher, into the 100,000lb zone.
After its short-lived and acrimonious attempt to form a strategic
partnership with GE seven years ago, it is difficult to see Rolls-Royce
renewing collaboration on big engines with the group. That leaves Pratt &amp;
Whitney, with which Rolls-Royce already co-operates on the smaller V2500
engine.
There is a compelling economic case for the two companies to work together.
Both are coming under increasing pressure from GE, which is rapidly becoming
dominant in the aircraft business, not only through its aero-engine division
but also through its aircraft leasing activities, recently enlarged by its
rescue of GPA, the Irish leasing company.
Both companies have been circumspect about possible co-operation in the big
civil engine market. But as Mr Chris Tarry, aerospace analyst at British
investment house Kleinwort Benson, puts it: 'There must now not only be a
high degree of nervousness but also a focusing of minds whether a
go-it-alone strategy is in fact correct.'

FT  05 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Pacific ties
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of Pacific Rim countries will meet this month to discuss whether
they should establish new mechanisms for economic co-operation. By inviting
his counterparts to an informal meeting in Seattle, President Bill Clinton
has raised the possibility of closer relations within Asia, which could
cause misgivings elsewhere about a potential new trade bloc.
Until recently, Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation - the grouping that is to
meet in Seattle - has lacked substance because its 15 members have seen
little advantage in promoting it. Apec nations compete fiercely with each
other for export markets and have outstanding political problems (China,
Taiwan and Hong Kong are all members) as well as historical enmities among
themselves. Many were in because they did not want to be left out or - as in
the case of the US - to ward off formation of regional blocs from that they
might be exclud-ed.
But the picture has been changed by an apparent increase in US enthusiasm
for Apec. It is easy to see why Washington wants to find new ways to ensure
harmony across the Pacific. US trade with Asia already far exceeds trade
with Europe. Asia provides US jobs as well as a fruitful area for investment
by US companies. But there are persistent trade frictions. At the same time,
the US wants to continue to play a balancing role in ensuring Asia's
security, but without the expensive troop presence that the cold war
demanded. If Asian countries, with their complex web of bilateral
relationships, can be persuaded to air problems in a multilateral forum that
includes the US, the risks of confrontation are likely to be reduced.
In Seattle, the leaders will have before them an Eminent Persons' report,
which recommends specific steps towards free trade in the region and an
Asia-Pacific economic community - though without a single internal market.
It is not clear, however, to what extent Asia-Pacific governments will want
to commit themselves to an ambitious programme of co-operation. Some
south-east Asian countries, particularly Malaysia, have reservations. The
likelihood of strong political commitment from the US to a new free trade
area is questionable to say the least, given the difficulties of the North
American Free Trade Agreement.
Nevertheless, it seems that greater economic co-operation and a general
commitment to reducing barriers will emerge. The world seems likely to
benefit from a stable political and economic environment as well as fewer
trade barriers in the part of the world that will account for a
progressively greater share of exports, imports and investment. Though a
move by Apec to reduce trade barriers without discriminating against
outsiders would be welcome, it seems, however, no easier to achieve than
global liberalisation. The Uruguay Round remains the highest priority.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Cadbury code has not been undermined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr G ACHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There has been much coverage of the losses at Queens Moat Houses. There
are two areas that investors and lenders must consider.
First, the apparent lack of basic financial controls. This adds fuel to the
Cadbury debate. Sceptics have said that compliance with many of Cadbury's
structural recommendations did nothing to prevent the problems, which only
proves that Cadbury achieves little.
I take a different view. I support the thrust of the Cadbury Code, but
structures alone are not enough. Directors must also understand their
responsibilities, and above all act on them. The public statement that
Cadbury requires on internal controls will concentrate directors' minds on
this task and this must be a good thing. But understanding needs robust,
straightforward guidance - not academic tracts. The challenge for the
business community is to produce this. At present this has not been achieved
and we must now all work together to construct guidance that is truly
practical.
The second issue is the divergent hotel valuations. Blaming the surveyors is
all too easy. A hotel valuation involves valuing a business. What financial
information and forecasts were the surveyors given? How reliable was this
information? Did the auditors or the surveyors verify it? Even where the
financial information is the same, different judgments may be made. The
skills required to value a business are much broader than those normally
expected of a surveyor in valuing an investment property. Is it a really a
job for surveyors alone?
I believe that the surveyors and the accounting profession must work
together to establish a framework that can command the confidence of the
business community.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Facts speak for themselves in review
of local government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Councillor MARGARET SINGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I can only explain my friend and colleague Josie Farrington's views on
the local government review (Letter, October 30) by reminding myself that
she is speaking on behalf of the Association of County Councils and that
county councils are due to be abolished if the review continues as
scheduled.
In attempting to make her argument against reform she attacks both a
government minister (David Curry) and tries to quote public opinion in her
argument. Neither is justified. The ACC knows there is a consensus between
the three national political parties about the review. This is clear from
the parties' manifestos at the last election. If she is looking for some
authoritative historical support for the Labour party's position, I refer
her to Aneurin Bevan speaking in 1954: 'There is little or no spiritual
identification by the citizen with the administrative county . . . Its
disappearance would involve the dispersal of sometimes highly efficient
teams of officials but no emotional disturbance among the electorate
embraced by it.'
As for the public opinion polls she mentions - but does not detail - what
they actually show (based on three polls on a sample of more than 6,000
individuals) is that 65 per cent of respondents expressing a view want to
see a single local council in their locality rather than the existing two
councils (district and county).
This finding is not really surprising. Two councils equals confusion about
which is responsible for which service. There can be little genuine local
accountability without clarity of responsibility.
A single local council in each area, based as locally to citizens as
possible, will result in both efficiency gains and greatly improved local
accountability. This is, therefore, one reform for which the government does
not deserve to be criticised.
We do not wish to squabble with our colleagues in counties - the provision
of quality services is our prime concern - but the facts speak for
themselves, if properly reported.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: No taboo on privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R ANDREAS KRAEMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In the tale of two east German cities, Judy Dempsey reports that a
shortfall of revenue could speed up the privatisation of local services,
'almost taboo in western Germany' ('Reconstructing bankrupt east Germany',
November 2). Nonsense. Outside the Free State of Bavaria, there are few
German cities the size of Rostock or Halle where local services are not run
by private companies. German municipalities may establish joint stock
companies as municipal enterprises for their provision.
'Formal privatisation' combines independence of management guaranteed by
company law, direct access to the financial markets and courts, and
flexibility of private sector options with the rigours of commercial
accountancy requirements and strategic political control through municipal
ownership. With these benefits, there has been little need for other types
of privatisation in Germany.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Powers of persuasion: The fight for freedom of speech in
Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just one month ago, parliamentary rebels were storming Moscow's main
television tower. Mr Yegor Yakovlev, a 63-year-old newspaper editor and
former television chief, says the media are now fighting a new battle, this
time for freedom of speech - with the country's first democratically elected
president on the other side of the barricades.
The first salvo in that battle came from Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, President
Boris Yeltsin's new information minister, who announced recently that the
media's task was to help develop a 'new democratic ideology' for society. In
future, he said, subsidies designed to help all media, most of which are
state-owned, switch to a market system would go only to those that helped
construct this ideology.
'I used to measure my freedom by the degree of criticism I could level at
the authorities,' says Mr Yakovlev, who, as editor of Moscow News, helped
roll back the frontiers of communist censorship under President Mikhail
Gorbachev's glasnost policy. 'But when the democrats defeated the communists
with the August 1991 coup, we found ourselves tied to the regime.'
In the latest struggle, between Mr Yeltsin and his parliamentary
adversaries, many editors chose to back the president and his radical reform
programme. The defeat of the communist hardliners ironically cleared the way
for presidential supporters like Mr Shumeiko to revert to a communist
conception of the media as a tool for 'shaping social consciousness'. In
particular, Mr Yeltsin's supporters want to use the media to help Russia's
Choice, the electoral bloc set up by leading reformers in the cabinet, win a
majority in the December 12 parliamentary elections.
Promising free and fair elections, Mr Yeltsin has invited foreign observers
to monitor the polls. The electoral law promises 'equal airtime' to all
participants. Mr Yeltsin has also set up a special 'arbitration court' to
'protect mass media against unlawful interference in their activities during
the electoral campaign and unhindered propaganda for or against candidates'.
Even if each party is given equal amount of time for political broadcasts,
the real test of fairness will be in the balance of day-to-day news coverage
and the amount of debate shown among candidates.
Newspapers - including the pro-communist Pravda, which reopened this week
after being closed in the wake of the uprising - are also lining up to
campaign for alternative political groups. Rabochaya Tribuna, funded by Mr
Arkady Volsky's Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, is backing his
centrist Civic Union alliance. But the newspapers' influence remains
negligible compared with that of television.
This is mainly because television in Russia, the biggest country in the
world, covers huge expanses of territory that candidates cannot hope to
cover, and because of a strong perception among Russians that what appears
on television must be true.
'Of course we believe what we see on television, out of habit, all the more
so because the people now in charge are supposed to be democrats, not
communists,' says Olga, a Moscow cook. 'But sometimes you feel that things
are not quite right. I try to watch all the news programmes and look out for
differences between them to form my opinion.'
Mr Yakovlev, who was chief of the Ostankino television station, one of the
two nationwide state-owned channels, until he was sacked last winter by Mr
Yeltsin for trying to stay neutral over the struggle with parliament, claims
he is again working for a 'one-party system'. Its election coverage has been
dominated by stories about Russia's Choice, with only a few references to
what other parties are saying.
The government's increasingly strong-arm tactics towards the media also
underline the vulnerable economics of an industry dependent on state
subsidies. Russian Television, the other main state network, for instance,
receives Rbs30bn (Dollars 25,000) a year; its advertising revenues total
just Rbs400m.
Emerging independent companies, such as the New Television Company
established by Mr Vladimir Gussinsky, a banking and construction magnate,
are not immune to government pressure. NTV employees say that the
state-owned St Petersburg television channel is being urged to break off its
contract to broadcast NTV programmes, which are seen as too independent.
Its weekly news digest recently aired interviews with the leaders of
anti-government parties, ranging from the pro-reform bloc of Mr Grigory
Yavlinsky, the economist, to the Civic Union. It also appealed for a public
voice for the supporters of the dissolved parliament. This, however, was
followed by a complimentary report on Mr Yeltsin's trip to the town of
Yaroslavl the day before. The programme ended with the 'sensational news'
that Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, former parliamentary speaker and co-leader of
parliament's revolt, had, according to an Arab newspaper, received millions
of dollars in secret subsidies from Iraq.
Attempts to use the media for the government's own ends pose two immediate
risks for Mr Yeltsin.
One is that he risks alienating supporters of economic and political
reforms. The second is that it could drive underground the views of a
sizeable minority - 10-20 per cent of the population - who supported the
parliamentary rebels. When the rebels stormed Ostankino television station
on October 3, it was because Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the former vice-president
now in jail for ordering the attack, said they needed airtime to help them
seize power. But there was also anger among the hardliners against what they
saw as biased coverage.
Now that that struggle is over, and there is no parliament to hold the
government to account, balanced coverage has become imperative in the
transition to a new parliament. As Mr Anatoly Sobchak, the liberal mayor of
St Petersburg, put it: 'In conditions of presidential rule, it is more
essential than ever to create as democratic an atmosphere as possible.'
But old habits are unlikely to die quickly. Indicative of the leadership's
cynicism about the media was the response of Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the
central bank governor, who was accountable to the former parliament, to an
Izvestia report that he had transferred Rbs600m to the Russian parliament
the day after Mr Yeltsin suspended it. 'Yes, that's so,' he reportedly told
Mr Igor Golembiovsky, the newspaper's editor. 'But why did you have to write
about it?'
While it remains uncertain how democratic the new Russian parliament will
be, the media remains the only source of healthy criticism of the
government. If Mr Yeltsin denies such expression, it will indicate that his
rule is becoming irreversibly intolerant.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Pay is not decided by the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr MICHAEL ROWLINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The articles on performance-related pay (Management: 'Rewards for the
top performers', November 3) pose the question of why PRP seems unstoppable
even though there is little or no evidence that it has any positive effect
on motivation. Two reasons for the popularity of PRP can be suggested.
First, with PRP each individual can be rewarded differently, even though
employees' actual output on specific activities may be the same. This is
unlike other types of individual performance pay, in particular payment by
results (PBR), typified by piece rates. Being based on appraisals rather
than just measures of output, PRP can take account of factors that are not
easily quantifiable, such as commitment and initiative. At the same time
this makes it difficult for workers to get together to fix their output and
pay in the way that they were able to do with piece rates, which were once
the basis of shop stewards' strength in industries such as car assembly.
Second, government patronage of PRP probably owes something to a naive
belief that PRP embodies principles derived from free market economic models
that can be applied to management. But the view that 'the market' decides
practically everything that is not decided by government leaves no role for
management. In fact, as anyone who receives PRP must be aware, their level
of pay is not decided by 'the market' but by the subjective judgments of the
manager who appraises them.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Tough talk is not enough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Prison works, says the home secretary. Does it? Consider the 47,000
convicted offenders he keeps behind bars. Many are inadequate, or
institutionalised. Too many suffer from mental abnormality and drug and
alcohol dependence. Many are simply dangerous. Some are evil, and need to be
kept out of society for a very long time.
This characterisation is not mine. I have lifted it, word for word, from the
speech delivered by Mr Michael Howard to the prison service on Wednesday. We
can agree on the dangerous and violent convicts he accommodates at an
average cost to taxpayers of some Pounds 22,000 a year, each. You will get
no liberal whining about that lot from me. Bang 'em up and lose the keys.
What of the rest - the majority of time-servers? Mr Howard says that crime
is reduced by incarcerating them. He gives two reasons. Criminals cannot be
housebreaking or car-smashing or whatever while locked in. When outside,
they are deterred by the knowledge that offending leads to jail. Anyhow,
nobody knows how to prevent crime. The home secretary can only ensure that
the courts, the police and the prison service function effectively. This is
disingenuous, silky barrister-talk. Inadequates, the institutionalised, the
mentally abnormal, and drug or drink dependents are society's failures. Not
all of them are, as the Victorians might have insisted, Satan's children.
Very few of us are inherently wicked.
There has to be a correlation between the number of social failures and the
rate of unemployment, the availability of affordable housing, and the
effectiveness of education. Perhaps television violence plays its part.
Governments, if not home secretaries, can do something in each of these
areas. They can also watch their mouths. Politicians cannot inculcate moral
values, but the values they espouse do matter. Privateer capitalism is a
wonderful mechanism, but it does not teach self-restraint, or discipline, or
respect for the criminal law. It merely asks that the lower classes be born
with such qualities.
This is not to condone crime. Mr Howard's hopeless cases have doubtless been
imprisoned for sound reasons, but he should know that they will be more
likely to offend when released. There will be more victims, not fewer. As to
deterrence, certainty of capture is the key. If thieves do not believe that
they will be caught, sentences of 100 years plus life will not deter them.
Habitual criminals, who may be rounded up after a spate of burglaries in a
particular area, may regard their chances of getting away with it as too low
for comfort. In such cases, putting them in jail may be a cost-effective
means of reducing crime, as some evidence suggests.
Whatever its value, prison alone is not the answer. The numbers tell the
story. Criminal statistics are notoriously unreliable, but the official ones
are all we have. We must do our best with them. According to the British
crime survey, published by the Home Office on Wednesday, some 15m offences
were committed against individuals and their property in 1991. That is an
increase of 36 per cent over the 1981 estimate. About a third of these were
recorded in police incident books. The police 'clear up' about 26 per cent
of the crimes they record. The proportion of crimes resulting in conviction,
the BCS notes, is about 3 per cent. We know that only a fraction of those
end in imprisonment. Seen in this perspective, Mr Howard's plan to build six
new prisons aims a thimbleful of water at a prairie fire. If the new jails
are, like the old, universities of crime, it might even be a thimbleful of
petrol.
Very well, you say, what should he do? First, he can make the police more
efficient. Yesterday's report from the Audit Commission suggests ways of
using police time more effectively. The government may accept these
recommendations. The rest of us will wonder what the law 'n' order Tories
have been doing about police management during the past 14 years. Mr
Howard's celebrated '27 points', announced at the recent Conservative party
conference, are, he says, designed to facilitate the detection of crime and
the conviction of the guilty. Some of the latter will be sent down. That is
why he is building more prisons. Disingenuity is this chap's art form.
Next, the home secretary can focus on crime prevention. The Audit Commission
says that the police cannot be held responsible if cars are manufactured
with poor security, or if individuals do not do all that can reasonably be
expected of them to protect their own property. Oh yes? It was just this
point that landed Lord Woolf in such trouble when he criticised the home
secretary's approach a few weeks ago. Yet here is the Audit Commission
saying the same thing, only leaving out the Woolf slip-up, which was to
suggest fines for people who failed to protect their property.
And over here is the BCS report, which tells us that 'the technology exists
to make cars much harder to break into, and much harder to drive away', and
that 'there is also room for encouraging builders to 'design out'
opportunities for crime'. It floats the notion of discounts on insurance for
houses that are properly burglar-proofed. If he works on these themes, Mr
Howard will be tackling half the recorded crime at one go. He says that the
government is spending Pounds 200m a year on crime prevention, which he
supports. Silly us. We had not realised that he has been stressing a
strategy of prevention.
As to violence, most assaults are caused by drunkenness. The British yobbo
is the product of the demon drink. Mr Howard might invite his predecessor,
now chancellor, to raise the price of alcohol. Tax differentials could be
used to encourage the sales of low-alchohol beers and wines. Domestic
violence, or the dreadful random murders we read about are tragedies that no
minister can prevent.
The real question that should be asked of the home secretary is, does he
think talking tough works for him? It went down a treat at the Tory
conference, but thinking voters prefer the 'tough on crime, tough on the
causes of crime' approach of Labour's shadow home secretary, Mr Tony Blair.
Mr Howard may feel that his policies add up to the same thing, but he has a
long way to go to convince the rest of us. He has an intellectual argument
to win. His career depends on it.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Welcome move on discrimination
damages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HERMAN OUSELEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The hurt and the damage inflicted by racial discrimination have for too
long been trivialised by the low level of damages industrial tribunals have
been allowed to award. We therefore welcome ministers' announcements in
recent days that the upper limit on compensation in discrimination cases is
to be abolished.
In the last year for which we have statistics the average award by tribunals
was Pounds 3,165 and the average settlement Pounds 3,981. These sorts of
amounts do not act as a proper deterrent and they do not encourage victims
to take up cases. We have been pressing government for many years to make
this change so that tribunal decisions can play a full part in the process
of securing an end to discrimination in employment. The Marshall judgment in
the European Court appears to have cut the Gordian knot for ministers and
encouraged some clear action.
It will fit well with the growing understanding in management practice that
the provision of equality of opportunity is good for business, whereas
discrimination is bad. The problem is that, while such arguments have been
given wider currency in management theory, we still see discrimination
playing an all too substantial part in the life of many ethnic minority
employees. Meaningful and serious awards at tribunals will, we hope, help to
clarify management minds on this.
We also hope the government does not leave this proposal on the shelf so far
as racial discrimination is concerned. A quick amendment bill this coming
session would send the signal we have long wanted discriminators to get.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Arts: The spirit of Russian worship - Patricia Morison is
intrigued by the icons from St Petersburg at the V&amp;A
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gates of Mystery; The Art of Holy Russia at the Victoria and Albert Museum
is the most revelatory exhibition to be seen in London this year. Not for 60
years has Russia lent such a collection of sacred art. Paintings,
embroideries, sculptures, carvings and liturgical objects all come from the
vast collection of the Russian Museum created in St Petersburg a century ago
by Tsar Alexander II.
At a glance, one sees that Russian sacred art owes its essential character
to Byzantium, which is to say the eastern Roman Empire. Gates of Mystery
confronts us with an art familiar to the extent that we recognise figures
like the Virgin Mary, St George and the dragon, or St Nicholas - although
not one particularly delightful scene of his encounter with a carpet-seller.
But the function and, to a large extent, the form of icons is alien to
Europeans with roots in a faith dominated by the Word rather than the Image.
Worship of the image (eikon in Greek) developed out of the Roman official
cult of the emperor's portrait. During the persecution carried out by six
iconoclast emperors, monks and nuns died in defense of the icons which
permeated Byzantine society. In 787 at the Council of Nicaea, the Iconodule
party won, but the news was badly received in the west where churchmen had
long taken a dim view of 'idolatrous' Greeks. In 794, the decisive moment
came when Frankish bishops at Frankfurt condemned icons as non-Christian.
Relics were to be venerated; images were not.
Two centuries later, icons became central to Russian life when Prince
Vladimir of Kiev abandoned the paganism of his Viking forbears. His problem
was to decide whether the Rus should become Catholic or Orthodox, Jews like
the Khazars, or even Moslems like the Bulgars. Every Russian knows the story
of how St Vladimir sent out envoys to discover which religion offered most.
Rome was easily outshone by the wealth and beauty of Byzantium.
Constantinople's churches, particularly Hagia Sophia, impressed the envoys
as indescribably grand. God, they assured Vladimir, must certainly dwell
there.
Drink clinched the matter. I quote the catalogue, which is remarkably
well-written and interesting (Pounds 25) and has sold like hot cakes. 'The
Moslems' alleged idea of heaven which offered unlimited fornication was
alluring for a man of Vladimir's alleged habits, but was more than cancelled
by their ban on alcohol. 'Drinking' said Vladimir, 'is the joy of the Rus.
We cannot live without it.''
It is fascinating to consider the consequences if Vladimir had not thought
that the Rus should mix spirits and spirituality. As it was, the Russians
were baptised into the Orthodox faith. Russian religious culture became
almost inseparable from that of Byzantium, with the difference that Russians
worshipped in Slavonic and knew nothing of Homer or Virgil.
The catalogue points out that attitudes to Old Russian art have changed
since Soviet times, when emphasing the debt to Byzantium was frowned on. The
11th-century Chernigov gold pendant shows the Greek influence in an
unexpected way. On one side stands the warrior figure of St Michael, beloved
of Byzantine emperors. The reverse shows a creature who is half woman, half
snake and appears on late Roman amulets as a protectress of women in
childbirth. Inscriptions in both Greek and Slavonic show that she had been
adopted by the then rather dubiously Christian ladies of Kiev.
Apart from the Chernigov amulet, everything in the show dates from after the
Mongolian invasions when a distinctively Russian style had developed. Choral
music plays and lights flicker in an attempt to create the right mood for an
art which is liturgical, focused on the worship of God and his saints
through their miraculous images.
So intriguing is the theology of icons that you may want to go beyond the
catalogue, in which case I recommend Jaroslav Pelican's Imago Dei (Yale,
1990). Christians should worship icons but reserve the highest form of
worship for God. 'The icon is a reminder', taught St John of Damascus, the
great apologist of iconodulism. It is a reminder of the miracle of the
Incarnation when the godhead put on mere flesh and blood. The artist
miraculously transforms matter to represent forms through which shine the
divine light; windows on to eternity.
With its chalices in silver and wood, the exhibition draws attention to the
centrality of the eucharist. Particularly evocative are the Royal Doors from
a 16th-century icon-screen, or iconostasis, which divided the congregation
from the mysteries beyond. They opened when the priest brought in the
eucharist which had miraculously become the body and blood of Christ, a
reminder of Christ the King's entry into Jerusalem and a promise of his
eventual return. When the doors were shut, graceful icons of the
annunciation, the evangelists, and a priestly Christ celebrating the
eucharist, reminded worshippers of the mystery within.
Such a rich symbolism is typical of these icons, and nowhere more so than in
a particularly lovely Trinity from Novgorod. Beneath the oak of Mamre, the
three angels are served dinner by Abraham, Sarah, and their tiny servant
boy. Angels and humans are linked in a circle in whose centre stands a
chalice holding the minute head of a calf. Vermilion and gold predominate,
the colours of sacrifice and love.
Admittedly, the immaterialist vision of the artists of 15th-century Novgorod
or Kiev makes contemporary Bruges or Florence feel terribly far away. These
monks cared nothing for the seductions of the natural world - nothing for a
landscape seen through a window or for the shadow cast by a string of
pearls. This oak of Mamre never rustled in the wind. To anyone wedded to a
sensual western aesthetic, icons may for ever seem strange rather than
beautiful. Nonetheless, Gates of Mystery opens our eyes to a belief in the
miraculous power of art lost 12 centuries ago at Frankfurt.
Sponsors, BAT Industries plc, the De Beers Centenary AG, Marc Rich &amp; Col AG.
Exhibition runs at the V&amp;A, South Kensington, until January 8
(071-938-8361).

FT  05 NOV 93 / Arts: Sofia Phil faces the future - Roderic Dunnett talks to
the orchestra's conductor Emil Tabakov
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERIC DUNNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bulgaria's leading orchestra, the Sofia Philharmonic, is currently visiting
England playing Berlioz, Debussy, Ravel and Mahler at a series of larger
provincial venues, climaxing next week with an appearance at Birmingham's
Symphony Hall.
Under communism, classical music flourished. Sofia's state-salaried opera
(Boris Christoff was one of its more famous alumni) throve under a series of
conductors, including Emil Tchakarov, who made famous recordings of
Mussorgsky shortly before his tragic death two years ago at the age of only
43.
The 120-strong Philharmonic regularly plays to capacity audiences at its
home base, the 1920s-built Sofia Hall, which boasts one of the best
acoustics in Bulgaria. But while politically this may be an auspicious time,
financing an orchestra in the former Eastern Europe following Communism's
demise is no simple matter.
Emil Tabakov, the Philharmonic's Chief Artistic Director and Principal
Conductor since 1988, makes no bones about it: 'Cultural life was better
under communism,' he says, 'simply because there was an adequate budget. The
state made good provision. Our dilemma now is that in the present rush to
make money nobody cares sufficiently about culture. The support - both moral
and financial - has withered.'
The present extended UK tour was set up by London-based firm IMG Artists,
liaising with a former Bulgarian State Concert Agency administrator, Nelly
Lalova, who has launched her own fledgling private agency. IMG meets all the
bills; orchestra and conductor receive expenses and a guaranteed fee.
'Orchestral salaries are still paid by the government, but they're very low
 -not enough with inflation (up to 100 per cent recently on some basic
commodities). Despite a recent salary rise, players' basic pay is still only
around Lv2,500 or Lv3,000 (Pounds 70) a month. So recording and tours are
crucial to supplement players' incomes.' Discussions under way with the
best-selling Sheffield-based record company, Naxos, could prove a boon.
The long term answer may lie in commercial sponsorship from the
newly-burgeoning private sector in Bulgaria. 'Everywhere in the west we see
commercial sponsorship as the norm,' says Tabakov. 'But we lack this
experience of how to go about getting sponsors. We need time to accustomise.
Our law still isn't geared up to independent sponsorship of the arts: the
relevant bill has yet to be voted through parliament.
'Many people in Bulgaria - new private industry, some of the professions,
the banks - sense the value of promoting themselves via the arts. But they
will hold back till they can see the tax advantages. We urgently need this
legislation: when it comes, it will be good for musicians and good for
everyone.'
Son of a Bulgarian lawyer, Tabakov studied double-bass in northern Bulgaria
and took up the baton at 18. While a student he conducted his local symphony
orchestra at Ruse, moving on to the Sofia Chamber Soloists. He graduated to
the Philharmonic in 1985, becoming its musical director soon after. As a
young string player, he encountered many of the outstanding conductors from
both east and west. Watching and listening, he insists, remain as important
as any part of a young conductor's training.
There are other problems. Some 60 players - virtually half the orchestra -
have moved in the past three years, many to seek better-paid work abroad.
'Just about every German orchestra has at least two Bulgarian players;
likewise Italy, France and Spain. We have good youngsters emerging from the
music academies, but they lack experience. Low salaries prevent us
attracting Western orchestral players, any more than we can afford top
soloists or conductors.'
Is he pessimistic? 'I'm naturally pessimistic, but we have to work at the
problem and solve it. The sponsorship possibilities now look good. Once the
tax law is agreed, I think we have a lot to offer. Our subscription concerts
and the Sofia Music Weeks in May and June are all high profile events which
attract a large proportion of Bulgaria's professional people. We can not
only promote a sponsor's name at home, splashing it all over Sofia Hall and
around the city, but on our foreign tours - to the UK, Germany, the US and
Japan. That gives me some optimism for the future.'
Is he not tempted abroad himself? 'Well, yes, I am. I have regular
commitments, not just in Europe but the Far East, South America and the US.
But I try to make the Philharmonic my number one priority, and give it all
the attention it needs. The first task is to keep the orchestra together,
and its standards high. The key thing is that musical life in Bulgaria is
not dead. These are difficult days, but we carry on doing our best. Each
problem calls for a different solution. But we will manage to resolve them.
Musicians are resilient people, you know.'

FT  05 NOV 93 / Arts: Chasing Moby Dick - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The history of trying to turn novels into plays is not a happy one. Off-hand
I can think of only a few successful examples. Two of them are from novels
by Henry James. A third is Nicholas Nickelby.
So anyone who approaches the dramatisation of Moby Dick should do so with
caution. True, it might make an opera. It is, after all, by the same author
 -Herman Melville - who nearly 40 years later wrote Billy Budd, which was
picked up by Benjamin Britten. And it seems only yesterday that Cameron
Mackintosh sought to turn Moby Dick into an eccentric musical.
The problem is not only that a large part of the book is an encyclopaedia of
whaling and all that goes with it. It is also that the novel is full of
symbolism. Captain Ahab may be chasing a whale, but at the same time he is
having a battle royal with himself about his motivation. The book also
contains a good deal about 19th century capitalism and notions of democracy.
Since the symbolism exists on several levels, it is quite hard to translate
it to the stage.
The Royal Shakespeare Company, playing at its small theatre in Stratford,
The Other Place, has gone for the physical approach, so much so that the
opening had to be postponed for a week because the leading actor, David
Calder as Ahab, strained his back in rehearsal.
The production, directed by Gerry Mulgrew, is stunning to watch. Storms,
masts, swinging from the ropes are all there, even at one stage the distinct
impression of a harpoon being thrown directly into the audience. Set design
is by Karen Tennent and, in the way of using every available device, no-one
could ask for more.
But is it a play? Here there must be doubts. You may say that it does not
matter much that we learn very little about whaling, though information has
always seemed to me a fascinating part of the book. More important is the
lack of characterisation. One of the most interesting figures in the book is
Queequeg. In this production, apart from one scene where he climbs out of a
coffin, he is just another member of the crew.
Calder's Ahab, played with a fine impression of a white-socked wooden leg,
looks as if he is capable of being a commanding presence, but in practice
seldom is. There is never much expectation that he has any chance of
overcoming the whale. The staging is stacked against him.
Part of the fault lies in the dialogue adapted by the (in this case)
slightly unfortunately named Rod Wooden. Melville relied heavily on the
novelist's powers of description and narrative. A good play depends on
spoken drama. Here, too much of it is flat. The actions speak louder than
the words, which may be a good motto for a general or even a politician, but
is an odd basis for a theatrical production.
There is an awful lot of action about in our big theatres at present. See,
for example, the Royal National Theatre's production of Machinal, which
suffers from the same faults as the RSC's Moby Dick.

This season, Friday is looking like one of the best nights for going out.
The early evening is dominated by the sort of aged series to which
broadcasters like to attach the word 'cult'. BBC2 cranks out the old puppet
drama Captain Scarlet And The Mysterons (6.00) promptly followed by the spy
series of similar vintage, The Man From UNCLE (6.25). That clashes with the
frequently shown Happy Days which led the fifties-revival in the 1970s (C4,
6.30). BBC1 is repeating Doctor Who: Planet of the Daleks (7.30) presumably
for a new generation who haven't seen it before.
It is hard to believe that The Wartime Kitchen And Garden (BBC2, 8.30) will
be able to match the charm and fascination of 'A Victorian Kitchen Garden',
but we shall see. Harry Dodson re-creates the sort of gardening that was
inspired by the slogan 'Dig For Victory' and Ruth Mott goes into the kitchen
to recall the glories of snoek, powdered eggs (jolly good for making
fried-eggy-bread) and carrot cake
The ITV drama series Demob (9.00) is mildly entertaining - but this is
bonfire night, forget television.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Property: Turnround at the tower - Canary Wharf's rise from
administration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It began with an urgent telephone call in March last year, and rapidly
escalated into one of the world's most high-profile insolvencies. Eighteen
months on, Canary Wharf, a potent symbol of the late 1980s UK property boom
and bust, has formally been taken out of administration by the English High
Court. The way is now open for Canary Wharf's new owners - 12 banks - to
fulfil the site's original, ambitious aims.
'In the words of the judge, we have now returned the keys to the
management,' said Mr Stephen Adamson, one of three administrators from
accountants Ernst &amp; Young. 'It's all a bit of an anti-climax.'
His co-administrator, Mr Nigel Hamilton, recalls responding to the first
telephone call from Canary Wharf's lawyers. The message was clear: help was
urgently needed to keep Canary Wharf solvent. 'We were running about trying
to put a package together,' he said. 'It developed into all-night sessions.
Until the banks finally met, they didn't know the true position.'
The position soon became clear enough to Mr Hamilton and his colleagues: no
more money would be forthcoming to sustain Canary Wharf, in spite of
promises of financial assistance by its parent company in Canada. Initial
calculations suggested that an extra Pounds 350m would be needed to service
debts, complete the development and attract more tenants through special
concessions.
'Different banks had different views,' he said. 'There was quite a mismatch
of attitudes. Finally one of the bankers said: 'This turkey won't fly'.'
That left open two options for the creditor banks:
First, to appoint administrative receivers in a bid to realise as much as
possible from their loans by selling Canary Wharf. But such a move would
have sacrificed important tax breaks and left open the possibility that
unsecured creditors would push for liquidation.
Second, to use the less familiar insolvency procedure of administration  -
which would have left existing directors in place and allowed the company to
continue to trade.
The banks opted for the latter. The danger, however, with administration was
that directors or creditors in the US or Canada might file for bankruptcy
protection for Canary Wharf in their own countries, triggering complex
negotiations between lawyers over the different countries' insolvency laws.
To prevent such an outcome, the banks approached a judge in his flat as soon
as they had decided to opt for administration and before the decision became
public knowledge.
The administrators' immediate priority was to ensure that the Canary Wharf
site continued to function. They had to move quickly to secure assets on the
site, to speak to staff and reassure tenants. 'There was a big concern that
the site would not be maintained. We were anxious to ensure that the
landlords' obligations were met,' said Mr Alan Bloom, the third
administrator.
Meeting the landlords' obligations was unlikely to be easy or cheap: Olympia
&amp; York, Canary Wharf's parent company, had provided what Mr Bloom describes
as a 'Rolls-Royce' service to tenants. These included a commitment to
subsidise the Riverbus service, which cost Pounds 900,000 during the
administration alone. The banks initially agreed to put up a total of Pounds
10m between May 28 - the day the administration order was granted - and
October last year to ensure that Canary Wharf continued to operate; to date,
their support has topped Pounds 50m.
'Everything was complex,' said Mr Adamson. Many contracts had to be
renegotiated and administrators had to pore over the complexities of 50
companies within the Canary Wharf group, set up to exploit tax allowances.
At the same time, the administrators had to deal with about 1,400 creditors.
English insolvency law only allows five creditors' representatives on a
committee to scrutinise the work of administrators. But on this occasion,
the Ernst &amp; Young team allowed many more creditors to attend to maintain
goodwill.
In addition, negotiations were continuing with the government on the vexed
issue of the Jubilee tube line extention, linking Docklands with central
London. The line, which had long been viewed as essential to the viability
of Canary Wharf, was finally given the go-ahead last week.
Ernst &amp; Young's aim in the first few months of the administration order was
to find a buyer for Canary Wharf. Mr Adamson recalls one call in particular:
'We were offered Pounds 1bn to knock the tower down so that 'His Highness'
could land his jet at London City airport. We never found out who His
Highness was.'
More serious offers came from Hanson, the UK conglomerate, and from a North
American consortium backed by the Reichmann brothers, Canary Wharf's
developers. Eight potential investors were eventually given information
under confidentiality agreements and three went on to conduct further legal
inquiries.
In the event, no offer received by the administrators was considered a
realistic commercial price. The administrators finally realised last
Christmas that the banks would have to retain long-term ownership of Canary
Wharf.
The last few months of the administration 'were like six-dimensional chess',
said Mr Adamson.
It was this complexity, and the delicacy of the negotiations with senior
government officials, which Mr Adamson believes justify the administrators'
fees of about Pounds 7m and a further Pounds 6m-Pounds 7m in related legal
fees.
What finally emerged was a series of options - one plan to mothball Canary
Wharf was codenamed Sleeping Beauty. The plan eventually put forward for
creditors' approval - called a more mundane 1B - contained three elements:
approval for the Jubilee line extension; the Department of Environment
declining to move to Docklands in spite of initial interest in doing so; and
a concerted bid to let the remainder of the building.
To win support from the unsecured creditors for a voluntary arrangement to
leave administration the banks agreed to offer Pounds 27m to creditors - up
to 15p in the pound, with a further 25p for those contractors willing to
provide warranties on work already carried out on site.
Given the choice of something or nothing, the voluntary arrangement was
overwhelmingly approved by creditors in September. Just two creditors - owed
Pounds 53,000 out of a total of Pounds 86.3m - voted against.
In spite of the successful restructuring of Canary Wharf's debts, the task
now facing the directors under the new chairman, Sir Peter Levene, remains
immense: to fullfil Canary Wharf's original aim of becoming London's premier
office location.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bill McGrath (right), currently deputy chairman of Wickes, the DIY and
timber retailer, is to be the next chief executive at Pentos, Britain's
second largest bookseller. Five weeks ago it announced its first ever losses
and passed its interim dividend.
McGrath, a self-made businessman with a reputation for being 'tough but
fair', will succeed the outspoken Terry Maher, who was responsible for
building Pentos into an important retailing force encompassing Dillons and
Hatchards bookshops, the Ryman stationery and office equipment supplier and
Athena posters. He formally retired as chairman and chief executive
yesterday making way for Sir Kit McMahon, former Midland Bank chairman, to
take over as chairman.
Sir Kit, who became deputy chairman at the end of September, will provide
continuity between the outgoing and incoming chief executives but is
eventually expected to make way for a new non-executive chairman.
McGrath, 53, began his working life as a trainee catering officer with
Cunard Steamship Company in 1956, becoming deputy chief hotel officer before
leaving Cunard in 1968. He is reported to have become a wine expert while
working for Asda, initially as buying controller for wines and spirits, and
joined Comet as managing director of its Timberland subsidiary in the early
1980s. Between 1985 and 1987 he was chief executive of Builders Mate, a
company he founded and eventually sold to Wickes.
At Wickes he was appointed chief executive of Wickes Building supplies, the
UK-based retail chain, and assumed responsibility for Wickes Continental and
Malden Timber in 1991. Last year he became group managing director and was
promoted to his current post last month; he is expected to take up the new
one by the beginning of January. (See Observer)

VICKERS, the UK engineering group, is reorganising its top management to
prepare for the retirement next year of Gerald Boxall, currently chairman
and chief executive of Vickers Defence Systems.
Vickers, which has interests ranging from Challenger tanks to Rolls-Royce
cars, and incubators, is expanding the roles of two of its other directors,
Roger Head and Peter Ward.
With effect from December 1, Head, currently finance director, will become
managing director, finance and planning, adding the function of corporate
development to his present responsibility.
Ward, currently chairman and chief executive of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, will
become managing director, operations. He will remain responsible for
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars but is also taking on the newly-established turbine
technology and propulsion division as well as Vickers Pressings.
The new division will incorporate the aerospace components operations and
the core marine engineering activities of KaMeWa, Stone Vickers and Michell
Bearings. As a result of the reorganisation John Crook, previously chairman
and chief executive of the marine engineering division, has left the
company.

FT  05 NOV 93 / People: Sell to encourage French leave
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Heading Britain's tourist organisations is not everyone's idea of fun.
Tourism has not traditionally been a UK government priority. State funding
for tourism is constantly under threat.
Adele Biss, a former PR consultant, agreed to become chairman of the British
Tourist Authority last May. This week she announced that Anthony Sell is to
be its chief executive.
Sell, 50, joins the BTA from Paris, where he has been managing director of
the continental European operations of Thomas Cook, the travel and financial
services group.
Sell comes to the job with no illusions. He does not expect the government
to become substantially more generous in funding the authority. However, he
had discussions with officials before deciding to take up the job; he does
think they value the authority's work.
All the same, it took him five months to make up his mind to accept the
post, which has been vacant since April. His predecessor, Michael Medlicott,
left to join Delta Air Lines.
Sell brings to the post substantial experience of other countries and
cultures. He speaks five languages other than English: Russian, French,
German, Italian and Serbo-Croat. He also reads Spanish.
Before joining Thomas Cook, he was a director of Boosey &amp; Hawkes, the
instrument-maker and musical publisher, where his responsibilities included
a French clarinet factory and four European music festivals.
Sell says his principal task will be to convey the variety of Britain's
tourist offerings to potential visitors. He has been struck during his time
in Paris by the number of French visitors to the UK who have told him they
had no idea how beautiful the Lake District was or how much there was to do
outside London.
Some have complained to him that they had to drive on the left. Although
that is unlikely to change to accommodate French tourists, he says more must
be done to help non-English speaking visitors find their way around.

George Cracknell has become executive vice-chairman of First National
Finance Corporation, the consumer credit group, following the retirement as
chief executive of Tom Wrigley.
Martin Mays-Smith, the chairman, explains that the group's structure has
been changed on Wrigley's retirement in order to give the managements of the
two operating subsidiaries, FNB, the consumer finance subsidiary, and FNCB,
the commercial lending bank, more room to run their own businesses.
In July, FNFC, which had earlier in the year found itself in breach of
banking covenants, narrowly avoided collapse by securing a refinancing deal
for its Pounds 1.1bn debt owed to 107 international banks.
Wrigley had been discussing his retirement for some time, but wanted to stay
until the re-financing deal had been agreed; the announcement coincided with
the group's financial year end on 31 October.
The change of structure exactly suits Cracknell, who had been a
non-executive director of the group since February, and expects his new post
to take up three to four days a week. Now aged 60, he retired in June from
Barclays, where he had been deputy managing director in the banking
division, and did not want to take on another 'six day a week' job.
He was recommended to Mays-Smith as a non-executive director at the end of
last year by Sir John Quinton, the former chairman of Barclays bank. The two
organisations go back some way together; Barclays was involved in the rescue
of FNFC in the mid-1970s, and Cracknell became a non-executive in succession
to Roy Vine, a former vice chairman of Barclays Bank UK, who had been a FNFC
director for 11 years.
'He is only quite recently out of the frontline, so he knows his way
around,' Mays-Smith says of Cracknell. 'He has a very good reputation, and
an up-to-date knowledge of all the banks too, which is quite useful in our
current predicament.'

FT  05 NOV 93 / Management: A bureaucratic legacy - A lesson for building
societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLIE FERGUSON and DONAL MCKILLOP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's collapse of plans to merge the Leeds Permanent and the National
and Provincial contains management lessons for all UK building societies.
The differences - ultimately irreconcilable - between the traditional,
hierarchical Leeds and the apparently less bureaucratic National and
Provincial - have already been well publicised. But the episode should be
set against the background of a wider shift away from centralised society
structures.
Societies in the 1990s have been encouraged to flatten management
hierarchies, decentralise decision-making and reduce the size of their head
offices.
The pressure for this has come from a more deregulated financial services
environment in which societies see the need to improve their responsiveness
to customers. Traditional bureaucracies are seen as ill-suited to the new
world of multi-product financial institutions, a perception which can only
grow as societies seek permission to sell an even wider range of services.
In redesigning their management structures, societies have to strike the
right balance between centralised direction from head office and delegated
responsibility to divisions and branches. It is argued that shifting this
balance in favour of flatter structures creates the conditions for new ways
of doing things and meeting the customer's needs; but just how quickly the
demise of traditional bureaucracy will occur within the sector is another
matter. There are interesting paradoxes when the evidence is examined.
While efforts have certainly been made to push management responsibility
down to branch level, building societies unlike other businesses in the
financial services sector have not rationalised their head offices. As the
table shows, what has happened is an increase in head office and
administrative staff within the larger societies.
Ironically this is true of all top eight societies between 1989 and 1992
with the exception of the Leeds, whose head-office headcount was static over
the period. Similarly, five of the top eight societies also show an increase
in the numbers of branch staff, although five also recorded a decline in
branch numbers during the period.
One conclusion might well be that bureaucracy is on the increase within the
sector. But the real answer is more complicated. While product
diversification on the one hand requires a less bureaucratic approach by
building societies, it creates its own momentum for increases in staff
numbers at the same time. Some societies claim the creation of their new
back-office administrative centres is intended to free branch staff to
concentrate more on serving customers' needs. The overall rise in staff
numbers can therefore be seen as part of a customer-focused equation.
Alternatively, these figures may demonstrate there is something inherent in
the traditional building society culture that makes staff reductions hard to
pursue. Years of monopoly thinking, in a protected business environment,
cannot change overnight. When the sector is tested against the
organisational imperatives of the 1990s, one must conclude that many
societies have a long way to go before they shake off their bureaucratic
legacy.
The authors are respectively senior lecturer at Ulster Business School and
lecturer, School of Finance and Information, Queen's University, Belfast.
Their book, Building Societies: Structure, Performance &amp; Change, was
published this year by Graham &amp; Trotman. Price Pounds 40.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Management: Uphill struggle to become 'horizontal'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS easier to be converted to a radical new religion than to practise it.
Even in fashion-mad America, where the religion of business process
re-engineering has spread like wildfire over the past 12 months and about 50
per cent of large companies claim to be practising it, only 5 or 10 per cent
are doing so properly, according to one of its high priests, James Champy.
Most are finding it more daunting than expected.
So a sizeable dose of scepticism is appropriate about a related but even
more revolutionary movement which is threatening to burst forth - that of
the 'horizontal organisation'.
For anyone who has somehow missed all the hype surrounding business process
re-engineering over the past year, it should be explained that it is an
ungainly term coined by Champy and a fellow consultant, Michael Hammer to
describe the complete redesign of the main operational processes of a
company: order generation and fulfilment, logistics, product development and
so on.
Re-engineering promises remarkable improvements in cost, quality, speed and
productivity - sometimes more than tenfold. But it is hard to practise
properly, since it entails vast political and human upheaval, including for
people who keep their jobs.
In all but the smallest organisation, operational processes have always been
carried out laboriously (in every sense) across a series of fragmented
'functions' or specialist departments. These include product or service
design, engineering, production, marketing, service and accounting.
Each has its own hierarchy, down and up which communication has to pass
before it is transferred to the next department. Most western organisations
have been only partly successful in bridging such vertical structures either
with permanent 'matrices' or temporary project teams, task forces and other
'overlays', as consultants insist on calling them.
Re-engineering - or 'core process redesign' as some of Hammer and Champy's
rivals more accurately call it - goes a big step further. It transforms such
processes into ones which flow permanently across the relevant departments
at the appropriate level, usually pretty low. This involves not only
'delayering' those departments, and removing front-line staff from them, but
sometimes breaking them up.
Champy's 5-to-10 per cent of US companies and a smaller proportion of
European ones, have reached various stages down this track. Treading warily
in view of the wrenching changes involved, most have re-engineered just one
of their key processes and others only a couple. Even at some of the fastest
movers, such as Texas Instruments, the revolution has been confined so far
to one, or just a few, of their business divisions.
Only a handful, such as Taco-Bell and the Astra-Merck pharmaceuticals
alliance in the US, and National and Provincial building society in Britain,
have yet found religion to the extent of revolutionising structures at the
top, as well as lower down and giving process responsibilities not just to
junior and middle managers, but also to senior executives. To distinguish
this from 'mere' re-engineering, Hammer calls it 'the process-managed
organisation'.
Two years ago the maverick N&amp;P actually started its transformation at the
top, before introducing it lower down. Assuming that the N&amp;P's messianic
chief executive survives last week's breakdown of his proposed merger with a
more staid rival, Leeds Permanent (see right), N&amp;P will soon become one of
the few sizeable enterprises in Europe to warrant the 'horizontal' label.
The idea of horizontal, team-based large organisations, with almost no
hierarchy, has been extolled in academic textbooks for years. But is it
realistic?
Like pavement prophets with their sandwich-boards, hyperbole-prone American
professors and consultants have claimed repeatedly that its coming was nigh.
But they have weakened their case by sticking the 'horizontal' label on
companies such as EDS, the US information technology services group.
Although it is certainly very project- and team-based, it is still heavily
hierarchical in parts.
But horizontal organisations are now at last arriving, swears Frank Ostroff,
a New York-based consultant from McKinsey and Co. 'This is real,' he
insists.
As Ostroff defines it, a horizontal organisation embraces not only 'core
process redesign' and all the other elements of a re-engineered one, but
plenty more besides. Most important, it provides the overall structure,
reward systems and multi-purpose skill-training needed to link all its teams
together so that they perform miracles for the customer without creating
process barriers which are just as harmful as the old departmental ones.
Ostroff's prescription shares several aspects of the concept of
'organisational architecture' popularised in the US by a rival consultant,
David Nadler and practised by Xerox.
In propounding his case, Ostroff suffers from the handicap of client
confidentiality; some of the most striking cases of 'horizontalisation' are
still under wraps, he says. He also qualifies his own claims for
horizontalism by saying that, even a decade from now, only perhaps 10 per
cent of companies will be fully horizontal, and that most will be 'hybrids',
retaining a degree of verticality.
That is only realistic, given the impracticality of running almost any big
company entirely without hierarchy. But it also shows up the term
'horizontal' for what it will remain for most organisations: optimistic or
misleading.
In the interests of clarity it should be replaced. Given the awfulness and
ambiguity of well-trodden academic adjectives such as 'differentiated',
'hybrid' and 'mixed', Hammer's awkward 'process-managed' comes closest to
the mark. Can anyone suggest a more stylish improvement?

FT  05 NOV 93 / Management: Can cultural differences be overcome?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN MICHAELS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cultural differences were cited as the main reason for calling off the
proposed Leeds Permanent/National and Provincial merger, which would have
created the third largest UK building society after Halifax and the
Nationwide.
Leeds is seen as having a traditional, hierarchical structure. N&amp;P, whose
attempts to reshape its activities through business process re-engineering
were profiled on this page on July 5, has adopted a different approach.
But when should a culture clash be allowed to derail a merger that is
universally agreed to make strong commercial sense?
Philippe Haspeslagh, professor of corporate strategy and organisation at
Insead, the business school outside Paris, observes: 'Cultures are always
different. Even between two companies in the same sector and country.'
Mark Tilden of Gemini Consulting is more blunt: 'If institutional
shareholders were around this merger would have been pushed through.'
Tilden agrees that cultural differences can be worked round but admits that
there comes a point when 'the future looks so unbearable it has to be called
off'.
Others are more adamant that the cultural differences were insurmountable,
partly because of the personality of David O'Brien, N&amp;P's chief executive,
who would have been chief executive of the merged society. Some in the
industry find his manner abrasive.
At the same time, though, many are convinced that a big commercial
opportunity has been missed. Says Robert Baldock, a partner in the financial
services division of Andersen Consulting: 'If N&amp;P had been different, this
would have been a marriage made in heaven.'
Simon Farnborough of the Boston Consulting Group agrees: 'It comes down to
the curious ownership structure of building societies. Without doubt,
they've missed an opportunity. They would have been very powerful.'
Nevertheless the episode should be kept in proportion, for as Baldock points
out only 50 per cent of planned mergers take place. 'Very few of those ever
realise their potential.'
If the cultures were really that different then at least the societies have
avoided what could have been a disastrous error.
'If you find that there are such significant cultural differences, you are
not going to be able to implement a joint business plan. They've been very
brave,' says Stephen Lawrence of Arthur D Little.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Technology: Ringing the changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNA KOCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new plastic extrusion technology developed by Eropol, a small French
engineering company, could change the life of millions of women suffering
menopause symptoms.
A joint venture between Dow Corning of the US and Sweden's Kabi Pharmacia
has launched an intra-vaginal ring on to the Swedish market. The UK and
France could follow suit.
IVRs have long been discussed for birth control and menopausal purposes.
Hormones embedded in the ring's silicone material are released in a
controlled manner to ease menopause symptoms or prevent conception.
Until now, the technology has not been available to produce these
cost-effectively. Eropol's solution
involves an extrusion tool into which are fed, simultaneously, the
hormone-doped silicone material forming the central core of the ring and the
pure silicone material surrounding it.
To obtain the circular profile, with a core concentric to its surrounding
silicone layer, the flow of material into the extrusion die must be
carefully regulated. The silicone entering the extrusion die is split into
10 streams, through the centre of which is introduced a stream of the doped
silicone. As each stream's flow can be controlled, Eropol can achieve the
required quality of extrusion.
Once extruded, the string of hormone-doped silicone is cut into small
lengths which are joined and become perfectly concentric because of the
cut's conical form. The rings are placed into moulds with heating elements
to harden the silicon.
The aim is to develop an auto-regulating mould capable of adapting to the
silicone's expansion during heat treatment. It would stay open during the
hardening process, with the halves kept apart under the pressure of a spring
to allow the silicone to expand. The mould would then be closed and two
tools inside it would perform the deburring action. That part of the process
has not been mastered and the rings are finished by hand. Eropol expects to
deliver the automated solution next year.
This technology could also serve to develop a contraceptive ring.

Project management techniques developed in the nuclear power industry have
now been applied to that most unlikely of sports - bungee jumping.
Nigel Holloway, chief technical consultant at AEA, of Didcot, applied two
safety principles used in the nuclear industry - redundancy and competence -
to produce a code of practice for the bungee jumping industry. Redundancy
means that any critical component in the jump should have a spare or
redundant equivalent - the bungee ropes must be attached to the jumper by
two separate means, for example.
Holloway is so confident of the procedures that he did a jump himself. AEA:

FT  05 NOV 93 / Technology: Safety in the works - Gunpowder, a traditional
fuel for fireworks, may soon be replaced by resins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'I THINK I've got the best job in the world,' enthuses Ron Rapley, research
director at Standard Fireworks, Europe's biggest firework manufacturer.
At the Hudddersfield site, perched high on a hill, Rapley and his team of
chemists are responsible for devising ever more sumptuous cascades of red,
green and white stars to the accompaniment of an ever more varied cacophony
of whistles, crackles and bangs.
But as a recent recruit to the world of firework manufacture - until two
years ago he was an accident investigator at the UK's Health and Safety
executive - Rapley is acutely aware of the potential danger of making
fireworks.
In the UK today 75m or so fireworks will be lit to commemorate the failed
plot to blow up Parliament in 1605 by Guy Fawkes. Rockets, bangers,
sparklers, catherine wheels and roman candles will all rely on gunpowder, a
dangerous mixture of charcoal, sulphur and potassium nitrate. From next
year, a new material could begin to replace the traditional explosive.
Rapley's team is working with researchers at the Cranfield Institute of
Technology to investigate ways of using resins - viscous compounds which
harden in air - to replace gunpowder in some of its fireworks. The result
should be a safer manufacturing process.
The investigations are arduous, not least because gunpowder is a versatile
firework component. Tiny grains of gunpowder are used as the blowing charge
in bangers, while larger grains - the size of a peppercorn or even a pea -
burn more slowly and produce more long-lasting effects. Gunpowder can also
be compressed into pellets to form rocket motors. Lit at one end the pellet
takes several seconds to burn - long enough to lift the rocket high into the
sky.
Because resins are organic they act as a fuel and only need the addition of
an oxidising agent - such as potassium nitrate - to produce a material to
rival gunpowder. The resin, which is viscous, also acts as a binder for all
the other ingredients.
The first step for Standard has been to investigate ways of using the new
resin in the coloured stars which shoot out of roman candles and rockets. In
many industries the development of the resin would be the bulk of the work,
but the stringent safety requirements of firework manufacturing has meant
that Standard has had to carry out strict trial procedures.
The tiny stars will be extruded, with a continuous flow of the viscous
material being chopped into the appropriate size, like minced meat out of a
mincing machine. Standard has already conducted successful test runs using a
conventional extruding machine, but still needs to develop an appropriate
conveyor belt system.
'We can't just put ordinary machines in,' Rapley points out. 'Every nook and
cranny has to be considered. If there's a corner that explosives can get in
to, they will.'
Rapley is confident the resins will be safer than gunpowder. Not only is
there less dust - less to be inhaled by employees as well as less to cause a
spark - but the softer dough of the resin absorbs blows which the hard
powder cannot.
Moreover resins open the way for machines which can be operated remotely.
Today's fireworks are often constructed and filled by hand and at best the
machines used need operators to stand close by. In the unlikely event of an
accident, says Rapley, machines operated remotely would help minimise the
casualties.
With a throughput of 70m fireworks a year, involving some 100m operations
between them, the safety requirements for Standard are awesome. It would
take just one operation in those 100m to go wrong for the result to be
potentially fatal.
The safety precautions at Standard's Huddersfield site - there are two
further locations near Wakefield - are necessarily stringent. Storage
buildings are well away from the numerous small production sheds, which are
grouped in twos with thick brick walls between so that if one shed blows up
no other section is damaged. The electrical wiring is on the outside of the
buildings to prevent sparks.
The gunpowder is stored separately under strict regulations. As none is
manufactured in the UK - it has to be imported from Germany or former
Yugoslavia - an expensive and difficult transportation procedure is
involved.
If the new resins could replace gunpowder, Standard would need less secure
storage facilities and could reduce its costs in both sourcing and
transportation. 'So few people make gunpowder to the quality we need - we're
virtually single sourcing,' explains Rapley. In addition the number of
suppliers is continuing to decrease. 'As each plant blows up they stop
production. That's how it works.'
Once the production of stars has been introduced successfully gunpowder
looks set to be replaced in other fireworks. Next on the list could be
fountains, for which Rapley is investigating the use of pourable resins so
that the cardboard shell of the fountain could be filled with the
pyrotechnic brew in the same way as toothpaste tubes are filled with
toothpaste. The problem would be to ensure no gas bubbles remain in the
mixture, as they would produce a bigger surface area for burning and result
in chunks of the mix spurting out.
The next step could be to develop the pellet motors for rockets. 'We would
have a tremendous advantage if we could get into things like rocket motors,'
Rapley continues.
Other manufacturers could follow suit since the process is not proprietary.
But it would take large volume production, says Rapley, to make it
economical. For Standard, under pressure in its traditional UK market from
cheaper, imported Chinese fireworks, cost reduction will be a welcome
further advantage of the resin technology.
And for the consumer the result could be more stable and prettier fireworks.
'I would hope we could produce some colours that we can't produce now,'
predicts Rapley. While greens, yellow, reds and whites are relatively easy
to produce by adding fragments of barium, sodium, strontium and magnesium
respectively, blues and purples are notoriously difficult to produce safely.
'If the process is inherently safer,' says Rapley, 'we could perhaps add
some ingredients that we can't use now.'
Nonetheless, Rapley believes the versatility of gunpowder means it will be a
long time - if ever - before it is replaced entirely. Which means the
festive rhyme 'gunpowder, treason and plot' has still some life left in it
yet.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Cardiff pins its hopes on the waterfront: A Pounds 152m
barrage project that is hoped will create 23,000 Welsh jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRELIMINARY WORK will start today on the Pounds 152m project to build a  3/4
 mile (1.1km) barrage across Cardiff Bay as a crucial part of the
regeneration of the city's waterfront.
Parliamentary approval for the barrage bill was completed on Wednesday
evening after more than six years of argument and delay. Royal assent is
expected today.
The barrage, at the mouths of the rivers Taff and Ely, will create a
permanent freshwater lake of 500 acres designed to improve the appearance of
the bay, which becomes mudflats at low tide.
Opposition has come from Friends of the Earth and other environmentalists
who fear the loss of the area's distinctive birdlife and believe that houses
could be damaged by rising groundwater.
The scheme is the flagship project of Cardiff Bay Development Corporation,
which was set up in 1987 to regenerate 2,700 acres of derelict docklands.
The barrage is expected to take four years to build. Seven contractors have
been invited to tender for the main contract, which is likely to be awarded
within the next six weeks with construction to start next February. Bechtel
is acting as project manager.
The corporation hopes the barrage will act as a catalyst for business and
leisure development along an eight-mile waterfront. So far, work has
concentrated on improving the infrastructure. The main office relocations to
Cardiff Bay have been by the Dutch group NCM Credit Insurance, which is
building a new UK headquarters, and Welsh Health Common Services
Authorities.
Plans include a home for the Welsh National Opera, a quality hotel, a
science discovery centre, shops, restaurants and other attractions aimed at
bringing 2m visitors annually to Cardiff Bay by the year 2000. Sir Geoffrey
Inkin, chairman of the corporation, said: 'With a water arena the size of
the City of London, Cardiff Bay will capture the imagination of the world.'
Mr Gwilym Jones, Welsh Office minister, said: 'The barrage forms the
centrepiece of a regeneration strategy which offers the prospect of more
than 23,000 jobs, 4,400 homes and Pounds 1.2bn of private sector investment.
Its construction will give our capital a unique international identity.'
The barrage bill was introduced by the government after the blocking of a
private bill in 1991. Opponents held up its progress and won a number of
environmental concessions, and the bill's approval was further delayed this
year because of lack of parliamentary time.
The bill now includes an enhanced scheme for protection from groundwater
damage and safeguards agreed with the National Rivers Authority concerning
flooding, water quality and fish protection. Up to Pounds 5.7m will be spent
to create a bird reserve to compensate for the loss of feeding grounds. The
barrage has five sluice gates and a fish pass to allow salmon to return to
the rivers.
Mr Alun Michael, Labour MP for Cardiff South and Penarth, which includes the
bay, said that in spite of the parliamentary divisions the barrage had
overwhelming support across the political spectrum. 'It was a
Labour-controlled county council which set the ball rolling, and trade
unionists and employers throughout south Wales recognise its vital
importance to our region.'

Sir Richard, a strong Euro-sceptic, said in September he was considering
leaving politics for a career writing books on agriculture. His office said
yesterday he would not make a statement until next week.
Loss of the seat would cut the Tory majority to 15.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Right wing leads backbench race
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BOB DUNN, MP for Dartford, is being tipped to win the election for the
vice-chairmanship of the backbench 1922 Committee of Conservative MPs - a
move that would dash government hopes of diluting rightwing influence on the
influential body.
Mr Dunn is one of 13 candidates from the right or centre-right of the party
who will be supported by the rightwing 92 group in elections to the 1922's
executive. These will almost certainly take place on November 25.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Doubt on London bus deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CABINET yesterday agreed an outline legislative programme for the next
parliamentary session starting in two weeks' time without deciding whether
to proceed with the deregulation of London buses.
Ministers settled on a moderately heavy programme focusing as expected on
law and order and deregulation. But they have still not made up their minds
whether to remove legislation to implement bus deregulation from the
wide-ranging deregulation bill.
The reason for withdrawing the plans would be the desire of some ministers -
believed to include Mr John Major - to excise controversial issues from a
programme that is supposed to unite the Conservative party.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Labour widens opinion poll lead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT last night ended a dismal parliamentary year with the news
that Labour has extended its lead in the opinion polls to 22.5 percentage
points, Philip Stephens writes.
The Gallup poll, published in today's issue of The Daily Telegraph, showed
the Conservatives trailing third behind the Liberal Democrats. It puts
Labour's support at 46.5 per cent, up two points from late September. The
Liberal Democrats stood at 25.5 per cent, down 1.5 points, while the
Conservatives moved up 1 point to 24 per cent.
Mr Major saw a small rise in his personal popularity rating from 16.7 per
cent to 19.1 per cent. It still marks him out as the least popular post-war
prime minister.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Prison officers start work-to-rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has plans to hold prisoners in police cells if prison
officers escalate a campaign of industrial action, starting today, aimed at
ending prison privatisation plans.
The 23,000-member Prison Officers' Association has voted to introduce a
programme of action in Britain's 130 state-run prisons, beginning with a
work-to-rule from today.
This involves refusing to work hours on top of the 39-hour week and to
follow prison procedures to the letter.
The association has warned it will step up its action later this month if
the government is not prepared to introduce measures to halt overcrowding
and market testing of prisons and prison services. The association says
these are leading to 'unchecked criminality' in prisons.
Mr John Bartell, association chairman, said further action would start on
November 15 when prison officers would refuse to accept prisoners who had
been held in police custody or privately-run prisons.
Mr Bartell said that while he was sympathetic to the government's objective
of introducing more controlled regimes in prisons he was concerned at
business plans that measured governors' performance by the amount of time
spent by prisoners outside their cells.
The Home Office said yesterday it would closely monitor the strength of the
action. Although there was a 79 per cent vote for industrial action, only 49
per cent of the membership voted.
Mr Bartlett said his members were 'no longer prepared to have their safety
jeopardised' in pursuit of 'an untested political objective'.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Leaders emerge in race for ID-card business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THORN Secure Systems, part of Thorn-EMI, and Electronic Data Systems, the
information technology subsidiary of General Motors, are the front-runners
to introduce a system of identity cards for the country's 20m social
security claimants.
Government officials said yesterday that an identity card system was likely
to be introduced after an investigation of how to reduce fraud in the social
security budget. The investigation, being overseen by the government
efficiency unit, is expected to be completed in the next few weeks. Both
Thorn and EDS have been consulted during the investigation.
It is estimated that a computerised anti-fraud system would cost more than
Pounds 100m, but could lead to annual savings of at least Pounds 800m in the
social security budget.
Officials estimate the savings would come from the near-elimination of three
kinds of fraud: use of stolen benefit books, use of forged books and
claiming under a variety of names.
A possible communications infrastructure for the system already exists.
Racal Network Systems runs a network linking 40 government departments, but
which has 'walls' between departments. It also links the 600 or so
Department of Social Security offices throughout the country.
The main expense would be additional hardware. An automatic telling machine
in every DSS office at about Pounds 100,000 each would mean a total cost of
Pounds 60m.
However, officials say the preferred scheme will probably involve installing
simple point-of-payments machines in post offices. These operate like
point-of-sale machines in supermarkets and would have the advantage of
ensuring that sub-post offices in villages do not become redundant because
of the existence of an automated teller machines in the street.
Whether the DSS will install a machine in all 12,000 sub-post offices or
only in the 6,000 main ones has not been decided.
Another important consideration in choosing the system is the concerns of
civil rights lobby groups that individual privacy may be at risk. Officials
say that technology exists to produce the kind of identity card that would
overcome civil liberty fears.
Claimants could have a 'hand scan' and then the shape of the hand would be
stored electronically, together with relevant social security data, on a
magnetic stripe on a swipe card of the kind used by banks. When claimants
collected benefits or pensions, they would have their hands 'read' by a
machine to verify identity.
Mr Brian Maitland Reynell, government services director of EDS, said trials
in the US had shown that hand scans could be devised that could not be used
by the police for criminal identification purposes, alleviating some of the
civil liberties concerns.
His company would be able to set up the entire system for the government. He
said cost would depend on how much hardware was needed. 'The cost would
certainly be less than the potential savings,' he said.
Nor would EDS actually make the cards. There are a number of companies in
Britain capable of doing this, such as McCorquodale Card Technology,
Datacard and De La Rue.
McCorquodale claims to have the largest share of an annual UK market of
about 250m cards. Swipe cards cost between Pounds 1 and Pounds 5 to
manufacture.
Thorn Secure System has the relevant technology to compete with EDS, either
through watermarks on magnetic strips on swipe cards or through
fingerprinting, a variant of the hand scan. Watermark magnetics is a
technique developed by Thorn and is a sophisticated version of the
watermarking used on bank notes.
Estimates of the total size of the fraud range from Pounds 1bn to Pounds
5bn. In Australia, the only country where there has been a detailed study of
social security fraud, it was estimated that the level of fraud ranged
between 5 per cent and 15 per cent of total payments.
British officials base their estimates on the 5 per cent level. That would
mean fraud of Pounds 3bn to Pounds 4bn, of which a quarter, or more than
Pounds 800m, is thought to stem from stolen benefit books, forged books and
multiple identity fraud.
The much harder to detect fraud of moonlighting - claiming benefits while
working - could account for a substantial part of the rest. If there was a
desire to attack this kind of fraud it would probably require the
introduction of the more sophisticated smart cards that contain a microchip
and could hold far larger amounts of updateable information about the
private circumstances of beneficiaries, including their work and income. The
government appears reluctant to go down this route because of the
implications for civil liberties.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Canary Wharf profit 'in 4 years'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANARY WHARF, the property development in London's Docklands, should be
making a profit within four years, its professional advisers predict.
Canary Wharf reached an arrangement at the end of last month with its
creditors to remove it from administration.
Mr Alan Bloom, a joint administrator to Canary Wharf at accountants Ernst &amp;
Young, said he expected income to exceed expenditure by 1997-98. The
forecasts are based on occupancy of 80 per cent to 90 per cent, and follow
big write-offs of liabilities and restructuring of debt.
Mr Bloom would not disclose the present rental income on the project, but
said annual operating expenses were expected to be Pounds 12m-Pounds 15m a
year. There are outstanding construction costs of Pounds 5m-Pounds 7m.
Unsecured creditors can expect a maximum payment of 15p in the pound, with a
further 25p in the pound to 130 contractors willing to provide warranties on
existing work. A big proportion will be paid by the end of January, and the
remainder once disputes over contested debts of about Pounds 25m have been
resolved.
The details emerged shortly before the accounts for the restructured
businesses for the year to October 31 1992 are due to be filed at Companies
House. Price Waterhouse, the auditor, has signed the figures in the past few
days. It has not qualified the accounts, but has drawn attention to an
accounting note which highlights the 'uncertainty' of debts restructured
until 2007. The consolidated accounts for 1992 are expected to show a net
loss of Pounds 1.2bn on the group, which reflects its acceptance of costs of
restructuring the debts.
Total bank loans on the balance sheet as long-term liabilities will be
Pounds 152m, reflecting the net present value of the Pounds 573m in debts
owing to the banks at the time of insolvency. An additional Pounds 98m
facility has been made available to fund the Jubilee Line extension. The 12
banks which now own Canary Wharf through a company called Sylvester
Investments have also made available up to Pounds 180m in other facilities.

MR PETER BROOKE, national heritage secretary, will tell UK satellite
television operators next week to move to a majority of European
programming.
Mr Brooke gave the warning yesterday in the first two-yearly report to the
European Commission on the European content of UK broadcasts.
He said: 'A number of broadcasters have yet to meet the targets for European
and independently produced material referred to in the (EC) directive.'
As a first step Mr Brooke will be writing to all the relevant broadcasters
asking why they have not met the requirements.
British Sky Broadcasting, a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the FT has
a stake, is likely to be among those receiving letters.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Unions condemn MPs' pay increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION LEADERS yesterday criticised MPs for awarding themselves a pay rise of
nearly 5.4 per cent over the next two years while public-sector workers were
being told to accept lower settlements.
In the early hours of yesterday morning MPs voted by 268 votes to 42, a
majority of 226, to award themselves a 2.7 per cent rise from January and
2.68 per cent the year after.
Ministers argued that the award would be the first pay rise since January
1992, and would bring MPs' salaries in line with inflation.
Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary of the public-sector union Unison,
Britain's biggest union, said it was 'grossly hypocritical' for MPs to give
themselves a rise nearly twice as high as the 1.5 per cent limit for
public-sector workers this year.
The TGWU general union said: 'MPs have voted themselves a higher wage rise
than they are imposing on 1m local government manual workers.'
Among the 56 Labour MPs who voted for the rise were Mrs Margaret Beckett,
the deputy leader, and Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary.
In the Commons debate, Mrs Beckett argued that MPs had to live in London and
run secretarial and research staff on comparatively small salaries.
The 16 Labour MPs voting against the rise included Mr Frank Field, MP for
Birkenhead, who proposed a pay freeze, and Mr Dennis Skinner, MP for
Bolsover.
On the Tory benches 10 MPs defied the recommendation of the government and
voted against the pay rise.
The vote cost Mr Michael Bates, Tory MP for Langbaurgh, his job as
parliamentary private secretary to Mr Nicholas Scott, the social security
minister.
The pay award was described as 'a free vote' outside the party whip. But as
a parliamentary private secretary, Mr Bates was considered part of the
'payroll vote', and was obliged to support the government. Mr Bates was
reported to be so outraged at the increase that he was planning to turn down
the cash.
Under the proposals, the salary of an ordinary MP would rise to Pounds
31,687 next year and to Pounds 32,538 in 1995. Those receiving a
non-parliamentary salary, for example those concerned with legal work, would
receive Pounds 23,854 next year and Pounds 24,495 in 1995.
It is proposed that, from 1996, increases in MPs' pay will be linked
annually to a range of civil service bands - which should end the
traditional furore over MPs' salaries.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Brain disorder verdict opens way for compensation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INQUEST jury yesterday returned a verdict of 'medical misadventure' on
Patrick Baldwin, a 29-year-old naval engineer who died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease, a brain disorder contracted as a result of taking a contaminated
growth hormone that was administered during childhood.
Lawyers acting for Baldwin's parents said the verdict at Lincoln Coroner's
Court opened the way for families who had suffered from contaminated
hormones to take legal action against the government for compensation. Mr
David Body, the Baldwins' solicitor, said writs would be issued in the High
Court next week.
Baldwin was one of 1,900 children in Britain who received growth hormone to
treat short stature between 1958 and 1985. An unknown quantity of the
hormone - extracted from the pituitary glands of corpses - was contaminated
with the disease, a human version of BSE or 'mad cow' disease. In addition,
an estimated 300 women who received infertility treatment with hormone
extracted from corpses may be at risk.
Although 10 people in the UK have died of the disease after growth hormone
treatment, Mr Baldwin was the first to receive an inquest.
After the verdict Dr Nigel Chapman, the coroner, said: 'It would be
advisable for the 1,900 people who were given the human growth hormone to be
monitored very carefully. It is not clear how many, if any, will be affected
by CJD but the implications of this case are far-reaching.'
Last month Australian researchers estimated that 30,000 people worldwide
were treated with potentially contaminated hormones before 1985, when three
young people died of the disease and the procedure was stopped.
The UK government has denied liability and refused requests for
compensation. But the Labour party last night supported Mr Body's call for a
change of policy. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said: 'It is
essential that a comprehensive screening and support service is
established.'

FT  05 NOV 93 / Rule on ITV takeovers may soften
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is mov-ing towards a modest relaxation of the rules
preventing the nine largest ITV companies taking each other over.
A compromise is taking shape after an inter-ministerial meeting this week.
It would allow a large ITV company to own a second 'large' licence.
The National Heritage Department is to send proposals to Mr John Major, the
prime minister, for a final decision. The proposals are expected to reflect
the growing view that some consolidation in the ITV system is needed if UK
commercial broadcasters are to compete internationally.
An extension of the 'moratorium' which makes takeover of ITV companies
difficult before the beginning of next year is now considered unlikely. An
extension would require primary legislation.
Any liberalisation is expected to be carefully framed and will almost
certainly exclude Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Mr Ian Lang,
Scottish secretary, and Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, have both
expressed concern about the continuation of regional production if Scottish
and Welsh commercial broadcasters were to be taken over.
It is also unlikely that a single company will be allowed to own both the
London weekday and weekend licences.
There remains scope for modest consolidation which would, for example, allow
Granada to take over London Weekend Television, a company in which it
already has a stake. In such a scenario Carlton Communications, owners of
Carlton Television, could take over Anglia. Carlton, holders of the London
weekday licence, already has a 20 per cent stake in Central, the second
largest ITV company.
The National Heritage Department said last night that no final decisions had
been taken. If compromise proposals are accepted then they would have to be
passed by both houses of parliament.
Supporters of liberalisation stress that existing licence obligations on
regional programmes and production would have to be met by new owners.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Insurer hit by Lautro ruling
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GUARDIAN Royal Exchange, the UK-based life assurance company, said yesterday
that it may have to pay compensation to investors who were mis-sold
insurance policies in 1990 and 1991.
GRE, which has already been subject to disciplinary action and a fine from
Lautro, the self-regulating body for the life assurance industry, said the
latest problems were also uncovered after a Lautro compliance review.
The review, earlier this year, raised concerns about the appropriateness of
advice given to clients, particularly by former 'tied agents' of GRE, who
sell the company's products exclusively but are not directly employed by it.
GRE said it had agreed with Lautro to review the business of those
representative firms and of any others where either documentation sampling
or the complaints level suggested further cases of mis-selling. It would
make compensation where necessary.
GRE said yesterday that it had recently started recruiting tied agents again
after a two-year moratorium. Meanwhile, it had cut the number of tied agents
to less than 150 from about 950.

FT  05 NOV 93 / BBC fee to rise in line with inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has granted the BBC a licence fee increase in line with
inflation until the corporation's present charter runs out at the end of
1996, Raymond Snoddy writes.
The announcement by Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, was
influenced by a report on BBC efficiency by consultants Touche Ross. The
consultants found that the BBC had pursued opportunities to make savings and
efficiency improvements 'in a rigorous and effective' manner.
Touche Ross did, however, offer the government a number of licence fee
options, including the option for a fee increase below the rise in retail
prices for two of the three years involved.
Mr Brooke said the settlement would enable the corporation to channel
savings into programmes 'and over the next three years allow the BBC
steadily to reduce and largely eliminate its annual borrowing'.
The decision was welcomed by Mr John Birt, BBC director-general.
As a result the colour television licence will rise by 1.8 per cent from
April 1 next year, from Pounds 83 to Pounds 84.50.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Unionist blow to Sinn Fein
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JAMES MOLYNEAUX last night dealt a heavy blow to Sinn Fein's hopes of
being brought into the Northern Ireland peace process, while giving an
equally big boost to the Anglo-Irish peace initiative.
The Ulster Unionist leader said Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA,
would have to wait until at least five years after agreeing to a permanent
cessation of violence before it could be considered for admission into the
democratic process. Other criminals were 'not usually considered for parole
until they have served five years of their sentence'.
Sinn Fein would also have to consent to the handover of IRA weapons and the
identification of IRA explosive dumps.
Interviewed on the BBC, Mr Molyneaux said it would not be difficult to
establish a workable Northern Ireland assembly 'in the fairly short term'.
This body would start with 'modest administrative powers', but as the
constitutional parties became accustomed to working together 'they would
acquire trust and confidence . . . and then who knows where it would end'.
In a positive response to the six points set out recently by Mr Dick Spring,
Irish foreign minister, Mr Molyneaux said that while some 'clarification'
was needed, Dublin was 'moving in the right direction'.
Asked whether he had an effective veto over proposals put forward by Mr John
Major, the British prime minister, Mr Molyneaux said: 'If quite obviously
they were going to suggest that they would transfer Northern Ireland lock
stock and barrel within say three years to an Irish Republic, well nobody
could expect us to live with that situation.'
Under such circumstances, the UUP - on whose nine MPs Mr Major depends to
swell his precarious majority - would 'terminate the lifetime of this
parliament prematurely'.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Labour alarmed at lag in exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPORTERS ARE losing out to companies based in other European Community
states in the race to establish markets in the former communist countries of
eastern Europe, according to figures produced for the Labour party by the
House of Commons library.
Labour said Germany, Italy and France exported substantially more than the
UK to eastern Europe last year. German exports to Poland, the Czech and
Slovak republics Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and the former Soviet Union
amounted to Dollars 23.9bn compared with the UK figure of Dollars 2.7bn.
France achieved total sales of Dollars 4.7bn and Italy Dollars 6.4bn. The
Netherlands, with a population of just 15m, sold goods and services worth
Dollars 2.69bn.
The figures also show that British trade with eastern Europe is increasing
more slowly than that of other EC countries.
UK sales last year were 49 per cent higher than in 1990, just after the fall
of the Berlin Wall. German exports were up by 65 per cent, and Italian
exports by 51 per cent. Dutch exports were up by 76 per cent.
Ms Joyce Quin, responsible for Europe in Labour's foreign affairs team, who
obtained the figures, said urgent action was needed to make sure that
Britain obtained a larger share of long-term export opportunities in eastern
Europe.
'The problem is that the countries that get most involved in eastern Europe
in the early days are the ones most likely to win through on a long-term
basis,' she said.
'The government have not got a sufficiently co-ordinated effort going across
British industry to maximise the opportunities in these countries. Ministers
need to talk urgently to the CBI, the chambers of commerce and trade
organisations to make sure everyone understands the importance of building
up this trade.'
The government also seems worried about the trends. Mr David
Heathcoat-Amory, Foreign Office minister, admitted during Commons questions
this week that Britain's export performance to central and eastern Europe
'must, indeed, be improved'.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Charities' funding code to be examined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CODE of practice for government departments funding the voluntary sector
'merits serious consideration', Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said
yesterday.
Such a code was recommended in a report resulting from discussions between
charity representatives and government departments.
The report, published by three charity umbrella bodies, warned that the
government should not place extra demands on the voluntary sector without
providing adequate resources.
The proposed code would cover such matters as the time-scale of grants, the
need to support voluntary organisations' staff training and development, and
the importance of contributing to central overheads as well as funding
specific projects.
Mr Howard told the Charities Aid Foundation conference in London yesterday
that he would ask the government's Ministerial Group on the Voluntary Sector
to examine the possibility of a code when it meets later this month.
Controversy erupted last month over another report, by three former advisers
to the Home Office Voluntary Services Unit, which recommended that charities
should lose tax relief now that many receive public funds to deliver
services. Mr John Major, the prime minister, moved quickly to stress that
tax relief would be retained, and Mr Howard yesterday distanced the
government further from the report.
A widening income gap between the biggest charities and others is revealed
in the latest edition of CAF's Charity Trends, published yesterday.
The top 200 fundraising charities increased their total income by 4 per cent
in real terms, and expenditure rose by a similar amount. But income of the
next 200 largest charities fell by 9 by cent, forcing them to cut
expenditure by about 8 per cent. Total income of the top 400 charities was
Pounds 2.8bn in 1991-92 - an annual rise of only 1 per cent, compared with
an 8 per cent increase the previous year.

FT  05 NOV 93 / DTI men 'tried to stop Matrix trial'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR OFFICIALS at the Department of Trade and Industry tried to block the
prosecution of three businessmen accused by Customs and Excise of illegally
exporting defence-related goods to Iraq so as to protect intelligence and
ministers, the Scott inquiry heard yesterday.
Mr Alan Barrett, a senior Minister of Defence official, told the inquiry
into British defence exports to Iraq that prosecutions 'may have brought . .
. into the open' the fact that ministers had approved export licence
applications for intelligence reasons.
'The concern was that the whole business might be exposed to the detriment
of the UK's interests,' he said.
Mr Barrett said he could not recall with certainty who tried to ensure that
the trial of the Matrix-Churchill executives 'didn't take place'. However,
he named three senior officials at the DTI - Mr Michael Coolican, Mr Tony
Steadman, and Mr Eric Beston - as the possible sources for his information.
'It is impossible to recall . . . I heard bits and pieces all the time,' Mr
Barrett said.
Documents made available to the inquiry show that information about
intelligence and Matrix-Churchill was shared by a small group of Whitehall
officials, members of the secret services, and customs officials in a
secretive committee called the Restricted Enforcement Unit.
Mr Barrett, who was a member of the unit, said that Customs and Excise had
never approached him for MoD documents as part of their investigation into
Matrix-Churchill, nor had he volunteered them.
Lord Justice Scott said that he intended to question senior customs
officials over what they knew about the involvement of government and
officials in the Matrix-Churchill case and on what grounds they decided to
go ahead with the prosecution.
The former chairman of the customs service, Sir Brian Unwin, who is
president of the European Investment Bank, is among those who have been
asked to give evidence in January.
The hearing continues on Monday.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Lilley heads off move to cut child benefit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, has successfully resisted a
move by the Treasury to restrict child benefit to those with earnings below
the national average of Pounds 16,000 a year.
The cabinet approved yesterday the main Whitehall budgets for the next three
years, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, underlined his determination
to limit the cost of the compensation package for value added tax on
domestic fuel.
In his last appearance before the November 30 Budget at Commons questions,
Mr Clarke said the proposed package of measures to help the poor and elderly
with higher fuel bills would offer 'some' help to 'some' people.
Mr Clarke stressed repeatedly that the impact on heating costs of the
planned imposition of VAT would be less than feared. He told MPs: 'I would
point out there has been such a fall in gas and electricity prices during
the 1980s that even with the tax imposed in full, fuel bills will be no
higher than they were 10 years ago.'
His comments came as the prime minister's office confirmed that the size and
scope of the compensation package remains the subject of a fierce struggle
between Mr Clarke and Mr Lilley. They also coincided with a renewed attack
by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, on the government's refusal to
make deeper cuts in public spending.
Mr Lamont said that present policies would 'never' achieve his goal of
reducing the proportion of national income spent by government from more
than 45 per cent to less than 40 per cent.
Speaking at a London conference, the Mr Lamont added that the government
should raise health service charges and cut state contributions to social
insurance.
Downing Street said if the differences remain unresolved the dispute over
compensation for VAT on fuel could go to full cabinet before the Budget.
The size of the compensation package will depend also on whether the
chancellor decided to introduce the new tax at the full 17.5 per cent next
April rather than at 8 per cent as presently planned.
Friends of Mr Lilley said he had fought off a demand from Mr Michael
Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, to 'means-test' universal
child benefit by imposing a cut-off point at the level of average earnings.
Mr Lilley had argued that the Treasury scheme was arbitrary and impractical
and broke the Conservatives' pledge in last year's general election
manifesto to protect child benefit.

FT  05 NOV 93 / More executives get bonuses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BONUS SCHEMES for senior executives have become the norm for large
companies, even though only 8 per cent had them in 1979, according to a
survey.
The survey by Incomes Data Services found that few schemes were in the
public sector. The Royal Mail was the only public body to have a bonus
scheme. Its scheme covers 1,200 senior managers and 11,000 middle managers.
British Rail abandoned an attempt to introduce a bonus scheme for senior
managers in 1990.
The study says that bonuses in the private sector tended to be paid on top
of normal salaries although some companies were paying lower salaries.
It also found that some companies were allowing bonus payments to count
towards pensions.
Many companies placed ceilings on bonus payments - for example, British Gas
limited bonuses in a range from 18 per cent of salary for most senior
managers to 37.5 per cent for the chairman and chief executive.
In spite of rises such as the Pounds 1.1m bonus paid to Sir Ian MacLauren,
the chairman of Tesco, in 1990, the report found British bonuses lagging
behind US counterparts such as Toys R Us which last year paid Mr Charles
Lazarus, its chief executive Dollars 6.71m on top of his annual salary of
Dollars 315,000.
IDS surveyed 18 companies and drew information from other corporate surveys.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Power given to the regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE two main elements to yesterday's announcement on restructuring
regional aid - the pooling of the resources of a number of government
departments in a single budget and the creation of a new administrative
structure for parcelling out grants to the English regions.
Six government departments - the Home Office and the departments of trade
and industry, environment, education, employment and transport - will pool
their separate regional aid programmes. Transport will not put any resources
into the pool, but will draw from it.
Some 20 regional development programmes will come under the control of a new
cabinet committee from April next year. It will have a budget of about
Pounds 1.4bn.
But a key element of the reforms will be the creation of 10 regional offices
to administer the aid. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, said the
existing network of government regional offices would be merged and the area
offices would administer the new single budget and all other departmental
programmes.
Each office will be headed by a senior regional director who will be
responsible for the expenditure programme in their area, providing 'a more
comprehensive and accessible service' to local people.
Mr Gummer said the reform would make government 'more accessible and
responsive'. It would ensure that priorities were set locally and give local
people more influence over spending.
The reform met with scepticism from opposition MPs, who feared it may mask
big cuts in regional development grants in the unified Budget later this
month.
'As the packages get even glossier the money gets ever smaller,' said Mr
Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary.
Mr Gummer also launched an invitation to civic and business leaders in
London, Birmingham and Manchester to define what practical steps they want
to take on urban regeneration.
Ministers were particularly impressed by the way that Manchester's bid for
the Olympics in 2000 created new alliances between business, community
groups and the local authorities to improve the city.
The Corporation of London yesterday welcomed the initiative.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUARDIAN Royal Exchange, the UK-based life insurance company, said yesterday
it may have to pay compensation to investors who were mis-sold insurance
policies in 1990 and 1991.
GRE, which has already been the object of disciplinary action and a fine
from Lautro, the self-regulating body for the life insurance industry, said
the latest problems were also uncovered after a Lautro compliance review.
The review, earlier this year, raised concerns about the appropriateness of
advice given to clients, particularly by former 'tied agents' of GRE, who
sell the company's products exclusively but are not directly employed by it.
GRE said it had agreed with Lautro to review the business of those
representative firms and of any others where either documentation sampling
or the complaints level suggest further cases of mis-selling. It would make
compensation where necessary.
The conduct of tied agents in the life insurance industry has been the main
focus of Lautro efforts to curb sales of unsuitable products to investors.
Last week Lautro, in its enforcement report for the 12 months to June 1993,
said disciplinary actions were being considered against several 'household
name' life insurance companies. Industry sources said that at least three
such cases were pending and that all were owned by shareholders.
The company said: 'To ensure continuing high standards in the future, GRE
has revised its business and compliance procedures.'
GRE said yesterday that after a two-year moratorium beginning August 1991 on
the recruiting of tied agents, it had recently resumed doing so. Meanwhile
it had cut the number of tied agents to less than 150 from about 950.

vice-chairmanship of the backbench 1922 Committee of Conservative MPs - a
move that would dash government hopes of diluting rightwing influence on the
influential body.
Mr Dunn is one of 13 candidates from the right or centre-right of the party
who will be supported by the rightwing 92 group in elections to the 1922's
executive. These will almost certainly take place on November 25 - a week
into the new parliamentary session.
In last year's election the 92 group was highly successful at securing its
candidates both on the 1922 committee and the chairmanships of other Tory
backbench committees.
This was widely seen as reflecting a pronounced shift to the right in the
parliamentary party as a result of last year's general election when several
rightwingers were elected to parliament for the first time.
Other MPs on the 92 group's 'slate' for the 1922 executive include Mr David
Evans, the outspoken MP for Welwyn Hatfield, Sir Rhodes Boyson (Brent
North), Mr John Townend (Bridlington) and Sir George Gardiner (Reigate).
Those on the slate who are already on the executive have meanwhile been
targeted for replacement by MPs loyal to Mr John Major, the prime minister.
These loyalists believe their presence in prominent positions could
undermine government efforts to build party unity.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Calling a halt to the price escalator: The water industry
regulator's plans for a fair deal for customers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAUNCH phase for the privatised water industry is over. Now, the water
companies must work for their profits.
This was the message that Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, the water
regulator, put across yesterday with the publication of his consultation
document on the forthcoming price review.
The paper stems from Mr Byatt's duty to lay down a formula for price
increases above the rate of inflation for all the privatised water companies
in England and Wales.
The formula takes into account the industry's investment costs and the costs
which are imposed on water suppliers by tighter water standards,
particularly at European Community level. The result is known as the 'K
factor' and this sets a cap on price increases.
When the price formula was originally set in 1989, the K factor was
deliberately set at a generous level for the water companies to ensure that
they earned high returns: the industry was new, the risks were unfamiliar,
and the stock market needed reassurance. But water bills have increased by 5
per cent in real terms every year, and newspaper headlines have been full of
water company chairmen's inflated salaries.
Mr Byatt is now preparing for the first five-yearly review next summer, and
yesterday's paper laid out his approach. It was summed up by his comment: 'I
want to get customers off the endless price escalator. The water industry
will have to earn its profits and its dividends through greater efficiency.'
The main proposal he made was to reduce the rate of return on water industry
assets from the present level of 7 per cent to the lower end of the 5 per
cent to 6 per cent range.
This is partly because the risks of privatisation are now over, but also
because interest rates have fallen sharply since 1989.
The level is far below the 9.5 per cent that the water industry says is the
minimum needed to attract outside capital. It is also below the 6.5 per cent
to 7.5 per cent which the Monopolies and Mergers Commission recently
recommended for another utility, British Gas. Mr Byatt says the low level is
because water is a low risk business, although he stresses that the formula
will be tailored to each water company depending on its circumstances.
Companies will have to lower their rates of return over 10 years. This may
encourage them to bring forward investment plans so they can benefit from
today's higher rates.
Mr Byatt also proposes to amend some financial criteria, such as interest
cover (the amount of times interest costs are covered by earnings). This
means that water companies will have to borrow more or achieve greater
efficiency to fund improvements in service and investments rather than look
to higher prices as in the past.
But Mr Byatt was wary of promising water customers that price rises will
stop altogether, let alone go into reverse. He spoke only of 'moderating the
escalator'. This is because the price formula includes an element over which
he has no control: the cost of EC-mandated quality improvements which are
automatically passed straight on to the customer. These have been estimated
to cost as much as Pounds 45bn over the next decade.
Mr Byatt has already said he thinks the EC standards are too costly. Last
month Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, agreed and promised to
sound out EC partners to see if the urban waste water directive could be
modified.
Meanwhile Mr Byatt will have to do his sums using a variety of assumptions
about EC costs.
The implication of yesterday's paper is that it is now up to the government
to act if it wants to stem further water price rises.
Mr Byatt was careful yesterday to avoid putting any actual numbers on the
price formula. He said it was too early, and too many unknowns hung in the
balance. This left the stock market without much to go on, although it gave
the industry heart because it implied that Ofwat has still got an open mind
about the detail.
Water companies will go into discussions with Mr Byatt hoping to negotiate
better terms for themselves, and much of their case will rest on their claim
that he is underestimating the risks they have to deal with, and the
uncertainties created by the EC directives.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
WATER CHARGES: THE OFWAT SQUEEZE
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -Rapid rises in water prices to be moderated by obliging companies to
  reduce costs for existing services, and fund improvements through
  greater efficiency
 -Price increases will only be allowed to help meet new quality and
  environmental obligations
 -Rate of return on new investment to be cut from 7 per cent to
  around 5 per cent or 6 per cent
 -Higher returns on existing investment not to be clawed back, but
  should converge with new rate over 10 years
 -Companies will have scope to increase efficiency and raise dividends
 -Cost of connecting a house to water and sewerage to be limited to
  Pounds 200 for each service

FT  05 NOV 93 / New car registrations up 15.5% in October
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW CAR registrations rose 15.5 per cent in October, the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders said yesterday.
The figures jumped to 126,305 from the 109,373 reached in the same month a
year ago. In the first 10 months of this year registrations have risen by
12.1 per cent to 1.58m.
But the retail motor trade, which has repeatedly attacked car manufacturers
for distorting the state of the market, yesterday voiced renewed doubts
about the strength of the recovery in demand.
Mr Alan Pulham, director of the National Franchised Dealers Association,
said 45 per cent of registrations in October were made in the last 10 days
of the month.
'This amount of late-month registrations, occurring in advance of final
sales, and covering most volume franchises, results in diminished values for
new, nearly new and used cars, to the disbenefit of customers, dealers and
manufacturers,' he said.
The association, which is part of the Retail Motor Industry Federation, says
the pre-registering of cars by dealers or car manufacturers before the
vehicles have actually been sold is 'a major problem forcing unreality into
the market'.
A month ago the dealers attacked Ford for 'forcing registrations' and
'distorting' the market. The society accepted yesterday that the 'continued
buoyancy of the market' was largely the result of 'the most intense
marketing effort ever seen in this country'.
The UK remains virtually the only European car market achieving growth. New
car sales in west Europe fell 16 per cent in the first nine months compared
with an increase year-on-year in the UK of 12.1 per cent in the first 10
months.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Leyland Daf announces Pounds 30m modernisation plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEYLAND Daf Vans is operating profitably nine months after its management
buy-out from administrative receivership. It will be able to fund a Pounds
30m product modernisation programme from earnings, Mr Allan Amey, chief
executive, said yesterday.
Gradual recovery in the UK commercial vehicle market and the revival of
exports to continental Europe has put the Birmingham-based company on course
to achieve its output target of 12,000 units and a Pounds 150m turnover next
year, said Mr Amey. This compares with 5,000 vehicles built since the
buy-out in April.
Until February the company had been part of the Anglo-Dutch Daf commercial
vehicles group, which absorbed the formerly UK state-owned Leyland Vehicles
in 1987. The group collapsed at the beginning of this year.
Mr Amey, who projected output of a further 2,000 vans between now and the
end of the year, said the company could operate profitably at a volume of
10,000 units a year, including provision for the Pounds 30m product
programme, which is to be completed within the next two to three years. He
said the company had signed a contract with design consultancy Hawtal
Whiting to update the existing 200 and 400 model van ranges.
The company is discussing the revival of sales through some Daf dealers in
continental Europe, following the rescue of the Dutch truckmaker. Export
sales should reach 2,000-3,000 next year.
The company also plans a substantial restructuring of its operations to more
than halve the number of its component suppliers to fewer than 200.
Mr Amey was speaking as Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders
statistics showed that the UK market for panel vans, the sector in which the
company competes, jumped by about 18 per cent in October compared with the
same month a year ago.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Standards board retreats on reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of the British Standards Institution suffered a surprising and
humiliating setback yesterday when it was forced to withdraw proposals for
sweeping changes to its constitution.
Strong resistance from BSI members at the organisation's annual meeting
forced Lord Keith, the president, to defer for at least three months
proposals to increase directors' fees and strengthen the board's powers. The
institution, which is responsible for writing standards used by industry,
said it needed three months of communication with its 29,000 members -
companies and individuals who subscribe for its services - before it could
put the proposals to them again.
This setback comes at an embarrassing time for the organisation, which is
the subject of a government review. The Department of Trade and Industry is
looking at whether it should continue to receive a government subsidy.
The institution attempted to put on a brave face, saying the problems had
arisen because of misunderstandings by its members.
But Mr Michael Sanderson, former chief executive and a critic of the
changes, said the move represented a defeat for the board unprecedented in
the organisation's 93-year history.
The annual meeting is normally a quiet affair which attracts a handful of
members and lasts only a few minutes. Yesterday it was attended by 46 voting
members and lasted nearly two hours. It was marked by long wrangles over
procedures and tough questioning of the board.
The first proposal to run into difficulties involved setting new limits to
fees which could be paid to directors. Lord Keith proposed doubling
directors' fees to Pounds 15,000 a year and the chairman's fee to Pounds
50,000.
Members then objected to a series of far-reaching changes in the
organisation's charter and by-laws. These would have strengthened the
board's powers and given it the right to make additional payments to
directors for work done beyond the normal scope of their duties.
'There was quite a full discussion but it was very clear there were
misunderstandings over what was being proposed,' said Mr Derek Prior,
communications manager.
None of the proposals were put to the vote - all were deferred pending the
consultation exercise.
Speaking before yesterday's meeting Mr Vivian Thomas, BSI chairman, said
changes to the constitution were necessary for effective decision making and
to bring its fee structure more closely into line with general market rates.
As well as organising the writing of British standards, the institution
provides testing facilities for industry. It made a pre-tax profit of Pounds
4.7m in the year ended March 1993.

THE RAILWAY privatisation bill was expected last night to become law today.
Its passage was cleared when the Lords shied away from a constitutional
clash with the government.
The Lords' final decision yesterday to back down means that British Rail's
opportunities to bid for franchises to run services will be restricted to
routes where no credible bidder emerges.
Ministers were visibly relieved by the bill's successful passage through the
Lords, which ended more than 190 hours of debate in both Houses. The bill is
expected to receive royal assent a few hours before the end of the
parliamentary session today.
However, the frantic manoeuvring which preceded the final stages undermined
the government's attempts to suggest that the difficulties of the past 18
months were over.
The government was seriously embarrassed on Wednesday when it was forced to
interrupt Commons business to reverse three defeats inflicted in the Lords.
The defeats - and the uproar which followed in the Commons - threw doubt on
claims that the Conservative party had united in the wake of ratification of
the Maastricht treaty.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, told MPs at question time that the rowdy
scenes on Wednesday night were 'a disgrace to parliament'.
Officials said the prime minister was particularly upset by Labour's whips,
who challenged the count on a division reversing the Lords defeats, in
effect accusing the Conservative tellers of lying.
Conservative MPs said Labour had indulged in a number of unparliamentary
tricks, including jamming the doors open in the division lobbies to delay
the vote, switching tellers halfway through, and deliberately miscounting.
Opposition MPs said the unparliamentary behaviour was not one-sided. Mr
James Wallace, a Liberal Democrat MP, said he was jostled by a Conservative
whip as he tried to vote.
Labour leaders were unrepentant about the unruly scenes. Mr Brian Wilson,
deputy transport spokesman, said it was one of the few occasions when the
opposition had been able to make procedural tactics work against the
government.
Mr John Prescott, the shadow employment secretary, said Labour had 'done a
marvellous job' in delaying the bill. 'The government got everything they
deserved,' he said.
Mr Prescott said few private-sector companies were likely to bid for
franchises. He claimed that the government would quietly drop the bill, but
warned that a Labour government would recreate a publicly owned national
rail network.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, said he expected at least seven
of the proposed 25 route franchises to be awarded by 1995.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Squatters face earlier eviction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT sought yesterday to buttress its tougher line on law and
order by unveiling measures to strengthen legislation against 'squatting'.
In a move welcomed by shopowners but condemned by organisations representing
the homeless, Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, said the legislation
would allow rapid eviction of unauthorised occupants of domestic and
commercial properties.
The legislation, expected to form part of the forthcoming Criminal Justice
Bill, would replace lengthy court procedures to secure evictions with
provision for owners and occupiers to secure immediate court orders against
squatters. There would be no need for the squatters to be present or
represented in court.
Those who refused to respond to such orders within 24 hours would be liable
to arrest and to be charged with a criminal offence. At present property
owners frequently face lengthy civil proceedings to regain possession.
Mr Howard expects local authorities and high street retail chains to make
most use of the procedures.
But law changes will also answer the frequent complaint at Conservative
party conferences about homeowners returning from holidays or business trips
to find their houses occupied by squatters. The Law Society, which
represents solicitors in England and Wales, warned that the new possession
procedures were open to abuse, with occupiers and tenants only able to
challenge proceedings after they had been evicted.
It said there was no need to create a new criminal offence or streamline
court procedures. The existing system caused delays because county courts
had insufficient resources.

Russia

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treuhand privatisation agency, and a consortium led by Deutsche Bank and
Westdeutsche Landesbank, have arranged a barter and financing package worth
DM1bn (Pounds 400m) for the export of east German manufactured goods to the
Tyumen region of the Russian Federation.
However, the agency and the banking consortium have still to confirm that
part of the financing agreement will be guaranteed by Hermes, the German
export credit agency which last August suspended credits to the Russian
Federation.
Under the accord's terms, Tyumen will buy DM200m of goods from eastern
German enterprises, while at the same time, it will export oil and other gas
products to Germany. The latter will be sold at world market prices.
The remaining DM800m of orders from Tyumen, which is anxious to obtain
equipment for drilling and transport, will be financed through the
consortium.
Yesterday, a Treuhand spokesman said there were signs that Hermes would
support the deal, which is seen as crucial for reviving links between
eastern German manufacturing and the former Soviet Union.
The agreement follows a recent visit to Berlin by a trade delegation from
Tyumen led by Mr Leonid Roketzky, who held talks with Mr Hans-Georg Pohl, a
senior member of the Treuhand's department for trade with eastern countries.
The contract, which follows earlier barter deals arranged by the Treuhand
with the former Soviet Union, is a welcome boost for east Germany's heavy
manufacturing sector which before German unification depended on exports to
the countries of eastern Europe and Russia.

FT  05 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Boeing plans new combat aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOEING is making a bid to return as a leading combat aircraft manufacturer
by announcing yesterday it was studying the development of a new multi-role
military aircraft to challenge proposals by the two main US combat aircraft
manufacturers, Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas.
Boeing said it had reached an agreement with the US government's Advanced
Research Projects Agency on a demonstration programme for the new modular,
multi-role aircraft that could perform conventional take-off and landing
missions for the US Air Force, short take-off and vertical landing missions
for the US Navy and Marine Corps and conventional aircraft carrier
operations.
The new aircraft is designed to perform missions now undertaken by the
Lockheed F-16, the McDonnell Douglas AV-8B built in co-operation and under
licence from British Aerospace and based on the BAe Harrier, and the
McDonnell Douglas F-18.
Both Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas have also been awarded US government
contracts to explore the feasibility of a new generation short take-off and
vertical landing aircraft. But the Boeing concept takes this further by
proposing a multi-role tactical aircraft to perform a variety of missions
for all three US forces.
'We're excited because our work is proving the idea is affordable as well as
technically feasible,' said Mr Mickey Michellich, Boeing's director of
advanced tactical aircraft programmes.
Boeing is also discussing with the US general Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney
aero-engine groups as well as with Rolls-Royce, which produces the Pegasus
powerplant for the Harrier, on a possible propulsion system for its new
modular combat aircraft.
Rolls-Royce also confirmed that it is discussing possible co-operation with
Pratt &amp; Whitney on a new short take -off and vertical landing engine for the
21st century successor to the Harrier.

FT  05 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Brussels agrees big trade concessions to
Moscow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday agreed on significant trade concessions to
Russia as part of its effort to get a new EC trade and political agreement
with Moscow before the Russian general elections in December, writes David
Gardner in Brussels.
Brussels is proposing to treat Russia almost as though it were already a
member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and wants to set 1998
as the date when the Community and Russia will decide whether to establish a
common free trade zone. The proposals are expected to be endorsed as a new
Commission negotiating mandate when foreign and trade ministers of the 12
meet in Brussels on Monday.
The Commission and the 12 had already agreed that the 'partnership' talks
with Russia should hold out the eventual prospect of a fully fledged free
trade zone.
At the time there were fears that Mr Yeltsin might lose a popular referendum
on Russia's reforms. The new insertion of a date is, however, regarded as a
psychologically important demonstration of EC commitment to Russia.
But of greater substance for Moscow is the Brussels proposal to treat Russia
as 'an economy in transition' rather than a so-called 'state trading'
country, such as China or North Korea. 'They want to be seen as capitalist
rather than communist,' a Commission official said yesterday.
Moscow had obdurately refused to be bracketed in 'state trading,' even
though, for instance, its energy prices are artificially low because of
state subsidies, Russian companies still have no market-based mechanisms for
calculating their production costs, and Russia has still not been accepted
into Gatt.
If the EC were to insist on state trading treatment, it would make it far
easier for the Europeans to take measures against imports from Russia than
under Gatt rules.
Under the Commission proposal, however, the EC would have to prove
'substantial' injury to European producers before imposing anti-dumping
duties, and to consult Russia before imposing the levies.

FT  05 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Japan carmakers in slow lane to China - A
huge market beckons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN's carmakers owe much of their impressive growth in the past to the
efforts they put into building up markets abroad.
But, in spite of the setback they face at home and in western markets,
Japanese carmakers have been curiously slow to move into one thriving market
that is not only geographically close but which offers strong growth for the
foreseeable future.
China's growing demand for passenger cars has so far failed to attract much
investment from its Asian neighbour which could risk falling behind western
rivals in the race to win over one of the fastest growing markets in the
world.
In a bid to make up for lost time, next Sunday the Japanese government and
car industry are sending a joint mission to China which they hope will help
pave the way for stronger ties.
The mission of over 60 members representing all the large Japanese car and
car components makers and bureaucrats from the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry, is the first of its kind to China. It will be headed by
Mr Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association
and of Nissan.
The official reason for the visit is to exchange views on industrial policy,
possible future co-operation and other bilateral issues. The Japanese are
keen to get to know their Chinese counterparts in industry and government
and to get a better picture of China's policy regarding its car market.
China feels that Japan has not been eager to invest in their car industry,
says a Miti official. 'But that is not the case. Because Japan is close to
China, their expectations are high,' he explains.
While western companies from Volkswagen to Chrysler have been setting up
manufacturing joint ventures in China, large Japanese makers have been
conspicuously absent from the eight car manufacturing projects given
official blessing of China's government.
Of the three large-car and three small-car projects approved by the Chinese
authorities, only Suzuki has set up a joint venture for mini-car production.
Daihatsu and Fuji Heavy, meanwhile, have formed technology transfer
agreements.
The potential for growth in Chinese car ownership is huge. The market is
expected to grow from 1.1m units last year to 3m units by the year 2000,
according to Chinese estimates.
Exports of Japanese vehicles to China have surged from 20,673 in 1990 to
96,953 last year. In the first few months of this year, exports rose from
7,940 units in January to 21,044 in March. And Japan already has six
commercial vehicle joint ventures and two technology transfer accords with
China.
However, the Japanese are finding China's market managing measures
irritating. One Miti official laments that 'their basic policy is to build
the cars themselves.'
Industry officials complain about political uncertainty and limited
infrastructure. They are also finding it difficult to swallow the terms set
by the Chinese.
Partly as a result of these hurdles, the large Japanese companies find their
interest in new markets diverted to South East Asia, where motorisation is
far more advanced than in China.
With Japanese vehicle exports to China having fallen dramatically as a
result of moves to cool the economy, the mission will be looking for any way
to bridge the gap.

FT  05 NOV 93 / World Trade News: EC prods Tokyo over competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, yesterday called on Japan
to translate recent declarations on strengthening competition policy into
'concrete and effective action.'
Speaking at a Japan-EC competition seminar in Tokyo - the first of its kind
 -Mr Van Miert said competition policy should be used to 'open up the
Japanese market to fair and undistorted competition from abroad.'
According to the text of his speech, released in Brussels, Mr Van Miert said
the Japanese government's ambitious policy declarations would have 'no
value' unless they were backed up by action. He said the Japanese
authorities had to take into account foreign as well as domestic companies
when framing competition policy.
Like his predecessor Sir Leon Brittan, Mr Van Miert picked out Japan's
restrictive distribution system as one potential barrier to competition from
non-Japanese companies. Mr Van Miert welcomed the 1991 guidelines on opening
up the system, issued by the country's monopolies watchdog, the Fair Trade
Commission. But he said they still fell short of the EC's competition rules.
He also welcomed the FTC's 'increased vigour' over the last few years, but
called on the Japanese government to provide additional backing for the
watchdog, by increasing the scope of the country's anti-monopoly law.
The competition seminar aims to bring together European and Japanese
competition authorities, lawyers, academics and consumer representatives to
examine and compare anti-trust policies.
EC commissioners yesterday approved plans to streamline anti-dumping,
anti-subsidy and safeguard inquiries.
The proposals - to set deadlines, give consumers a greater say in cases and
separate dumping and injury investigations - will now be put to EC
ministers. Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, said the proposals would
'shorten the period of doubt and uncertainty that can seriously hamper the
business plans of firms under investigation.'

It is capitalised at Y245bn (Pounds 1.54bn) with Heilongjiang Bus
contributing 65 per cent, the Heilongjiang Import and Export Corporation 10
per cent, and Hino Motors and Mitsui 12.5 per cent each.
Production, initially 100 units a year rising to 500, will start this month.
Hino will provide components such as engine transmissions. The chassis will

FT  05 NOV 93 / US Rethink on Drugs: US tries to break the vicious circle -
Latest efforts to stem the tide of illegal drugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the US government, the war against drugs begins overseas. But if its
measure of success is the quantity of narcotics flowing into the country,
then it has failed.
'The simple fact of the matter is that after spending billions of dollars on
the interdiction effort, more cocaine and more heroin enters the country
today than before the first drug strategy was released in 1989,' a
congressional report concluded last month.
This sense of failure led the Clinton administration to announce a shift in
strategy last month. But the shift - which reduces the emphasis on
interdiction and aims to increase US spending in the source countries - has
disappointed most followers of the drugs issue.
'This is just another stage of the cycle of the international drugs war,'
said Mr Kevin Zeese of the reform-oriented Drugs Policy Foundation. 'It's a
good thing they've recognised the failure of interdiction but they are
chasing the cat's tail. Nixon focuses on interdiction, Carter on
eradication, Reagan and Bush go back to military spending and interdiction,
then Clinton focuses again on the source countries.'
The Clinton administration has tried to frame its anti-narcotics strategy
overseas within its foreign policy emphasis on democracy and human rights.
'Counter-narcotics is an integral part of what we are trying to do with
foreign policy,' said Mr Richard Porter, director of national security
affairs in the Office of National Drug Control Policy. 'Trafficking,
corruption, drug use, economic dislocation, instability and human rights
problems are more likely when democratic institutions are fragile, which is
why the traffickers are there.'
Interdiction - involving coastguard and naval operations and AWACS aerial
surveillance mainly in the Caribbean - has been expensive. The Pentagon,
which controls these operations, has been criticised for wasting millions of
tax dollars and for diverting non-drug enforcement activities to drug
enforcement accounts.
Yet officials insist these efforts have had a significant impact on the
Colombian cartels which dominate the cocaine trade and are moving into the
heroin business.
According to Mr Porter: 'The question is not whether it's been a success or
not. It has been a success. It's a matter of looking, as the dollars get
scarcer, at where we can get more bang for the buck.'
The efforts have increased interceptions, which have forced significant
changes in the cartels' methods, he said. Seizures - amounting to 107 tonnes
in the three years from 1989 to 1992 - have cost the cartels billions of
dollars.
Furthermore, instead of transporting the cocaine in bulk through Florida as
was common a few years ago, they are now forced to make smaller shipments.
But there would be greater cost effectiveness if the traffickers were
tackled in source countries: 'That's the beehive. If we want the bees, the
best place to get them is in the hive. Otherwise we are chasing them all
over the forest where they are harder and harder to find,' Mr Porter said.
Yet, drugs policy experts are worried that such a shift would merely move
funds from one part of the Defence Department to another. Meanwhile, despite
the administration's emphasis on building democracy, this part of the
strategy would be viewed as foreign aid and therefore highly vulnerable to
cuts by Congress.
Furthermore, the attempt to identify a successful drugs policy with
democracy is likely to be confusing. 'It's a recipe for ineffective policy,'
says Mr Peter Hakim of the Washington-based InterAmerican Dialogue.
Though there is criticism of the drugs policy for placing too much emphasis
overseas, only 9 per cent of the Dollars 12.7bn budget in 1993 was spent
outside the US and less than 4 per cent was spent in joint programmes with
other governments, the majority of which was in the Andean countries.
The new efforts, say officials, would build on improved co-operation already
evident, particularly with Bolivia and Colombia, in the Andes.
A senior State Department official said these efforts would aim to provide
increased help with the administration of justice. Help with eradication
would continue but there would be greater emphasis on alternative
development and crop substitution. The US would also seek support in these
objectives from the international financial institutions.
But these objectives are difficult and succeed, if at all, only in the
long-term. Furthermore, eradication efforts - as has been shown in the Latin
American centre for coca production in Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley - have
only succeeded in shifting production elsewhere.
Alternative crops, such as cocoa, coffee and palm-oil, occasionally fetch
higher prices on the international market to make them competitive with
coca. But drugs dealers can always raise the prices they are prepared to pay
for coca leaf to levels which keep coca-growers hooked.
This is the root of the problem. The difference between the price of cocaine
on the other side of the border and the price on the US side means that
efforts to stem supply almost inevitably looked doomed to failure.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
NARCOTICS: THE MAIN TRADE ROUTES
Where cocaine and opiates come from and where they go
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
United States
 -Cocaine market worth Dollars 15bn-Dollars 17.5bn a year: consumption
  150-175 tonnes at street price of Dollars 100 a gram.
 -New forms of heroin show up as Colombian cartels diversify; heroin
  fetches wholesale price of Dollars 180,000 to Dollars 200,000 per
  kilo, up to 10 times cocaine price.
 -Heroin purity on streets rises 600 per cent since 1981; street price
  drops 25 per cent from 1988 to 1992.
 -Some Dollars 100bn-Dollars 200bn a year of drugs money laundered in
  US, the world's principal centre for money laundering.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mexico, Central and South America
 -Colombia's Cali cartel may control more than 70 per cent of world
  cocaine business.
 -Sixty per cent of world cocaine now passes through Mexico as
  interdiction deters formerly favoured Florida and Caribbean routes.
 -Peru responsible for cultivation of about 60 per cent of world coca,
  Bolivia 21 per cent, Colombia 18 per cent.
 -Potential cocaine production rises from 840-1,040 tonnes in 1988 to
  955-1,165 tonnes in 1992.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Europe
 -Heroin smuggling increases through eastern Europe as turmoil in
  wake of turmoil in former Yugoslavia.
 -Europe becomes a more attractive target for cocaine traffickers as
  prices rise above those in US and EC border controls are reduced.
 -Seizure in 1992 of a tonne of cocaine on Finnish border shows that
  cartels are seeking foothold in Russia.
 -Spain now main European gateway for cocaine, with an estimated 55 per
  cent flowing through Iberian peninsula.

FT  05 NOV 93 / US Rethink on Drugs: Clinton's commitment doubted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's new director of drug control policy, Mr Lee Brown,
received a frosty welcome last month when he presented the administration's
interim drug strategy to the Senate.
Democrats joined Republicans in criticising the skimpy document. Senator
Joseph Biden, judiciary committee chairman, complained that the
administration had not 'taken this seriously enough.'
The 'war against drugs' waged in the past four years has been viewed in many
quarters as a failure. Although casual and first-time drug use has declined
dramatically since 1988, marijuana and LSD consumption seem to be on the
rise again.
Hard-core use has barely been dented: the purity of cocaine sold on the
street - an indicator of the supply situation - has risen again in the past
two years after declining from 1987 to 1990, and drug enforcement officials
fear a dramatic resurgence in heroin abuse.
Critics complain that the drug war strategy has focused too much on the
supply end, with more than 70 per cent of the drug control budget spent on
law enforcement and on interdiction efforts to stop drugs arriving in the
US.
The demand end, they charge, has been neglected. Treatable drug addicts
cannot obtain places in the inadequate drug treatment centres, and even
addicts convicted and sent to prison are released without treatment.
Mr Brown's interim strategy appears to answer many of these complaints. Step
one in his document is 'an aggressive drug treatment strategy with hard-core
use as its primary target.'
The strategy cites a study by the Rand Corporation, a think tank and
consultancy, pointing out that only around 20 per cent of cocaine users are
heavy addicts, but that they account for two-thirds of total consumption. It
also argues that hard-core use harms society most, fuelling the wave of
drug-related violence that has ravaged US cities.
Two things, however, annoy the administration's critics in Congress: the
absence of any noticeable changes in funding to back up the changes in
rhetoric, and the lack of presidential involvement.
This year's drug control budget may not be a fair indication of the
administration's ultimate intentions. Drafted in a hurry, and before Mr
Brown was even named to his post, the Dollars 13.1bn budget submitted by Mr
Clinton bore a striking resemblance to his predecessor's.
The White House showed little willingness to fight for this budget.
Officials accepted cuts in treatment programmes proposed in the House of
Representatives until Mr Brown turned and fought.
But the lack of any indication in the interim strategy that resources will
be shifted among the different components of the anti-drug programme, as
well as the absence of any pledge of increased overall funding, has raised
questions in Congress.
When Mr Brown was appointed his position was raised to cabinet level, but
his staff was cut from 146 people to 25. Mr Clinton needs to put more
substance into his anti-drug drive if he is to convince Congress that that
move was not symbolic of his lack of commitment to the issue.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Banks to delay Brazil debt accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL and its leading bank creditors have agreed to delay the completion
date of an accord covering the restructuring of more than Dollars 35bn of
debt. The delay is to allow more time for negotiation with the International
Monetary Fund.
Mr Andre Lara Resende, Brazil's chief debt negotiator, said yesterday the
target date for completion had been put back from February 28 to April 15.
Signing of the bank deal will begin on November 29.
The February closing date implied that an IMF agreement - necessary for the
bank accord to be completed and for the issue of US zero coupon bonds as
collateral - would be in place by early January, which now looks unlikely.
The IMF wants the government to balance its operating budget in 1994, and
fiscal measures planned by the government to do this have been delayed. Mr
Resende said the government hoped to have unveiled the measures by
mid-November. An IMF team due to arrive in October will now arrive on
November 15 or 20.
He said he had no indication if the Dart family, which holds 4 per cent of
the outstanding debt and which has been refusing support for the accord, had
changed its position. Banks holding 95.11 per cent of the debt have
indicated they will accept the agreement, and 95 per cent must sign for it
to become effective.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Moynihan aims to put more bucks on bullets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE great American debate over crime and gun control moved into higher gear
this week as a result both of Tuesday's elections and of initiatives and
actions in Congress.
The House of Representatives on Wednesday authorised funding for a package
of measures along lines proposed by President Bill Clinton, including the
recruitment of as many as 50,000 new police officers nationwide.
This clears the way for consideration next week of the long-stalled Brady
bill, which would require purchasers of handguns to wait five days before
taking possession. The Senate, also putting crime on its agenda, is expected
to vote by the end of the year on the bill, named after Mr James Brady, the
White House press secretary severely wounded in the attempt on President
Ronald Reagan's life in 1981.
While agreement on an omnibus crime bill is far from certain, Senator Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, injected a significant new element
into the political equation by proposing that Mr Clinton's healthcare reform
bill include swingeing increases in the federal tax on handgun ammunition.
'It is time the federal government began taxing handgun ammunition used in
crime out of existence,' he said.
His proposal would certainly do this for the most destructive bullets. He
asked for a general sales tax increase on bullets to 50 cents from the
current 11 cents, with the annual licence fee for manufacturing ammunition
rising from Dollars 10 to Dollars 10,000.
But he also called for a 10,000 per cent increase in the tax on one
Winchester cartridge, known as the Black Talon and advertised for its
penetrative capabilities. This would lift the price on a box of 20 from
about Dollars 24 to around Dollars 150,000.
Senator Moynihan has recommended this approach before and it was picked up
last month by Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton, who emphasised she was speaking
only in a personal capacity. But it was received cautiously on Wednesday by
Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, and immediately condemned by the
National Rifle Association as just another 'egghead' notion.
The NRA reckons it has had a very good week. Two of its toughest critics, Mr
James Florio in New Jersey and Ms Mary Sue Terry in Virginia, were defeated
in gubernatorial contests, while across the country state and local voters
approved propositions calling for stiffer jail sentences, more prisons and
more policemen.
These are part of the current NRA anti-crime campaign which is designed in
part to draw attention away from the issue of gun control itself.
On the other hand, neither Mrs Christine Todd Whitman nor Mr George Allen,
the victors, campaigned in favour of rescinding recent gun control
legislation in both states. Mrs Whitman argued against anything that would
make possession of assault weapons any easier, while Mr Allen focused most
of his attack on toughening Virginia's parole laws.

<TEXT>
MR JEAN CHRETIEN was sworn in as Canada's 20th prime minister in Ottawa
yesterday, returning the Liberal party to office after nine years of
Conservative rule.
Mr Chretien, 59, a 30-year veteran of federal politics, immediately
appointed a centre-right cabinet of 23 members.
Mr Paul Martin, 55, a former businessman and son of the late Senator Paul
Martin, takes over the department of finance. He is a fiscal conservative,
committed to gradual deficit reduction and more efficient government.
A former Toronto businessman, Mr Roy MacLaren, 59, becomes minister for
international trade and in charge of the North American Free Trade Agreement
portfolio. Mr Maclaren is a Nafta supporter.
A veteran of the Pierre Trudeau government, Mr Andre Ouellet, 54, becomes
minister of external affairs, while Mr Lloyd Axworthy, 53, another Trudeau
veteran, is minister of human resources and will represent western Canada.
Mr Arthur Eggleton, a former mayor of Toronto, heads the Treasury Board and
Mr Marcel Masse, a federal civil servant under Liberal and Conservative
governments, shoulders inter-governmental affairs, covering constitutional
problems looming with Quebec and western Canada.
Mrs Sheila Copps, 40, a leading Liberal parliamentarian, becomes deputy
prime minister, one of four women in the cabinet.
The cabinet must address a federal 1993-94 deficit of about CDollars 40bn
(Pounds 20.5bn), external debt of USDollars 225bn, high unemployment,
lagging recovery and exploding health and welfare costs.
The new prime minister has proposed a CDollars 6bn crash infrastructure
programme to create new jobs. The funds would come partly from defence cuts,
including cancellation of a CDollars 5bn helicopter order from Westland of
the UK and Agusta of Italy, but this has raised protests from three
provinces which stand to benefit from work on the order.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Russian military doctrine finds favour with US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday gave cautious approval to the new military doctrine
outlined by Russia earlier this week.
Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, told the Senate foreign relations
committee he had little concern either about Russia's abandoning its pledge
of 'no first use' of nuclear weapons, or about provisions for the
involvement of Russian troops in peacekeeping operations in neighbouring
states of the former Soviet Union.
'In the new doctrine, Russia has said essentially that it will not use
nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states who are parties to the
non-proliferation treaty. In fact, the nuclear doctrine announced in this
statement is not very different from our own,' Mr Christopher said.
'Frankly, the US and its allies never took the old Soviet doctrine as a
serious indication as to what the USSR might actually do with its massive
arsenal of nuclear weapons.'
Mr Christopher welcomed the new doctrine's statement that its basic
objective was to complete the withdrawal of Russian troops to Russian
territory, and said he had received assurances in Moscow last week that the
government was 'committed to reaching a prompt agreement with both Latvia
and Estonia on the withdrawal of Russian troops.
He said US understanding of the new doctrine's reference to military
operations outside Russia's borders contained the proviso that such
operations would be conducted only in co-operation with the states involved.
'In short, Russia must be part of the solution and not part of the problem
with respect to the regional conflicts. Nothing that we have seen in this
new doctrine contradicts that crucial principle.'

FT  05 NOV 93 / Matisse cut-out comes to auction: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MATISSE is one artist whose reputation has grown during the art market
recession. At Sotheby's in New York on Wednesday 'The Wine Press' sold for
Dollars 13.75m (Pounds 9.34m) to the Swiss Bank Corporation.
The composition is a cut-out, an experimental work of 1951. Matisse took
scissors and snipped out pieces of paper, painted them, and then glued the
shapes on to a white support. It combines his skills as colourist, draftsman
and sculptor. The cut-outs show him moving towards the experimentalism of
the abstract expressionists, and this was the first to appear at auction.
Sotheby's auction, of Impressionist and Modern art, its most important of
the autumn season, brought in Dollars 48.5m and was over 77 per cent sold by
value. However, 18 of the 56 lots were unsold, showing that buyers are still
selective.
The main casualty was 'Violin et verre', an important 1913 Cubist work by
Braque. Among other lots to find buyers was a Renoir of two washerwomen,
which sold above forecast for Dollars 4.9m, and 'Liebespaar', a painting by
Egon Schiele of two nudes on a bed, which sold below estimate for Dollars
4.6m, in real terms a loss on the Pounds 2.9m it fetched at Sotheby's in
Lodnon in 1984.
Sotheby's claimed three artists' records, including the Matisse for a work
on paper: Dollars 1.2m for a stone sculpture of a kneeling woman by the
German artist Wilhelm Lehmbruck, and Dollars 442,500 for 'La Grande Jatte au
Printemps' by Emile Bernard, which was much influenced by Seurat's view of
the same scene.

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US factory goods orders rose for a second straight month during September,
and shipments of finished products hit record high levels, the Commerce
Department said, Reuter reports from Washington.
The 0.7 per cent rise in September orders to a seasonally adjusted Dollars
255.2bn (Pounds 172bn) followed an upward revision to 1.2 per cent for the
gain in August and pointed to a rising tempo of national manufacturing
activity.
With the exception of a 1.9 per cent fall in July, factory orders rose in
three of the four months from June through September. Meanwhile, US non-farm
productivity jumped by 3.9 per cent in the third quarter, and a second
quarter fall of 1.3 per cent was revised downwards to 0.4 per cent, the
Labour department said.
Shipments in September were 1.4 per cent at Dollars 260.2bn, the highest on
record.
But unfilled orders were down by 1.1 per cent in September, a seventh fall
in a row in backlogs as companies continue to operate leanly.
Transportation orders suffered the biggest fall in September, down 1.6 per
cent after a 7.4 per cent August rise. A drop in demand for new aircraft
more than offset stronger orders for new cars, ships and military tanks.
Excluding transportation, orders in September were up one per cent following
a gain of 0.3 per cent in August.
In September, shipments of new cars climbed by 6.6 per cent after a 9.4 per
cent rise in August. Defence contractors' orders fell 2.1 per cent.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Clinton joins war of words over healthcare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has joined his wife in declaring verbal war on the
insurance industry association most vigorously opposed to their healthcare
reform proposals.
Both have been stung by a series of radio and television commercials by the
Health Insurance Association of America, a coalition of mostly small and
medium-sized insurers which is estimated to provide health cover for about
65m Americans.
The Clintons launched their reform programme by promising to work with
anybody to achieve universal healthcare insurance. But on Monday, Mrs
Hillary Rodham Clinton accused insurers of bringing the country to 'the
brink of bankruptcy because of the way they have financed healthcare'.
On Wednesday, the president chipped in by turning the catch phrase of the
commercials - 'There must be a better way' - against the association. 'They
tell you they've got a better idea,' he told a rally in a Pittsburgh suburb,
'except that we're all still waiting for it.'
Simultaneously, Mr Richard Celeste, former governor of Ohio and now an
administration adviser on healthcare, disrupted an association press
conference called to unveil a new commercial. Asked to leave, he shot back:
'When you go up with million dollar advertisements, you're fair game for a
response.'
The HIAA, which represents 271 companies, has seen some defections in recent
years. Four of its biggest members - Aetna, Cigna, Metropolitan Life and the
Travelers - have in the past two years set up their own association to
promote managed healthcare, a concept that meets the approval of the
Clintons.
Prudential Insurance, while still a member of the HIAA, has refused to
provide funding for the Dollars 5.5m commercial campaign, running in 10 of
the bigger states, on the grounds that it was 'far too negative', according
to a company spokesman,
The commercials feature Harry and Louise, a thirtysomething couple, in
assorted domestic and work environments agonising over the cost of the
Clinton health plan. Explicit in most is the fear that their insurance will
run out or be taken over by the government.
Some radio commercials not sponsored by the HIAA are far cruder. One
currently doing the rounds transforms a doctor's waiting room into a cattle
round-up.
Mr Willis Gradison, former Republican congressman from Ohio who retired last
year to head the HIAA, argues that its advertisements are accurate and that,
under the Clinton plan, many members will simply be absorbed into large
insurance pools, at a considerable cost to the quality of healthcare.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Japan's stock market falls sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLOOM over the Japanese economy intensified yesterday when the Tokyo stock
market plunged 2.2 per cent, closing below the psychologically important
19,000 level for the first time in eight months.
The fall was another blow to Japan's financial system, already staggering
from the failure this week of Muramoto Construction, the biggest post-war
corporate collapse.
The Nikkei average, which retreated 431.45 to 18,949.79 yesterday, lost
further ground when the market opened today. In less than an hour, the index
slipped 405.44 to 18,544.35.
Some of the blame for the weakness is being attributed to last week's
partial listing of East Japan Railway (JR East), the semi-privatised railway
group. The Tokyo market declined in six out of seven trading days since the
flotation, losing 1,300 points, or 6.7 per cent.
'JR East has almost become an enemy of the market,' said a Japanese broker.
Financial officials and brokers had hoped JR East would restore confidence
among investors, leading the stock market out of the current slump. Instead,
investors were discouraged by the halt in trading of JR East shares last
week, as big selling orders for the stock jammed the computer system at the
Tokyo stock exchange.
Since hitting Y600,000 at its initial trading price, JR East has fallen 18
per cent, dragging down the Nikkei.
Brokers also blamed the market plunge on absence of stock purchases by
public pension funds, which have actively supported share prices since last
March, only to disappear after the listing of JR East.
The economic background in Japan remains grim and leading companies have
started to announce large-scale staff cuts.
The spate of corporate interim results during the past few weeks have
indicated further deterioration in profits, as many companies have revised
down earnings estimates for the business year to March.
However, with finance ministry officials wishing to offload other
state-owned companies, including Japan Tobacco and the remaining regional
railway companies, the stock market may well see another round of public
pension fund support.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Pacific forum may extend role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum are expected to
endorse a new framework giving the organisation a more formal role in
setting policy on investment and trade.
US officials said senior delegates from the 15 Apec member countries had
given their blessing to a declaration on a new trade and investment
framework which would probably be adopted at the Apec ministerial meeting in
Seattle later this month.
The framework proposes an evolution in the role of Apec, until now largely
an informal consultative forum, to the establishment of a permanent trade
and investment committee. This committee could continue some of Apec's
existing work in areas such as customs but 'also move gradually into
additional policy areas such as the comfort level and commitment of members
to expand,' according to Ms Charlene Barshefsky, the deputy US trade
representative.
The Seattle meeting will also discuss a more ambitious vision of Apec's
future prepared by a group of 'eminent persons'.
Their report warns of rising protectionism, the development of inward
looking regional blocs, and the escalation of trade disputes between Apec
members, and urges 'the foundation of a true Asia-Pacific Economic
Community' to head off these risks.
It recommends that Apec set a goal of free trade in the Asia-Pacific region,
working over the next three years to establish a timetable for reaching this
goal.
More immediately, it argues for measures to facilitate investment within the
region, the adoption of an effective dispute resolution mechanism if one is
not achieved in the Uruguay round of talks on liberalising the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Washington trade experts warn, however, that the goal of an Asia-Pacific
Economic Community is distant. The difficulty the Clinton administration is
having in persuading the US Congress of the advantages of the smaller free
trade area set up by the North American Free Trade Agreement does not bode
well for such a sweeping ambition.
'Any talk about free trade areas, much less economic communities, would be
in terms of long term ideals rather than concrete proposals,' said Mr
Jeffrey Schott, a research fellow at the Institute for International
Economics, a Washington think tank whose director, Mr Fred Bergsten,
represents the US in the eminent persons group.

JAPAN'S leading electronics companies are to cut bonuses, an important part
of employees' income, to the lowest level for 18 years.
They yesterday set bonuses at an average of around five months' salary, the
third annual decrease in a row, reflecting profits declines caused by the
economic downturn.
This sets the tone for other industrial sectors' bonus negotiations, due to
take place over the rest of autumn. Widespread cuts are expected, a further
blow to depressed consumer spending.
The electronics payout is well below demands by the Japanese Electric
Electronics and Information Union, for a small rise from last year's bonus
of 5.22 months' pay to at least 5.4 months. Yesterday it accepted companies'
offer after 'the hardest negotiation we have ever had,' said Mr Katsutoshi
Suzuki, its secretary general.
However, Sanyo's company union broke ranks with the industry organisation
and refused the offer, a rare crack in traditionally harmonious labour
relations.
'The tension is high. The union will never compromise,' said Mr Yoshito
Ishibashi, secretary general of the Sanyo union. He is holding out for the
same bonus as last year, in cash terms, equivalent to a small reduction as
measured in monthly salary terms.
Bonuses, paid in two chunks at the year end and in the summer, represent on
average around 30 per cent of employees' annual income. Most workers use
them to repay loans or buy consumer goods. Overtime brings in another 5 per
cent and basic wages the rest, according to the Nikkeiren employers'
federation.
Employers believe that it will be less painful for staff to accept bonus
cuts now than risk reductions in wages, on which annual negotiations take
place in the spring.
'We have started cutting overtime, and now we need to cut bonuses. If the
unions agree to a large cut in the bonus, we might not have to go into
wages,' said Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Nikkeiren. 'The aim is to
start with the top layers of the wage structure,' he said.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Hosokawa to compromise on political reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday called for a
quick compromise with the opposition Liberal Democratic Party on plans to
reform the corruption-prone political system.
Mr Koshiro Ishida, management and co-ordination minister, the government's
chief negotiator on political reform, will seek a compromise at a meeting
today with Mr Yoshiro Mori, LDP secretary general.
Mr Hosokawa has implied he will resign if he does not get parliament's
agreement on political reform by the end of the year. The LDP lost a general
election in July after nearly four decades in power, because of its failure
to achieve political reform. LDP leaders do not want to block reform again,
though a hard core of older party members have serious reservations about
the plans.
However, the LDP has delayed the reform plans, to increase pressure on Mr
Hosokawa, so the process is at least 10 days behind schedule. The government
now aims to get the plans through the lower house by the middle of this
month, to give the upper house a month's debate before the parliamentary
session closes on December 15.
Officially, both sides share the broad aim of the government's proposals, to
replace the present system of multi-seat constituencies for the lower house,
with a mixture of single seat constituencies and proportional
representation.
They differ over the numerical split between constituency and proportional
representation seats. The coalition has proposed 250 each way, for a
500-seat house, while the LDP prefers a 471 seat house, of 300 constituency
seats and 171 chosen through proportional representation.
The LDP's strong constituency organisation gives it an interest in pushing
for a high proportion of constituency seats. Mr Hosokawa must also satisfy
his largest coalition partner, the Social Democratic Party, which believes
it would do best under proportional representation.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Malaysia looks to younger politicians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MALAYSIA'S body politic has undergone a fundamental change following
elections within the United Malays National Organisation (Umno), the party
which has dominated the country since independence from Britain in 1957.
A new, younger and more politically aggressive team within Umno led by Mr
Anwar Ibrahim, the finance minister, looks set to gain greater influence
over the running of the country.
Mr Anwar, 46, was declared Umno deputy president at a party convention
yesterday. Three of Mr Anwar's supporters, all in their 40s, were also
elected to leading positions, pushing aside older leaders including Mr Ahmad
Badawi, the foreign minister and Mr Sanusi Junid, the agriculture minister.
Umno, a party composed entirely of Malays who make up about half of
Malaysia's 18m population, controls almost all senior positions in
government. It is also believed to be an immensely wealthy organisation,
with close connections with many of Malaysia's leading business
conglomerates.
In the past the Umno deputy president has automatically become deputy prime
minister. Mr Anwar has now established himself as the successor to Dr
Mahathir Mohamad, 68, who has been prime minister since 1981.
Mr Anwar has risen rapidly in politics. A former leader of Malaysia's
Islamic youth league, he was imprisoned for a time in the 70s, suspected of
anti-government activities.
The finance minister had been involved in an often bitter battle for the
post of Umno deputy president with Mr Ghafar Babar, a veteran politician who
served as Dr Mahathir's right hand man for many years.
In the past Dr Mahathir has supported Mr Anwar but analysts say the prime
minister could now feel threatened by the considerable power base the
finance minister has built up within the party.
Following the Umno elections, a cabinet reshuffle is now likely. Dr Mahathir
might also choose to call an early general election to unite the party and
prevent a possible rift developing between its older and younger members.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Cynicism and mayhem greet Delhi's first election: Shiraz
Sidhva tests the political water in India's newly enfranchised capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CITY OF Delhi, recently granted statehood after being run by India's
central government since 1952, goes to the polls tomorrow to choose its own
legislative assembly.
The contest, , the first of five state elections this month, is primarily
between the ruling Congress Party and the Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP). Two other parties, Janata Dal and the Bahujan Samaj Party, and
more than 1,000 independent candidates may deny a clear majority to the
larger parties.
Congress, which has ruled in India for most of the last 40 years, is
increasingly blamed by many for the nation's ills. The BJP has increased its
strength in the last five years from two seats in parliament to 118 in the
1991 general election sees the state elections as an opportunity get closer
to power at the centre.
The Delhi campaign has been one the most colourful, if not the most riotous
that the city has seen. The chief election commissioner's announcement on
September 22 that Delhi would go to the polls in November, caught political
parties unawares. They had been concentrating on elections in four other
states, including Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, India's largest.
Trouble erupted last month when the Congress and the BJP announced their
candidates - there was mayhem in the headquarters of both parties, with
disgruntled party members hurling abuse and even a flower pot at party
leaders. Representatives of some factions doused themselves with kerosene
and threatened to set fire to themselves if they were not included on the
lists of candidates.
Responding to pressure from political parties to grant Delhi statehood, Mr P
V Narasimha Rao's government amended the constitution in December 1991,
providing for an assembly for India's capital city.
Though the National Capital Territory of Delhi (earlier designated a union
territory) will have a chief minister and a council of ministers like other
Indian states, critical areas of urban management, including law and order,
land development and finance, will continue to be controlled by central
government.
In political circles, the focus of the elections has shifted from civic
issues like the shortage of water and electricity, to national ones, like
corruption, and communal tension. But in the ubiquitous slums which mar the
splendour of Mughal Old Delhi or the impressive tree-lined avenues of New
Delhi, the people are only concerned about whether the promised housing
schemes, a regular water supply, and metered electricity, so that they do
not have to steal from poles, will materialise after the elections.
You'd think our lives will change overnight if you listened to these
politicians,' says Dharam Singh, an office clerk in the Govindpuri area. 'It
makes no difference which party comes to power, they are all corrupt, and we
suffer for it.'
Delhi's 72 constituencies are festooned with streamers, sparkling lights,
posters, and thousands of paper and polythene flags bearing the symbols of
different parties. Flower-bedecked campaign vehicles ply the streets,
bearing candidates and leaflets, and giant cut-outs of political
personalities with ingratiating smiles loom at traffic junctions.
Loudspeakers at every street corner blare out impassioned pleas for votes
and campaign songs sung to catchy tunes from the latest Hindi films. The big
hit is an adaptation of the year's most popular and controversial film song,
'Choli ke peechhe kya Hai? (What's beneath that blouse?)' which the BJP has
cleverly used to ask Mr Narasimha Rao: 'What's inside that suitcase?'
They are referring to allegations by stockbroker Harshad Mehta, the man at
the centre of the Bombay financial scandal, that he had given Mr Rao a
suitcase containing Rs10m for the prime minister's election campaign. Mr Rao
was cleared by an official investigation.
New Delhi, the seat of power, has always been pampered but the sprawling
extensions of east and north Delhi which have mushroomed over the past two
decades are badly planned, and lack clean drinking water and electricity.
The city's transport system is one of the worst in the country, and more
private cars and two-wheelers have made Delhi's roads some of the most
unsafe and the polluted in the world.
Results of the polls will be announced at the end of the month, after
elections are held in four other Indian states.

The US and South Korea yesterday postponed a decision on whether to hold the
joint Team Spirit military exercise next year in an attempt to persuade
North Korea to resume international nuclear inspections, John Burton reports
from Seoul.
Pyongyang had demanded the suspension of Team Spirit as a condition for
permitting renewed nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA).
Mr Les Aspin, the US defence secretary, indicated after a meeting in Seoul
with South Korean officials that Team Spirit would be suspended if North
Korea allows IAEA inspectors access to its nuclear facilities and holds
substantive talks with South Korea on the nuclear issue.
'Our patience is not unlimited,' said Mr Aspin, but he added that 'we are
not prepared to set deadlines at this particular juncture' for a North
Korean response.

MR Jim Bolger, the New Zealand prime minister, yesterday wound up the
National party's campaign in the New Zealand election, in the knowledge that
the latest opinion polls show his party holding a clear lead over the main
opposition Labour party among 'decided' voters.
A TV3-Gallup poll, released last night, showed National with 42 per cent of
the vote, among that segment of the electorate which had made up its mind.
Labour trailed at 34 per cent. The two main alternative parties, the
Alliance and New Zealand First, registered 13 per cent and 8 per cent
respectively.
However, most recent polls suggest that the 'undecided' element, although
falling, is still in double digits, and Mr Bolger warned supporters that he
was 'taking nothing for granted'.
The Labour Party also claimed that its own polling indicated waning support
for the Alliance - a coalition of five left-leaning, Green and Maori parties
 -in key Auckland constituencies.

FT  05 NOV 93 / India's external debt rises to Dollars 85bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S external debts rose Dollars 3.2bn in the year to March to Dollars
85.4bn, largely because of an increase in loans from multilateral
development agencies.
The figures were set out in a Finance Ministry report yesterday aimed at
assuaging fears that India is in danger of running into a debt crisis.
Critics of the government's reforms have frequently attacked Mr Manmohan
Singh, the finance minister, and his colleagues for allegedly bowing to
pressure from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other
lenders to take on debt which India cannot afford.
The report says the government is keeping a close watch on external debt.
'External indebtedness as such is not an evil as long as the debt incurred
is utilised efficiently. The stabilisation and structural reform measures
being pursued by the government will enable the economy to utilise external
loans efficiently and will enhance the capacity of the economy to repay the
loans through higher exports and invisible earnings.'
The report says India's external debts rose rapidly after the mid-1980s,
from Dollars 37.3bn in March 1986. Total debt as a proportion of GDP rose
from 17.5 per cent in 1985-86 to 40.2 per cent in 1991-92 before falling
slightly to 38.3 per cent last year. (Defence-related debt is excluded in
1985-86 and included in later years).
The ratio of debt service payments to exports and other foreign earnings
rose equally fast and stood at 30.4 per cent in the year ending last March.
Citing World Bank data, the report says that at the end of 1991, India's
ratio of debt to GNP was 29.2 per cent - compared with an average of 37.4
per cent for least-developed (ie poor) countries. The figure for
neighbouring Pakistan was 50 per cent. India is the world's fourth largest
debtor (after Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia).

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EGYPT sought yesterday to bring Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organisation back to the negotiating table after their talks broke down last
week over Israel's proposals for implementing the first stage of the outline
peace agreement signed in Washington on September 13.
Mr Amr Moussa, Egypt's foreign minister, said after talks in Tel Aviv with
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign
minister, he saw no reason why the negotiations should not resume on
schedule next week.
However, in Cairo, Mr Nabil Sha'ath, who leads the PLO negotiating team,
warned Israel that if it persisted with its proposals for only a limited
army withdrawal from the occupied Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of
Jericho the two sides would fail to meet the December 13 deadline for the
completion of the first stage of negotiations.
'We are giving a warning, a signal to the Israelis that we cannot complete
our objective in two months if they continue with this concept. It is a very
early signal to the Israelis. It cannot go on this way,' Mr Sha'ath said.
The PLO has accused Israel of seeking to retain a military presence in over
50 per cent of the Gaza Strip instead of carrying out an almost total
withdrawal.
Mr Peres acknowledged before Mr Moussa's arrival that there was a crisis in
the negotiations, but appeared confident that it would be resolved.
The row over the the PLO-Israel talks may have deflected Mr Moussa from the
main purpose of his visit which was to press for progress on the stalled
negotiations between Israel and Syria. Egypt believes strongly that a
breakthrough with Syria would be a powerful boost to prospects for an
overall Middle East peace deal.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA is unlikely to receive further funding from the international
financial institutions and the Group of Seven industrial countries this
year, according to senior G7 officials.
This is in spite of a strong push by Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance
minister, for more aid soon.
Introducing a new package of austerity measures yesterday, he said the
second, Dollars 1.5bn tranche of the systemic transformation facility from
the International Monetary Fund should be paid by the end of the year - as a
much-needed sign of confidence in the reform process.
However, foreign observers say inflation, at between 21-24 per cent in
September alone, is not yet on a firmly declining trend, while the budget
deficit will reach at least 10 per cent of gross national product this year
in spite of efforts to trim it.
The provisional budget deficit for the fourth quarter - set at Rbs5,200bn -
is seen as unachievable because it would mean cuts to agricultural credits
and other programmes which cannot be cut without grave damage to the
country's economy.
This means the IMF's second tranche is unlikely to be seriously considered
until early next year, by which time a new government will be in place as a
result of elections on December 12.
Russia is pressing for a meeting with G7 finance and foreign ministers in
Moscow in either December or January, to review progress.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Credit crunch arrives for Spain's munificent seven:
Free-spending cities have run out of cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST WEEK a third of the Malaga city council's telephone lines were cut off
for 24 hours. An extremely irritated Telefonica, the national
telecommunications company, had become fed up with city hall's unpaid bills.
Now creditor banks of the Costa del Sol resort are becoming fidgety about
Malaga's ability to service a total estimated debt of Pta35bn (Pounds 177m).
Mr Hilario Lopez Luna, Malaga's deputy mayor and its chief financial
officer, yesterday obtained an emergency credit from the central government
to meet financial charges totalling Pta700m which the city was unable to pay
to a group of domestic and foreign banks, led by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, at
the end of last month.
He also began negotiations with another team of creditor banks, led by Bex,
a unit of the state-controlled Argentaria banking group, to defer payment of
Pta725m in debt servicing which is due next month.
Malaga, the fifth largest city in Spain with a population of more than
500,000, was forced to default last month in order to meet its October
municipal employee wage bill.
However, Malaga is by no means the only debt-burdened Spanish city. In all,
the country's 8,000 municipalities owe Pta2.400bn, half of it by Spain's
seven largest cities.
At a three-day convention of the national federation of municipal and
provincial councils which opens tomorrow, the mayors of the seven largest
cities will lead an attempt to obtain more cash from the central
administration, as well as specific help on debt renegotiations.
There are at least three components to the financial mess that has engulfed
local administration in Spain: the central administration has been erratic
over its cash transfers to the municipalities; the cities and towns have
been extremely spendthrift; and the financial community has encouraged the
cities freely to tap the capital markets.
The total deficit of the municipalities is just 7.3 per cent of Spain's
overall public debt - 'a mere drop in the ocean' says Mr Henrick Humbolt,
the senior bond analyst at Madrid brokers FG - and it has so far had no
effect on the domestic debt market. Malaga's difficulties have none the less
jolted debtors and creditors alike into concern over city finances.
'The banks are treating the cities as if they were a sovereign risk, but
there is legally no guarantee that the central administration will bail
them,' says Mr Jaime Mariategui, a senior partner of Madrid financial
analysts Research Associates. A recent report issued by Research Associates
on the creditworthiness of Spanish cities warned that financial transparency
at local government was limited and that the indebtedness of the cities 'is
undoubtedly higher than the figures, indicators and ratios would suggest.'
The central government, which has seen its own deficit double in the course
of this year, is in neither the mood nor the position to mount a rescue
operation and it is already cutting transfers to municipalities. The draft
1994 budget, which is before the Madrid parliament, sets aside Pta597bn for
the municipal compensation fund, the main source of central government
funding to the cities, against the Pta700bn the municipalities had expected.
The problem at the city hall level is exacerbated by delays in making the
transfers. Malaga's Mr Lopez Luna claims that the central authorities owe
the city Pta2.5bn, a sum which would have allowed Malaga to meet the debt
servicing charges and also pay off at least part of what is owed to
Telefonica and other suppliers.
The Madrid government has however every reason to keep the cities on a tight
rein. Spending by the municipalities was up 15.4 per cent last year on 1991
with personnel costs increasing by 14.6 per cent and debt servicing charges
rising by 22.5 per cent. The cities complain that they are pressed to
provide ever improving infrastructures and amenities by increasingly
demanding urban dwellers - and mayors who keep balanced books do not get
re-elected.
The party is now over and the main actors in the local government crisis
will have to compromise in order to overcome the financial disarray. The
central government will be forced to dig into its pockets, the
municipalities will have to restrain spending and the banks will have to arm
themselves with patience.
Malaga's Mr Lopez Luna insists he has made a start: municipal taxes are
going up by 10 per cent.

THE DRAMA of Italy's Ferruzzi family, once among Europe's wealthiest clans
and now diminished by the collapse of the multinational group it once
controlled, shows no sign of abating.
Three of the four heirs of Mr Serafino Ferruzzi, the group's founder, have
launched one of Italy's biggest claims for damages.
The legal action is against Mrs Idina Gardini (nee Ferruzzi), the wife of
the entrepreneur Mr Raul Gardini, who guided Ferruzzi for much of the time
after Mr Ferruzzi's death in 1979.
Mr Gardini, who shot himself earlier this year after becoming embroiled in
Italy's political corruption scandal, gave up control of Ferruzzi in July
1991 following a family rift.
Mrs Gardini received L505bn (Pounds 206m) from her relatives for her 23 per
cent stake in the family holding company, which controls the quoted Ferruzzi
group, and the two families parted company.
In the suit, launched in the Ferruzzi's home town of Ravenna, Mrs Gardini's
relatives are reclaiming the L505bn, plus interest, along with a further
L1,600bn in damages to cover the alleged 'nullification' of their stake in
Ferruzzi caused by Mr Gardini's alleged mismanage-ment.
The group, which has borrowings of more than L28,000bn, has been
effect-ively controlled by a pool of creditor banks since reporting
financial difficulties in May.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Lira falls in the wake of corruption allegations

INVESTORS reacted swiftly to the growing politicial strains in Italy
yesterday, with sharp falls in the lira and share prices.
Government bond prices also dipped as analysts warned of greater political
uncertainty in the wake of new leaks about alleged illegal payments by the
security services to government ministers.
The allegations, which have been widely reported this week, forced President
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to make a surprise television address to the nation on
Wednesday night. The President, who has so far remained largely immune to
the corruption allegations which have cut through the political
establishment, denied any involvement in illegal activities.
Leaked testimony from senior members of the security services now helping
magistrates with their inquiries suggests that money was illegally
channelled to some cabinet ministers over a period of years.
Mr Scalfaro is a former head of the interior ministry, which is in charge of
Italy's secret service.
Senior politicians yesterday rallied round the President in an attempt to
shore up one of the few political institutions still commanding widespread
respect.
However, their action failed to stop heavy share sales and a sharp fall in
the value of the lira, which only recovered slightly in the afternoon. The
lira fell to L970.63 against the D-Mark and L1,641.14 against the dollar,
compared with L965.06 and L1,636.74 respectively on Wednesday. On the Milan
stock exchange, share prices dropped by almost two per cent.
The latest uncertainty comes at a difficult time for the Ciampi government,
which is fighting to win parliamentary approval for the 1994 budget.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Owen gloomy over Bosnia: Region heading for a 'humanitarian
disaster', says mediator
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LORD OWEN, the European Community's mediator on the former Yugoslavia,
yesterday said no initiative could avert a disaster in the region this
winter unless it embraced a peace settlement, and he saw no early prospect
for a resumption of peace talks.
'All three sides have made the decision to go on fighting,' Lord Owen told a
news conference in Geneva. 'We are heading for a very nasty humanitarian
disaster this winter and the question is not if, but when,' he said.
Meanwhile, a defiant Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, yesterday
ruled out participation in a new peace conference on former Yugoslavia while
Serbia remains under UN sanctions. The United Nations 17 months ago imposed
trade sanctions, including an oil embargo, on Serbia for its role in the
violent carve-up of Bosnia. In an interview published yesterday in Belgrade
newspapers, Mr Milosevic vowed not to 'forgo our national and state policies
because of international pressures and sanctions.'
But Lord Owen told a news conference in Geneva that without a negotiated
peace settlement the war would continue and so would interference with food
and fuel supplies destined for the civilian population. 'If there is no
settlement, many thousands will lose their lives this winter,' he said.
The EC envoy expressed particular regret that President Franjo Tudjman of
Croatia had publicly revealed the existence of secret talks in Norway this
week between the Zagreb government and rebel Serbs, calling the timing
'unfortunate'. Mr Geert Ahrens, who represented Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald
Stoltenberg, the United Nations mediator, at the talks, said yesterday that
no further meeting was planned after the breakdown of the talks on
Wednesday.
Lord Owen, meanwhile, described as 'nonsense' the 'no peace, no war'
scenario some have painted for Bosnia. There might be 'some dulling of the
war' during the winter, but all three sides had a strategic interest in
preventing power and other supplies from aiding the others to rebuild
military strength.
In September, the Bosnian government side rejected a peace plan based on a
three-way ethnic division of the country. But Lord Owen said it almost
baffled belief that so many lives could be put at risk over 'a very small'
percentage of land, which would raise the Moslem share from about 30 to 34
per cent.
Bosnian Moslem troops yesterday marched into Vares, central Bosnia,
consolidating their hold over the region.
Soldiers planted a green flag with Arabic lettering in the main square of
Vares after Bosnian Croat forces abandoned the town, said eyewitnesses.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Belgium urges early active role for EMI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Philippe Maystadt, the Belgian finance minister, yesterday suggested that
the planned European Monetary Institute could start actively co-ordinating
the monetary policies of EC member states with low inflation after it starts
operations in January.
At a seminar on economic and monetary union organised by the Federal Trust
for Education and Research and Salomon Brothers International, Mr Maystadt
floated the idea of low-inflation EC countries agreeing a common monetary
growth target. The EMI could then use this to organise monetary
co-ordination and monitor progress towards the achievement of durable price
stability in the Community.
The minister, who is current president of the European Community council of
economics and finance ministers, also suggested that the EMI might take over
announcing policy decisions such as interest rate changes of member central
banks agreeing to a common monetary target during the second stage of Emu
which begins in January.
The EMI, which will be based in Frankfurt and is seen as a forerunner of a
European central bank, has so far been given only vague guidance on the
scope of its operations and Mr Maystadt's remarks yesterday represented an
attempt to set an agenda for the institute.
In view of the 'rather long' second stage envisaged for Emu, it was
important to launch a qualitative step towards further European integration
and to ensure that the EMI is not perceived as an empty shell, he said. Mr
Maystadt said that national central banks would continue to make independent
monetary policy decisions.
But he admitted that his idea of an EC monetary target would push the
bankers and the EMI towards the 'ultimate goal of conducting a single
monetary policy at Community level'.
Not surprisingly, his approach found no UK support. Mr Christopher Taylor,
the Bank of England's chief European adviser, said the EMI's role should be
advisory and consultative, and it should have only a small staff.
Mr Taylor said the UK was wary of monetary aggregates and stressed that the
EMI 'must not interfere with, or cut across, the monetary and exchange rate
policies of member states.'
Mr Maystadt warned the EC against trying to operate the European exchange
rate mechanism with widened 15 per cent fluctuation margins until full
monetary union. The approach of Emu could trigger competitive currency
depreciation and threaten the EC single market, he said.
He admitted that January 1 1999 was now a more realistic target for
transition to a fully fledged monetary union than the original objective in
the Maastricht Treaty of 1997 for stage three.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Germans seek new meaning in European union
</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE days after the inauguration of the European Union, as laid down in the
Maastricht treaty, the governing parties in Germany are urgently seeking to
redefine the concept.
It does not mean a close-knit federation of states, nor does it mean a
loose-knit confederation, according to Mr Peter Hintze, the
secretary-general of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union.
Those are 'old concepts'.
He suggests the much vaguer idea of 'an association of states', as proposed
by Germany's constitutional court in its opinion on the Maastricht treaty
last month.
It sounds like a terrible defeat for dedicated European federalists,
including Mr Kohl. Yet it is not, says Mr Hintze. It is just a change of
names.
Mr Hintze's embarrassment, at a press conference yesterday to launch the
party's pre-European election campaign, was obvious. He was seeking both to
distance himself from, and yet show some sympathy for, the views of Mr
Edmund Stoiber, prime minister of Bavaria and the most powerful political
figure in the Christian Social Union, the sister party of the CDU.
Mr Stoiber had declared on Monday that the concept of European federalism
was dead. It was no longer party policy, in the CSU or the CDU, he said. He
wanted something more like a confederation, with clear powers retained for
nation states.
The Bavarian premier is articulating a growing suspicion in Germany about
the powers of Brussels.
Mr Hintze wants to disagree, but also, just a little, to agree. 'Mr
Stoiber's views are personal views, not necessarily those of his party,' he
declared. 'The process of European integration is politically irreversible.
Mr Hintze's prevarication stops well short of the ringing condemnation of Mr
Stoiber voiced by the German foreign office. There Mr Klaus Kinkel, leader
of the Free Democratic party, the other coalition partner, rules.
It would be mistaken, dangerous and a strategic error to allow 'regional
considerations' to dilute Germany's commitment to European union, said Mrs
Ursula Seiler-Albring, Mr Kinkel's junior minister. 'The federal government
will not allow itself to be led astray in its European policy by tactical,
party-political and populist considerations,' she said.
Campaigning for next June's European parliamentary elections has clearly
just begun.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UB Plasma, based in Koblenz on the banks of the Rhine, has suddenly become
Germany's most hated company. Since it was closed down on Thursday last
week, newspapers and television programmes have been carrying pictures of
deserted rooms where donors used to give blood.
Police have arrested four UB Plasma workers, including its chief executive,
and charged them with fraud and negligent killing in an affair that has set
millions of Germans wondering if they may have caught Aids from a routine
hospital operation.
Prosecutors yesterday said they were investigating allegations that the
company knew it was distributing plasma containing HIV, the Aids virus.
Public prosecutor Norbert Weise said an employee of Koblenz-based UB Plasma
had told investigators the company passed on blood supplies and products
despite tests showing some to be HIV-positive.
The company employed 10 people and is believed to have imported plasma from
abroad before mixing it into 'pools' with blood from up to 7,000 of its own
donors. It supplied at least 54 hospitals in Germany with plasma, as well as
clinics in other countries. Five of the intermediaries have so far been
identified.
First reports of irregularities date back to 1986 when a former employee
complained to authorities in the state of Rheinland-Pfalz, where the company
is based, that it had been selling contaminated products. There were further
complaints in 1991 and in summer this year the Bonn Health Ministry told
authorities in Rheinland-Pfalz about fresh suspicions.
The State Prosecutor for Koblenz city told German newspapers this week the
company was heavily indebted, one reason why it may not have implemented
adequate tests.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Workshare idea splits France
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French Senate is to vote today on an experimental state aid plan for
companies that reduce regular working hours in order to take on more
employees.
The controversial plan gained surprise support this week from Mr Michel
Giraud, the labour minister, despite the divisions it has caused in the
government and in parliament. If the plan wins approval, it will return to
the National Assembly which last month rejected a similar amendment calling
for a conditional reduction from 39 to 32 hours in the legal working week in
France.
The idea of spreading available work around more people was first canvassed
by a number of Socialist leaders in last March's elections.
Mr Giraud's offer this week to exempt companies from some social welfare
charges for three years is conditional on managers agreeing to reduce their
working week by at least 15 per cent and increase their workforce by 10 per
cent, and on employees agreeing to take a pay cut.
The work-share plan cuts right across party lines. It has drawn opposition
from economic liberals like Mr Alain Madelin, minister responsible for small
business and Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the UDF party in the
government coalition, who argue that it is just a way of 'sharing
unemployment', as well as left-wing Socialists and Communists who want the
working week cut from a maximum 39 hours to 35, without any compensating pay
cut.
But it has backing from Mr Michel Rocard, the Socialist leader, President
Mitterrand, and growing support from within the RPR Gaullist party.

THE number of asylum applicants seeking refuge in Germany last month
totalled 16,660, nearly the same as the previous month, but two-thirds lower
than the same period last year, the federal interior minister announced.
The figures are expected to fall further in view of July's new asylum law,
scrapping article 16 of the constitution giving asylum seekers an automatic
right to stay in Germany.
Nearly half the refugees entering Germany last month came from the former
Yugoslavia, a trend which has continued unabated since the war erupted in
June 1991. Romanians account for the second largest group.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Wave of terrorism reflects deepening crisis in Turkey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE attacks on Turkish targets in Europe yesterday reflect the increasingly
desperate measures being taken by Kurdish militants to draw attention to
their cause.
They also coincide with an unprecedented wave of violence in Turkey's
Kurdish speaking south-east region.
In the last 10 days, more than 130 people have been killed, of whom 77 were
civilians from pro-government villages, allegedly murdered by the Kurdish
Workers Party (PKK).
The deepening crisis has already forced the prime minister Mrs Tansu Ciller
to reshuffle her cabinet, and diplomats believe the latest incidents will
force her to cede further powers to the military in fighting the PKK.
'These outrages show once again that the PKK is a terrorist organisation and
that governments in Europe must now curb its activities,' the foreign
ministry said.
The Turkish right wing was already calling for punitive measures, ahead of
next week's key parliamentary debate on extension of emergency rule in the
13 south-eastern provinces.
The government has been trying to win cross-party support for the new
draconian provisions of the anti-terrorism law. But it may fail in the
absence of a clear national policy on the Kurds.
Mrs Ciller's own party is concerned that the military may use its extended
powers to impose martial law in the region, with the government appearing to
have given up the pretence of normal civilian rule in the region. Ankara
already has an estimated 150,000 troops in the area, and is preparing to
send 7,000 special forces in early December.
Last week, the government announced the cancellation of all public works in
the region, after reports that contractors were being forced to pay
protection money to the PKK.
Basic services such as primary schools have become targets, with television
carrying gruesome footage of six young teachers murdered last week,
apparently by the PKK. More than 700 schools in the Diyarbakir area alone
are now closed.
Meanwhile, local officials are arming Turkish villagers, in the wake of
bloody attacks by the PKK.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Kurds 'launch attacks across Europe'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUSPECTED Kurdish separatists launched a wave of attacks across Europe
yesterday, killing one man in Germany and causing damage to embassies,
airline offices and commercial property in London, Copenhagen, Switzerland
and Vienna.
The PKK, the banned Kurdish Workers' Party, did not claim responsibility for
the precisely co-ordinated sledgehammer and firebomb attacks, but police had
little doubt that Kurdish separatists had carried them out.
It was the second campaign of simultaneous attacks in four months. In June,
Kurdish militants attacked Turkish diplomatic missions, numerous travel
agencies and banks in several European cities.
A document left at the Turkish embassy in London - one of four Turkish
premises firebombed - said the attacks were a protest against Turkish
treatment of Kurdistan and the 'massacre in the town of Lice on October 22'.
Turkish troops shelled the town after a gendarme general was shot.
The attackers said they would resist the efforts of Mr Demirel, the Turkish
president, to 'finish off Kurdish resistance by spring 1996.'
Germany, which has a large Kurdish population, was singled out for the most
concerted attacks, with authorities in 28 cities reporting incidents of
varying severity.
One attack on a restaurant in Wiesbaden killed one diner and injured eight
more. In another, 20 armed men ransacked the European headquarters of the
Turkish newspaper, Hurriyet, in Frankfurt hitting a guard with sledgehammers
and beating a journalist.
In Oslo, a small group of Kurds demonstrated peacefully outside the Turkish
embassy.
Five people were taken to hospital after the four firebomb attacks in
London. Up to 1,000 people were evacuated in an attack on a Turkish bank in
the City of London.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Water regulator pledges to halt price escalation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR IAN BYATT, the water industry regulator, promised yesterday to 'get
customers off the endless price escalator' as he laid out plans for next
year's review of water prices.
His pledge, in a long-awaited consultation document, was welcomed by
consumer bodies which have complained about rising water bills and salary
increases among water company executives since privatisation. But it drew a
guarded response from the water industry and hit share prices.
Mr Byatt indicated that he planned to cut the rate of return water companies
have been allowed to earn since their privatisation in 1989. This had been
set at a deliberately high level to attract new investors, he said. Now, he
added, the risks were lower, and companies should fund future improvements
through greater efficiency or higher borrowing, rather than higher prices.
The only excuse for price rises after the new formula came into effect in
1995, he said, would be investments needed to meet higher water quality
standards, mainly from the European Community. But there would be some
flexibility based on each company's circumstances.
Mr Byatt pointed out that he did not have to agree the new 10-year price
formula with the water companies, but if they objected they could appeal to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The details will be announced next
July.
'For customers, the most important message is that the rapid increase in
water prices above the rate of inflation can be moderated. I believe that it
was necessary to have had an in-crease in water prices. But customers have
become increasingly concerned at continuing in-creases above the rate of
inflation,' he said.
He expected water companies in the next 10 years to provide existing service
standards at prices 'below today's level in real terms'.
Stock market reaction was mixed. Analysts said tougher rates of return could
hit companies with large investment plans, but they drew comfort from the
fact that Mr Byatt also said he wanted to avoid disruptions. Most water
shares fell.
The Water Services Association said it shared Mr Byatt's concern about
unnecessary real rises in water bills, but added: 'It is particularly
important new investment which has to be undertaken is properly
remunerated.'
Mr Jim Gardner, chairman of the Ofwat National Customer Council, said: 'We
fully support the director-general's wish to 'stop the escalator'.'

FT  05 NOV 93 / Germans clamour for Aids tests after blood scandal

<TEXT>
DOCTORS yesterday called for calm as tens of thousands of Germans swamped
switchboards at hospitals and health centres to inquire about Aids tests in
the wake of a contaminated blood scandal.
'The panic should stop. This hysteria is completely caused by politicians
who have lacked any common sense,' said Mr Karsten Vilmar, president of the
German doctors' association. Hospitals and local community health offices
were flooded with telephone calls all day as Germans asked to undergo tests
for HIV, the virus which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Some
doctors said that their patients were postponing operations until they could
be guaranteed safe blood.
The panic followed statements by public health experts urging people who
suspected they might be contaminated to be tested for HIV. Mr Horst
Seehofer, the federal health minister, urged anyone treated with blood
products since 1980 to be tested.
In Lower Saxony, the ministry for social affairs said anyone who had
received blood since 1982 should be tested.
'We have had people calling non-stop and all we can do is direct them to the
hospital departments which took care of their operations,' a receptionist at
the Johannita hospital in Bonn said.
'We can't answer all the calls, there are just too many', said Ms Christa
Mueller-Breitkreutz, head of the local health agency in Bonn.
Last month, Mr Seehofer announced the federal health office had failed to
reveal about 373 cases of HIV infection after transfusions. Most of the
cases predate screening for HIV, which began in 1985.
But fears have grown after the beginning of a federal investigation into UB
Plasma, a German company selling blood. The company was closed by
authorities a week ago. Police have arrested four UB Plasma workers,
including its chief executive, and charged them with fraud and negligent
killing. The company supplied at least 54 hospitals in Germany with plasma.
Norway and Italy announced they were removing from the market products
distributed by UB Plasma. Health authorities in Switzerland said all blood
products there are tested for HIV.
'I would not recommend anyone to take an Aids test unless he or she is very
nervous and wants to be calmed,' said Mr Franz Reigel, head of the
department of immuno-biological products in the Swiss federal office for
health.
A German law, introduced in 1985, requires that all blood products be tested
for HIV. But UB Plasma is suspected of having violated this requirement
because of lack of funds.
Health authorities from the German federal states met yesterday to debate
greater supervision of companies selling blood products and to make sure
information is passed on between states.
Doctors across Germany were meanwhile urging people to remain calm. 'The
chances of blood being infected with the virus are extremely small. People
should also be told this,' Mr Vilmar said.
Mr Franz Montgomery of the Marburger Association of independent doctors
said: 'There is no reason for mass panic. Worried patients should simply
call their usual doctors first.'

FT  05 NOV 93 / Contracting out saves civil service only Pounds 100m:
Market-testing brings smaller than expected drop in costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAVINGS from contracting out civil service work have been much smaller than
expected when the market-testing programme was launched 18 months ago.
In a Commons statement, Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister,
said that market-testing - which puts civil service work out to competitive
tender - had so far produced savings of about Pounds 100m.
This compares with the Pounds 375m which would have been saved if the
programme had achieved its targets. Savings are running at 14 per cent of
the value of the work, compared with the 25 per cent figure predicted at the
launch.
Tendering has been completed on just Pounds 700m of work, less than half the
Pounds 1.5bn target set for the end of September.
Mr Waldegrave said further work worth Pounds 300m and currently carried out
by 35,000 civil servants, would be market-tested in the coming year. Next
year's programme includes many items not completed in the first round.
A 'substantial further tranche' of the first year's programme would be
completed shortly, he said, including the Pounds 250m contract for managing
the Inland Revenue's computers.
Around 10,000 civil service jobs would go as a result of the first year's
market-testing, Mr Waldegrave said. Most would be redeployed to other civil
service work, while some would be transferring to companies which had won
contracts.
Market-testing has been dogged by delays, particularly over the employment
rights of staff whose jobs are contracted out to the private sector.
Contractors have also accused the civil service of dragging its feet and
failing to realise the efficiency savings possible from contracting-out.
The results of the first round of market-testing show that the civil service
has been successful in holding on to much of the work put out to tender.
In-house teams won 57 per cent of the bids by value, and 91 of the 150
contracts awarded where there was a competition between the existing staff
and outside contractors.
In Customs &amp; Excise, just three of the 14 contracts were won by outside
contractors - all in support services. None of the VAT debt management work,
currently done by regional collection offices, went outside.
Yesterday's announcement came amid mounting complaints from private sector
companies bidding for work.
Writing in the FT yesterday, Mr Charles Cox of Hoskyns, the information
technology company, said the programme had been implemented in ways that
undermined the potential for savings. The number of private sector bidders
would diminish unless the government addressed the problems faced in winning
bids.
Another bidder said yesterday that some departments had made it very hard
for outside bidders to win. 'We've been pitching into bidding like lambs to
the slaughter,' he said.
The savings of about Pounds 100m would recur year after year, according to
Mr Waldegrave. Spectacular gains had been achieved in some parts of the
programme.
Mr Michael Meacher, Labour's Citizen's Charter spokesman, said the savings
had not come from improvements in services.

FT  05 NOV 93 / Development aid to be pooled in Pounds 1.4bn regional
package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC AID to England's regions is to be restructured in what ministers
call one of the biggest upheavals in Whitehall's relations with local
government in 14 years of Conservative rule.
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, said under the reform local people
would have more influence over spending. But the restructuring plan prompted
scepticism among opposition MPs who think it could be accompanied by heavy
development grant cuts in the Budget at the end of this month.
Under the reform, six government departments will pool their separate
regional aid programmes in areas such as housing development, education
support and business development in a single budget.
The overall programme will be administered by a new cabinet committee from
April next year, to be headed by Mr Gummer.
Until now the aid programmes have been administered by the Home Office and
the Departments of Trade and Industry, Environment, Education, Employment
and Transport.
The new committee will administer a budget of about Pounds 1.4bn in 1994-95,
some Pounds 300m less than the combined budgets of the 20 aid programmes
last year.
Mr Gummer also launched an invitation to civic and business leaders in
London, Birmingham and Manchester to define what practical steps they may
want to take in the area of urban regeneration.
Under two programmes, called City Pride and London Pride, Mr Gummer said he
planned to explore with civic and business leaders 'how they could build on
their strengths and come forward with a vision for their areas expressed in
practical terms'.

A New York jury ruled that the Sevso collection of Roman silver, valued at

Rock musician Elton John was awarded Pounds 350,000 damages in the High
Court against the Sunday Mirror, which claimed he had a form of the
slimmers' disease bulimia. The jurors said that Pounds 275,000 of the award
was to punish the newspaper. Mirror Group Newspapers said the punitive
damages were 'grossly excessive' and the concept was 'contrary to the basic
right of freedom of speech'. It was granted a stay on their payment pending

JOHN HUME, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party,
said yesterday there would be 'peace within a week' in Ulster if his
initiative with Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams was embraced.
Mr Hume (pictured talking to reporters at Downing Street) outlined details
of the peace plan to prime minister John Major. But the plan was rebuffed.
Hopes for peace were boosted by Ulster Unionist party leader James
Molyneaux, who responded positively to the latest Anglo-Irish initiative.

FT  04 NOV 93 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Danish sell-off
confronts two obstacles - Hilary Barnes examines the politically troublesome
privatisation of Tele Danmark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 8th November 1993) appended to this article.
THE privatisation of Tele Danmark, the state-controlled monopoly
telecommunications group, is proving politically troublesome and there are
still no assurances it will go ahead successfully.
The privatisation is due to begin in the first half of next year with the
government aiming to reduce the state shareholding from 93.7 per cent to 51
per cent. The sale, open to both Danish and international investors, could
raise between DKr2.5bn (Dollars 369m) to DKr3bn.
Tele Danmark is a relatively new concern. It was created by merging three
regional phone companies, Copenhagen Telephone, Jutland Telephone and Funen
Telephone, with the state's telephone service, which controlled
international communications traffic.
The result of the merger is a group with a turnover of DKr15.6bn for 1992,
pre-tax profits of DKr1.36bn, assets of DKr27.1bn and equity capital of
DKr7.3bn.
At the end of 1992 it employed 17,300, but rationalisation is bringing about
a steady reduction in payroll.
The regional phone companies enjoyed regional monopolies, but competed
fiercely with each. An OECD study in 1990 found that both in terms of price
to subscribers and quality of service Denmark was surpassed only by Iceland.
Subsequent OECD comparative reports show Denmark may have slipped back a
little on price to subscribers, but charges nevertheless remain among the
lowest in Europe.
Legislation for the sell-off is due to be presented to the Danish parliament
before Christmas. There are, however, two potential obstacles to the sale.
The first is a European Commission investigation into the terms of the
proposed sell-off. There is a suspicion that the the way the privatisation
is being structured - with the company effectively buying shares below
market value and then selling them at a substantial profit - involves a
hidden state subsidy.
Mr Jorgen Stig Andersen, the civil servant at the Communications Ministry in
charge of the telecommunications sector, says he believes that the
Commission is satisfied with the answers the government has given and that
the Commission will shortly give the green light to the privatisation.
How will international investors will regard the company? The published
equity capital gives the company an equity-to-assets ratio of 27 per cent.
But its balance sheet does not include pension liabilities of DKr8bn. This
is 'a bomb under Tele Danmark,' says Copenhagen-based American financial
adviser, Mr Todd Johnson.
Under US accounting law, Mr Johnson points out, pension liabilities must be
included in the balance sheet. If this were applied to the Tele Danmark
balance sheet the company's equity capital would be negative, he says.
Although Denmark's regional telephone companies have been long dominated by
the state, they include some private shareholders, some of whom have bought
in recent years in the hope of making a profit on Tele Danmark's move into
the private sector.
Their continued presence among Tele Danmark's shareholders has proved a
thorny problem for politicians.
Earlier plans to privatise the group came to nothing because the government
wished to retain a right in perpetuity to redeem the privately held shares
at 125 per cent of par and to impose a dividend ceiling of 10 per cent.
The proposals were not satisfactory for Tele Danmark, because on these terms
it would not have been able to raise the capital it urgently needs to
improve its financial position.
In their place the government, deeply imbued with socialist principles, has
come up with a complex scheme. This aims to provide Tele Danmark with new
capital and at the same time stop existing private shareholders from
profiting from the flotation.
Tele Danmark is to buy the the 42.7 per cent stake the government is putting
up for sale along with the privately-held shares in the company. It will
redeem them at DKr170 per share, the market price of Tele Danmark on June 14
this year.
The company will then write down its share capital by the value of the
shares purchased and a new class of shares will be issued for the same
nominal value as the value of the shares written down. The new shares will
be classed as B shares.
The B shares will then be sold to the public. But by effectively buying the
shares for DKr170 and then selling then for DKr500 or more apiece, it has
clearly opened the company to accusations of state financial assistance.
The EC Commission's verdict is eagerly awaited on all sides.
This is the fourth in a series on the privatisation of Europe's state
telecommunications operators. Earlier articles appeared on October 11, 26
and 28. The next article in the series will appear on November 10.

FT  04 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: BAe near peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another strong bout of speculative buying interest drove British Aerospace
sharply forward. The stock closed 20 higher and only 4 short of its 1993
high of 468p, on above average, but not spectacular, turnover of 3.5m
shares, in spite of recent bad news regarding the proposed Taiwan link-up.
Stories circulating for at least two weeks have sugg-ested that a careful
and unobtrusive stakebuilding operation may have been in motion.
Marketmakers have been at a loss to explain the shares' strong performance
since the end of last month when the stock began to rise from 425p.
The big price gain, although accompanied by turnover only marginally above
usual, triggered stories of discreet stakebuilding. Much of the business in
the shares appears to have been executed by one marketmaker, arousing the
suspicions of the others. It has even been suggested that GEC, known to have
coveted some of BAe's interests for some years, could have been involved.
One leading trader in the stock said the shares have been 'fundamentally
overvalued for some time; either someone is buying a seat at the table if
the company is eventually broken up or bid for, or the shares may have been
massaged for some kind of cash-raising operation'.
There were suggestions that big holders of BAe had begun to consider
switching into Rolls-Royce after reports that overseas holdings in the
latter had fallen back to 25 per cent after the recent rights issue.
Rolls-Royce edged up 3 1/2 to 155 1/2 p yesterday in heavy turnover of 5.3m.

VIACOM, the cable television company locked in a takeover battle for
Paramount Communications, announced yesterday it had lined up the loan
financing it needs to support its Dollars 9.5bn agreed offer for the film
and publishing group, which also faces a Dollars 9.5bn hostile offer from
QVC Network.
Both Viacom and QVC are in the throes of a cash tender offer for 51 per cent
of Paramount's shares at Dollars 80 a share. This will cost each of them
Dollars 4.8bn.
Viacom said last night its loan package, which had been 'substantially
oversubscribed, on very favourable terms', included a Dollars 3.5bn senior
unsecured revolving acquisition credit facility and a Dollars 1bn bridge
term loan.
The bridge loan would help it buy shares in the tender if regulatory matters
delayed a Dollars 1.2bn investment in Viacom by Nynex, the Baby Bell
telephone company. Viacom is also getting a Dollars 600m investment from
video rental group Blockbuster Entertainment.
QVC has already lined up around Dollars 5bn in cash, consisting of Dollars
3bn in bank loan commitments and Dollars 500m of equity investments from
four other media companies.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Alcazar hangs on choice of American partner: Paul Betts
explains the last stages of the European airline merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERGER negotiations between Swissair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian
Airlines System (SAS), and Austrian Airlines are expected to enter a
decisive stage this weekend.
Although no deadline has been set, the four carriers are hoping to resolve
the last significant issue threatening their four airline co-operation
project called Alcazar. This involves the choice of a US airline partner for
the Alcazar group.
Mr Otto Loepfe, Swissair's chief executive, yesterday said a breakthrough
could be achieved during talks in Stockholm at the end of this week.
However, Mr Jan Carlzon, the former SAS president who stepped down last
month to devote all his efforts to the Alcazar project, also warned
yesterday he would leave SAS if the co-operation talks were to fail, in
remarks clearly designed to accelerate negotiations.
Mr Carlzon said the choice of a US airline partner was 'the only real large
question that can still endanger Alcazar'.
The problem has been made all the more difficult because three of the
European carriers already have close links with different US airlines: KLM
with Northwest Airlines, Swissair with Delta Air Lines, and SAS with
Continental Airlines.
But sources close to the negotiations said yesterday it would be 'tragic' if
the US airline issue were to lead to a collapse of the proposed partnership
to form a fourth airline force in Europe, designed to compete against the
big three carriers - British Airways, Lufthansa of Germany and Air France.
They emphasised that the Alcazar airlines had reached broad agreement on
several difficult issues including the valuation of assets, headquarter
location for the new joint company and the constitution of a joint
management structure.
The four carriers have also identified more than Dollars 1bn in synergy
benefits. Co-operation in European operations is understood to account for
most of the gains with the US partner only playing a relatively minor role,
according to sources close to the Alcazar partnership.
Although the four airlines claimed there was no specific deadline to reach
an agreement, they all privately agree that the talks cannot drag on
indefinitely.
'The weekend talks are likely to be determinative. The question is how long
can you spend evaluating just one last issue,' explained one source familiar
with the negotiations.
Another airline official conceded that the four carriers had perhaps
underestimated the complexity of negotiating the four-airline alliance six
months ago.
'After all, there has never been a transaction like this one negotiated in
Europe before, involving six governments (the Netherlands, Switzerland,
Austria, Sweden, Denmark and Norway), and six quoted companies, since SAS is
quoted separately in the three Scandinavian countries,' he said.

<TEXT>
PAKISTANI police fired tear-gas at Karachi airport yesterday to disperse a
crowd of thousands awaiting the return from exile of Mr Mir Murtaza Bhutto,
the younger brother of Ms Benazir Bhutto, prime minister, Reuter reports
from Karachi.
Mr Bhutto is wanted in Pakistan in connection with terrorism charges.
Aviation authorities had turned away the aircraft provided by the Syrian
government to return Mr Bhutto to Pakistan after 16 years of self-imposed
exile, his mother Mrs Nusrat Bhutto said. Officials refused to comment.
'The special flight came to Karachi, circled once over the airport and when
it made a second circle authorities refused it permission to land,' Mrs
Bhutto senior told reporters.
She said the aircraft took Murtaza to Sharjah, in the United Arab Emirates,
where he would board a commercial flight for Karachi. At Karachi airport,
police and paramilitary forces fired into the air, sprayed tear-gas and
baton-charged some of the 3,000 people on hand to greet the 39-year-old Mr
Bhutto as they tried to break through a gate on to the runway.
Police say Mr Bhutto, who had been living in Syria, would be arrested on
arrival. He is wanted in Pakistan for allegedly leading an underground
group, Al-Zulfikar, accused of bombings in several cities and of hijacking a
Pakistani airliner to Kabul and Damascus in 1981 in which one man was
killed.
He was elected in his absence to the Sind provincial assembly on October 9,
and must take the oath before Sunday or forfeit his seat.

<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S interim government moved closer to winning the backing of the
country's national assembly this week when Mr Iyorchia Ayu, a leading
opponent, was forced to stand down as speaker of the Senate, writes Paul
Adams in Abuja.
The senate, the upper house of a two-chamber national assembly, reconvened
on Monday for the first time since President Ibrahim Babangida stepped down
on August 26.
The military remained in real control but left day to day administration to
an interim government headed by Chief Ernest Shonekan, who leads a civilian
cabinet.
Mr Shonekan has promised fresh presidential elections in February, but there
has been speculation he would extend his term if given backing for such a
move by the assembly.
Mr Ayu, a strong supporter of Chief Moshood Abiola, winner of the annulled
presidential poll last June, can stand for re-election at tonight's session
of the Senate, but the mood of the house appears to have been shifting
towards support for Mr Shonekan.
Of the chamber's 91 members, 55 voted for a motion to elect new principal
officers. The vote came at the end of two days of heated exchanges between
supporters of the government and of Mr Abiola.
The assembly is to work alongside the interim government of Mr Shonekan
until an elected head of state is installed. Since re-convening, the Senate
has been preoccupied with political infighting and has yet to consider the
banning of the June presidential poll, validity of the interim government
and its proposed agenda, including fresh elections in February.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Yeltsin lays down the law to leaders of Russia's regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday told leaders of Russia's 88 regions and
republics to approve a new constitution stripping them of privileges and
rights and asserting the power of the presidency and the federal government.
In a toughly worded speech to the regional leaders, the Russian president
insisted on removing from the draft constitution all reference to the
republics as 'sovereign states' and to a right of secession - clauses which
had been part of earlier drafts before Mr Yeltsin's hand was strengthened by
his military victory over the Russian parliament a month ago.
He also said the 67 regions and the 21 republics must enjoy the same rights
and responsibilities - rather than, as now, a bias in favour of republics.
A group of regions, including Tatarstan, Yakutia, Bashkiria, Kabardino
Balkaria and Dagestan, have objected to these clauses and demanded changes.
Mr Mintimer Shamiyev, president of Tatarstan, said that 'this is the
constitution of a unitary state. People in the republics will not support
such a draft.'
However, after a day's argument, Mr Yeltsin ordered a six-man commission to
thrash out an agreed position - while making it clear through Mr Sergei
Filatov, his chief of staff, that he would not fundamentally alter the
disputed clauses and that if no agreement was reached he would push it
through in its present form.
The draft constitution must be completed and published by November 10, a
statutory month before elections which will also include a referendum on the
constitution.
The republics, especially those in most vocal disagreement with the
president, have in the past two years greatly increased their powers in
relation to the central government.
While president and parliament were locked in a long power struggle, the
ability of Moscow to govern the country, and even to raise taxes, steadily
declined.
Many republics - such as Tatarstan and Yakutia, rich respectively in oil and
diamonds - have passed laws giving them prior rights to make deals and
economic treaties without reference to the centre.
In the aftermath of the suppression of parliament and a display of central
authority, Mr Yeltsin is using the period before the elections for a new
parliament to stamp his authority indelibly on the country - especially by
putting into place a constitution which gives him more powers than enjoyed
by the French or US presidents.

EUROPEAN newspaper and magazine owners yesterday warned the European
Commission and EC governments against hampering the development of
'multimedia' companies.
The European Publishers' Council said media, computer, telecoms and consumer
electronics groups in the US and Japan were already forming alliances. They
could corner the European market unless restrictions on cross-ownership of
different media were lifted, the council warned.
The EPC, which represents 26 European publishers, yesterday launched a
report on the multimedia technology which argues that 'cross-media activity
(in Europe) is not only inevitable but essential if newspaper and magazine
publishers are not to lose competitive advantage and so atrophy.'

<TEXT>
GERMANY came a step closer to introducing a modern regulatory infrastructure
for its financial markets yesterday when the cabinet approved the draft of
the second Financial Markets Promotion Law.
Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, said that the law counted as a 'quantum
leap forward' for the international competitiveness of Germany's financial
services sector and was one of the most important pieces of legislation in
the life of the current parliament.
The long-awaited law will make insider dealing a criminal offence in Germany
for the first time, punishing offenders with up to five years in jail or a
fine of up to DM500,000 (Dollars 309,000) It will also establish a
regulatory body to supervise the German securities industry, a German
version of the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission responsible for policing the
US securities markets.
In addition it will introduce new disclosure thresholds for share stakes,
making it obligatory for shareholdings to be declared when they reach or go
over 5, 10, 25 and 75 per cent. At present stakes only have to be disclosed
when they reach 20 to 25 per cent compared to 3 per cent in the UK.
The draft law was first proposed by Mr Waigel, finance minister, in January
of last year.
It is likely to enacted by parliament in the first half of next year.

FT  04 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: BP rise checked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recent strong showing of British Petroleum - the shares have risen from
around 300p since the start of September and came within a whisker of
attaining a two-year high - was halted late yesterday by a burst of overseas
selling pressure ahead of today's third-quarter figures from the UK oil
company.
By the close, BP was 5 1/2 lower at 347p, with turnover of 9m shares said to
have been substantially boosted by the appearance of large blocks of shares
on offer from the US. Oil sector specialists said the US selling
materialised after one of the leading US oil analysts downgraded his 1994
crude oil price forecast to Dollars 18.50 a barrel.
The downgrade, and the subsequent US-sourced selling pressure, caused
widespread concern in London. It was US buying that triggered the upsurge in
BP shares from the 184p level in August 1992. The US buying was accommodated
by heavy selling of BP shares by UK insitutions.
Oil specialists were decidedly nervous about BP shares ahead of the figures.
'Given the rise in the stock lately, the numbers will have to be very good
indeed,' said one. Talk of a possible heavy rights issue was disregarded
around the market, with next spring seen as a more likely time to tap the
market.
Shell Transport performed similarly to BP, easing 3 to 715p, although there
was no evidence of selling from the US. Lasmo dipped 2 1/2 to 137 1/2 p,
with dealers citing the latest decline in crude oil prices rather than
unsubstantiated bear stories as being respon-sible for the latest fall in
the shares.
British Borneo was a feature among the smaller oil stocks, edging up 3 to
217p - its highest level since November 1991 - after the encouraging oil
discovery on Block 21/16 in the North Sea.
BAT Industries slipped 7 to 485p, albeit in rather unspec-tacular turnover
of 2.7m shares, after revealing third-quarter results broadly in line with
market estimates.
Sun Alliance moved up 5 to 373p on heavy turnover of 4.5m, with good buying
from Morgan Stanley said to have been responsible for the performance by the
shares.
Prudential Corp, on the other hand, came under relentless downside pressure
throughout the session after Charterhouse Tilney, the stockbroker, was said
to have lowered its current year profits forecast for the group by Pounds
30m to Pounds 515m, citing increased claims affecting Prudential's M &amp; G
Reinsurance operation. Prudential retreated 7 1/2 to 357 1/2 p on good
turnover of 4.2m shares. The weakness in Prudential spilled over into Legal
&amp; General, which ended 8 cheaper at 510p.
Willis Corroon, the insurance broker, ran up 5 to 221p after the emergence
of persistent US buying of the ADRs.
National Westminster rose 9 to 563p, with Swiss Bank said to have been an
aggressive buyer of the stock.
Drug issues turned the corner and began to recover from their recent
volatile ride, with most stocks staging a rally. They were helped to some
extent by an upgrading in the US by Goldman Sachs of three US companies,
which encouraged flagging sentiment in pharmaceuticals over here.
Wellcome pushed through the sensitive 700p level and closed at 705p - 15 up
on the day. Glaxo jumped 23 to 683p and SmithKline Beecham 'A' added 10 1/2
at 415 1/2 p.
Zeneca, which claimed its Zestril drug benefits heart attack victims, moved
ahead 12 to 768p.
Market belief that a ruling would come today in Medeva's court battle over
the patent for its Hepatitis B vaccine pushed up confidence in the shares.
They advanced 5 to 125p in a turnover of 1.8m. The judgment was expected
later in the month, so sentiment was buoyed by the belief that an early
announcement would indicate a positive one for Medeva.
MB Caradon made further progress, climbing 5 to 341p, with dealers noting a
log-jam of pent-up buying orders following the recent Kleinwort Benson buy
note.
BT 'old' shares rose 7 to 476 1/2 p and the partly-paid 7 1/2 to 227 1/2 p,
the latter in 8.2m volume, ahead of today's second-quarter figures, with
specialists pin-pointing the rate of dividend growth as the key factor in
the shares' performance.
Market pleasure with the results of Marks and Spencer was slightly tempered
by fall-out from the food wars, according to one analyst, who had expected
that the figures would have pushed the share price up more strongly.
The shares appreciated 7 to 403p in good volume after results which forced
many analysts to revise upwards their forecasts.
Good effects from the retailer's results rippled out to the textile sector,
with some market watchers seeing optimism in the supply potential.
Claremont, a main supplier to the high street retailer, strengthened 6 to
353p.
An upgrading by Kleinwort Benson helped Dixons to register a gain of 7 at
273p.

FT  04 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Battle in food retailers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HECTIC trading swept through the food retailing sector as price war fever
intensified. Four of the major players ended the day in the top five
turnover listings, with Asda taking pole position after 31m shares were
traded.
Interim results from J. Sainsbury sparked the action as the company used the
opportunity to announce an aggressive marketing campaign of cutting prices
on 300 of its key brand products. Fears over a price war in the sector,
which exploded last week when a US warehouse retailer won permission to open
an outlet in the UK, were fuelled and selling cut back most stocks. Many
analysts set about downgrading and Sainsbury ended 15 down at 385p, after
378p, with 12m shares dealt.
Argyll Group lost 18 to 274p in volume of 16m, making it the day's second
highest turnover stock. It was also the Footsie's biggest percentage faller
with a 6.2 per cent loss. Tesco dipped 4 1/2 to 195p and Asda receded 2 1/4
to 50 1/4 . Kwik Save relinquished 18 to 620p.
One analyst said that the market had been braced for shock waves after the
Sainsbury announcement. 'It was a powerful competitive move and there is
bound to be retaliation.' He predicted quite an amount of downside in the
food retailing and said his downgradings were trimming food retailers by an
average of Pounds 30m to Pounds 40m.

FT  04 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK INDEX futures moved through a narrow range yesterday, and although the
sector provided a lead for the underlying cash market, volume in the
December contract was unimpressive, writes Terry Byland.
Renewed support for UK bonds buttressed expectations of a base rate cut, but
optimism across the broader range was restrained by a less certain trend in
US bonds.
The Footsie December contract opened cautiously, edging forward to 3,173,
with the premium against cash remaining just under the fair value estimate
of 11 1/2 , which allows for carrying costs and dividend payments. Then the
contract fell back to 3,161 before rallying to close at 3,176, the final
reading showing a premium of 2 1/2 against fair value. Turnover was only
9,810 contracts, however.
Traded options were a little busier, recording just under 38,000 lots,
against less than 30,000 on Tuesday. The FT-SE 100 option contributed 9,165.
British Petroleum (9,165 contracts) headed the individual companies' list as
dealers braced themselves for today's trading figures. Late reports
indicated that US sources were sellers of BP.
J. Sainsbury (3,906 contracts) saw a good deal of new positioning by broking
houses in the wake of a profits statement which unsettled the food retailing
sector. Also active was Hanson (1,431 lots) and British Steel (3,029).

FT  04 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early falls recouped but volume flags
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN UNEASY, drifting session left UK share prices little changed yesterday
from the previous close. The spotlight turned back to the UK company front
and food retailing stocks gave ground as the market responded to trading
reports from J. Sainsbury and Marks and Spencer, two of Britain's high
street retailing monarchs.
London's worries over Wall Street eased as the Dow built on Tuesday's gain
to edge higher at the beginning of the new session. The FT-SE 100 Index
rallied from an early decline of 8.6 points to finish only 1.8 off at
3,162.3.
Traders sounded marginally satisfied with the overall performance from a
stock market still lacking direction ahead of the Budget, due at the end of
this month, from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer.
Firmness in UK government bonds provided support for the stock market's
satisfaction with the Bank of England's cautiously favourable comments on
the inflation outlook. But it was left to the newly recovered pharmaceutical
sector to provide the backing for the broad range of the blue chip market.
Across the wider spectrum of the second line issues, sheer lack of interest
left the FT-SE Mid 250 Index to drift down 5 points to 3,517.3.
The institutions took on board a Pounds 184m rights issue from Siebe without
strain. Hints that further equity fund raisings could be on the way also
failed to disturb fund managers who regard these as a convenient way of
putting funds into the stock market.
While half-time profits from Sainsbury were up to expectations, the group's
disclosure of widespread price-cutting plans increased nervousness among
analysts towards the outlook for the food retailing sector, as well as
prompting a general downgrading of profits forecasts for Sainsbury itself.
Good trading figures from Marks and Spencer were well received, but BAT
Industries gained no benefit from third-quarter figures. However, the
market's caution regarding recovery in UK company profits remains a
restraining factor, and strategists have already switched their attention to
prospects for final quarter profits.
The renewed firmness in bonds was seen as an important plus factor for the
UK stock market, which resumed its upward trend last month largely on the
back of falls in bond yields throughout Europe. A cut in UK base rates
around the time of the Budget, at the end of November, remains a key
component of stock market optimism.
Seaq volume fell to 614.3m shares, bearing out the general view that
yesterday's market lacked real direction. Non-Footsie business made up
around 54 per cent of the day's deals, a return to more average daily
levels.
On Tuesday, Seaq volume of 660.6m shares brought a retail worth of Pounds
1.59bn, well up to the improvement in genuine investment activity which has
featured the stock market over the past three months.
With little news on the domestic economic side in prospect for the rest of
the week, London market analysts are focusing on the data pending from
across the Atlantic. Factory orders and housing starts from the US, due
today, will provide a curtain-raiser for the federal unemployment data to be
announced on Friday.

FT  04 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow retreats sharply from
record level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices retreated sharply from their record highs amid heavy program
selling yesterday as investors reacted badly to further increases in
long-term interest rates, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 35.77 down at 3,661.87, but off
its low for the day of 3,644.55. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell 5.42 to
463.02, while the American SE composite slipped 2.58 to 481.70 and the
Nasdaq composite dropped 12.71 to 772.95. NYSE volume was heavy at 342m
shares.
Although yesterday's economic news was broadly positive - the Federal
Reserve's 'beige book' report on the state of the economy said that economic
activity continues to grow at a 'slow to moderate pace' virtually free of
inflation - it was not positive enough to give a lift to equities. Instead,
investors and dealers focused on the bond market, which posted big declines
once again yesterday. By late afternoon the benchmark 30-year bond was down
three-quarters of a point, and the yield was above 6.1 per cent.
Bond prices have fallen sharply over the last few days as fixed-income
investors reacted badly to a spate of positive economic news which, they
feared, might lead eventually to rising inflation and tighter monetary
policy. The weakening bond market upset stock prices because equity
investors have become concerned that the long bond market rally may have
peaked, and that Treasury yields may be heading upwards after 2 1/2 years of
steady declines.
Hopes for sustained strength in car sales lifted the big motor manufacturers
in early trading. The latest sales data, however, proved disappointing and
the big three car stocks lost most of their gains by the close. Ford ended
down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 63 1/4 , General Motors was just Dollars  1/4
ahead at Dollars 49 1/4 and Chrysler was left with a fall of Dollars 1 3/8
at Dollars 56 3/8 , all after active trading.
Drug shares bucked the trend, Pfizer moving forward Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars
63 5/8 , Bristol Myers Squibb Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 59 3/4 and Merck
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 32 7/8 .
Banc One shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 36 5/8 after announcing the
acquisition of Liberty National, a Kentucky based banking group, in a stock
deal worth Dollars 784m at current prices. The news lifted Liberty National
shares, which are listed on the Nasdaq market, by Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars
29 3/8 . Other banks were weaker, upset by rising long-term interest rates.
Citicorp dipped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 35 3/8 , Chase Manhattan Dollars 1
to Dollars 32 1/8 and JP Morgan Dollars 1 to Dollars 69 3/4 .
Pacific Telesis dropped Dollars 4 1/4 to Dollars 55 in the wake of a
downgrade from securities house Goldman Sachs, which lowered its rating for
the telecommunications company's stock from 'trading buy' to 'market
performer', citing price reasons.
On the Nasdaq market, Snapple Beverage advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 24
5/8 after the soft drinks company reported improved third-quarter profits.
Canada
TORONTO ended mixed after further heavy trading. The TSE 300 index was off
5.6 at 4,244.7 but rises outpaced declines by 405 to 392. The index had been
above its previous record high of 4,255.6 for much of the session, before
losing ground in the final hour. Volume reached 84.5m shares. Golds gained
2.66 per cent.

FT  04 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong and Bangkok
turn back after bull runs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARP reverses were suffered in Hong Kong and Bangkok, although other
markets continued the region's record-setting run. Tokyo was closed for a
national holiday.
Mr Michael Franklin of James Capel said that given the region's performance
so far this year, it was due for a consolidation. He believed some centres
would now 'catch their breath' in preparation for the rally that
traditionally precedes the Chinese New Year
HONG KONG retreated 3 per cent as a late wave of profit-taking pulled the
Hang Seng index 290.80 lower to 9,352.11. The correction was attributed to
short-term speculative activity by investors keen to book some profits after
the market's 25.6 per cent bull run since the start of October.
Among the most active blue chips, HSBC Holdings fell HKDollars 2.50 to
HKDollars 88, Cheung Kong lost HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 36.25, Sun Hung
Kai Properties fell HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 54.50 and Hong Kong Telecom
dropped 70 cents to HKDollars 16.50.
In a recent strategy report, Kim Eng Securities noted that much of the
recent aggressive buying activity had centred on blue chip stocks, leaving
most at post 1987 highs in p/e ratio terms. However, this had occurred in
the absence of any improvement in economic or political fundamentals.
Kim Eng commented that while the current wave of liquidity might well
continue in the short term, there would have to be a return to fundamentals.
'Therefore, until there has been a consolidation of the index at these new
higher levels, we think that many of the main second line stocks offer
better value than blue chips.'
BANGKOK fell 4 per cent in an active day of rollercoaster trade over a
100-point range. The SET index closed 54.36 down at 1,303.39 after a six-day
rising streak that has seen the market advance 18.1 per cent. Turnover
surged to a record Bt36.3bn: the previous record, set on Monday, was Bt28bn
but that compared with a daily average of Bt3bn to Bt4bn at the end of last
month.
The fall came in a market beset by apparently baseless rumours of impending
political upheavals and a farmers' protest march to Bangkok.
SEOUL succumbed to heavy institutional profit-taking and the composite
index, which managed a 15-point rally early in the day, gave up the advance
to finish 2.55 lower on balance at 756.87.
AUSTRALIA saw its second consecutive fall in the absence of foreign buyers
and the All Ordinaries index, down 25 points at one stage, recovered
slightly to end 16.9 off at 2,108.4 in turnover of ADollars 536.7m.
Blue chips to suffer included News Corp, which lost 20 cents at ADollars
11.04, after a day's low of ADollars 10.88. Analysts commented that the
stock was affected by a proposal to issue so-called super voting shares.
NEW ZEALAND finished easier but above the day's lows as the market
demonstrated some fatigue in the run-up to Saturday's election. The NZSE-40
capital index, which had posted gains over the previous eight trading
sessions, shed 4.62 to 2,198.46 in turnover of NZDollars 62m.
SINGAPORE climbed to another record close, the Straits Times Industrial
index adding 3.58 at 2,127.43, with activity again focused on cheaper priced
issues.
The market was led forward by a 70-cent, or 4.8 per cent, advance in
Singapore Press Holdings to SDollars 15.30.
BOMBAY moved higher on buying triggered by false rumours of a resolution of
the stand-off between separatists and the government at Kashmir's most
sacred mosque.
The BSE 30-share index ended 18.73 ahead at 2,630.98.
Local newspapers reported that the army siege of the mosque was lifted after
the government reached an agreement with the militants, but the government
subsequently denied the reports and said negotiations were continuing.
MANILA was propelled to an all-time closing peak by pent-up domestic and
foreign institutional demand as the market returned to work after a four-day
holiday. The composite index moved ahead 94.71 to 2,467.54, following last
Friday's 46-point advance, in volume of 1.2bn shares.
Mr Matthew Sutherland of Asia Equity noted that in spite of repeated calls
for a correction, 'the index never manages to consolidate for more than a
day before pushing back up again'. He believed the market was still good
value at current levels, seeing bright prospects for the economy in 1994,
with corporate earnings far exceeding consensus forecasts of around 17 per
cent.
TAIWAN rose to its best level for almost five months amid hopes that the
central bank may ease credit further at its board meeting today. The
weighted index ended 55.49 stronger at 4,283.34, after touching 4,298.99.
Turnover of TDollars 51.13bn was the heaviest since April.
KUALA LUMPUR rebounded to finish generally higher as investors sought second
line stocks and the composite index gained 9.67 at 982.03.

FT  04 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Equity markets vary in Latin America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Variations in equity market performance characterised the Latin American
region last week.
According to data supplied by the IFC, the private sector division of the
World Bank, Brazil registered the strongest gain in dollar terms. However,
the market remains highly volatile and the Bovespa index started this week,
for instance, with a gain of 9 per cent, partly on renewed rumours of the
announcement of an economic stabilisation plan.
But as Baring Securities notes, for many institutions the risk of being out
of Brazilian equities is still perceived as being greater than being in.
Of the region's smaller markets, Peru has attracted heavy foreign buying.
Some measures conflict with the pattern shown by the IFC table, and there
are indications elsewhere that Peru has shown the best performance in dollar
terms over the year to date.
The approval of a new constitution in Sunday's referendum, says Mr Robert
Simpson, a director of the Latin American desk at BZW in London, provides a
new incentive; while privatisation proposals, expected to be in place by the
end of the year, will boost market capitalisation and generate fresh
overseas interest. A fall in inflation to around 1.8 per cent per month has
also been encouraging.

FT  04 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Amsterdam rises as Akzo
exceeds expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Continental accent switched again yesterday, as Frankfurt subsided and
Amsterdam extended this week's relative strength, writes Our Markets Staff.
AMSTERDAM was surprised and generally wrong-footed as Akzo's third quarter
results exceeded expectations. The chemicals group soared nearly 7 per cent,
closing Fl 13.30 higher at Fl 194.20, helping the the CBS Tendency index to
a gain of 2.3 or 1.7 per cent at 140.0.
Most analysts had been expecting Akzo to show profits of between Fl 120m-Fl
140m, up from Fl 162m. Instead, the company turned in Fl 169m and, said Mr
Shaw Bridges, European chemicals analyst at Merrill Lynch, the figures
revealed that the management had come to grips with priorities like
restructuring measures.
According to other analysts, Akzo's announcement suggested that the bottom
had now been reached in its decline and that it was well placed to reap the
benefits once Europe emerged from recession. The results had been helped,
they added, by a stronger dollar and improvement in the PVC market. DSM was
pulled along in Akzo's wake, adding Fl 2.30 to Fl 105.30.
KLM and Philips are due to report today and some analysts commented that a
set of good results from both could be in store. KLM, which remains subject
to gains and losses on rumours surrounding the progress or otherwise of the
Alcazar talks - an announcement may come this weekend - rose Fl 1.90 to Fl
41.90. Philips put on Fl 1.00 to Fl 40.30.
FRANKFURT registered an intraday high of 2,101.60, but the DAX index fell
back to close 11.22 lower at 2,084.36 after Tuesday's 33.46 gain.
Turnover declined from DM11.1bn to DM8.9bn. Dealers fell back on sector
rotation, moving to construction, one of the few areas where prices are not
at their high for the year. Strabag Bau jumped DM19.00 to DM610.00 and
Bilfinger &amp; Berger by DM25.00 to DM942.00; Hochtief put on DM37.00, or 3.4
per cent to DM1,123.00 and Holzmann byDM38.00, or 4.1 per cent to DM967.00.
Among blue-chips, Daimler reacted to Tuesday's news of a possible dividend
cut by falling DM9 to DM743, but Volkswagen, strongly higher on Monday and
Tuesday, shed proportionately more, closing DM7.50 down at DM400.
PARIS was little changed on the day, the CAC-40 index rising just 1.45 to
2,171.16.
Peugeot generated some interest in reaction to a rise in third quarter
turnover, reported after Tuesday's close, and the shares advanced FFr23 to
FFr669, still some 5.2 per cent down from the year's high recorded in
mid-August.
James Capel remains bearish on the vehicle group: Mr Bob Barber noted that
in spite of a good month in July, when sales benefited from the availability
of diesel versions of two popular models, the following two months revealed
a loss of market share. He concluded that fourth quarter results would be
disappointing, should this trend continue.
MILAN felt constrained by political uncertainties ahead of local elections
on November 21 and worries about the budget's passage through parliament;
the Comit index eased 0.94 to 578.68.
Olivetti tried to pick up some of Tuesday's declines before the shares again
turned lower, down L18 at L1,730. Fiat shed L144 to L1,730 on arbitrage
trade with the rights.
ZURICH survived a late bout of profit-taking to finish at another record
high, the SMI index adding 7.0 to 2,749.9.
The insurance sector continued to benefit from Winterthur's forecast on
Tuesday of higher full-year profits. Winterthur added SFr13 to SFr862.
SBC rose SFr3 to SFr499 in response to its forecast of substantially higher
full year profits.
Swissair added SFr28 to SFr725 as its chief executive was quoted as saying
there could be a breakthrough in the Alcazar talks by the end of the week.
DUBLIN advanced 1.6 per cent to a new year high, the ISEQ overall index
rising 28.93 to 1,849.27.
The market has been driven higher in recent days by Smurfit on expectations
of an improved pricing structure in the US paper and packaging sector. Its
shares added 12p or 5 per cent to IPounds 2.52.
Nordic forestry stocks rose sharply, by 5.4 per cent in STOCKHOLM on the
view that the sector had underperformed the broad market, and by 3.9 per
cent in HELSINKI in a direct response to the industry's price rise plans.
Swedish equities were lifted, additionally, by lower bond yields, the
Affarsvarlden General index rising 19.30 to a new high of 1,443.30; in
Finland, the Hex index peaked 38.3, or 2.4 per cent higher at 1,607.7.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Money Markets: Easier borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CUT in Danish short-term interest rates yesterday bolstered hopes of
easier borrowing conditions across Europe, even though the German Bundesbank
failed to reduce its repo rate by more than a tiny fraction, Peter Marsh
writes.
The Danish central bank reduced its discount and key deposit rates to 7 per
cent from 7.25 per cent. This came after the Bundesbank made a largely token
cut in its 13-day repo rate, at which it feeds money into the banking
system, to 6.39 per cent from 6.4 per cent.
The moves underlined the general trends towards easier monetary policy in
continental Europe. However, the decision-making Bundesbank council is
thought unlikely to lower Germany's internationally important Lombard and
discount rates when it meets later today.
At its last gathering two weeks ago, the council brought down both rates by
 1/2 percentage point to 6.75 per cent and 5.75 per cent respectively. In
its deliberations yesterday, the Danish central bank kept its 14-day money
market rate unchanged at 8 per cent.
In Britain, hopes of a cut in base rates on or around Budget Day on November
30 were given a new lease of life by scrutiny of the Bank of England's
quarterly inflation report, released on Tuesday night.
Although the Bank's economists used highly cautious language in writing the
report, they were generally optimistic about inflation trends in the longer
term.
That was interpreted by some commentators as increasing the chances of a cut
in interest rates around Budget Day. It is thought Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, may announce such an easing to compensate for a tax increase.
Yesterday the December short sterling futures contract - which indicates the
market's perceptions of cuts in official short-term interest rates - gained
6 basis points to close at 94.50. The three-month interbank rate eased
slightly to about 5 5/8 per cent from about 5 per cent previously.
In the UK money market, the Bank and the discount houses combined fairly
smoothly in channelling Pounds 425m to the banking system through action by
the Bank in buying bills. The relatively small shortage yesterday -
estimated by the Bank at Pounds 500m - followed several big daily shortages
in recent weeks which have proved more difficult to remove. The Bank bought
Pounds 64m of band 1 bills at 5 7/8 per cent and Pounds 361m of band 2 bills
at the same rate of interest.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange: D-Mark tends to lose ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-Mark yesterday lost ground against most of the other important
European currencies, writes Peter Marsh.
It gained slightly against the dollar as investors weighed up the
implications of the continuing weakness in the German economy.
In spite of signs that Germany is some way from returning to growth, the
Bundesbank council at its meeting today is thought unlikely to opt for a
further reduction in its Lombard and discount interest rates. The council
announced a  1/2 percentage point cut in both these rates two weeks ago.
A reduction of one basis point yesterday in the German central bank's 13-day
repo rate to 6.39 per cent was dismissed by many market analysts as largely
technical.
On a quiet day's trading, a talking point among European traders was action
by Denmark in cutting its discount and key deposit rates to 7 per cent from
7.25 per cent. The move failed to lead to any notic-eable sell-off in the
Danish krone. It strengthened moderately against the D-Mark to DKr3.9895
last night from Tuesday's DKr3.9990 close.
The German currency slipped against the French franc to FFr3.484 from
FFr3.490 previously, while against the Belgian franc it receded to BFr21.39
from BFr21.55. It also fell against the lira to L965.3 from L967.4. But the
D-Mark's exchange rate against the Spanish peseta was up to Pta80.10 from
Pta79.98.
People looking for the German currency to return to unmitigated strength
gained some consolation from its performance against the dollar. Last night
the D-Mark was quoted at DM1.6930 to the US currency, up from DM1.6945 on
Tuesday. In New York the dollar ended at DM1.6890.
Investor preference for the German currency as compared with the dollar was
largely because of ideas that the Bundesbank is unlikely to cut its key
interest rates for at least another month. Also, some investors are
concerned that tomorrow's US employment figures may indicate a weak-ening in
US growth.
The pound declined  1/2 pfennig against the D-Mark, finishing at DM2.5075.
This followed from a new spurt of bullishness in financial markets about the
prospect for a cut in UK base rates around the end of this month when Mr
Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, presents his first Budget. Against the
dollar the pound slipped to Dollars 1.4805 from Tuesday's Dollars 1.4825.
Reports from the Bank of England and the Treasury appeared to indicate that
the UK authorities are relatively optimistic about inflation in the long
term. This could leave the way clear for an early cut in interest rates.
The Greek central bank's reserves rose to Dollars 7bn last month from
Dollars 5bn in October 1992, the Bank of Greece said. Reserves in September
were about Dollars 6.2bn. The bank has built up reserves recently after
fears of a drachma devaluation abated.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Warning over Saudi output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAUDI ARABIA, which has the world's largest proven oil reserves, will need
to invest at least Dollars 18bn before 2000 to reach and maintain capacity
of about 10m barrels a day, according to a report published yesterday.
The London-based Centre for Global Energy Studies, which was founded by
Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, the former Saudi oil minister, believes the
kingdom will be easily able to expand its current capacity of 9.6m b/d to
the 10m b/d level by next year if the government chooses. But maintaining it
at that level will be more costly, it says.
Dr Manouchehr Takin, the report's author, said present Saudi spending plans
suggested that the kingdom's additional capacity this decade will come
almost solely from existing oil fields. But these will require substantial
capital investment in order to maintain production levels, including the
installation of costly gas or water injection systems.
Operational costs in Saudi oil fields also appear to be higher than
international norms, according to Dr Takin.
The report notes that the need to maintain such high levels of spending,
which will not add significant amounts to the country's oil production
capacity, coincides with growing budgetary pressures within Saudi Arabia,
brought about in part by large defence outlay.
The report says there is little likelihood of new fields, such as the giant
Shaybah field near the Abu Dhabi border, being developed in the near future
because of their remoteness and lack of infrastructure to bring the oil to
terminals.
A growing Saudi dependence on older fields means the country will lose its
ability to quickly make up for a sudden loss of output in other producing
countries, as it did when Kuwait was invaded by Iraq.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Germany insists on farm price
protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN government yesterday called for the EC to reinstate the
controversial 'switchover' mechanism for converting 'green' money rates into
national currencies, at a conference on the crisis in the agrimonetary
system.
'Switchover' protects farmers in strong currency countries such as Germany
from cuts in prices because of currency fluctuations.
'Neither Germany, nor any other country whose currency is or may come under
pressure of revaluation, will accept any system which results in abrupt
reductions in institutional prices and amounts,' said Mr Erhard Schwinne,
head of currency affairs at the German agricultural ministry, at the
conference, organised by Agra-Europe.
The EC Commission froze 'green' exchange rates on September 9 to shelter
farm trade from the exchange rate upheaval caused by the shake-out in the
European Monetary System in August.
Mr Schwinne said the switchover could be adapted to the current regime of
floating currencies without imposing additional costs on the EC Budget. But
Mr Jean-Marc Gazagnes, who manages agrimonetary affairs at the EC
Commission, said switchover cost Ecu350m a year for each percentage point
revaluation in currency rates.
EC agriculture ministers are due to meet on November 16 to decide on reforms
to the agrimonetary system. Commission proposals advocate a move away from
the 'switchover' mechanism which essentially protects German and Dutch
farmers from price cuts by inflating prices to all farmers in the community.
The commission's proposal for increasing the distance that 'green' rates
must move before they are revalued would cost Ecu75m, Mr Gazagnes said. He
also said its proposals would help farmers by speeding up compensation
payments.
Food industry representatives called on agriculture ministers to find some
way out of the current stand-off. They criticised the commission's decision
to freeze green rates in September.
Ms Joan Noble, a sugar industry consultant, told the conference the
commission's action had been 'arbitrary' and ran counter to the aim of
establishing free trade in the internal market.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: State control still leaves
bitter taste - Ukraine's status as a top five sugar producer is in danger,
says Jill Barshay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JILL BARSHAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE'S status as one of the world's five biggest sugar producers is in
jeopardy unless the state relinquishes control of the industry.
Plagued with financial problems, energy shortages and a dearth of machinery
and spare parts, sugar growers cannot count on a repeat of this year's good
weather to maintain the country's largest cash crop.
Ukraine's sugar beet crop is up 43 per cent this year, at 40m tonnes, but it
is still unclear if Ukraine's farmers will be able to harvest the large crop
to produce 4.5m tonnes of sugar before the ground freezes in the middle of
this month.
Only 60 per cent of the harvest was gathered by the end of last week. Heavy
September rains delayed the harvesting by two weeks.
In a country beset with hyperinflation and a worthless paper currency,
Ukraine must barter its resources for imports. With 2.5m tonnes of sugar
satisfying the sweet teeth of 52m Ukrainians, the expected additional 2m
tonnes is primarily sold to other states within the Commonwealth of
Independent States.
Sugar exports are Ukraine's primary means of buying desperately needed
energy supplies from Russia, to which it already owes Dollars 2.5bn for gas
and oil. Ukraine also sells its sugar to Turkmenistan for gas, to Uzbekistan
for cotton and tobacco and to Belorussia for consumer goods.
Since last year's miserable harvest of 28m tonnes of beets, Kiev's
communist-oriented government has been under pressure to stimulate sugar
production. Inclined toward command economy formulas, the government issued
huge amounts of credits and subsidies to growers over the summer and early
autumn.
Dismayed that the credits only served to drive up inflation, the government
was driven last month to a desperate measure: tentative market reform.
Although private farming is almost non-existent in Ukraine, especially in
beet production, the Minister of Agriculture, Mr Yuri Karasik, has now given
beet growers limited rights to make their own storing, processing and
selling decisions.
Co-operative and state farms may barter their beets for fuel to power their
tractors and harvester. Farmers may also process their beets into sugar for
sale to the state at a higher price: while the state still remains the
monopoly buyer, farmers are no longer required to sell their raw product
immediately.
However, beet growers are still hostages of the inefficient state.
Obligatory state orders take 96 per cent of the expected harvest, leaving
farmers with a mere 4 per cent of their crop to buy whatever they want from
whomever they want. Farmers receive a small purchase price from the state
which is rendered meaningless by hyperinflation and irregular and obsolete
supplies from the shattered state distribution system.
Lacking fuel, farms cannot transport beets to storage houses to await
processing. Instead, cut beets lie on the soil, losing sugar content. With
an initial 15-20 per cent sugar content, cut beets lose one-tenth of 1 per
cent of sugar each day they lie on the ground - sometimes more during cold
autumn nights. It is not uncommon for state farms to hire elderly women to
pick beets off the field.
Beyond the immediate energy shortage, there are deeper concerns for next
year when the current stock of harvesting machines, which are on their last
legs this year, will wear out. The Soviets, with their philosophy of
centralised production, decided that all Ukraine's harvesters should be
built at a Ternopl factory, which in turn received many parts from the
former East Germany.
The Ternopl factory is no longer supplied by the Germans and production has
come to a halt. Ukraine's sugar beet production research institute,
SakharSvyokla, has developed an alternative harvesting attachment for simple
tractors, but so far has not been able to find investment for mass
production. 'Starting next year, there will be a problem. In the 1994-95
season, there will be a grave deficiency of machinery,' says a SakharSvyokla
analyst.
In addition trucks and clumsy sorting machines lead to unnecessary losses
from transportation and sorting, amounting to 3.5 per cent of the harvest.
The final blow to the Ukrainian sugar industry could come from Russia, which
is contemplating imposing a 100 per cent customs duty on sugar imports to
promote its own faltering sugar industry.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Biffex takes first step in
revamp
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE BALTIC Freight Index, which provides the basis for the Biffex freight
futures contract traded on the London Commodity Exchange, was adjusted
yesterday to exclude some smaller ship sizes.
The weightings of some shipping routes included in the index were also
increased.
Mr Philippe van den Abeele, Biffex marketing director, said the shipping
market wanted the change to the index 'to provide a closer relationship
between the BFI and a more specific sector of the dry bulk shipping market'.
He said the change would streamline the index as a first step towards
revamping the futures contract, which has seen volume drift down to an
average of 200 lots a day.
Mr van den Abeele, who took up his appointment this week, is on six months'
secondment from Clarkson Wolff, the shipping futures firm. He hopes to
increase volume in the contract to 500 lots a day by the end of next year.
The changes to the index were announced in January and came into force
yesterday.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec optimistic as oil prices
fluctuate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL PRICES fluctuated widely yesterday although traders were at a loss to
point to any single factor which was unsettling the markets. Brent Blend for
December fell at one point to Dollars 15.60 a barrel before recovering in
late London trading to Dollars 16.20.
The uncertainty in the markets prompted optimistic comments from officials
of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Mr Jean Ping, Opec
president and energy minister of Gabon, said the September agreement to keep
the production ceiling at 24.52m barrels a day was being maintained and
should lead to stronger prices by the middle of November.
A survey by the Reuters news agency completed on Tuesday estimated Opec's
October production at 24.67m b/d, a level which most analysts say should not
substantially undermine prices.
But one oil company trader in London yesterday still saw 'more reasons for
prices to go down than up'. He said that although Opec members appeared to
be abiding by the agreement, the over-production which had previously
plagued the organisation had been replaced by sharply increased North Sea
production, which at 500,000-600,000 barrels a day was equivalent to a
'mini-Opec state coming onstream'.
Opec ministers counted on the onset of the northern hemisphere winter to
boost demand and prices when they set the latest quota. But analysts said
there were so far few signs of that demand materialising.
Mr Jeremy Hudson, research director at Lehman Brothers Securities in London,
cited statistics showing that US demand for refined products fell by 1.5 per
cent in October despite growing signs of stronger economic recovery. Demand
estimates for Europe and Japan were 'being consistently chipped away'. He
said the market volatility could be seen as a return to 'normal' conditions
after 18 months of relative stability.
Another factor continuing to worry traders is the prospect that Iraq will
reach agreement with the United Nations on the resumption of oil exports.
There is little possibility of Iraqi oil finding its way on to international
markets until well into 1994, but it is 'a terrible uncertainty' which is
unsettling the markets, according to Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the energy
desk at Smith Barney in London.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: W Europe gas needs 'to rise
60%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN EUROPE'S demand for natural gas is forecast to rise to 400bn cubic
metres by 2010 from 250 bcm in 1990, according to Statoil, the Norwegian
state oil company.
Mr Peter Mellbye, Statoil's president of natural gas, said Eastern Europe
would require about 100 bcm of gas on top of the west's 400 bcm. But he said
that if Europe's current economic climate continued, his projection would be
too optimistic.
Presenting the forecast at a gas conference in Brussels, Mr Mellbye said
Norway's gas export commitments to Europe would increase rapidly over coming
years, reaching a plateau of 51 bcm annually, nearly double the current
annual export level of 27 bcm.
'Gas delivered to Europe covered by Norway's Troll sales agreement will
reach a plateau level of 18 bcm annually around the year 2000 and be
sustained for 20 years.'
Mr Mellbye's forecast assumed annual European gross domestic product growth
rates at about 2-3 per cent, Brent blend reference oil prices at Dollars 20
a barrel, low inflation and stable exchange rates, and also that gas
sustained its current competitive position against alternative fuels.
He said the European demand forecast was driven mainly by economic growth,
which would lead to increased gas demand in the industrial and residential
sectors.
An implicit result of Statoil's forecast assumptions is that gas will
continue to capture market shares from competing fuels. 'Until now, this
process has been most harmful to the market for fuels, heavy fuel in
particular,' Mr Mellbye said.
'There seem to be new opportunities emerging for gas suppliers after the
turn of the century. A substantial part of the growth in future demand (for
gas) is forecast to materialise in (Europe's) southern markets,' markets
farthest away from Norway's gas resources.

The wool market has continued to show strength. Offerings at auction have
been fully cleared, prices have tended to move gradually higher in
Australia, and in other wool producing markets more sporadic sales have seen
sharper increases. The industry is now firmly convinced that the lowest
point of this wool market has been passed. Sales from the Australian wool
stockpile, at premium prices, have also increased. Buyers further down the
line in the industry have been more active. The AWC market indicator touched
500 cents on November 2, from an April low point of 381c/kg.

Precious metals remained range-bound in thin trading yesterday and continued
to consolidate after the recent sell-off. GOLD closed in London at Dollars
364.45 a troy ounce, up Dollars 3.45. 'Volumes are very light and there's
not enough momentum to break out of the recent range,' one dealer said. Gold
was expected to fluctuate between Dollars 360 and Dollars 365 in largely
professional trading, with the price still too high to attract solid
physical demand but too low to cause producer selling. Some dealers said US
funds could still liquidate long positions, making gold vulnerable to
further falls. SILVER firmed slightly to close in London at Dollars 4.245 an
ounce, up 4.5 cents, after attracting light US buying. Dealers suggested the
silver market may be re-evaluating the effect of Xerox's development of a
new type of silverless film. Trading was extremely slow on the London Metal
Exchange and markets ended mixed. After November traded option declarations
passed smoothly in the morning, some technical resistance came into play
during the afternoon, when COPPER and ALUMINIUM fell back.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Futures firm fined Dollars 2m
for hiding cattle trades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO, ABIDJAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US government has fined a prominent Memphis futures trading firm Dollars
2.22m for concealing the fact that it controlled huge blocks of orders in
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's live cattle futures pits during most of
1991.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission stopped short of barring the
company from trading, an act that analysts say could have dealt a death blow
to the CME cattle contract.
In an administrative complaint, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
said McVean Trading and Investments, under the direction of its officers,
doctored reports it sent to the CME and the CFTC to disguise the fact that
it consistently controlled as much as 25 per cent of the open positions in
the cattle market for a period of at least a year.
The exchange and the CFTC impose strict limits on the size of any individual
position in US futures markets, to avoid the danger of market manipulation.
The CFTC complaint said McVean's positions were sometimes 10 times the
allowable limits.
The company maintained those positions by falsely reporting ownership of
trades and trading accounts, both of which violate CME rules.
Although the agency did not accuse McVean of market manipulation, the
extremely large positions detailed in the CFTC's complaints were taken
during a rally in the cattle market, and were often concentrated in
contracts that were close to delivery, when volume is relatively thin.
The complaint, which McVean and six of its officers and employees chose to
settle without admitting or denying responsibility, highlights a dilemma
facing the CME and, to a lesser extent, the CFTC.
The CME detected the McVean's bogus accounting and issued a 'cease and
desist' warning in February, but failed to take stronger action despite the
threat these very large positions might have posed to market integrity.
Barring McVean from the market could have weakened a product the exchange
has been doing its best to preserve. Live cattle is the CME's biggest
agricultural contract, but has gradually been losing volume.
The loss of what traders call a 'major player' such as McVean would have
reduced liquidity and market viability.
'I don't like to hear about these things, because I am concerned about the
sanctity of the contract,' said one long-time livestock analyst. 'However, I
wouldn't be happy if it forced McVean out of the market. They add volume.'
The CME said only that it co-operated with the CFTC. McVean is a
family-owned futures firm, which manages about Dollars 75m in customer
accounts as well as its own positions.
Cocoa producers called on the European Community to abandon a plan to allow
more non-cocoa fat in chocolate and urged Indonesia to join production
management efforts, Reuter reports from Abidjan.
The head of the Cameroon delegation to the Cocoa Producers Alliance said if
the EC allowed more non-cocoa fat in chocolate it could lead to a fall of
200,000 tonnes of cocoa a year in the European market.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: Long-dated US Treasuries slip on lack of
support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LONG-DATED US bond prices continued to decline as investors and dealers sold
in reaction to news of improving economic growth.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/4 at 101
13/16 , yielding 6.112 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note rose
1/32 to 99 1/2 , yielding 4.123 per cent.
After posting big declines earlier in the week on news of a strengthening
economy, prices opened little changed but the absence of any buyers in early
trading meant longer-dated prices soon slipped lower on lack of support.
Traders said activity was light, with investors mostly on the sidelines
until the Treasury announced the breakdown of its November refunding round.
Trading was also hamstrung by the unwillingness of participants to get too
involved ahead of the October jobs report, due tomorrow.
In the event, the refunding announcement passed with little excitement, and
longer-dated prices actually recovered slightly after the big three car
makers announced weaker than expected sales figures.
THE GERMAN bond market ended little changed, after the Bundesbank
disappointed traders by reducing the minimum repo rate by just one basis
point. German traders had been hoping for at least a three basis point cut.
The lowest accepted rate for 13-day funds dropped to 6.39 per cent after
last week's 6.40 per cent.
'The Bundesbank is not going to cut rates aggressively, and traders have to
come to terms with that,' said one analyst.
The market's uninspiring performance yesterday, following a rally in the
last few days, gave other European markets a chance to regain some ground.
ITALY was the day's star performer, with bond futures up a full point. Bond
prices recovered some, but not all, of the ground they have lost in the last
week.
'Short-term budget concerns are fading and long-term political concerns are
on hold,' said Mr Kit Jukes, an international economist at SG Warburg, who
added that political concerns are bound to resurface later.
DANISH bond prices rose about  1/4 point, following a  1/4 point cut in the
discount rate to 7 per cent. Dealers are expecting a repo rate cut to follow
today.
The rate cut helped renew hopes that further easing elsewhere in Europe is
on the way.
FRENCH bonds ended virtually unchanged, failing make up any ground against
Germany, ahead of today's auction of the French Treasury's new benchmark
10-year bond.
Dealers said the Danish rate cut had added to frustration over the French
government's failure to cut rates.
'The franc is relatively strong,' said Ms Marie Owens-Thomsen, international
strategist at Midland Global Markets.
'There is plenty of scope for the French authorities to move without even
beginning to assert an independent policy (from the Germans).'
She believes that there is 'a distinct possibility' of a rate cut next week,
but warns that, while the short end of the market stands to benefit,
long-dated bonds are not likely to gain much ground.
'People are starting to lock in profits (on the long end of the bond
market), as we move into the end of year,' she said, causing the yield curve
to steepen.
SWEDISH bond yields fell 10 - 15 basis points yesterday, as traders welcomed
the appointment of Mr Urban Baeckstroem as governor of the Swedish central
bank, the Riksbank.
Mr Baeckstroem, who takes office at the start of next year, is viewed as
favouring faster interest rate reductions than the current central bank
governor, Mr Bengt Dennis. Swedish money market rates also fell on the news.
GILT prices ended more than  1/4 point higher yesterday, encouraged by the
stronger US Treasuries market.
Tuesday's Bank of England inflation report suggesting a potential rise in
inflation beyond the government's targets had little impact on the market.
Dealers said that the report did not rule out further easing of rates around
the time of the Budget on November 30.

FT  04 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Banker calls for more
supervision of derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AP-DJ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MARKETS in derivatives products require greater scrutiny, according to Mr
Hans Georg Fabritius, the vice president of the Deutsche Bundesbank's
regional bank in Hesse, AP-DJ reports from Frankfurt.
Mr Fabritius called for international harmonisation of supervisory
guidelines in light of the globalisation of markets. Greater transparency
also is needed, he said.
Derivatives have been the focus of several recent high profile reports,
notably a critical appraisal by the Bundesbank itself.
'For me, there's no question that the controls and supervision must be
increased,' Mr Fabritius said. Non-binding recommendations for market
participants aren't enough. Market transparency, which is 'more than
unsatisfactory' in Germany, also must be improved, he said.
Annual reports published by German banks offer essentially no description of
an institution's activities in the derivatives market, he said.
'The banks should contribute to improving market transparency out of
self-interest and which would allow them to better gauge and steer
counter-party risk,' he said.
Netting, the process of offsetting transactions against each other, has yet
to be regulated on an international basis, Mr Fabritius said. In Germany,
for example, it's not clear how netting would be treated in bankruptcy
cases.
While noting that netting diminishes individual counter-party risk, he
argued that it does free up equity, thereby permitting further derivatives
transactions.
The question of determining overall market risk depends in large part on
whether derivatives are a stabilising or destabilising factor in the
markets, he said. Although they are considered neutral in theory, that has
not always been confirmed in practice.
Although derivatives do improve the transfer of risk from the more
risk-adverse to those willing to take on risk, there are signs that
derivatives are used more for trading gains or speculative purposes than to
hedge risk, he said. In that way, they become fresh sources of risk.
One sign of this is that swap transactions between traders outweigh
agreements involving end users, Mr Fabritius said. Some also consider high
levels of open interest in the futures markets as an indication of large
speculative trades.

Slaski flotation
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND's fledgling capital market faced a major challenge yesterday with the
opening of subscriptions for 30 per cent of Bank Slaski, the big state owned
bank.
The flotation, worth 1,395bn zlotys (Dollars 69m), follows the bank's recent
failure to attract a strategic partner. Last week the finance ministry
cancelled a tender for 45 per cent of the bank after failing to receive an
offer for the 20 per cent open to a major foreign bank investor. The
ministry says it is continuing to search for a partner.
Bank Slaski, which has a loan portfolio weighted towards the country's
chemical, steel and coal industries, reported a gross profit of 735bn zlotys
for the first six months of this year on a balance sheet worth 33,147bn
zlotys.
The current stock market issue, open to both foreign and domestic investors,
is for between 5 and 5,000 shares at a price of 500,000 zlotys each. It
gives Bank Slaski a price-earnings ratio of around 3.5 compared with a range
of 17 to 29.5 for the other three banks listed on the Warsaw exchange.

FT  04 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Generous pricing ensures a good
reception for Catalonia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RELATIVELY generous pricing ensured a good reception yesterday for the first
international bond offering from Catalonia, one of Spain's richest
autonomous regions.
The success of the FFr1bn offering of 10-year Eurobonds bodes well for the
forthcoming issue from the Spanish region of Andalucia, which is expected to
launch a FFr1.3bn offering of 10-year Eurobonds on November 15.
Catalonia's Eurobonds were priced to yield 35 basis points over the 6 3/4
per cent French government OAT due 2003. The yield spread came at the top
end of market expectations of 30 to 35 basis points.
Lead manager CCF said that investors had been pleasantly surprised by the
yield on the bonds but Catalonia had still achieved a spread equal to or
less than those on outstanding French franc Eurobonds issued by the Kingdom
of Spain.
Mr Xavier Ruiz del Portal, Catalonia's director of finance, said the all-in
cost of the offering was 6.47 per cent and that by the end of the day,
around 60 per cent of the bonds had been placed with investors.
Speaking from Barcelona, Mr Ruiz del Portal said: 'This shows that the bonds
have been priced at the right level.' He added that Catalonia was likely to
make an early return to the Eurobond market as a result of the success of
yesterday's debut offering.
CCF said retail demand for Catalonia's bonds had exceeded expectations. Of
the bonds sold, more than a third were placed with retail investors, high
net worth individuals in particular, and the remainder with institutions.
When the bonds were freed to trade, they eased from their fixed re-offer
price of 98.773 to 98.63 bid. However, the spread remained at 35 basis
points, reflecting CCF's commitment to keeping the spread intact.
Wood Gundy launched a CDollars 300m issue of 15-year Eurobonds backed by
high-coupon Canadian government bonds. The offering was designed to tap
investor demand for long-dated Canadian dollar paper.
The bonds were priced to yield 50 basis points over the 7 1/2 per cent
Canadian treasury due 2003 and 35 basis points over the interpolated 15-year
area of the yield curve.
Wood Gundy said that similar offerings had been launched in the US, Canada
and Euro-lira markets in the past year. It expected the structure to be
adopted in other bond markets where high-coupon government bonds are trading
at a substantial premium to their par value.
Investors are unwilling to buy such bonds because of their intrinsic capital
loss. However, by stripping the coupons from the bonds and placing them in a
special purpose vehicle, banks can re-package them as new bonds which can
then be sold on to investors.
Elsewhere, the downward spiral in yields continued in the Swiss foreign bond
market as Elf, the French oil giant, raised SFr125m through an issue of
eight-year bonds with a coupon of 4.125 per cent. Syndicate managers said it
would not be long before a borrower with a triple-A rating launched an
offering of bonds with a 4 per cent coupon.

TNT, the troubled Australian transportation group, yesterday told
shareholders that it made a loss after tax and abnormal items of ADollars
33.2m (USDollars 22.4m) in its first quarter to end-September. In the
corresponding quarter of 1992, the group reported a ADollars 65.1m deficit.
The red ink in the latest three months, however, was mainly due to abnormal
charges, which totalled ADollars 35m, compared with ADollars 49m a year ago.
These, the company said at its annual meeting in Sydney, were 'almost
wholly' due to unrealised foreign exchange losses incurred by the Ansett
airline group. Ansett, a predominantly domestic carrier, is owned jointly by
TNT and Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation.
On a consolidated basis - that is, excluding companies in which TNT holds no
more than a 50 per cent interest - there was a small ADollars 43.6m profit,
compared with a ADollars 44m loss in the first quarter of 1992. Meanwhile,
ahead of abnormal items and tax, TNT made a first-quarter profit of ADollars
23.4m, up from just ADollars 2m last time.
Mr Fred Millar, TNT's chairman, told shareholders that results from many
parts of the group were improving. However, TNT admitted that a couple of
trouble spots continue to dog the group - notably the Spanish business,
where the first-quarter loss was larger than last year and worse than
budget, and GD Express Worldwide, owned jointly by TNT and five national
post offices. The latter, said Mr Millar, has budgeted to halve its 1992/3
loss in the current year and reach break-even by mid-1995.
At the lengthy annual meeting, directors faced tough questioning from some
shareholders, although many seemed supportive of the board's current
strategy.
Mr Millar added that the group hoped to be able to announce new board
appointments by early 1994; it lost six members this summer, when a
boardroom split occurred, and Sir Peter Abeles - along with a band of
directors who backed him - severed ties with the company he built up.

business, writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco.
Technology Service Solutions will provide services to owners of IBM
workstations, personal computers and point-of-sale products used in shops.
The business is expected to employ about 3,000 technicians, many of whom
will be transfered from IBM, and will be based in Valley Forge,
Pennsylvania.
The venture builds on an existing relationship between IBM and Kodak for the
service of terminals located in shops.

LION NATHAN is looking to Asia for growth opportunities and is not planning
further acquisitions in either Australia or New Zealand, the brewer's chief
executive, Mr Doug Myers, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Auckland.
Mr Myers also said the group would 'comfortably achieve' a profit of more
than NZDollars 200m (USDollars 110.94m) after tax and goodwill amortisation
in 1993-94 against NZDollars 155.86m in the year to August.
He said the Australian and New Zealand markets were mature, with little
opportunity for growth, but the beer markets in Asia, Eastern Europe and
South America were growing. Lion was looking at joint venture options in
Asia and would concentrate its efforts on selling products to the other two
markets rather than setting up breweries.
The company is evaluating a proposition to set up a brewery in South Korea
with American brewer Adolph Coors and is considering other proposals.
Lion, which bought brewing and hotel assets in August from SA Brewing for
ADollars 225m, said it will start selling the 105 hotels in the first
quarter of 1994.
Earlier yesterday the company reported a bottom line profit of NZDollars
32.1m for the year to August, up from NZDollars 20.8m.

FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: Foreign buying triggers concern
in India - Stefan Wagstyl and RC Murthy on special discounts to
multinational companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL and RC MURTHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIAN entrepreneurs are protesting at the sight of foreign multinationals
buying stock in their Indian subsidiaries at a fraction of the market price.
Taking advantage of rules designed to tempt foreign groups back into India,
over 30 groups have increased their stakes in their Indian units, at
discounts of up to 90 per cent to market prices.
Colgate Palmolive, the US toiletries group, bought stock in its Indian
affiliate at a 90 per cent discount to the market; Burmah, the UK oil
company which controls Castrol, secured an 89 per cent discount on shares in
Castrol India; and ABB, the Swiss-Swedish engineering combine, bought shares
in ABB India at a 78 per cent discount.
Indian business families claim this is unfair because they, too, would like
to buy stock cheaply.
As Mr Rahul Bajaj, chairman of Bajaj Auto, the world's biggest scooter
maker, says: 'If foreign companies are allowed to buy stock at a discount,
so should domestic companies. We need a level playing field.'
Indian business families generally own less than 20 per cent of their listed
companies and would like to increase their holdings to secure better
control. Some are concerned that they will be swept away by the
multinationals, which, having secured control of their subsidiaries, will
buy out indigenous Indian industry as well.
The finance ministry has yet to decide what to do. 'We have not reached a
conclusion. You can say there's a policy vacuum,' said one senior official.
The origins of the argument lie in the 1970s, when multinationals were
forced to cut stakes in their Indian affiliates to 40 per cent or less -
often at fire-sale prices.
In 1991, when the government raised the limit to 51 per cent as part of the
liberalisation programme, foreign companies were slow to buy back their
shares because prices were high.
Last year, Indian financial institutions, which are controlled by the
government and hold the bulk of Indian equities, agreed on a formula under
which controlling shareholders could buy their stock at a price/earnings
multiple of 15 - compared with a market average of 30.
The multinationals seized their chance and arranged for their subsidiaries
to sell them cut-price shares. The discounts were sometimes far greater than
the Indian authorities had expected, because prices were determined by the
previous year's profits - low profits meant a low price.
The finance ministry did not object, since it was keen to attract the
multinationals back to the country and the sums involved were modest -
generally less than USDollars 10m. The share issues were subject to approval
by shareholders owning at least 75 per cent of the company.
But there were few objections because most shareholders thought foreign
companies that increased their stakes might also bring other benefits to
their Indian subsidiaries - and so bring value to shareholders.
The Indian Companies Act permits such preferential issues to any
shareholder, whether Indian or foreign, as long as it is approved by
shareholders with 75 per cent of the stock. And some Indian groups have,
like the multinationals, taken advantage of this rule. Tata, the country's
largest combine, increased its holding in Tata Steel, its biggest operating
company, from 8 per cent to 12 per cent about two years ago. Families which
have recently raised stakes include the owners of Indian Rayon, a textile
group (43 per cent discount to the market price), Vysya Bank, a leading bank
(97 per cent) and Nahar Shipping (55 per cent).
However, this wave of cheap issues has worried the financial institutions.
Last week, they forced Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, a vehicle maker, to amend plans
for an issue of equity warrants which would have enabled the founding
Mahindra family to buy stock at about Rs80 (Dollars 2.55) a share, compared
with a market price of Rs270.
The institutions decided, in private meetings, that this was too cheap - but
agreed to a price equivalent to about Rs120.
With the encouragement of the finance ministry, the institutions are likely
to examine future proposals for preferential issues more closely. At the
ministry, some officials believe that foreign groups deserve special
treatment because of the enforced losses they suffered in the 1970s.
They argue that Indian business families do not deserve special protection -
any more than founding families in the US and other developed countries are
entitled to maintain control through preferential share issues.
However, these views are not unanimous. Other officials believe the ministry
should not be over-accommodating to foreigners at a time when critics of
government economic policy - including the opposition Bharatiya Janata
Party, the right-wing Hindu party - accuse ministers of favouring foreigners
at the expense of Indian companies.
Indian businessmen say some techniques available in other countries are
banned in India, such as using shares as security for a bank loan or issuing
non-voting stock.
Mr Onkar Singh Kanwar, managing director of Apollo Tyres, a leading
tyremaker in which the founding family holds about 19 per cent, says:
'Foreign companies have an unfair advantage over us.'
One way of ensuring fairness would be to amend the Companies Act and ban
altogether the issue of shares on preferential terms to favoured
shareholders.
Given this possibility, it is not surprising that companies are rushing to
complete their share issues lest they leave it too late.

<TEXT>
ASIA PACIFIC Breweries, whose main shareholders are Heineken of the
Netherlands and Fraser and Neave of Singapore, is to take control of New
Zealand's second-biggest brewer, DB Group.
Until now DB Group has been controlled by a consortium of Asia Pacific
Breweries and Brierley Investments, but APB said it plans to buy Brierley's
27 per cent stake in the financially troubled group for NZDollars 115m
(USDollars 64m)
Asia Pacific also said it was selling its 25 per cent shareholding in
Australian hotel group Austotel to Brierley for NZDollars 38.33m. Brierley
will then buy a further 50 per cent of Austotel, now held by DB Group, for
NZDollars 76.6m.
DB Group, formerly Magnum Corporation, has run up substantial losses in
recent years, mainly due to its investment in Austotel and in Wilson Neill,
owner of the Tasmanian brewery Cascade Group.
Brierley's chief executive, Mr Paul Collins, said Asia Pacific Breweries
would bring to DB Group Heineken's expertise in brewing to further increase
its quality, while Brierley's expertise would help rebuild Austotel to an
'acceptable level of profitability.'

<TEXT>
MR Martin Revson, former chairman of US drugs and cosmetics group Del
Laboratories and a former director of Revlon, agreed yesterday to pay
Dollars 1.6m in fines and restitution to settle insider trading claims filed
by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The SEC said Mr Revson, without admitting or denying liability, would pay
Dollars 1.25m in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and just over
Dollars 343,000 as a civil penalty under insider trading legislation. Both
amounts related to the profits the SEC says the 84-year-old Mr Revson
derived from his purchase of shares in the industrial conglomerate Kidde
during the summer of 1987.
The SEC's original complaint alleged that Mr Revson was part of a large
insider trading ring led by Mr Edward Downe, a former director of New York
broking house Bear Stearns, and that Mr Revson bought Kidde shares for
himself and his daughter in June and July of 1987 after being given inside
information by Mr Downe.

fight bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY's first hostile takeover bid in the normally placid banking sector has
created an unexpected opportunity for Schroders, the UK merchant bank.
The bank has been appointed by the board of Banco di San Geminiano e San
Prospero, which is one of Italy's most successful regional banks. It wants
Schroders to mount a rapid defence against an unwanted takeover bid by Banca
Popolare di Verona, another sizeable regional institution.
The takeover offer, which is for only 30 per cent of the Modena-based Banco
di San Geminiano's share capital, 'seriously undervalues' the stock and goes
against the grain of Italy's new takeover laws, according to one banker
involved.
The new takeover rules permit bidders to make partial offers for an
acquisition target's capital.
However, they also require the raider to offer small shareholders the same
price as that being paid to those holding larger stakes.
Some bankers are claiming that Banca Popolare di Verona has exploited a
loophole in the new takeover legislation so it can offer a price lower than
that being paid to big shareholders.
Banco di San Geminiano is an attractive prize at a time of consolidation
among Italy's medium-sized regional banks. Net profits amounted to L60bn
(Dollars 36m) last year, while total assets were about L9,500bn. Its market
capitalisation is about L1,500bn.
Like many regional banks in northern and central Italy, it has a healthy
loan book and an attractive deposit base. Modena, home of some of Italy's
best-known specialist engineering companies, is one of the country's most
affluent cities.
In spite of Banco di San Geminiano's attempts to launch a spirited defence,
prospects for a higher offer - or the arrival of a 'white knight' to make a
counter bid - are compromised by the tight deadline for the current deal.
The offer by Banca Popolare di Verona, which claims to have already won
approval from shareholders owning 17 per cent of its target's stock, closes
at the end of this month.

ASTRA, the Swedish drugs group, said it has not withdrawn its schizophrenia
treatment from sale in Europe, despite a decision by its partner Merck to
warn against its use in the US.
More than 100 people in the US who took part in clinical trials on the drug,
known as Roxiam, had been continuing to take it pending a decision on its
authorisation by the US's Food and Drug Admistration, Merck said.
Prompted by blood disorders in eight patients taking the drug in Europe,
including one death, Merck earlier this week said it had advised doctors in
the US to stop medication.
Astra, which developed the product and has marketed it in Europe for
two-and-a-half years, said it had recommended 'far-reaching precautions' in
the use of the drug.
Full information on the product, which had sales in the first three months
of the year of SKr50m (Dollars 6m), had been sent to regulatory authorities
and physicians, it added.

FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: Pacific Telesis spin-off plan
wins approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PACIFIC Telesis, the California-based local telephone company, has won
regulatory approval for its unusual and controversial plan to spin off its
mobile communications business into a separately quoted company.
The go-ahead from the California Public Utilities Commission, which oversees
the industry, ended a dispute which had delayed the spin-off.
The commission's public advocacy office had demanded that Pacific Telesis
refund Dollars 1bn to its telephone operating companies for research into
cellular technology supposedly paid for out of telephone rates. In the end,
the commission insisted the company pay just Dollars 41.3m.
Pacific Telesis announced plans for the spin-off last December. The wireless
business, to be known as Pactel, involves the group's US cellular telephone
and paging businesses and its international mobile operations, which include
ventures in Germany, Sweden, Portugal and Spain.
The group plans to sell 12 per cent of Pactel in a public offering which
could raise up to Dollars 1.2bn and will be completed by mid-December. It
will distribute the remaining 88 per cent of the stock to existing
investors.
Pacific Telesis, one of the seven Baby Bell regional telephone companies,
has a strategy very different from most of the other big local operators as
they prepare for the convergence of the telecommunications, computer and
media industries.
Its rivals are keeping all their operations under one corporate parent and
snapping up interests in cable TV companies and programme providers.
Pacific Telesis, with no significant television investments, argues that the
spin-off will allow Pactel to take greater advantage of worldwide wireless
growth, since it will free it from much of the regulatory oversight of its
traditional telephone business.
At the same time, the split will enable Pacific Telesis to play a larger
role in personal communications services, a new kind of mobile telephony.
The Federal Communications Commission, which oversees the US national
telecommunications industry and is due to auction PCS licences next year,
has limited the size of the licences existing cellular carriers can bid for.
The split will free Pacific Telesis of these restrictions.

INTERNATIONAL Business Machines is making its first foray into the nascent
market for hand-held computer/communicator devices with the introduction of
Simon, a hand-held cellular telephone-cum-computer.
The device is to be sold in the US by BellSouth Cellular, one of the leading
US cellular telephone service providers.
Simon weighs just over a pound and looks much like an ordinary cellular
telephone, with a touch-sensitive display instead of the usual dial pad.
However, unlike earlier 'personal digital assistants', such as Apple's
Newton, Simon is primarily a communications device.
Its functions include: facsimile, paging, electronic mail, calendar and
appointments diary, address book, calculator and pen-based note pad, as well
as cellular telephone.
Unlike Apple's Newton, which deciphers handwritten notes and turns them into
text, Simon stores the image of a written note and sends it via the cellular
network to a facsimile machine.

NOVA, western Canada's most conspicuous corporate turnround of the
recession, reported a strong result for the first nine months of 1993.
The company said capital spending would rise substantially to handle growing
demand for capacity in its natural gas pipeline system.
Nova, which is concentrating on building its core pipeline and petrochemical
businesses after a brush with failure two years ago, has put its Novalta
Resources gas production unit out to tender.
It expects firm bids later this month. Analysts value the unit at CDollars
200m or more.
Nine-month net profit was CDollars 159m (USDollars 121m), or 37 cents a
share, up 43 per cent from CDollars 111m, or 27 cents a share, a year
earlier, on revenues of CDollars 2.4bn, an increase of 9 per cent.
Third-quarter profit was CDollars 45m, or 10 cents, down 4 per cent from
CDollars 47m, or 11 cents, on revenues of CDollars 828m, up 10 per cent. The
decline was due to a lower regulated rate of return on pipeline operations.

TEXACO, the US energy group, is being sued for Dollars 1bn over alleged
pollution from oil production operations it ran in the Amazon Basin in
Ecuador, writes Richard Waters.
The action, filed in the federal court in Manhattan, has been brought on
behalf of Ecuadorean indians who claim that waste from the operations
polluted their environment.
Texaco denied the allegations, saying that it had operated in the country in
accordance with 'sound internationally accepted oil industry practices' and
the laws and regulations of Ecuador.

FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: Reader's Digest stages rebound
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WALL Street took heart yesterday from an announcement by Reader's Digest
that its struggling US books and home entertainment business had showed
signs of rebounding.
The stock closed on the New York Stock Exchange Dollars 1 1/2 ahead at
Dollars 42 3/8 , even though the news came against the backdrop of a 7 per
cent decline in net income, lower revenues and a sharp downturn in operating
profits during the three months to September 30.
The company said 'early reports' indicated that changes in the marketing
strategy for its US book operation were succeeding in returning its growth
rate back to 'historic levels' of about 10 per cent.
It added that it would eliminate a further 200 jobs to bring domestic
'staffing levels in line with business activities'. In June, 250
redundancies were announced. After the cuts are fully implemented, the
company will employ about 2,050 in the US and 7,200 worldwide.
With the share price near its 52-week low, investors appeared willing to bet
the worst may be over. The stock had fallen sharply since February, when
Reader's Digest first said the business was not performing to expectations.
The company, a leading publisher of magazines and books, blamed unfavourable
changes in currency exchange rates for the 7 per cent decline in revenues to
Dollars 637.2m, and a 23 per cent fall in operating profits, to Dollars
68.2m. If currency changes were excluded, revenues would have showed a 6 per
cent rise.
In the event, net income fell to Dollars 62.8m, compared with Dollars 67.6m
last time. Earnings per share worked through at 54 cents, exceeding
analysts' forecasts of about 50 cents. In addition to the strength of the US
dollar, profits suffered from increased promotional spending in
international markets.

National
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANC ONE, one of the US's most ambitious regional banking groups, has
reached agreement to acquire Liberty National Bancorp of Kentucky in an
all-stock deal which yesterday was worth Dollars 785m.
The takeover, which signals the growing pace of consolidation in the US
banking industry, would strengthen Banc One's presence in northern and
western Kentucky and southern Indiana. Liberty National has 94 offices and
assets of Dollars 4.7bn, compared with Banc One's Dollars 1.7bn of assets in
Kentucky.
Banc One's shares fell Dollars 1 3/8 on yesterday's news, to Dollars 36 1/8
, amid fears that the deal would dilute its earnings. The shares later
recovered to Dollars 36 5/8 .
Though its shares have now slid to a low for the year, Banc One remains more
highly valued than many other banks, making its shares attractive as a
takeover currency. After yesterday's fall, the shares were trading at 1.93
times the bank's book value, compared with an industry average of 1.53, said
Diane Glossman, an analyst at Salomon Brothers.
Banc One claims a dominant market share in Lexington, the Kentucky state
capital. Liberty National claims a 40 per cent market share in Louisville,
on the border with Indiana.
'Combined, these two affiliates will become the largest banking company in
Kentucky and will be the only one serving all the major markets,' said Mr
John McCoy, Banc One chairman and chief executive.
Shareholders in Liberty National will receive 0.8421 of a share in Banc One
for each share held. If the Banc One share price rises above Dollars 41.57
during a set period, they will receive stock worth Dollars 35.
Liberty National's stock yesterday rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 29 3/8.

TRANS WORLD Airlines, the US carrier formerly owned by Mr Carl Icahn, the US
financier, yesterday emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to become
a new public company under the same name.
Under a plan approved by a Delaware bankruptcy court in August,
shareholders' equity has been split between its employees, in return for
wage concessions, and its creditors, in return for debt forgiveness.
Employees have pledged labour cost savings of Dollars 660m in return for 45
per cent of the company, while creditors have written off Dollars 1bn worth
of debts in return for a 55 per cent stake. TWA, which serves 105 cities in
the US and 19 cities in Europe and the Middle East, went bankrupt in January
1992 after seven year under Mr Icahn's ownership.
Its emergence from Chapter 11 follows a similar rescue from bankruptcy for
Continental Airlines in April.

A COURT in Houston, Texas, ordered Deloitte &amp; Touche, the US accounting
firm, to pay Dollars 77m in punitive damages to investors in a limited
partnership which invested in cattle, writes Richard Waters.
The accounting firm had been negligent in preparing a tax return claiming an
allowance for grazing land which the firm could not show the cattle had
actually used, the court decided. Investors in the Limited partnership had
paid Dollars 35m plus additional penalties to the US's Internal Revenue
Service after agreeing a settlement over the matter in 1991. Deloitte is

FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: Snapple mixes an explosive fruit
cocktail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPANY which turns in operating income growth of 230 per cent on revenue
growth of 130 per cent should expect to hit the financial headlines. But not
when that company is Snapple Beverage, the New York-based fruit juice and
iced tea maker.
In the 11 months since it went public, the company has become something of a
Wall Street legend. Once an obscure regional brand, Snapple has seeped into
the American consciousness and on to store shelves, sending sales soaring.
It has turned up in the refrigerators of television show characters and
featured prominently in this summer's hit film Sleepless in Seattle. A
recent fashion section in The New York Times magazine referred to the
'Snapple set . . . who crave exotic juices the way another generation once
craved quiche'. According to the Wall Street Journal, the term Snapplesque
has entered Wall Street's lexicon as the definition of a stock which is
wildly overpriced.
The company's stock has performed erratically, trading as high as Dollars 29
7/8 (adjusted for a September stock split) before dropping to Dollars 23.
Shares climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 24 5/8 yesterday, after the company
posted third-quarter earnings of Dollars 26.9m, or 22 cents a share, up from
Dollars 7.8m, or 6 cents, last year on a pro forma basis. The company is
planning a secondary offering of 8m post-split shares.
Revenues rose to about Dollars 113.7m in the quarter from Dollars 86.9m last
year. To put these numbers in perspective, Snapple posted revenues of only
Dollars 13.3m for the whole of 1988. In 1991, the year before it went
public, revenues had risen to Dollars 95m. Analysts expect revenues of
Dollars 400m this year.
Snapple's explosive performance has left investors wondering whether the
company is another Ben &amp; Jerry's in the making - a company which translated
its overnight success into a long-running reliable performance - or whether
it is merely flavour of the month, doomed to fall as dramatically as it has
risen.
The company attributes its strength to 'beverages which appeal to consumers
seeking great-tasting, natural products', and Snapple doubtlessly slaking
some of the nation's thirst for seemingly healthy non-alcoholic drinks.
Sales of these drinks - dubbed New Age beverages by Wall Street analysts -
are rocketing. In the ready-to-drink iced teas category alone, sales are
expected to climb 70 per cent this year to Dollars 850m, according to some
industry experts.
Traditionally, Snapple relied on word-of-mouth praise to propel sales,
rather than expensive advertising campaigns. This worked when its main
market was confined to the New York area.
However, it has expanded enormously, and with 52 beverage lines and a
presence in every state in the nation, the company is using more mainstream
methods of promotion. This year it launched its first national advertising
campaign, at an estimated cost of Dollars 30m.
Fame has brought Snapple its share of notoriety. In September, the company
was forced to run an advertising campaign to quash rumours it supported the
Ku Klux Klan, the white supremacist group, and that it endorsed the tactics
of Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group.
The KKK rumour is particularly ironic given that Snapple's founders have
described themselves as 'three Jewish boys from New York'. In a letter to
consumers the company said: 'We are not involved in any way whatsoever with
the KKK, Operation Rescue or any other type of pressure group or
organisation, period.'
Perhaps more worrying are charges that the Food and Drug Administration is
looking into Snapple's 'all natural' claim on some of its labels, and the
California health services department is questioning the 'brewed' label on
its iced teas.
Even if these concerns come to naught, the Snapple craze could fizzle out.
But for now, US consumers seem to be saying it tastes good enough to keep
profits growing.

<TEXT>
MOLSON, the international brewing, special chemicals and hardware retailing
group, saw profits edge ahead in the second quarter. The group saw its
domestic market share slip as a result of aggressive pricing in the discount
beer sector.
The group's first half results were flat.
It said, however, that Molson Breweries remained the market leader in Canada
and was fighting back with new products and expansion in the US.
Profit for the September quarter was CDollars 37.2m (USDollars 28.5m), or 63
cents a share, against CDollars 36.4m, or 60 cents, a year earlier on
revenues which fell to CDollars 769m from CDollars 811m.
First half profit was CDollars 74m, or CDollars 1.25, against CDollars
74.8m, or CDollars 1.26, on revenues which slipped to CDollars 1.54bn from
CDollars 1.6bnTotal domestic beer sales rose just under 1 per cent in the
first half, but Molson's market share slipped to 48.6 per cent from 50 per
cent.
The company retaliated with new low-price plans and says it has more new
products on the way. The group's share of brewing profits in the first half
was CDollars 74m, down 24 per cent, mainly due to the deal with Miller
Brewing of the US which this year took a stake in Molson Breweries.
Molson's chemical businesses improved and retailing performed well.
In specialty chemicals, Diversey's operating profit rose 12 per cent to
CDollars 43.2m in the first half on sales of CDollars 681m, up 3 per cent.
European operations were strong, except in Spain.
US cleaning chemicals were marginally profitable, against a loss last year,
but Canadian operations improved significantly and Latin America and Asia
Pacific also strengthened.
Malsham, the retailing group, posted sales up 15 per cent, and operating
profits of CDollars 19.3m against CDollars 92m. The new megastores were
performing well.

an investment firm. Mrs Eprile is the first woman to be named executive
director, a post normally filled from the investment or legal communities.
She will head all seven divisions' review operations for potential
rationalisation and later examine the regulations. She has played a key role
in developing capital adequacy standards and improving the quality of annual
reports.
Teleglobe, Canada's overseas telecommunications group, 19.7 per cent owned
by BCE, recorded a third quarter net profit of CDollars 20.5m (USDollars
15.5m), or 33 cents a share, up from CDollars 15m, or 27 cents, on revenues
of Dollars 381m, up 22 per cent. Nine-months profit was CDollars 47.9m, or

REPAP Enterprises, one of North America's top coated paper producers,
reduced third quarter losses, thanks to firmer pricing and increased
efficiency at its Canadian and US mills. The lower Canadian dollar and lower
interest rates helped, writes Robert Gibbens.
The pre-tax loss was CDollars 32.2m (USDollars 24.6m), down from CDollars
51m a year earlier. Revenues rose 7 per cent to CDollars 309m, with coated
papers and construction timber showing good gains, but market pulp remained.
The nine-month pre-tax loss was CDollars 103m, against CDollars 171m.

FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: State shake-up produces
turnround at Nordbanken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORDBANKEN, the Swedish state-owned bank, showed the benefits of financial
restructuring and lower interest rates yesterday when it disclosed a
SKr2.5bn (Dollars 305.6m) profit for the first nine months.
The result is a dramatic turnround on the SKr10.1bn loss recorded in the
same 1992 period, when it was burdened by huge credit losses linked mainly
to the collapsing real estate market.
The improvement makes Nordbanken Sweden's most successful bank in terms of
operating profit. It is bound to add to concern that the bank, the biggest
casualty of the country's financial sector crisis, has received too much
assistance from the state.
It is expecting a full-year surplus of at least SKr3.2bn, compared with the
record SKr16bn deficit it incurred in 1992. The performance should assist
the government's plans to return the bank to the private sector as soon as
possible.
The bank's rapid return to profit is attributed to the hiving off of SKr67bn
of problem loans into a 'bad bank' entity called Securum at the start of the
year. However it has also benefited from cost-cutting and substantial
capital gains on its bond portfolio in a lower interest rate environment.
Loan losses shrank to SKr3.4bn in the January-September period from
SKr12.3bn last time. Non-performing loans at SKr11.7bn are still SKr600m
higher than at the year end, if Securum is excluded.
Total operating income rose to SKr10.8bn from SKr7.1bn. This was after net
interest income climbed to SKr6.8bn from SKr5.2bn, and bond portfolio gains
saw 'other income' rise to nearly SKr2bn from SKr473m. A 1 per cent fall in
costs, to SKr4.9bn, left the group with a profit before loan losses of
SKr5.9bn, compared with SKr2.2bn in 1992.
The bank said loan demand from companies and households remained weak. Its
share for loans to companies has fallen to less than 16 per cent from more
than 19 per cent following the sale of Securum. However its share of
consumer lending has risen slightly to exceed 11 per cent.
A SKr1.3bn perpetual debentures issue helped raise the bank's capital
adequacy ratio to 10.4 per cent at the end of September, from 8.9 per cent
at the year end.
Nordbanken expects final-quarter operating profits to be at least as large
as the SKr743m achieved in the third quarter. Mr Hans Dalborg, chief
executive, said: 'The trend towards lower interest rates has been beneficial
to the bank's borrowers as well as to the bank's earning capacity. It
creates prerequisites for a continued stabilisation of market conditions.'
Nordbanken is one of four candidates in final round of bidding for Gota
Bank, which also collapsed into the arms of the state last year. 'Gota and
Nordbanken have similar business strategies and would complement each other
if they merged,' it said.

FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: Paris to consider Renault sale
timetable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH Government could give a clearer timetable for the privatisation
of a merged Renault-Volvo group as part of its attempts to reassure Volvo
shareholders opposed to the deal, government sources said yesterday.
This could involve the issue of a letter or a public statement about the
timing of the privatisation, or the placing of Renault on the next list of
companies to be sold off as part of the French government's plans for 21
publicly-owned groups.
The four companies on the current list - Banque Nationale de Paris, Rhone
Poulenc, Elf-Aquitaine and Banque Hervet - are expected to be sold by early
next year. BNP has already been successfully privatised and Rhone Poulenc is
due to be sold within the next few weeks.
Greater certainty about the timing of the privatisation of a combined
Renault-Volvo group is one of the principal demands of Volvo shareholders
opposed to the deal. Increased opposition to the merger from some Volvo
investors has forced the company to postpone until next month a vote to
approve the deal.
The French government has said it plans to privatise the combined group as
quickly as possible, with a target date during the second half of next year.
It still maintains it is impossible to give a precise date for the
privatisation because conditions in the automotive and financial markets
must be taken into account.
However, Renault's inclusion on the next list of privatisation candidates
could help assuage shareholder fears.
The second principal concern of rebel Volvo shareholders - the golden share
to be retained by the French government after privatisation - is still
described as non-negotiable by French officials and Renault.

FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: Daimler-Benz shrugs off loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES at Daimler-Benz, the German automotive, aerospace and electrical
engineering group, deepened to around DM2bn (Dollars 1.18bn) in the first
nine months of this year.
The group, however, yesterday forecast a clear improvement in the closing
quarter, and claimed the positive trend would continue into 1994.
The group attributed the expected progress to the 'positive sales situation'
for Mercedes-Benz cars, and the effects of this year's hefty provisions for
restructuring and 44,000 job cuts.
The DM2bn loss, calculated according to US accounting rules adopted for
Daimler's recent listing on the New York Stock Exchange, includes a charge
of DM1.5bn. The first-half deficit, on the same basis, was DM949m.
Under German accounting standards, the group made a net loss of
approximately DM180m in the first three quarters, after a DM168m profit at
the halfway mark. Precise figures will be published on December 14, the
company said.
Analysts, still digesting Tuesday's hints of a dividend cut from Daimler
chairman, Mr Edzard Reuter, were puzzled by yesterday's figures and promises
of improvement. However, most still assumed a group loss of around DM2bn for
the full year.
Observers said the June introduction of the C-Class Mercedes car would
bolster volume sales, but that its relatively low price - unchanged from its
predecessor's - would do less for profits.
Overall demand in the European car market is not expected to pick up before
mid-1994 at the earliest.
Meanwhile, rumblings of discontent over closures and job losses continued
among the group's workers. A leading employee representative said yesterday
the management of the Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) subsidiary had chosen a
'confrontation strategy'. He demanded the scrapping of a plan to close six
factories and other sites.
Mr Erwin Hilbrink, a member of the Dasa supervisory board, claimed the
company had withdrawn an offer to discuss possible alternatives to the
closures.
Mr Reuter's veiled suggestion of a dividend reduction, apparently made to
demonstrate that shareholders should share some of the sacrifices demanded
of the workforce, weighed down Daimler shares yesterday. The stock shed DM9
to close at DM743.

FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: BHF-Bank climbs 14%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BHF-BANK said yesterday group operating profits rose by 'a good 14 per cent'
in the first nine months of the year to DM229m (Dollars 135.5m). As is usual
for German banks, the increase is calculated with reference to
three-quarters of last year's profits.
Partial operating profits, which excludes profits from own account trading,
for the Frankfurt-based merchant bank rose by 29 per cent while the group's
total assets increased 17 per cent to DM55bn. The bank attributed this to
relatively strong asset expansion in subsidiaries operating in low-risk
sectors. Group personnel and materials costs rose by only 7 per cent.
BHF gave no further details of the profits increase. However it is likely
the results have benefited from healthy trading gains in the buoyant German
equity and bund markets. In the first six months of the current year,
operating profits rose 23 per cent to DM148m after setting aside DM67m
against bad and doubtful loans.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROFITS at MAN, the German commercial vehicles and heavy engineering group,
may have further to fall, following a 45 per cent slump in the year to the
end of June, Mr Klaus Gotte, chairman, warned yesterday.
Although incoming orders rose 12 per cent to DM3.7bn (Dollars 2.2bn) in the
first quarter of 1993-94, all the growth came from outside Germany, he said.
Foreign orders were up 21 per cent at DM2.3bn, while domestic demand was
unchanged from a year earlier. Meanwhile, sales fell 12 per cent to DM3.2bn.
The group expected turnover for the full year to fall slightly to DM18.3bn,
compared with DM19bn, while the fall in earnings would be moderated by the
shedding of a further 2,000 to 3,000 jobs, according to Mr Gotte.
Warning that he did not expect any improvement in domestic demand before
mid-1994, he seemed sceptical of a recent report from Germany's six leading
economic institutes forecasting 1.5 per cent economic growth next year.
The board could only hope they were right, Mr Gotte said, pointing out that
investment goods makers were also hoping for relief through lower interest
rates and modest pay deals.
There were good prospects that MAN Nutzfahrzeuge, the trucks and buses
division, and mainstay of the whole group, would remain in the black in the
current year after last time's fall from DM506m pre-tax to DM61m.
MAN Roland, the printing machinery business which lost DM220m last year, and
has already forecast another deficit in 1993-94, had been restructured and
was well-placed to return quickly to profits once markets improved. Global
demand for printing equipment had almost halved since the winter of 1991-92,
Mr Gotte said.
Reviewing the last financial year, he reported growing sales in east Asia,
which accounted for 20 per cent of all export business. Diesel motors,
printing machines and plant construction services had done especially well.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AKZO, the Dutch chemicals group, reported a small increase in third-quarter
net profit before extraordinary items. It was the company's first quarterly
rise posted so far in 1993.
Net profit before extraordinary items rose to Fl 169m (Dollars 89m) from Fl
162.1m a year earlier, on turnover up 3 per cent at Fl 4.1bn. The company is
to pay an unchanged interim dividend of Fl 1.50.
Akzo took Fl 55m in extraordinary charges in the third quarter, mainly to
pay for the recent spinning off of loss-making businesses into joint
ventures with other companies. If extraordinary charges are included, net
profit fell to Fl 113.9m from Fl 162.1m.
Mr Syb Bergsma, Akzo's finance director, said fourth-quarter net profit
before extraordinary items was also expected to show a rise.
'We may have to show further extraordinary losses in the fourth quarter. If
so, they will be lower than in the third quarter,' he said.
He described third-quarter operating profit, which was steady at Fl 260m, as
'not unsatisfactory', given current economic conditions.
Akzo's chemicals, coatings and pharmaceuticals businesses all posted
increases in operating profit but the group's fibres business fell into an
operating loss.

FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: SBC forecasts 20% advance in net
income for full year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWISS Bank Corporation (SBC), the country's third-largest bank, said
operating income in the first nine months of 1993 was 'substantially ahead'
of that in the same period last year. No figures were given.
Mr Georges Blum, chief executive, said business continued to be strong in
October. He anticipated a 20 per cent rise in net income in the full year
against last year's SFr1.01bn (Dollars 673m), in spite of continuing high
provisions for bad loans.
The forecast appears modest considering the bank doubled net income, to
SFr719m, in the first half, and in comparison to the much higher growth
rates anticipated at rivals Union Bank of Switzerland and Credit Suisse.
However, SBC's full-year 1992 net income was boosted substantially by a
SFr255m extraordinary profit on the sale of an Austrian electricity utility.
Mr Blum also announced a reorganisation of the bank's senior management and
a restructuring of its Swiss branch network. Competition in Swiss retail
banking has intensified since Credit Suisse acquired Swiss Volksbank last
spring.
Mr Blum said SBC, which has been pushed into third place by the Credit
Suisse deal, aimed to gain market share and to cut costs by about SFr100m a
year through the restructuring.
SBC said the most important factor in its strong third-quarter performance
was the buoyancy of international stock markets.
Consolidated revenues from financial and trading operations in the first
three quarters more than doubled, due mainly to active securities trading
and the rapidly-expanding volume of interest-rate derivatives.
On the other hand, revenues from foreign exchange trading dropped following
the widening of the fluctuation margins within the European Monetary System
in August.
Net commission income improved substantially, with strong growth in earnings
from brokerage and syndications, as well as in administration and custodian
fees. Net interest income remained disappointing.
Total assets of the parent company at the end of September stood at
SFr175.9bn, 1.5 per cent lower than at the end of June. Loans outstanding
dropped 2.9 per cent during the quarter to SFr102.8bn, but securities
holdings jumped 23.3 per cent to SFr20.8bn.

FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Rhino pays Pounds 12.5m for Virgin Games
Stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RHINO GROUP, the fast-growing computer and video games retailer, is paying
Pounds 12.5m in cash to acquire Virgin Games Stores, the joint venture UK
retailer owned by Richard Branson's Virgin Group and WH Smith.
The purchase, which includes Pounds 3.5m for the stock, will be funded by
Rhino through a 5-for-9 rights issue priced at 44p a share to raise Pounds
12.4m net. The deal will combine the two biggest specialist computer and
video games store chains in the UK.
Rhino already has 34 stores, trading as Future Zone, while Virgin Games
Stores has 29 in the UK and one in the Irish Republic. In the year to May 31
the Virgin operations, which had net assets of Pounds 4.3m, generated Pounds
2m in profits before central overheads on turnover of Pounds 24.3m.
The deal will enable the USM-quoted Rhino Group, launched 13 months ago when
Mr Bev Ripley and Mr Terry Norris - former directors of Cityvision, the Ritz
video hire shops operator - took control of JMD Group, to accelerate its own
development plans which set a target of 130 stores in three years.
The purchase and the rights issue, which is fully underwritten by Panmure
Gordon, are subject to shareholder approval at an extraordinary meeting on
November 19.
Dealings in Rhino's shares, which were suspended on Tuesday at 58 1/4 p
pending the announcement, are expected to recommence on November 22.
Mr Ripley, Rhino's chairman, said yesterday that the two operations were 'a
near perfect fit' and would enable Rhino to have 75 specialist computer
games stores operating in the important pre-Christmas trading period.
The deal will also allow the Virgin Retail division to concentrate on
building the Virgin Megastore multi-product retail chain. Virgin's 21
existing Megastores already sell computer games in addition to music and
videos.

THE OCEANA Consolidated Company, which has interests in stockbroking and

end-September.
The outcome compared with a deficit of Pounds 158,000 last time and was
struck on turnover up from Pounds 4.79m to Pounds 6.29m.
A maiden interim dividend of 0.5p is declared, payable from earnings of
7.28p per share (2.43p losses).
The directors said the improvement in profits reflected a continuing strong
contribution from Charles Stanley, the stockbroker, its principal
subsidiary.
Trading in the second half had opened on a firm note, the directors added,
although it was too early to predict the outcome for the full year.

SHARES IN Kitty Little Group rose 10p to 31p yesterday as the USM-quoted
designer and manufacturer of consumer goods reported pre-tax profits more
than doubled from Pounds 26,000 to Pounds 54,000 for the first half of 1993.
It also announced the acquisition of Samco, the market leader in branded

about Pounds 2m to fund the acquisition and provide increased working
capital.
Turnover for the period fell slightly to Pounds 2.48m (Pounds 2.69m).
Earnings per share worked through at 0.53p (0.06p) and the group is paying
an interim dividend of 0.5p (nil), with a forecast final of not less than
1p.
Mr Graham Webster, chairman, said the acquisition should double group
turnover, which, together with planned overhead savings, should have a
profound impact on the group's future performance.

Pounds 24m

<TEXT>
MORGAN Grenfell Equity Income Trust, a UK investment trust, is attempting to
raise about Pounds 23.8m, after expenses, via an offer for subscription of C
shares.
The directors say that, in their opinion, 'the UK economic outlook currently
provides attractive opportunities for investment' and therefore 'now is an
appropriate time to expand the capital base of the company.' The trust,
which was floated in October 1991, was second in the UK income growth sector
over the year to November 1.
Issuing C shares is now common practice among investment trusts which want
to expand their capital. The C shares will be convertible into ordinary
shares after January 7; by waiting to convert until the proceeds are
substantially invested, there is no dilution of the net asset value of
existing ordinary shares.
Up to 25m C shares are on offer at 100p; the minimum investment is Pounds
1,000. Irrevocable undertakings to buy 8m shares have been received. The
offer closes on November 23.

FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Lincoln House to eliminate debt through
Pounds 2m placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER FRANKLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LINCOLN HOUSE, the USM-traded home furnishing group, is to raise some Pounds
2m net of expenses via a placing and open offer and subscription.
The company is issuing 9.07m shares at 25p apiece. Of these, 8.07m have been
conditionally placed - subject to the rights of shareholders to apply for
their entitlement on a 1-for-2 basis under the open offer - and 1m are to be
issued pursuant to the subscription.
The proceeds will be used principally to eliminate net borrowings and
provide additional working capital.
Because the nominal price of the company's shares at 50p exceeds the 25p
placing price, to enable it to proceed with the placing and avoid having two
separately listed classes of shares, the company proposes a capital
reorganisa-tion.
The first stage of this will involve a sub-division of its shares into one
new ordinary share with a nominal value of 10p and one deferred share with a
nominal value of 40p.
The resulting new ordinary shares will, for all practical purposes, have the
same rights attaching to the issued ordinary shares of 50p each.
The deferred shares will be valueless and no share certificates will be
issued in respect of them.
In the second stage all the deferred shares will be cancelled for no
consideration and the share premium account following the fund raising issue
will also be cancelled.
The amount set free will be used to eliminate the deficit on the profit and
loss account and to create a special capital reserve against which goodwill
arising from any future acquisitions may be set off.
The company also proposes to adopt a new share option scheme to replace its
existing executive scheme.

FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Blagden shares dive 26p after warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Blagden Industries, the packaging and chemicals group, tumbled 26p
to 138p yesterday after the company warned that profits for the current year
were unlikely to exceed Pounds 2.5m.
The decline from the previous year's Pounds 7.63m reflects the intense
competitive pressures on the steel drum business within the group's
packaging division.
Blagden said trading conditions for the first half of 1993 had remained
substantially unchanged from those of the second half of last year.
However, since the announcement in August of halved interim profits of
Pounds 3m, prices of steel drums had fallen in Germany and this had led to
significant price reductions across Europe.
The company added that with the extra burden of the increased price of steel
(up about 4 per cent in the third quarter of 1993) operating margins had
been eroded.
This was, however, in common with its competitors in the European drum
market, where Blagden is a leading player in an industry burdened by
overcapacity.
In contrast, both the chemicals and protective equipment divisions continued
to trade well.
Blagden said it had identified further cost-cutting measures and a number of
business initiatives to improve longer-term profitability.
At the interim stage, the company stressed the need for 'prudent husbanding'
of resources, in cutting the dividend from 4.5p to 1.5p.

FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Greenwich Comms loss at Pounds 65,300
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Greenwich Communications, the USM-quoted supplier of satellite receiving
equipment, reported a slight increase in pre-tax losses from Pounds 57,500
to Pounds 65,300 in the year ended August 31, 1993.
Turnover dropped from Pounds 421,700 to Pounds 261,800, while at the
attributable level, after minorities, losses were cut to Pounds 59,700
(Pounds 63,000) or from 0.9p to 0.85p per share.
Mr Alfred Stirling, chairman, said that the Portuguese offshoot, Greenwich
Satellite Portugal LDA, was still suffering from recession.
In addition, NEC had decided to withdraw its satellite receiving products
during the year, but Greenwich was now awaiting the introduction of a new
product at the end of the year.
Possible litigation from former director Mr J Carrad and his wife, relating
to the company's investment in DRL Communications - now in receivership -
had not progressed much further, Mr Stirling said. An extension of time had
been granted to them, but full particulars of their claim had still not yet
been served.

FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Canadian Pizza to float with Pounds 34.5m
valuation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PRICE of 200p a share was fixed yesterday for the flotation of Canadian
Pizza valuing the pizza crust maker at Pounds 34.5m, almost Pounds 5m more
than estimated last month but Pounds 5m less than originally indicated by
the company's advisers in September.
Advisers said Mr Harry Kent, deputy chairman of the company and one of its
founders, as well as other shareholders, had been reluctant to see their
holdings diluted 'unnecessarily'.
Partly for this reason a factory the company was planning to build in
continental Europe would now be funded from cash generated internally and
debt. This accounted for most of the fall of Pounds 10m from the first
company valuation.
The Kent family, the largest shareholder, will have an 18 per cent interest
after the float, a reduction from 19.5 per cent.
The second valuation discrepancy was a function of strong institutional
demand for the shares.
Dealings in the shares are expected to start on Friday November 19.
On forecast pro-forma pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 3.35m (Pounds
2.21m) for 1993, the issue price gives a notional p/e of 15. The board
expects to recommend a final dividend of not less than 3.6p.
The total 5.9p dividend the directors would have recommended for the year
ending December 1993 would give a gross yield of 3.7 per cent. Pro-forma
earnings per share are 13.3p.
Of the 11.1m shares offered, 64 per cent of the enlarged capital, 68 per
cent are being placed firm with institutions and the balance placed subject
to clawback for the public offer for sale.
The money will be used to repay Pounds 2.5m in senior debt and redeem Pounds
11m in preference shares, including a 10 per cent premium. The float cost
Pounds 1m and the company will not be geared on quotation.
The last date for applications will be November 10, with dealing starting on
November 19.
COMMENT
The reluctance of existing shareholders to be diluted unecesssarily suggests
their awareness of the attractions of the business. However, the company's
relatively high pre-tax margins - 14.5 per cent last year going on 17 per
cent this year - makes its growing niche vulnerable to invasion by bigger
rivals. CP's biggest customers are the stingy supermarkets which account for
50 per cent of sales. But 84 per cent of the company's profits come from
crusts, a mere 12 per cent of a chilled pizza's retail selling price. The
rating, at a 14 per cent premium to the sector excluding Unilever, limits
scope for any significant initial rise.

FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Lloyd's trusts find favour with
institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S investment trusts issuing prospectuses yesterday reported strong
backing from institutional investors for their plans to raise corporate
capital for the insurance market.
Two of the funds - CLM Insurance Fund and Masthead Insurance Underwriting -
scaled down the size of their capital raising efforts because of
difficulties in obtaining sufficient capacity on 'good quality' Lloyd's
syndicates.
The London Insurance Market Investment Trust (Limit), sponsored by Samuel
Montagu and James Capel, successfully raised Pounds 280m for a fund which
will provide Pounds 480m in capacity for 98 syndicates.
Sir Laurie Magnus, a director of Samuel Montagu, said: 'It's firmly in the
bag'. The issue was fully subscribed, although Pounds 70m was placed subject
to a clawback provision which will allow Limit to satisfy applications under
the retail offer.
CLM Insurance Fund, which is supported by Sedgwick Group and Barclays de
Zoete Wedd, placed 80m shares and offered a further 30m shares for
subscription in an issue designed to raise a net Pounds 105.7m.
CLM scaled down its plans to raise up to Pounds 200m because of problems in
finding sufficient capacity on good quality Lloyd's syndicates.
Lord Rees, chairman, said the 'the fund was large enough to provide a good
spread of syndicates across a range of leading managing agents - yet small
enough to ensure we can be selective on behalf of our corporate members.'
Masthead Insurance Underwriting, an investment company sponsored by Hambros
Bank, said it had fully placed an issue designed to raise Pounds 43m with
institutional investors. Masthead is providing Pounds 75m in capacity for
between 20 and 25 syndicates.
'We are delighted with the support we have received from institutional
investors,' said Sir Jeffrey Bowman, chairman. Institutions would have
supported the Pounds 50m offer originally intended by Masthead. This had
been scaled down to take into account the 'availability of underwriting
capacity of the requisite quality,' added Sir Jeffrey.

FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Fenchurch pathfinder reveals strong profit
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FENCHURCH, the insurance broker which plans a stock market flotation later
this month, yesterday published its pathfinder prospectus and reported a
strong increase in profitability.
Operating profits from continuing operations increased by 44 per cent to
Pounds 6.9m in the year to September 30.
Interest payable on some Pounds 19.5m of debt - which will be repaid with
the proceeds of the flotation - and losses of Pounds 818,000 at the Lloyd's
agency business, which is to be demerged, depressed pre-tax profits to
Pounds 4.56m (Pounds 2.96m).
The group is planning a placing and intermediaries offer and will issue
listing particulars on November 17.
Dealings are expected to begin on November 26.
JO Hambro Magan is acting as financial adviser to Fenchurch and James Capel
is sponsor and underwriter of the issue.
Turnover from insurance broking increased to Pounds 28.4m (Pounds 25.3m),
offsetting a fall in investment income to Pounds 1.95m (Pounds 2.39m).
Turnover at the Lloyd's agency business fell to Pounds 2.83m (Pounds 3.84m).
Operating expenses in broking increased to Pounds 23.2m (Pounds 22.9m) and
to Pounds 3.65m (Pounds 3.23m) in the demerged agency business.
Profits on ordinary activities before interest payable rose from Pounds
5.49m to Pounds 6.15m. Interest payable fell to Pounds 1.59m (Pounds 2.53m).
Earnings per share improved from 7.3p to 12.9p, or adjusted, to 15.5p
(5.5p).

FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: ICI fails to agree BASF acrylics
acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICI's efforts to build a Europe-wide acrylics manufacturing empire collapsed
yesterday when talks over acquiring BASF's German acrylics business
collapsed.
Parallel talks on the sale of ICI polypropylene capacity to BASF are
unaffected, ICI said yesterday.
The two sides are understood to have disagreed over the valuation on the
acrylics business, which has a turnover of about Pounds 60m a year.
Such chemical sector valuations are notoriously difficult especially during
a recession: profits are low or negative, but recovery is in prospect. The
failure to agree on a deal is a blow to ICI's plans to buy acrylics capacity
in Germany but it makes only a small dent in the company's worldwide
acrylics business which has sales of more than Pounds 500m.
ICI has already this year added the acrylics side of US chemicals company Du
Pont to its portfolio. Du Pont's acrylics side had turnover last year of
about Pounds 200m. The assets, stock and goodwill of the business, which is
profitable, was estimated at Pounds 180m-Pounds 190m.

FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Scottish Metropolitan makes Pounds 26.8m
cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH METROPOLITAN Property, the property investment company which
incurred a heavy loss in 1991 and fired its managing director, is to raise
Pounds 26.8m through a rights issue.
The company reduced its property portfolio in the last 18 months to cut
borrowings, but now intends to expand again with acquisitions of about
Pounds 5m each in Scotland. It has abandoned speculative development which
led it into loss.
ScotMet incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.78m in the year to August 15
1993 on the basis of FRS 3 accounting which it has now adopted. This
compares with a loss of Pounds 3.91m on a restated basis for 1992.
Net asset value per share was 82.4p, compared with 108.1p a year earlier,
reflecting a deficit of Pounds 21.33m on valuation of investments at August
15 1993, and a one-off adjustment of Pounds 5.63m because of the accounting
policy change.
A final dividend of 1.1p per share (nil) making an unchanged 1.5p for the
year is propopsed.
After selling property worth Pounds 31.1m in the 1993 financial year,
ScotMet last month sold Saltire Court in Edinburgh for Pounds 53.1m, a
Pounds 6.5m surplus on book value.
Mr Scott Cairns, managing director, said that the sale unlocked the
company's new strategy and enabled it to have a 'voluntary refinancing.'
ScotMet's rights issue is on the basis of 1-for-3, priced at 85p each, a 20
per cent discount to Tuesday's closing price of 105p. Irrevocable
acceptances have been received for 44.7 per cent, and the balance is
underwritten by Kleinwort Benson.
The rights issue and the Saltire Court sale will leave ScotMet with
borrowings of Pounds 68.6m compared with Pounds 170.3m in August 1992.
Instead of borrowing from 18 banks, bank debt will be Pounds 5m and the
company has arranged a Pounds 57m facility from 10 UK banks.
COMMENT
The rights issue is the only way forward for ScotMet which strayed
disastrously from investing in existing properties, mostly in Scotland, into
speculative developments of inappropriate scale. Saltire Court brought
prestige but accounted for 20 per cent of its assets and took ages to fill
up. The fall in nav per share disappointed the market and with the rights
issue news, the shares dropped 9p to 96p. But property values are rising and
earnings per share next year could be 2.75p. That would give a prospective
p/e of about 35, roughly in line with the sector. The new ScotMet is not
going to be exciting but should be more reliable. The rights should be taken
up.

FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Search ends for new Clark chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SEARCH for a new chairman to head C&amp;J Clark, the private UK shoe company
whose shareholders narrowly rejected a Pounds 184m takeover bid earlier this
year, ended after four months yesterday with the appointment of Mr Roger
Pedder, a non-executive director and Clark family member.
Mr Pedder's appointment, replacing Mr Walter Dickson, is expected to
alleviate some of the tensions which have riven the family-owned company for
some time and culminated in an attempt to sell C&amp;J Clark earlier this year.
Family members rejected suggestions that his appointment had been fixed
before the selection process began. 'It was as fair and open as possible,'
said one. 'It was just considered he had the (appropriate) retailing
experience.'
There remain some, however, who appear to be unhappy with the decision to
appoint an insider. Mr Daniel Clark, a non-executive director and family
member who argued vehemently for a sale, announced his resignation
yesterday.
The role of the chief executive, Mr John Clothier, a family member who
aroused considerable controversy by backing efforts to sell the company, now
appears somewhat more secure since Mr Pedder's appointment.
Mr Pedder was one of five candidates. It is believed that one of those
shortlisted was Mr Rudolf Agnew, former chairman of Consolidated Goldfields
and now of TVS Entertainment.
The company is still searching for two non-executives, while a further two
will be nominated by a shareholder council representing family interests.
Clark's is 80 per cent owned by more than 500 family members.
The company, which has in recent years been hit by recession and hefty
reorganisation costs, returned to the black for the first half with pre-tax
profits of Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 4.1m loss). Sales grew from Pounds 300.7m to
Pounds 322.1m.

The offer consisted of a placing of 50.7m shares, 65 per cent firm with
institutions, and the rest - 17.76m shares - subject to clawback through the
public offer. There were over 45,000 requests for prospectuses from the
public. Demand from retail investors is expected to trigger the clawback in
full.
The issue price was 170p.

THE FURORE surrounding J Sainsbury's announcement that it was cutting prices
on 300 own-label lines obscured an 11 per cent rise in interim pre-tax
profits to Pounds 434m.
The figures for the 28 weeks to September 25 were broadly in line with
analysts' expectations but could not stop Sainsbury's shares falling 15p to
385p as the food retailing sector was hit by fears of a price war.
'These are really very good figures, which suggests that Sainsbury's was not
forced into launching its price campaign because it was losing sales,' said
one analyst. 'It has chosen to seize the initiative.'
Group turnover increased 10.9 per cent to Pounds 5,87bn, with total sales in
the UK up 9.1 per cent to Pounds 5.18bn.
Sales in the supermarkets division increased 8.9 per cent to Pounds 4.66bn,
with existing stores contributing 1.8 points of the increase and new space
7.1 points.
Grocery inflation is running at about 2 per cent, which means underlying
sales in Sainsbury's existing stores have fallen slightly since last year,
but Mr David Sainsbury, chairman, said it was not a cause for concern.
'Underlying sales have been going up only slightly or going down slightly
for the past 10 years,' he said. 'It's nothing new.'
Supermarket operating profits rose 13.3 per cent to Pounds 391.1m.
Mr Sainsbury said the company planned to continue opening between 20 and 23
supermarkets a year, but admitted the company was unlikely to enjoy the
sales growth it had in the past, increasing the importance of developing the
other businesses.
Savacentre, the hypermarket operation, increased sales 7.2 per cent to
Pounds 332.2m, with operating profits up 17.8 per cent to Pounds 19.1m.
Sainsbury opened its first new Savacentre for three years this year and said
it saw scope for expanding the chain from 10 stores to between 25 and 30.
Homebase, the DIY chain, increased sales by 14.7 per cent to Pounds 181.9m
and operating profits by 31.6 per cent to Pounds 11.9m.
In the US, which Sainsbury now sees as an important avenue for expansion,
the Shaw's supermarket chain lifted sales 4.2 per cent to Dollars 1.04bn,
(Pounds 680m) with operating profits up 17.7 per cent to Dollars 25.2m.
Earnings per share increased by 9 per cent to 16.34p, with the interim
dividend raised from 2.7p to 3p.

FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Yorkshire-Tyne Tees TV warns of fall into
loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YORKSHIRE-Tyne Tees Television, the big ITV contractor, warned yesterday
that it was likely to report a loss for the year to September 30.
The formal announcement, which led to a 4p drop in the share price to 172p,
confirmed persistent rumours that the advertising revenue for the year would
be lower than previously expected.
It is clear that Yorkshire's airtime has been sold in a way that tries to
pull forward revenue into the 1992-93 financial year by offering discounts.
At a board meeting on Tuesday it was decided that as much as Pounds 8.5m in
revenue should not be counted towards the 1992-93 revenues. At the same time
its share of total ITV advertising revenue has dropped from 11.2 per cent to
about 10.3 per cent. The target had been to boost it above 12 per cent, but
this was always seen as very ambitious.
The pressure on Yorkshire has been on since the beginning of the year when
the combined group started paying its bid price of Pounds 53.3m a year to
the Treasury.
Ms Katherine Pelly, television analyst at stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson who
issued a 'sell' notice on Yorkshire on October 19, called yesterday for
managerial changes at the top and said it would be 'impossible' for the
company to pay a final dividend.
There was no immediate sign yesterday that Mr Clive Leach, chairman and
chief executive, planned to step down but there was still uncertainty over
his long-term position.
The formal statement from Yorkshire, where Pearson, owner of the Financial
Times has a significant stake, said that the lower than expected advertising
revenue and exceptional costs relating to previously announced closures 'is
likely to result in the group reporting a loss' for the year.
Some City estimates of the loss head towards Pounds 20m although it is
likely that Yorkshire has made a good trading profit and that pre-tax losses
are unlikely to be higher than Pounds 5m.
The pressure to disclose the shortfall in advertising revenue flowed from
the replacement of the Yorkshire advertising sales house, Media and Airtime
Sales, with Laser, which took over formally on October 1.
Laser is a wholly owned subsidiary of London Weekend Television which
earlier this year bought a stake in Yorkshire. It is believed that Mr Greg
Dyke, the LWT chief executive and a Yorkshire director refused to accept the
additional revenue for the 1992-93 accounts.
The Yorkshire admission raises serious questions about how television
advertising is sold in the UK and how the price is set.
Mr Tim Wootton, managing director of TSMS, the advertising sales house
representing Central, Anglia and Ulster, said of Yorkshire's announcement:
'This is horrific news in terms of the credibility of ITV as a whole. We are
absolutely not in this position regarding any of our companies.'

FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Siebe seeks Pounds 184.3m via rights -
Acquisition of Eckardt is third continental European buy this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIEBE, the international controls and engineering group, yesterday launched
a Pounds 184.3m rights issue to buy Eckardt, a family controlled business in
Germany and the group's third acquisition in continental Europe this year.
The 1-for-10 issue is priced at 485p, a 14 per cent discount to the 565p at
which the shares closed on Tuesday. Siebe's shares rose 9p yesterday.
Mr Barrie Stephens, chairman and chief executive, said Eckardt, which makes
process automation and control systems, was being acquired because of its
fit with the European operations of Foxboro, the US business bought three
years ago for Dollars 650m.
Eckardt is a well-known name in control engineering and was called by one
analyst yesterday a 'small European Foxboro'. It will give Siebe an enlarged
European manufacturing base and access to a bigger pool of German
engineering expertise.
The company made a DM6.1m pre-tax loss in the year to December 31 1992 on
sales of DM230.7m, after charging DM7m above the line for restructuring.
Mr Allen Yurko, managing director and chief operating officer, said he was
confident Siebe could turn Eckardt into a significant profit and cash
generator within 18 months and that there was scope to reduce costs
substantially.
Siebe will be paying DM212.8m (Pounds 85.1m), including the assumption of
DM33.8m of debt. Initially the group will make a DM30m subscription for new
Eckardt shares, which will give it control and substantially repay bank
debt.
The German families, led by the Sieglin family, which control Eckardt have
asked to receive the balance of DM179m next October.
Siebe is also repaying debt taken on earlier this year when it paid Pounds
27.3m to buy two controls companies, Eberle in Germany and Schmidt in
Austria.
After the acquisitions Siebe will be left with cash of about Pounds 72m
which it will not be using to repay debt. Mr Stephens said Siebe was only
currently looking at one other potential acquisition, a small European
company in the controls field.
The group had not wanted to raise money via a placing, because that route
denied some shareholders the opportunity to sell rights in the market. To
have raised less than the amount implied by a 1-for-10 rights was not
practical or worth the cost, the advisers had said.
Gearing after the acquisitions will be no higher than 39 per cent, but
significantly lower after a fair value adjustment to reflect better a higher
value of Eckardt's assets.
Siebe said when it bought Foxboro and gearing rose to 100 per cent that it
would cut the debt equity ratio to below 55 per cent within three years. Mr
Stephens said Siebe had achieved this target on a pro-forma basis before the
two acquisitions earlier this year.
Eckardt makes gross margins of 35-40 per cent, has net book assets of
DM29.1m and substantial hidden assets on the balance sheet, Siebe says.
Mr Stephens said the deal would not be dilutive. The group says it expects
to achieve PBIT margins similar to the 19 per cent achieved at Foxboro
within 18 months.
Siebe is in its close period. But Mr Stephens said trading was currently on
target and the group continued to be cash generative. The company said it
would pay a 3.66p interim dividend - a 10 per cent rise - on the increased
shareholder base.
The purchase of Eckardt takes Siebe further into the controls business which
already accounts for 70 per cent of group sales of Pounds 1.6bn. The group
only entered this area in 1983.
The rights issue is fully underwritten by SG Warburg.

FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Embattled ICD loses Pounds 4.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Communication &amp; Data, the marketing services company,
yesterday showed the impact of its recent reorganisation reporting pre-tax
losses of Pounds 4.92m for the 15 months to May 31 compared with profits of
Pounds 1.13m for the previous year, writes Catherine Milton.
The board does not recommend a dividend and says it will 'strongly resist'
resolutions to be put to shareholders at a special meeting requisitioned by
a boarding party representing 12 per cent of the shares.
The resolutions propose the removal from the board of Mr David Cicurel,
chairman, Mr Ralph Elman, finance director, and Mr Daniel Unger, a
non-executive. The three would be replaced by nominees of the boarding party
grouped within PSB, a direct marketing company.
ICD made exceptional debits of Pounds 4.14m in provisions against trade
debtors. ICD also booked a write-down on assets and wrote off Pounds 993,378
in goodwill following the sale of its interest in Database Group.
Sales rose to Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 9.59m).
Losses per share were 8.51p compared with earnings of 2.12p.

FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Wigmore plans to raise Pounds 50m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WIGMORE Property Invest-ment Trust is attempting to raise up to Pounds 50m
via a placing and offer-for-subscription of shares at 100p, with warrants
attached on a 1-for-5 basis.
The trust will be managed by Baring Investment Management and will use
Baring, Houston &amp; Sanders as property adviser.
Wigmore will aim to outperform the FT-A Property Index by investing in
shares and other securities of UK property companies with market
capitalisations of less than Pounds 250m.
The principal holdings will be in property investment companies, but there
will be some holdings in development companies and up to 20 per cent of the
fund can be invested in special situations, such as joint ventures.
The 10 largest investments in the initial portfolio are expected to be: City
Site Estates, Chesterfield Properties, The Ex-Lands, Hemingway Properties,
London &amp; Associated Investment Trust, Olives Property, Prior, Southend
Property Holdings, Tops Estates and Town Centre Securities.
Institutional investors and some property companies have agreed to to
subscribe for 19.36m shares in return for cash and/or securities.
In a separate deal, 3.06m shares are being subscribed for by property
companies which have been given a cash election.
Under this arrangement, once sufficient funds have been raised, the property
companies will receive cash, rather than trust shares, in return for their
own shares.

FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: GEC will only bid for full control of
Ferranti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEC, which has proposed a 1p-a-share bid for Ferranti, has told Ferranti's
chairman Mr Eugene Anderson, that it is only interested in taking 100 per
cent control of the troubled defence electronics group.
Mr Anderson, responding to a series of questions raised by Mr John Katz, who
is representing some disgruntled Ferranti shareholders, said he had spoken
again to GEC about the possibility of leaving current shareholders with a
minority stake in a Ferranti which would be majority controlled by GEC.
'The answer was unequivocal,' Mr Anderson said. 'They will not bid for
anything less than 100 per cent of the equity. They believe that they need
this position in order to have the flexibility to take the actions necessary
to reverse the deterioration of Ferranti brought on by its weak balance
sheet and lack of liquidity.'
There are growing signs that some of Ferranti's 48,000 individual
shareholders are deeply unhappy with the GEC offer. This, together with
Ferranti's complex share structure, has raised doubts over whether GEC will
be successful in winning the backing of investors holding 90 per cent of the
equity and raised hopes among some investors that GEC might settle for
becoming the majority shareholder.
However, Mr Anderson made it clear yesterday that GEC has reiterated that it
will only go forward with the bid 'if it receives 90 per cent acceptances' -
the minimum percentage required under company law to compulsorily purchase
the rest.
Meanwhile Mr Katz has invited Mr Anderson to make a presentation to
disgruntled Ferranti shareholders at a meeting he is planning to hold to
discuss their campaign.
Mr Katz, who has received hundreds of telephone calls from anxious
individual Ferranti shareholders, said yesterday that he hoped to arrange
the meeting to give them the chance to air their views.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Queens Moat has say on valuations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO firms of chartered surveyors under scrutiny for valuing Queens Moat
Houses' assets at figures that differed by nearly Pounds 500m used the same
basis to prepare their figures, the company said yesterday.
Both Weatherall Green &amp; Smith and Jones Lang Wootton compiled their
valuations on an open market, willing seller basis, Mr Andrew Coppel, QMH's
chief executive said yesterday.
Weatherall produced a final valuation of Pounds 1.35bn for the 1992
accounts. Within four months, Jones had submitted an alternative figure of
Pounds 861m based on the same financial information.
The details will add to the controversy following the release of QMH's
restated 1991 and 1992 figures, which has triggered an examination of the
two firm's valuation certificates by the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors.
Mr Barry Clarke, RICS assistant secretary general, said a decision was
expected 'within days' from its assets valuation standards team.
QMH issued a statement yesterday and wrote a letter to RICS clarifying the
position. It said Weatherall had prepared a 1991 valuation of Pounds 2bn and
a draft valuation for 1992 of Pounds 1.86bn. The latter was presented to
banks in April this year and did not take into account the changed
circumstances of the group.
At the board's request, Weatherall supplied a revised figure in May of
Pounds 1.35bn, qualified because it was based on unaudited financial
information.
In June the board commissioned Jones to produce a new valuation. Its Pounds
861m figure was delivered in September and accepted by the board. It is
believed that the professional fees for the two firms were in excess of
Pounds 500,000.
When asked whether the board was tempted to encourage the surveyors to
produce a lower valuation figure, Mr Coppel replied: 'Absolutely not. It
would not have been in shareholders' interests to minimise the valuation.'
It also emerged yesterday that Mr Donald Jackson, who used to work for Bird
Luckin, QMH's former auditor, carried out tax work for the company after
retiring. And both Mr Allan Porter, former deputy finance director, and Mr
Maurice Hart, a former non-executive director, had previously worked for
Bird Luckin.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Filling the aisles by selling them cheap: Guy de Jonquieres
examines Sainsbury's price offensive and change of direction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J Sainsbury, Britain's largest supermarket chain, yesterday shook the food
retailing sector by unveiling a two-pronged strategy to deal with what it
admitted were big - and possibly long-lasting - changes in the country's
grocery market.
The group's most dramatic step has been to intensify industry competition by
lowering the prices of 300 popular own-label lines. It has also signalled a
longer-term shift by admitting that its core UK grocery business will expand
more slowly. It said it would seek more growth from other types of
retailing, at home and overseas.
Mr David Sainsbury, chairman, said that although the company planned 23 new
stores this year, 'we won't be able to get the sales increases in percentage
terms that we have had in the past'. Capital spending totalled Pounds 431m
in the first half, and the group expects to become cash-positive in the next
two years.
Mr Sainsbury said the latest price cuts could force a response from
manufacturers, as well as other retailers. The prices of manufacturers'
branded products would 'have to come down very significantly to compete'.
Sainsbury's claims that 150 of its best-selling own-label lines are already
23 per cent cheaper on average than comparable branded products sold by Kwik
Save, the leading discount chain.
Some observers were surprised at the vigour of Sainsbury's initiative, since
its first half sales and profits suggest that it has been little affected by
discount competition.
But Mr Sainsbury said an opportunity to expand own-label sales had been
created by rivals' decisions to switch their marketing emphasis from quality
to low prices.
Sainsbury's move reflects growing confidence in the strength of its brand.
Its own-label lines account for 57 per cent of its packaged grocery sales,
the highest of any UK supermarket chain.
The shift of approach follows a reassessment of strategic priorities in the
year since Mr Sainsbury became chairman.
His management style is more open and less autocratic than that of his
predecessor, his cousin Lord Sainsbury. He is also more ready to acknowledge
doubts in the City about the prospects for grocery retailing.
'Clearly there are worries. Anyone who said there was not an issue about
discounters, about warehouse clubs, about how far development can go, would
not be living in the real world.'
He saw similarities with conditions in the late 1970s, when food retailers
were mauled by cut-throat price competition. 'We're clearly now back in a
period when people are again talking about discounting and price wars.'
He believed the problems were due chiefly to the economic cycle, not to a
permanent change in consumer psychology. However, he saw little evidence of
rapid recovery and said Sainsbury's was ready for a long period of severe
price competition.
One option was to expand its chain of 10 Savacentre hypermarkets, which sell
clothing, food and household products at small discounts. The company had
originally considered building 15 such stores but now believed there was
scope for 25.
Mr Sainsbury claimed to be unworried by the threat from US warehouse clubs,
such as Costco, which last month defeated a legal attempt by Sainsbury's,
Tesco and Argyll to prevent it opening outlets in Britain.
He said warehouse clubs relied on a 'fragile' trading formula, and
Sainsbury's had learned much about competing with them from Shaw's, its US
supermarket chain. One lesson was that other retailers could match the
clubs' price advantage by buying their products more cheaply in bulk
'multi-packs'.
But irrespective of conditions in the UK market, Mr Sainsbury said 'the
logic of the business' would drive Sainsbury's to become more international
in the next five years, with a strong emphasis on expansion in the US.
That trend stemmed in part from the prospect of slower growth and reduced
investment needs in Sainsbury's UK grocery business.
Though Mr Sainsbury dismissed suggestions that the UK market was in danger
of saturation, he said the annual rate of store opening would not exceed
this year's level and might well fall later in the decade.
Though the speed of international expansion would depend on finding the
right opportunities, as much as 20 per cent of group turnover could come
from overseas by the end of the decade, compared with 11 per cent last year.
Its experience with Shaw's had convinced Sainsbury's that it could
successfully transfer its expertise abroad. Mr Sainsbury gave no details of
how the group planned to develop overseas, though his first choice was the
US rather than continental Europe.
He would prefer to grow organically, rather than by acquisition, and to
expand into markets contiguous with Shaw's base in New England.
Mr Sainsbury's other medium-term priorities were to improve the efficiency
of supplier relationships and emphasise 'social responsibility' issues, such
as the environment. 'These are the areas where we have to demonstrate in the
next five years that we are really ahead of all our competitors,' he said.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Alcazar to choose US partner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERGER negotiations between Swissair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian
Airlines System (SAS), and Austrian Airlines are expected to enter a
decisive stage this weekend.
Although no deadline has been set, the four carriers are hoping to resolve
the last significant issue threatening their four airline co-operation
project called Alcazar. This involves the choice of a US airline partner for
the Alcazar group.
Mr Otto Loepfe, Swissair's chief executive, yesterday said a breakthrough
could be achieved during talks in Stockholm this week. However, Mr Jan
Carlzon, the former SAS president who stepped down last month to devote all
his efforts to the Alcazar project, also warned yesterday he would leave SAS
if the co-operation talks were to fail, in remarks clearly designed to
accelerate negotiations.
Mr Carlzon said the choice of a US airline partner was 'the only real large
question that can still endanger Alcazar'.
The problem has been made more difficult because three of the European
carriers have links with US airlines: KLM with Northwest Airlines, Swissair
with Delta Air Lines, and SAS with Continental Airlines.
But sources close to the negotiations said yesterday it would be 'tragic' if
the US airline issue were to lead to a collapse of the proposed partnership
to form a fourth airline force in Europe designed to compete against the big
European carriers including British Airways, Lufthansa of Germany and Air
France.
They emphasised that the four European airlines already agreed on several
difficult issues including the valuation of assets, headquarter location for
the new company, and joint management structure.
Co-operation is understood to account for most of the Dollars 1bn (Pounds
600m) benefits, with the US partner playing a minor role.

FT  04 NOV 93 / M&amp;S up 21% as price freeze pays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE day J Sainsbury said it was reducing prices on key lines, Marks and
Spencer claimed success for its own strategy of trimming gross margins and
sharpening prices, as it announced a 21 per cent increase in interim
profits.
Pre-tax profits were a record Pounds 307.8m, about Pounds 10m higher than
the most optimistic forecasts. M&amp;S shares improved 7p to 403p - in sharp
contrast to shares in the food retailing sector - and several of its
suppliers also enjoyed share price gains.
Sir Richard Greenbury, M&amp;S chairman, said he believed 'value and quality
have never been as important as they are now'.
'Over the last 12 months or so we have reduced margins to sharpen our
prices. The result of that has been that as consumers came out of the
trenches they started to spend more with us.'
The company launched its 'Outstanding Value' campaign a year ago, when it
froze the prices of three-quarters of its goods, and cut prices for the
remaining 25 per cent.
Sir Richard said that while some prices had since increased, others had been
reduced, and clothing prices overall remained broadly unchanged since last
year.
Price increases in the food operation had been held to a little over 1 per
cent.
He refused to reveal how much gross margins had fallen, or to speculate on
how long M&amp;S would hold present prices or continue to reduce gross margins.
Such judgments, he said, depended on factors including the Budget and its
effect on the UK economy, and on what happened to retail price inflation.
He was also sceptical about claims that UK retailing was seeing a
fundamental shift away from focusing on margins towards a volume-led
approach more akin to that in the US.
'There are an awful lot of retailers, including those who pontificate the
most, who keep talking about bringing margins down to drive volumes, but
don't actually make any more profit,' he said.
Group sales at M&amp;S were up nearly 9 per cent to Pounds 2.87bn. Sales in the
UK and Republic of Ireland were up nearly 7 per cent to Pounds 2.40bn, with
operating profits 23 per cent ahead at Pounds 295.9m.
Turnover in continental Europe increased from Pounds 97m to Pounds 106.5m.
But while operating profits rose 42 per cent to Pounds 9.9m, the comparison
was flattered by the devaluation of sterling and the inclusion of
substantial store opening costs in last year's figures. Sir Richard said the
economic outlook remained gloomy.
Sales and operating profits increased at both Brooks Bros and Kings Super
Markets in the US, but sales fell and losses increased slightly in Canada.
A continued strong performance in the Far East contributed to a 29 per cent
increase in total turnover for the rest of the world to Pounds 275.6m, with
operating profits increasing from Pounds 6.1m to Pounds 8.7m.
The interim dividend was lifted from 2.2p to 2.5p, payable from earnings up
20.6 per cent to 7.6p.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Financial services help BAT shrug off cigarette price war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries increased pre-tax profits by 24 per cent to Pounds 1.36bn for
the nine months to September 30. Recovery in the group's financial services
more than offset the growing impact of the US cigarette price war on tobacco
profits.
Brown &amp; Williamson, the US tobacco subsidiary, reported a 70 per cent fall
in profits during the third quarter as retailers and wholesalers reduced
orders until lower prices took effect. B &amp; W's profits for the nine months
were 50 per cent down.
Mr Martin Broughton, chief executive, said US cigarette prices were now more
stable. The price gap between premium cigarettes and economy brands had been
cut from Dollars 8 to Dollars 4 a carton.
With the prospect of a sharp rise in federal tax in October next year, Mr
Broughton said manufacturers' price increases could not be ruled out. He
also launched a sharp attack on US legislation requiring cigarette makers to
use 75 per cent US-grown tobacco in their products, calling it 'a flagrant
breach of Gatt rules'.
BAT's overall tobacco profits rose from Pounds 877m to Pounds 889m, but
declined 14 per cent if a Pounds 135m gain from an exchange of cigarette
brands with American Brands, the US tobacco and drinks group, is excluded.
Operations in Germany suffered from recession and increased smuggling,
particularly from Poland, but cigarette exports from the UK continued to
rise and higher profit contributions came from Australia, Canada, and most
African and Asian markets.
Profits from continuing financial services operations increased by Pounds
203m to Pounds 593m, with the contribution from the group's life companies
growing by 13 per cent to Pounds 229m.
Total underwriting losses on continued business at Eagle Star fell to Pounds
100m, from Pounds 244m. Both personal and commercial lines in the UK showed
substantial improvement in underwriting results. Underwriting losses from
domestic mortgage indemnity business amounted to Pounds 26m for the quarter.
The result was marred by a high level of claims from discontinued activities
at Eagle Star. Provisions on financial insurance business - mainly
commercial mortgage indemnity and agency pool business - amounted to Pounds
94m, compared with Pounds 57m at the half-way stage.
Allied Dunbar's contribution to trading profit increased by 17 per cent to
Pounds 109m, while the contribution of Farmers' grew by 8 per cent to Pounds
328m.
Earnings per share grew 56 per cent to 29.3p for the nine months.

FT  04 NOV 93 / CD group faces legal action over unauthorised recordings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRING International, the budget price compact disc company being floated
next month, faces legal action for allegedly selling unauthorised recordings
of Olivia Newton John, Cat Stevens, Bob Marley and other artists.
Tring, whose chairman is Mr Alan Wheatley, former chairman of venture
capital group 3i, is also being sued for allegedly passing off one of its
CDs as being by the artist Chris de Burgh. The recording was actually made
by a group called the Ron David Orchestra.
Mr Wheatley, who is a non-executive director of the Forte hotel group,
British Steel, and financial institutions NM Rothschild and Legal &amp; General,
was unavailable for comment.
Mr Mark Frey, Tring's joint chief executive, said all the complaints were
being investigated and the company's policy was to withdraw the music
concerned from sale. He said Tring had always paid royalties to companies it
believed held copyrights.
He said that the actions would not have a material effect on Tring's
profits, which were Pounds 3.3m pre-tax last year; nor would it affect the
planned flotation, which he expects to value the company at Pounds 45m.
The company, whose CDs usually sell for Pounds 2.99, had about 800 titles in
its catalogue, he said. The legal actions affected only a small proportion
of those.
He added: 'Litigation on copyright is an ongoing thing. Every company in
this business is involved in litigation.'
Record groups that have served writs on Tring include PolyGram, EMI Records
and MCA. MCA alleges Tring has sold unauthorised recordings from the musical
Chess. Mr Frey said Tring was in dispute with MCA over who owned the
copyright. Chris de Burgh is also suing the company, as is A&amp;M, part of
PolyGram.
Chris de Burgh says in his writ that Tring has sold CDs and tapes with
covers containing his name in large letters along with the words 'The Lady
in Red', one of his works. He said that at the top of the cover were the
words, in extremely small print: 'The Instrumental Hits of'.
Mr Frey said the recording had been withdrawn and reissued to make clear
that Chris de Burgh did not appear on it.
Island Records, also part of PolyGram, alleges that Tring sold unauthorised
recordings of Bob Marley and Cat Stevens. Mr Frey said he was confident
Tring held proper title to the Bob Marley recordings and that he was
counter-suing Island.
He said Tring would defend its right to the Cat Stevens recordings, but
those had been withdrawn from sale. He said the company had withdrawn its
Olivia Newton John recordings from sale. EMI is suing Tring over the
recordings.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Mercedes returns to motor racing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERCEDES-BENZ, the German luxury car producer currently losing money and
cutting tens of thousands of jobs, is launching one of the most ambitious
international motor sport programmes to be undertaken by any carmaker in
recent years.
It is officially re-entering grand prix racing next year for the first time
since 1954. The following year it will also start competing in North
America's rival to grand prix, IndyCar racing. And it is to use its new
smallest C-class model for an official attack on the illustrious German
touring car championship.
While the move is likely to be criticised in some German quarters as
inappropriate at a time of crisis, Mercedes executives justify it on the
ground that it is essential to reinforce Mercedes' now threatened image as a
technology leader at a time of increasingly severe competition from rival -
particularly Japanese - luxury carmakers.
The move into North American motor racing, in particular, is seen as almost
unavoidable given that both Honda and Toyota are planning to make their
IndyCar debuts next year. North America is by far the world's biggest luxury
car market.
Like virtually every other carmaker participating in motor sport, Mercedes
yesterday gave no indication of the programme's likely costs. Motor sport is
one of the most expensive of all promotional and marketing activities, with
leading grand prix teams such as Williams or McLaren requiring at least
Pounds 20m to operate for a season.
Mercedes' grand prix and IndyCar involvement will be mainly through the
supply of engines, in the same way as Renault and Ford supply engines to the
Williams and Benetton teams respectively.
Mercedes is relying not on German expertise but the UK's world-leading motor
sport industry. It is buying an equity stake in Ilmor Engineering, the small
Northampton-based engine specialist, which has been supplying the Swiss
Sauber team in grand prix this year.

FT  04 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Marks and Spencer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Virtue would seem to have found its reward since Marks and Spencer announced
its full-year figures in May. Having been criticised through the recession
for static sales, Marks' Outstanding Value campaign delivered growth last
year. The knockers then lighted on the company's annual pay award, despite
assurances that productivity gains would offset the costs. This they duly
did with staff numbers falling by 4 per cent during the last six months
despite the new store opening programme. While it is true that the wage
award only cut in half way through the current period, the cost base is
still under control. The shares have justifiably done well.
Fears now centre on Marks' food business since live ammunition is being
fired in the supermarket price war. Clearly M&amp;S cannot defy gravity. Yet it
has a small, if profitable, niche which does not overlap strongly with the
majority of the grocers' business. It makes little sense for the
supermarkets to attack it, and if they did Marks' lower cost base and focus
would prove good defences. Besides, entering the market would not be easy as
much of the specialist food manufacturing capacity is already tied up by
M&amp;S.
Cost control, further benefits from high spending on information technology
and the sales drive should keep earnings bubbling. M&amp;S is well positioned to
benefit from the much-touted virtuous circle of lower costs, lower margins
and rising volumes. Even if the company's cautious view of 1994 proves
correct, dividend growth prospects justify a premium rating. And since the
shares are still towards the lower end of their historical rating range,
sceptics have a tough case to make.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The US cigarette price war is starting to take a perceptible toll on BAT
which suffered a 26 per cent fall in overall tobacco profits in the third
quarter. While the drop was broadly in line with expectations, considerable
uncertainty still clouds the outlook. There is unlikely to be a new year
price rise in the US, so retailers are unlikely to build up much by way of
stocks in the current quarter. That could lead to a profits shortfall larger
than the Pounds 75m already seen in the first half. With the prospect of a
federal excise tax of up to 75 cents a pack from next October, the chances
of price recovery in the US look slim in 1994. Meanwhile, the German market
is under pressure, partly as a result of smuggled imports from Poland, and
Latin America is no longer showing its customary growth.
Since tobacco earnings are unlikely to revive quickly, the recent rally in
the shares may have already discounted much of the recovery in financial
services. The tax rate will be higher next year, too, as the effect of the
enhanced scrip dividend falls away. At least BAT is now making good profits
in the UK, which allows it to be generous on the dividend front without
incurring fresh ACT problems.

FT  04 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Siebe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Siebe appears to have struck it lucky with Eckardt. Its German acquisition
is a good fit with Foxboro and will enhance its position in the European
controls market. Moreover, a price of only 92 per cent of turnover looks an
extraordinary bargain, despite Eckardt's small loss last year. Both its cost
base and its depreciation rate must look unnaturally high to Siebe, so there
is plenty of room for margin enhancement, even if some of it is cosmetic.
Yet for all this, the acquisition is not exactly a quantum leap. Eckardt's
turnover was less than 6 per cent of Siebe's last year.
The suspicion that Siebe has more acquisitions in mind is increased by the
fact that its rights issue is raising Pounds 72m more than it needs and that
the excess will be kept in cash rather than used to pay down debts. It may
simply be a question of in-fill acquisitions, but Siebe will have to watch
its use of provisions if this is its chosen route to growth. And it probably
requires something more substantial to generate the critical mass needed to
confront the likes of Honeywell.
That is why Eckardt could be useful in another way. Since its German owners
account in a particularly conservative way, Siebe may be able to write up
its stated DM29m (Pounds 11.7m) net assets considerably once they are
absorbed into its balance sheet. Presumably it will also follow its
controversial practice of adding intangible assets as well. Siebe's gearing
would then fall well below the 39 per cent it forecast yesterday. It could
then swallow a pretty large morsel without tapping shareholders for more.

FT  04 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: The grocers' bun fight
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
J Sainsbury's price offensive threatens to turn the food retailers' stock
market retreat into a rout. The company has footled around before with
price-cutting campaigns, but there is little doubt this is the real thing.
By chopping the prices of 300 own-label lines for the foreseeable future,
Sainsbury is sacrificing gross margin without much clue whether this can be
recovered in higher sales. There is now no knowing where this downward
spiral in the industry's margins will end.
The move will undoubtedly strengthen Sainsbury's position as market leader.
It re-emphasises Sainsbury's high quality brand, which represents its most
important competitive advantage. Moreover, the move is adroitly timed - just
before Christmas - and will tie up additional own-label manufacturing
capacity, making it hard for rivals to respond. Weaker competitors will
either suffer intense margin pain or lose sales.
Sainsbury's aggression, though, may only ensure it emerges as the least bad
loser. With much of its Pounds 2bn rights issue proceeds left to play with,
the industry is now in danger of wrecking its returns by ploughing on with
self-defeating expansion plans. With the sector trading on a historic
multiple of 12, the market already considers the grocers incapable of
sustaining much earnings growth. They might be doing shareholders a favour
by accepting that reality, halting their development programmes, running
their stores for cash and slashing their generous dividend cover. By giving
them low multiples and high yields, the market seems increasingly to view
grocers as utility stocks. Perhaps it is time they took the hint.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Housing market falters as new mortgages fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECOVERY in the housing market is faltering, according to figures for
mortgage lending released yesterday by the Bank of England.
The news will increase pressure on Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, not to
restrict further the scope or availability of mortgage interest relief in
the Budget, because of the likely impact on the housing market.
Figures for the third quarter of the year show that the number and value of
new loans approved fell around 10 per cent compared with the previous three
months.
Some Pounds 13.5bn in 257,000 new loans was approved in the third quarter,
compared with Pounds 15bn in 281,000 new loans from April through to the end
of June.
The figures also underline the message in other recently published
statistics, that the banks are increasing their share of the mortgage market
against the building societies.
While the building societies had higher gross lending than the banks -
Pounds 8.4bn against Pounds 5.9bn - their amount of net lending was Pounds
2.8bn while the banks' net lending was Pounds 3.2bn. The difference between
the two sets of figures represents the extent to which mortgages have been
cancelled.
'The figures suggest that building societies are not holding on to customers
as well as they might do,' one industry expert said.
The weakening of the market compared with the more optimistic signs earlier
in the year comes despite continuing low interest rates.
Last week the Council of Mortgage Lenders, which represents building
societies and centralised lenders such as banks, warned Mr Clarke that the
housing market was on a knife-edge.
'Consumers remain wary of committing themselves to house purchase ahead of
the Budget,' Mr Adrian Coles, the Council's director-general, said
yesterday.
Lord Inchrya, the director-general of the British Bankers' Association, said
that the reason for the banks' success in raising their market share was the
popularity of fixed-rate mortgages, which accounted for 60 per cent of the
lending.
Total mortgage advances for the third quarter were Pounds 14.9bn compared
with Pounds 14.4bn in the second quarter. Net lending rose to Pounds 5.5bn,
up from Pounds 4.6bn in the second quarter. While the figures for the third
quarter are higher than those for the same period last year, 1992 figures
were affected by the drop in activity after the mid-August end to the
holiday from stamp duty.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Democrats in retreat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REPUBLICANS did well in Tuesday's state, city and local elections in the
US. They replaced Democratic governors in New Jersey and Virginia, unseated
the Democratic mayor of New York, and emerged victorious in several smaller
contests. These were not national ballots but the outcome will make it more
difficult for President Bill Clinton to get his legislation through
Congress. The tide of political opinion is clearly not running his way.
It is true that local factors play a larger part in US local elections than
they do in their counterparts in many European countries. New York's
outgoing mayor, David Dinkins, who lost by a whisker, was not an outstanding
success in a job that may be impossible to do well. New Jersey's outgoing
Democratic governor, Jim Florio, who also lost by a slim margin, had
increased taxation and incurred the wrath of the National Rifle Association.
In Virginia the Republican, George Allen, won by a convincing 58 to 41 per
cent, but the vote was influenced by support for religious fundamentalism.
Party allegiance does, however, count for something, perhaps more than many
Americans believe. Democrats are still governors in 29 of the 50 states.
They control an overwhelming majority of US city halls, in spite of losing
Los Angeles earlier in the year. In off-year elections there is often a
swing against the party that controls the White House, as even President
Ronald Reagan discovered shortly after taking office. Added to that, the
electoral mood this year is against incumbency itself. In Maine and New York
City the voters approved limits on the number of terms any one
representative could serve.
The danger for President Clinton is that while there are more Democrats
around there are more who can be turfed out. The big test will come next
year, when there will be gubernatorial contests in 36 states, and a third of
the senate and the entire lower house will be re-elected. The swing of the
pendulum alone suggests that the Democrats are likely to be the loser in
these mid-term elections. If Mr Clinton is to rely on what is at best a
tenuous party allegiance in Congress he must try to get as many votes
through Congress as he can during the coming year.
One important vote is due in a fortnight, when the lower house will decide
on ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement. There is no
doubt that the US economy would benefit from Nafta, but in particular areas
there are fears about the exportation of jobs across what would be a
barrier-free border with Mexico. Several head-counts suggest that before
this week's Republican triumphs support for Nafta in the lower house was
short of victory by some 50 votes. Tuesday's results will have made some
individual congressmen and women more nervous about their re-election next
year. Much work will have to be done by President Clinton between now and
November 17 if the passage of the Nafta deal is to be assured.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Observer: Kohl shoulder
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl needs all the help he can get when it comes to sewing
west and east Germany back together again. But there is one worthy endeavour
with which he is unlikely to have much truck.
Launched today in Bonn, the National Foundation for Germany is the
brainchild of two men who rank among Kohl's most seasoned political rivals -
ex-chancellor Helmut Schmidt, now displaying almost Bismarckian
curmudgeonliness at the age of 74, and Kurt Biedenkopf, the prime minister
of the east German state of Saxony.
Biedenkopf may be a member of the chancellor's own party, but he shares with
Schmidt the belief that Kohl's blind spot over the extraordinary cost of
unification has greatly exacerbated the country's problems. Mere mention of
Biedenkopf's name has been known to send Kohl puce with indignation.
The foundation, to be based in Weimar, will specialise in that worthy German
occupation of organising debates and study groups to ponder the country's
future.
Schmidt, who has fairly piled up the cash since leaving the chancellorship
11 years ago thanks to the success of his books, is putting DM1m into the
organisation.
Similar contributions are expected from the likes of Hermann Josef Abs,
former chief executive of Deutsche Bank, and Gerd Bucerius, founder of the
newspaper Die Zeit.
A fund-raiser in Berlin at the end of the month aims to swell the coffers
further.
No surprise that it is president Richard von Weizsacker rather than the
chancellor hosting the occasion.

Napoleon's ghost must be smiling on the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development's choice of Jacques de Larosiere to succeed Jacques Attali as
its president.
After all, Bonaparte's main criterion for choosing generals was that they
must be lucky, and, unlike his predecessor, the new president looks to be
fortunate even in his misfortunes.
Witness the effect on the media of his recent arrival at the IMF annual
meeting in an ordinary Washington DC taxicab. The press applauded it as an
admirable contrast with Attali's love of limousines and private jets.
Alas, it now transpires that the cab journey was not a deliberate symbol of
the dawning of a new age of austerity at the bank. The IMF had in fact laid
on a limo to collect de Larosiere at Dulles airport, but the chauffeur
failed to recognise the former Banque de France governor and drove away
without him.
Privately, he was not amused.

<TEXT>
John Katz, the research consultant who emerged from obscurity to marshal
opposition to PosTel's bid for property company Greycoat, has had to attend
to a spot of administration in the past week. For he has been besieged by
disgruntled Ferranti shareholders, seizing on him as their possible saviour
in fighting the 1p-a-share offer from GEC.
Operating from a PO Box in Richmond, Surrey, with just one line for the
phone and fax, John Katz &amp; Associates has this week procured itself an
answering service, ordered two extra telephone lines, and started making
inquiries as to whether it needs regulatory authorisation if it decides to
take the Ferranti case further.
Katz, it emerges, is essentially a one-man-band, but he has obviously used
his scarce resources to considerable effect.
One merchant banker, slightly bewildered by the following he has built up,
says the Katz technique is to bombard his prey with faxes. 'God knows what
he did before the machine was invented,' observes this particular victim.
A barrister who qualified in South Africa, Katz has lived in the UK since
1979, initially working as European marketing manager of a subsidiary of
Anglo American.
Later, investing his own funds in the stock market, he extended his advice
to 'a select group' of clients, his speciality being undervalued shares. He
was roped into Greycoat because one such client, a Rolls-Royce dealer in
Putney, had got involved with the company at his recommendation.
'So there was a measure of commitment for the advice I had previously
given,' he remarks. Now he has warmed to the cause: 'The arrogance which
merchant banks and directors adopt in these circumstances is very damaging'.
It would certainly seem that Greycoat's advisers, Rothschild, seriously
underestimated Katz, an unknown in the City hitherto. SG Warburg, advisers
to GEC, take note.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Reluctant to walk the gangplank: Hugh Carnegy says the
debate over the Volvo-Renault merger symbolises Sweden's vexed attitude to
the EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volvo has always been close to the hearts of Swedes, remarked a hard-pressed
company spokesman this week. It was, he said, 'normal, natural and fair'
that an emotional national debate had sprung up over the plan to subsume
Volvo's quintessentially Swedish cars into a junior partnership with mighty
state-owned Renault of France.
By the same token, the vexed question of whether Volvo's shareholders should
approve the merger with Renault has come to symbolise a broader argument
over Swedish attitudes towards the country's role in the wider world - and
in particular its application to join the European Community.
Like the recession-battered country as a whole, Volvo is just recovering
from a traumatic three years dominated by losses. Just as the nation's
political leaders have decided membership of the EC is essential to the
future economic and political well-being of Sweden, so the Volvo board has
decided the long-term survival of its core car and truck-making operations
depends upon a strategic link with a big European partner.
But to what degree does opposition to the Volvo-Renault deal really mirror
an apparently solidifying resistance in the country to the notion of EC
membership? And, in a wider sense, do both concerns signal a tendency in
Sweden to turn inwards in response to what is the worst economic slump in 50
years?
Professor Assar Lindbeck of Stockholm University, Sweden's leading
economist, believes that the nationalistic element in the fight against the
Volvo-Renault merger only emerged seriously after substantive objections
were raised by shareholders, not vice-versa. He says the core issues in the
opposition revolve around the industrial strategy behind the deal and the
role of the French government as the owner of the merged company - not
foreign ownership.
'I don't think feelings about foreign control are any greater in Sweden than
anywhere else - possibly less. What matters in this case is the involvement
of a foreign government with protectionist instincts. French governments
have been more interventionist than Swedish governments have been.
'If the French government had not been involved I don't think the merger
would have become an issue in the country.'
It is true that the mainstream political parties and, crucially, the
majority of trade unions, have supported the Volvo-Renault deal. The LO, the
confederation of blue-collar unions, has not flinched in the face of a media
campaign to prevent Volvo being 'sold out', saying more foreign investment
is needed to secure jobs in Sweden, not less.
Nevertheless, nationalistic overtones have become prominent in the Volvo
debate. Svenska Dagbladet, the respected conservative newspaper which is
normally vigorously against state intervention, has called for Prime
Minister Carl Bildt's right-centre government to step in to stop the deal in
its present form. 'Just as Renault is important to France, so Volvo is for
Sweden,' is the mantra of the paper's chief economic commentator, Mr Peter
Malmqvist.
Mr Olav Ehrenkrona, Mr Bildt's senior domestic policy adviser, says Svenska
Dagbladet's stance on Volvo is indicative of the strains Swedish society has
been under in recent years as recession and reforms have eroded the old
comfortable certainties of the country's strong industrial base and
elaborate welfare system.
'It is very difficult for people to stick to principles when those
principles lead to painful results you did not expect,' he says.
The pain he refers to extends far beyond the unedifying sight of a treasured
national symbol such as Volvo sliding under foreign control. Three years of
slump, in which the economy has shrunk by more than 5 per cent, have heavily
battered the 'Swedish model'.
Unemployment, once below 5 per cent, has leapt up to more than 13 per cent
of the workforce. Real wages and disposable income have fallen. A
combination of rapidly deteriorating public finances and politically
motivated reforms has led to lower unemployment benefits, higher healthcare
and education charges and much tighter sick leave rules.
At the same time, Sweden's traditionally liberal refugee policies have led
to a surge in foreign newcomers recently, with at least 70,000 citizens of
the former Yugoslavia alone set to settle in the country over the next
couple of years. Their arrival in the middle of a severe downturn has
sparked unprecedented levels of anti-immigrant feeling. It is mild by the
standards of Germany or France, but weekend riots by right-wing racist
groups in industrial centres such as Gothenburg and Trollhatten are no
longer unusual.
'Sweden has been a very homogeneous place,' says Mr Olle Wastberg, until
recently senior aide to Mrs Anne Wibble, the finance minister, and now
editor in chief of Expressen, a top-selling tabloid newspaper. 'Now people
in the streets and in small towns are seeing people who are very foreign to
them. It is taking time to get used to it, especially in a recession.'
Such trends have tended to reinforce the argument against Swedish membership
of the EC. Membership is seen as representing a further dilution of Swedish
identity, opening the way to more foreign influence and a flight of more
jobs abroad. Recent opinion polls have shown opposition to membership
hardening at about 45 per cent, with support dwindling to less than 30 per
cent.
'People tend to confuse the issues,' says Olle Wastberg. 'When they see
(state-funded) day-care centres being closed early, they may blame the EC
because they hear the government saying that one reason for changes in taxes
that lead to cuts in public spending is to harmonise our tax system with
that of the Community.'
Mr Wastberg says he will keep the populist Expressen pro-EC as the country
moves towards a referendum on membership, expected sometime late next year.
He believes public opinion can be turned around, but, like many others, says
much will depend on the attitude of the country's biggest political party,
the opposition Social Democrats.
The Social Democrats, led by Mr Ingvar Carlsson, are well placed, according
to opinion polls, to win next September's general election. But they are
deeply split on the EC. They lodged Sweden's application to join the
Community when last in government, but only after a controversial volte-face
in party policy carried through by the leadership.
Today, more than 50 per cent of Social Democratic voters indicate in polls
that they are against membership, with less than 20 per cent in favour. This
would be enough of a hurdle to winning a referendum in itself, but it is an
insurmountable obstacle given that a majority of voters from four of the
other six main political parties in favour of membership are also opposed.
Because of the split in their own ranks, the Social Democrats currently
treat EC membership like fatal poison, avoiding addressing it in public. An
exasperated Mr Bildt, struggling to get the case in favour across to the
public, has resorted to trying to goad the Social Democratic leadership into
supporting the policy it put into place when in office.
Undoubtedly, the internal strains of the past three years - and the
successive crises in Europe - have left many Swedes sceptical and uncertain
that greater economic, political and industrial integration with Europe is
the way forward.
But, as Prof Lindbeck points out, it is also true that many Swedish
companies have long since taken that path, becoming in the process genuine
international organisations with much more of their production outside
Sweden than at home. Just early last year, a majority of Swedes were in
favour of EC membership.
An upturn in the economy, expected to take hold next year, and a more
positive stance by the Social Democrats could yet turn around opinion on the
EC. By the time a referendum is held, the row over Volvo's merger with
Renault will be long past, and its outcome either way is unlikely to be a
significant factor in the settling of the EC debate.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Closed skies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S AIRLINE passengers are still suffering from high fares nearly a
year after the European Community's open skies policy came into force.
Competition has been slow to develop and, according to a report yesterday by
the UK's Civil Aviation Authority, there is little prospect of improvement.
Part of the explanation is that the middle of a deep recession is not the
best time to raise funds to develop competitive services. But the main
problem is the entrenched position of Europe's flag-carriers. About 95 per
cent of international scheduled routes within the EC are served by
monopolies or duopolies but only 26 by three or more carriers.
Where two flag-carriers operate, the prospects of competition are slim.
Established players, which have lived for decades in a culture of
state-sponsored collusion, have little incentive to start price wars. But
where three players operate, the dynamics are more promising, the CAA report
shows. The most significant price cuts this year have occurred on routes
where British Midland has started to run services.
The snag is that it is still hard for third operators to enter the market
because most of the Community's busiest airports are congested, with scarce
take-off and landing slots already allocated to flag-carriers. Matters are
made worse by governments' habit of subsidising their airlines, which means
potential rivals are not competing on a level playing field.
The ideal solution would be to increase the supply of slots by building more
airports or runways and to ban state aid. But such radical actions are
unfortunately not practical politics. The French government's recent u-turn
over plans to restructure loss-making Air France shows the difficulties of
curbing state aid. Equally, building new airports runs smack into
environmental lobbies.
The CAA's answer is to put forward proposals which go some way towards
creating the conditions for effective competition but also stand a chance of
being politically acceptable. It wants the Commission to insist that state
aid is linked to plans to cut costs sharply so that further hand-outs are
not needed and that subsidies are not used by airlines to buy market share
through the purchase of smaller competitors.
The CAA also argues that slots should be freed up for use by those airlines
which are most likely to challenge the established order. Here its approach
is incremental, relying on distributing any new slots that become available
rather than confiscating existing slots from flag-carriers. Yet it is still
more radical than the Commission's current policy.
Passengers may feel that the CAA's proposals do not go far enough. But
vested interests are so powerful that it will not be easy for even these
modest ideas to win acceptance. If passengers want more, they will have to
make their voices heard loud and clear.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Leading Article: VW's 29 hours
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY is struggling to adapt manufacturing employment to reduced demand
for its high-cost goods. According to the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, German unemployment will grow from 7.7 to 11.3
per cent of the workforce between 1992 and 1994 - a far bigger increase than
in any other large industrial country.
Volkswagen, the loss-making motor group, faces not only the general problems
of German industry, but also some specific ones caused by inability to
control costs during previous periods of capacity expansion. It is, however,
not clear whether the company's radical proposal for a four-day week from
January 1 maps out the route to recovery.
Volkswagen says it needs to cut its 108,000-strong workforce to 72,000 by
the end of 1995 - a consequence of stagnating sales and big productivity
improvements. Labour reductions of this order can be avoided, VW maintains,
only if employees agree both a 20 per cent cut in working hours - to 28.8
from 36 per week - and equivalent reductions in wages. The IG Metall trade
union, which in the past has led an industry-wide drive for shorter hours,
has ruled out 20 per cent pay cuts, but indicated willingness to compromise.
Bound by a commitment to the Lower Saxony government, VW's largest
shareholder, to maintain a 100,000-strong domestic workforce until the end
of 1994, the company's chairman, Mr Ferdinand Piech, badly needs a deal.
However, in his efforts to press through wage cuts, he holds strong
negotiating cards. Germany's labour costs, having failed to adjust to
straitened economic circumstances, are too high, while VW workers earn
roughly 10 per cent more than in other German motor groups. The company may
partly offset reductions in workers' living standards with cash which would
have been deployed for redundancy programmes.
Provided IG Metall agrees appropriate pay cuts, the plan could grant
Volkswagen breathing space in which to work out longer-term arrangements for
lowering costs. Yet unless the company can foresee a relatively speedy
return to five-day working (at present unlikely), cuts in working hours will
not be more than a short-term expedient for tackling the fundamental problem
of over-manning and excess capacity.
Such deals have only limited applications for companies in similar
predicaments. They do not tackle the non-wage costs which represent an
important burden on German companies. Additionally, across-the-board
reductions in pay and hours, demanding equal cuts in living standards from
all workers, irrespective of their productivity, could even counter the move
to more flexible working practices which Germany urgently needs. German
labour and management are showing welcome readiness to negotiate solutions
to the country's industrial difficulties. But they are still only at the
beginning of the adjustment process.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Fitness regime for '90s: David Marsh on the changes foreseen
by European banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European commercial banks pondering their strategies for the end of the
century foresee a tighter, leaner future - for themselves and their
customers.
They will be more cost-conscious and closely regulated than today, and will
employ considerably fewer staff. They will make more of their profits from
trading activities rather than lending. They will offer a broader scope of
services to retail and corporate customers, but at increased fees.
These are the main findings of a broad survey of European banking and
capital markets published yesterday, polling the views of executives from
400 banks and institutions across 21 European countries.
The study, by consultants Arthur Andersen, shows that European banks are
sceptical about the prospects for introducing a single European currency by
the Maastricht target date of 1999.
Doubts about the feasibility of reducing European currency fluctuations are
greatest in Germany, France and the UK. Banks are unlikely, however, to be
worried by the damping of hopes for speedy economic and monetary union, as
they expect to make an increasing share of earnings from dealing in European
currency instruments.
The banks are pinning hopes for expansion above all on trading in
derivatives, equities, money market instruments and corporate bonds. Their
emphasis on derivatives - instruments such as swaps, futures and options
used to hedge exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate fluctuations -
has already caused some concern among international bank supervisors, who
have pointed to the need for greater surveillance of these markets.
Partly reflecting such worries, banks expect increased moves towards EC-wide
regulation by the end of the decade, with 45 per cent of respondents saying
this would hit profits. Anxiety about the impact on earnings of tighter
regulation is greatest in Belgium, France and Luxembourg, as well as central
and eastern Europe.
A majority of banks believes a pan-European free market in financial
services will improve profitability. But French banks are exceptionally
nervous about increased competition from other EC countries: 45 per cent of
respondents believe this will reduce profitability, compared with only 15
per cent who hold this view elsewhere in Europe.
As increased domestic and international competition lowers profitability in
traditional lending and deposit business, banks are consciously widening
their scope. There is a trend towards German-style 'universal' banks,
grouping commercial and merchant banking activities under one roof. Most
respondents believe universal banks will significantly gain market share in
a wide range of areas - from derivatives and foreign exchange to insurance
and deposit-taking.
The need to cut costs is reflected in banks' intention both to reduce staff
numbers further and to press ahead with costly new technology - part of the
move towards 'branchless' banking.
Significantly, German banks - although apparently seen as a model by many
competitors - emerge as among the most likely to be affected by future
changes. At present relatively fragmented, the German banking industry
expects much greater concentration. Ninety one per cent of German
respondents, compared with 58 per cent of their European counterparts,
expect further closures of bank branches.
German bankers see far more opportunities than others from expansion in
central and eastern Europe, and believe hostile takeovers - currently
exceptional in Germany - will be more common.
For all the differences in individual countries, banks spot one overriding
trend with considerable relevance for the development of capital markets
across the continent. As public sector social security schemes come under
pressure for economic and demographic reasons, retail customers are likely
to turn more to banks for long-term pensions and insurance products.
As banks examine questions about their roles and identities, the report
makes clear the scale of the management challenge. As Mr David Andrews,
Andersen's head of financial services, puts it: 'For survival, change is not
optional - it is mandatory.'

FT  04 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Standards institution 'punctilious'
in following Cadbury committee code
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From N C L MACDONALD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a board member of the British Standards Institution, and as a member
of the Cadbury committee, I was disturbed to read the incorrect assertion
('Standards authority faces criticism', November 3) apparently made by the
former chief executive of BSI, that proposed changes to BSI's constitution
were 'against the recommendations on good corporate governance proposed by
the Cadbury committee'.
Far from contradicting the code, the BSI board (and its audit committee,
which I chair) has been punctilious in seeking to observe the spirit and the
form of the code. Unjustified criticism, particularly if linked to
inaccurate comment by past employees, provides an inadequate basis for an
effective debate.
In fact, the Cadbury recommendations do not formally apply to BSI, but the
board decided, from the moment that it was reconstituted, that it would
follow the code. Several changes have been made as a consequence, not least
the extensive disclosure now given in the annual report.
The board was reconstituted, following changes in BSI's constitution which
were approved by its members at the 1991 annual general meeting, to reflect
best commercial practice. Recent events have focused attention on the
responsibility of non-executive directors to ensure that the organisations
with which they are associated have proper systems of control and suitable
management information to discharge their responsibilities properly. The BSI
board has no intention of shirking these responsibilities.
The board will welcome constructive questioning from any members who attend
the annual general meeting today, where they will quickly learn that the
actions taken and changes proposed by the board reflect a logical and
considered approach to bringing the BSI into a state in which the members'
interest can be better served.
The challenges facing BSI are profound, and the board has taken action to
ensure that these issues are tackled. The chairman and the executive
committee have been addressing numerous difficult but vital issues, and
report regularly to the BSI board. Effective corporate governance requires
no less.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'European union' (November 1), was timely and excellent.
The UK government and much of the media are giving a false impression of the
state of European union. If we are not careful, the UK will again miss the
boat. Economic recovery needs the single market. A permanent European single
market cannot be achieved without permanent monetary stability. The only
feasible plan to achieve monetary stability is Emu, including, in due
course, a single currency. Emu and a single currency will lead to further
political integration.
But it does not stop with the European union. A substantive increase in
global multilateral trading needs both a successful Uruguay Round and
monetary stability. Global monetary stability can only be achieved by a
system being worked out between the US, Japan and the European Union.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Worldwide threat of weak demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A historical parallel to the present-day threats to the world economy would
be enlightening to people with imagination.
In 1938-39, the threat of communism to the capitalist democracies had by no
means vanished. Yet in those years the main threat came from Nazi Germany.
The blindness of many western statesmen to this new threat, and their
continued obsession with communism, cost their citizens dearly by delaying
preventive action against the Axis powers.
Inflation is like the communist threat in 1938-39. Only the meretricious
will say that it is yesterday's threat, or that we can forget about it. But
for the time being the greater threat is one of global depression - by which
I do not mean a repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s, but a drawn-out
under-performance of output and employment, politically as well as
economically debilitating.
Let me cite three out of many pieces of evidence. Credit Suisse First Boston
points out in its October Economics Bulletin that the devaluation of
sterling and the lira, relative to the D-Mark and the franc, have not had
their normal postwar effect - higher inflation in the devaluing countries.
Instead UK producer prices have shown only a glancing rise after
devaluation, and Italian prices rose less than expected. On the other hand,
French and German producer prices, especially the former, have actually
fallen.
Credit Suisse First Boston may be jumping the gun in calling the net effect
deflationary. Consumer prices normally rise more than producer prices
because productivity in services does not rise as quickly as in industry.
Yet the price indices may be deceptive. The best statisticians cannot pick
up all the quality improvements or special discounts that lie concealed
behind the price-lists. Nor, as even the Bank of England warns us, should
policymakers treat as inflationary the knock-on effects of indirect tax
increases imposed by governments to relieve their structural budget
deficits.
The second instance comes from the Bank of England's new Inflation Report.
This contains a chart, reproduced here, showing the expected profile of
inflation derived from gilt-edged prices. This does indeed show some
expected rise from a 1995 low-point, but not by much. The important lesson
is that expected inflation in about 10 years fell by one percentage point
between May and August, and by almost as much again in the period to
October. Inflationary expectations are now 'down close to where they had
been before sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism'. Indeed,
assuming that gilt-edged yields contain some risk premium, as well as an
allowance for future inflation, inflationary expectations lie within the
government's 1-4 per cent range.
Third, there are signs that UK retailers' price wars are no flash in the
pan. Midland Global Markets Research has collated a good many pointers to
retail price restraint being with us to stay. The retail sales price index
has risen less than the underlying RPI and sales volume has increased faster
than gross domestic product. Within the retail trade, the sectors that have
held down prices most have seen the fastest sales. The war between BT and
Mercury, together with the price cuts announced by Sainsbury yesterday,
exemplify what is happening.
There is a more cosmopolitan element too. Although the importance of China
in the world economy has been hyped up, UK imports from the emerging markets
 -eastern Europe, Latin America and east Asia together - have risen in a
mere three years from 17 1/2 to 21 per cent of the total. As Credit Suisse
First Boston suggests, such imports have put pressure not only on British
margins, but also on the margins of traditional suppliers in western Europe
and elsewhere.
These direct influences on the price level of western European countries do
not conflict with a monetary interpretation of inflation. What they do mean
is that the effects of demand restraint come through more quickly into the
price level. This is all to the good. Nor should the success of the new
exporters be regarded as a threat. For they do not sell their wares to line
their central banks with D-Mark, franc and sterling notes, but to buy
western produce and know-how.
What, however, threatens to throw a spanner in an otherwise benign set of
consequences is the weakness of demand in the industrial world. The Bank of
England mentions a 6 1/2 per cent growth of Nominal GDP as according with
'the real growth needed in the recovery, and the inflation target'. Yet such
demand expansion is not taking place in the UK or in any other leading
member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. As The
Economist pointed out last week, Nominal GDP is growing by 3 per cent or
less in all EC countries except the UK; and even in the latter it is well
below the Bank's benchmark.
We should avoid a futile battle between those who see European depression in
terms of inflexible labour markets and high costs of employing workers, and
those who worry about inadequate demand. The more flexible labour markets
become, the greater the benefits of a moderate but positive rate of demand
expansion. In fact, the climate for pay flexibility and for a critical look
at labour overheads has never been better - after many decades of moving in
the wrong direction. But the one thing that could scupper this new mood and
turn it into resentment would be if lower pay and prices simply led to
slower demand growth in money terms, with little to show in output and jobs.
* * * In this new phase the case for an independently accountable Bank of
England has to be restated. Its sole task can no longer be just to stop
inflation. Nor can the real economy be always safeguarded just by making the
counter-inflationary strategy sufficiently gradual. Growth depressions may
persist for years without causing a deflation that shows up in the
statisticians' indicators.
In current conditions an independent central bank needs to have an objective
for nominal demand. Nominal GDP is the best-known variant but other
measures, such as domestic expenditure, which I need not labour, may be more
operational and suitable for concerted international action.
There is nothing novel about all this. In spite of Alan Greenspan's
attachment to price stability, the US Federal Reserve has always had other
aims. The New Zealand Reserve Bank operates through a contract with the
finance minister, which now covers inflation exclusively, but could be
renegotiated next time to cover some version of Nominal GDP.
The main case for an independently accountable central bank is not that it
can magically bring price stability at a zero cost. It is the case for
having one body clearly responsible for monetary policy, which could not
then be blamed on some amorphous amalgam of politicians, officials and
central bankers as at present.
Moreover, it is a good democratic idea that fewer decisions should be taken
by a central government, constantly looking over its shoulder at its
parliamentary majority, and that more should be taken by other bodies
accountable in other ways.
It is still desirable that a central bank should acquire a first-class
counter-inflationary reputation. For it can then get away with more demand
stimulation when the time is ripe, and there will be fewer suspicions that
it is taking inflationary risks to buy an election. But this need not
prevent it having wider objectives.
To revert to our opening analogy from the 1930s. The statesmen who most
successfully took on the Nazis were far from soft on communism. But they
were aware that there was more than one threat and that different threats
could be uppermost at different times.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Nuclear review conclusions not
obvious
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr DIETER HELM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Professors Fells and Lucas (Personal View, November 2) rightly point
out that the issues facing the nuclear industry necessitate a wide-ranging
inquiry with broad terms of reference. The conclusions of such a review are,
however, far from obvious, and they may not be so clearly pro-nuclear as the
authors might wish.
The authors think it wise to maintain a 20 per cent reserved market for
nuclear power. There is, though, nothing magical about this level of
contribution, nor any obvious reason why this bit of the market should be
reserved for nuclear power. Furthermore, the authors are quite wrong to
assert that 'electricity from Sizewell C can be competitive with gas'. The
large construction costs, the long time period, the uncertainty about load
factors and about the disposal of waste fuel do not compare very well
against the economics of combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs). To suggest
that 'it is a question of convincing prospective investors', rather than one
of fundamental lack of cost competitiveness, is unconvincing.
Indeed, having extolled the virtues of more pressurised water reactors
(PWRs), the authors concede quite rightly that 'a new nuclear plant is
unlikely without government support'. What the authors really want is terms
of reference which give the answer: 'Sizewell C'. May I suggest the relevant
question then is: 'If 20 per cent of the British electricity market were
reserved for nuclear power, should a new PWR be built?' It is precisely
because it is far from obvious why nuclear should have a special place in
the market that the terms of reference of the nuclear review should indeed
be broad: a thorough investigation of the costs and benefits of nuclear
power is needed, so customers who will have to pay for new reactors can see
whether the bills are worth paying. Only then will the nuclear industry have
a degree of stability in planning its future.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Muddle in the Chunnel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From J R STANYARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your call for the government to bear the risk of the preconstruction
stage of major infrastructure projects ('Chunnel link', October 29) is to be
welcomed, but your arguments for giving priority to the Channel tunnel link
are flawed.
First, the fact that the project is already delayed is immaterial; it should
be evaluated alongside other competing schemes using today's estimates of
benefits and uncommitted costs. The history of the proposed link, however
protracted and tortuous, should not affect the decision.
Second, using a massive, high-profile initiative is more likely to flood the
'pump' of private/public finance than to prime it. Has not experience of
major projects taught us that novel techniques, whether technological,
managerial or financial, are most likely to be successful when they have
been piloted in lower-risk situations? Surely we should be looking to learn
quickly on smaller, high benefit/cost ratio projects and feeding the lessons
into the big schemes as they develop.
The Chunnel link is needed but let us ensure a decision on its fate is made
on rational grounds. Muddling the debate with that on innovative ways of
funding public works will do both causes a disservice.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Personal View: How market testing is being undermined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES COX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The market testing programme, which puts work done by civil servants out to
tender, has now been running in the UK for almost one year. With the
announcement today of the government's achievements in the first round, it
is time to reflect on the progress of the programme to date, which many have
found disappointing.
The latest figures for departmental savings offer some limited encouragement
from the purchaser's perspective. There has been a tendency, however, to
focus on cost reduction without full consideration of the options available
to improve the added value of service delivery. With few exceptions,
policymakers and civil servants have demonstrated an inadequate
understanding of the extent of the benefits that the private sector is able
to offer and how these may be achieved.
One of the central problems has been the use of public procurement
techniques, borne of public sector item purchasing, which are wholly
inappropriate to a programme that seeks to simulate the mechanism of market
enterprise.
Tenders are often framed in such a way that they severely restrict the scope
for using entrepreneurial and forward-looking approaches to deliver greater
savings. It is therefore almost impossible for suppliers to minimise
reductions in staff numbers while still making an adequate return.
The most typical approach has been for departments to draft detailed service
specifications, based upon the current provision. Little regard is paid to
the longer-term and higher objectives to be supported, to the alternative
methods available to achieve them, or to the flexibility required for
outsourcing - where specialist services are bought in from private companies
 -to work in practice.
By suppressing the scope for innovation and by limiting the benefit that
industry is able to offer, these restrictive requirements undermine the
central purpose of market testing. It is no coincidence that trade unions
have explicitly advised their members involved in market testing to base
their specifications on the existing set-up.
Moreover, once translated into a binding contract, such stringent
requirements can result in an increasingly inefficient and irrelevant
service, without the flexibility to adapt to changing needs and advancing
technologies. Indeed, a number of large outsourcing contracts in the US have
failed precisely because of this problem.
Potentially this is a political time bomb for the government. If problems do
occur, they are likely to be in the mid-term of contracts let under this
year's market testing round - that is, about the time of the next general
election.
The success of market testing for highly skilled professional services will
also depend to a significant extent on the ability of government and private
sector to secure the co-operation and commitment of existing personnel. At
this early stage, no company will have replacement staff of equivalent
capability ready to take over the running of the service.
This begs the question of how to mitigate the inevitable frictions of the
'hostile takeover bid' scenario created when a defeated in-house team is
expected to transfer to a winning company. Government could minimise the
adversarial nature of the process between civil servants and the private
sector by introducing a preliminary phase in the market testing process
based upon benchmarking a proposal from the in-house team, perhaps in
collaboration with a private sector partner, against industry best practice.
Only where it is clear that outsourcing to the private sector will yield
additional benefits should a competition for an external supplier be held -
without an internal bid, leaving civil servants free to become actively
involved in the market testing process and to form a co-operative, rather
than adversarial, relationship with the private sector.
Of course, for civil servants themselves the primary concern has been the
effect of market testing on long-term employment prospects. Certainly in
information technology, most civil service divisions realise that they are
over-staffed.
This is compounded by a progressive reduction in staffing needs throughout
the IT sector as a result of technological change, and it is clear that
redundancies are inevitable, irrespective of whether the services are
outsourced or remain in-house.
The government should not overestimate the ability of private companies to
absorb public sector staff into their workforce, particularly in the current
economic climate.
Nor can departments expect to be shielded from the costs and
responsibilities of reskilling and redundancies. Host companies will not
want to act as the government's abattoir, taking on staff merely for the
opportunity to fire them, even if subsidised to do so.
It is critical that these problems are addressed before the momentum of
market testing begins to fade. Otherwise there is a danger that the interest
of private sector suppliers will diminish rapidly and the mechanism of
competition will become correspondingly less effective.
Market testing is an important initiative which could provide substantial
improvements in the value for money of public services. To achieve its full
potential, however, private sector involvement should not be based merely on
participation in individual tenders, but on the formation of long-term,
strategic partnerships with the civil service.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Arts: Trumpet and piano - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At Hakan Hardenberger's trumpet recital with pianist Roland Pontinen, the
audience was full of serious, short-haired teenagers and smaller, well-kempt
children in the tow of parents, aunts and grandpas. Budding trumpeters,
surely, even though Hardenberger and Pontinen are rather shaggy - dark and
blond respectively.
Hardenberger has set a famous standard, and must owe some of his success to
being spotted as a teenager. He began his international career 15 years ago,
and is now 32.
Most countries can boast a superb trumpet or two, or three; but they rarely
travel as stars, for they all play the same marketable solo repertoire
consisting exclusively of the Haydn Concerto in D. True, a few 'period'
specialists struck lucky when the 18th century came into vogue, with all
those fleet, high-flying solos for the old valveless trumpet that taxed
players whose expertise was geared to Wagner and Strauss. (And Elgar - or
any local equivalent.)
Young Hardenberger, however, was peculiarly fortunate in being both
precocious and omni-competent. He has not squandered his good fortune on
easy success: prompted or inspired by him, Birtwistle, Ligeti and Henze have
composed trumpet works that are substantial gifts to the meagre repertoire.
On Tuesday he ventured in another direction, no less bold but almost
archaeological, trying out unknown pieces with piano from earlier this
century.
The programme included two of the Paris Conservatoire's annual
competition-pieces (such as all wind soloists depend upon). A suite by the
eighty-something Florent Schmitt - who lived on and on while his music
declined from fine early-century works to brittle 'Les Six' pastiches -
sounded sprightlier than most of his later products. An early 'Legende' by
Georges Enescu carried an authentic whiff of period drama, heady and moody.
We heard also Antoine Tisne's more recent sequence, Heraldique: whimsically
intense and personal, if not so potent as to drive one off in search of more
of his music - not right away, anyhow.
By contrast a trumpet sonata by George Antheil (at 52), once known in
America as the avant-garde 'Bad Boy of Music', proved vapidly cute,
downright retarded. In Pontinen's thoughtful hands (assisted on the ivories
by one Hardenberger finger), Charles Ives' 'Three Page Sonata' for piano -
actually 8 or 10 pages long, and almost a half-century older than the
Antheil - sounded the authentic note of passionate modernism.
Pontinen was less happy in Stravinsky's virtuoso transcriptions of
'Mouvements' from his Petrushka. They were adapted for the young Artur
Rubinstein, partly to please him but surely no less out of mischief: they
are recklessly difficult, and in those days Rubinstein hated practising.
Nowadays, when everybody knows the orchestral originals, pianists must face
up to the crazy challenge of recapturing all that colour and all that
teeming vitality. Pontinen, very workmanlike, fell short of that - and it
was a mistake to play only two movements, without the tuneful, exhilarating
catharsis of the third.
The recital concluded with Hardenberger's own transcription of An American
in Paris, calculated to appeal. Though every player in the world must long
to play Gershwin's first trumpet, this was not the way to manage it. For one
thing, fattening his role by cannibalising the other instrumental parts
flattened some inspired contrasts: in the Charleston, for example, muted
trumpet was no substitute for Gershwin's soaring violins. For another,
Pontinen - as one might have guessed from his Petrushka - never, ever
swings. Readers who look on the bright side might see that as a sign that
American music has not invaded European music completely, not yet.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Arts: 'Exact Change' equals failure - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fact that little happens in Exact Change is exactly the point, for its
three characters are all failures. The point is both comic and serious.
These three American men were once at high school together and are stuck
working together. First (Act One), they fail to run to run a restaurant;
then (Act Two) they fail in crime. Botts: 'How did we get here?' Merola:
'Bad luck; poor planning; faulty execution.' Bompkee: 'And shitty ideas.'
Much of the time, they abuse each other, either verbally or physically. I am
seldom bothered by coarse or obscene words, but for about half the play
these three men use bad language so constantly and (worse) so meaninglessly
that I took offence. I also spent most of the play disliking all three men
intensely - spending time with people who recognise their own failure is a
wearying business - and took a dreadful pleasure in their bouts of bashing
each other up.
The author is the American playwright, David Epstein. That he accurately
catches a certain East Coast American type of talk is not in question. But
what type of talk is this? We have all heard this kind of American before,
because we have encountered it on TV in countless sit-coms. Botts and
Bompkee and Merola speak in patterns that are too cute to be real. Even the
extent of their failure is cute. They not only fail to rob a toll-booth
successfully, they then lock themselves out of the stolen car they used and
in which they have left their fingerprints.
At several points, however, Epstein means his characters to transcend this
kind of cuteness. Mainly this occurs when they talk, with infinite
incomprehension, of the opposite sex. Botts: 'What is it about women?'
Morelli: 'An alien culture.' They talk of women's perfumes, of their own
castration complexes, and of their own violence to women. They are, of
course, as much failures with women as elsewhere; indeed, you start to sense
that their failure with women is at the root of their own failings. But it
is here that the play becomes touching; and only it is here that I found it
possible to laugh.
The production, directed by Aaron Mullen, takes time to find its feet. At
first, Steven O'Shea, as Merola, speaks at too monotonous a volume, and the
timing is too pat. But Mike McShane, as Bompkee, and Kevin McNally, as
Botts, are remarkably persuasive, and O'Shea eventually rises to their
level. My reservations are about the play.
I reviewed last week the excellent Birmingham Rep staging of Pinter's Old
Times. Because I did not notice the sung passages including anything from
'Smoke gets in your eyes', I assumed that they were omitted. I am reliably
informed, however, that in this I was mistaken. My apologies to the actors;
and my renewed compliments to the production.
Exact Change is at the Lyric, Hammersmith, W6, until December 4.

NAKED (18) Mike Leigh
DAVE (12) Ivan Reitman
THE REAL McCoy (12) Russell Mulcahy
LONDON FILM FESTIVAL
Mike Leigh's Naked is so politically incorrect that it risks being trampled
to death by outraged ideologues. Greens will be shocked by its morbid relish
for urban decay and global despair. Feminists will be appalled as the
hero-misogynist Johnny (David Thewlis) rapes, rants and chauvinistically
philosophises. And film purists - do we count them as PC? - will think,
'This is not a movie, it is a Jeremiad with changing backdrops.'
At Cannes the film won two prizes, for best director and best actor
(Thewlis). But let us not take that as a quality guarantee. It may just mean
that Europeans fell for it as they fall for any UK movie, from the latest
Loach to Jarman's The Last Of England, that depicts Britain as a doomed
island inhabited by losers, villains or madmen.
In reality Naked is itself maddening: part good, part bad, part ugly. Our
hero Johnny, brilliantly played by Thewlis, is a Leigh special: a gutter
Hamlet, awash in downbeat soliloquising and offbeat mannerism, all the way
from the snuffly cough that punctuates his sentences to his habit of
spinning giant think-aloud arias at the drop of a triviality. 'How did you
get here?' he is asked at one point: whereupon he delivers a thumbnail
history of human evolution.
We first meet him date-raping a girl in a Manchester alley and are soon
watching him throw his virility around down South. He has dropped in on the
London flat of girlfriend Louise (Lesley Sharp) where the new prey is
dimwitted flatmate Sophie (Katrin Cartlidge): a sort of Dalston Vampira with
pinched vowels and tighter-pinched black clothing. 'Is there an instruction
manual for this?' asks Johnny, attempting to unbutton the unbuttonable after
Louise has gone out to leave the coital coast clear.
So far, so typical. This is the Doctor Leigh we know from High Hopes and
Life Is Sweet: the man who lays his specimen proles on the examining table
and solemnly, minutely probes their minds and manners. But Naked then moves
off in a new, alarming direction. Abandoning individual patients for a
general medical inquiry, Leigh tracks all over London pushing his
stethoscope at every cardboard everyman he can find in Cardboard City and
environs. He seems to be searching for the dark soul of London; or perhaps
of all cities; or perhaps of the world.
There is the young Scottish down-and-out shouting for his lost girlfriend.
There is the woman Johnny roughs up - he is still our escort-guide - after
glimpsing her dancing in a window. And there is the middle-aged office
nightwatchman (Peter Wight), forlorn and Hancockian, with whom Johnny
strikes up an all-night chat about life, death and the Book of Revelation.
Oh good heavens, and we almost forgot Jeremy (Greg Cruttwell). He is the
snooty yuppie in a parallel story, who first beats up a waitress and then
moves in on That Flat to menace poor Sophie with a stuffed lizard.
Mike Leigh is a wise old lizard himself. He probably knows that people
secretly like the political incorrectness of his plays and films, whether
sexist or classist. More usually it is the latter: the sacred proletariat
coshed with its own obtuseness, and those who try to escape from the
proletariat impaled on their pretensions. Whatever the satirical agenda, in
Leigh's best work there has been an enlivening struggle between the
director's dictatorial comic spirit and the fight-back spontaneity of the
improvisation-developed characters.
In Naked the characters seem to have been allowed little or no autonomy at
all. They are pawns in a Great Miserablist Plot. Those who are not villains
are victims. Those who are not DIY philosophers like Johnny, or like Leigh's
Nietzche-with-a-filofax Jeremy, are birdbrains like Sophie or Louise. Put
more bluntly, those who are not men - the bio-deterministic thesis almost
seems to amount to this - are women.
Naked has a loose, free-form daring in its structure that one would love to
say marks an advance in Leigh's work. But in the viewing it seems less like
an advance, more like a walk off a tall cliff into a chasm of glib
misanthropic and misogynistic generalities. For once the PC crowd (we hate
to say it) may be right.
Kevin Kline is multiplied by two in Dave, causing us to wonder what marvels
or monsters lie in wait if Hollywood gets serious about genetic replication.
The interesting thing about this comedy of Presidential imposture - the only
interesting thing - is the way it strews living duplications of the famous
all through its story.
Not just Kline, who plays both stroke-stricken outgoing President and the
goodhearted bumpkin who takes his place, first to placate the media, later
for real. (The plot is The Prisoner Of Zenda meets Mr Smith Goes To
Washington.) But also walking, talking and smirking through in small cameo
roles are Arnold Schwarzenegger, Oliver Stone and a dozen real-life American
politicians and newspersons: possibly real, possibly (as I suspect) made in
test-tubes.
Certainly the film is made in one. Director Ivan (Twins) Reitman and writer
Gary (Big) Ross begin by heating some funny satire over a low burner. Then
just when the substance begins to fizz they pour in a whole lot of schmaltz
concerning Kline 2's growing passion for Kline 1's first lady, Sigourney
Weaver. This pair is determined to save children's homes, cut out corruption
on Capitol Hill and generally bore us to death with social-political piety.
What did Reitman and Ross, bending over their tube, want the film to do?
Just to change colour? It does, from bilious wit to sentimental puce. What
we had hoped for, vainly, was a few sharp crackles leading to a climactic
explosion.
The Real McCoy is a heist thriller with similar pace and wit problems.
Hi-tech burglar Kim Basinger is fresh from a six-year jail sentence, and do
we mean fresh. Evidently they have a beauty salon and state-of-the-art
hairdresser at the Athens Correctional Facility in Georgia. Looking a
million dollars, Miss B comes out to steal Dollars 18 million more. She is
helped by boyfriend Val Kilmer and hindered by evil former criminal pal
Terence Stamp (plus Southern accent). But she is not helped by Russell
Mulcahy's direction, which proceeds at the pace of a lobotomised snail even
when hell and high hokum are meant to be breaking out during the theft
itself.
The London Film Festival is back, starting today. Has it really been a year
since London's South Bank was last covered in a seething, palpitating mass
of international celluloid? Ah, but my new year resolution for 1993 was not
to be rude about the size and unwieldiness of this year's LFF, however
tempting. Enough to say that there are more than 200 films on show, and
those are just the features.
Among entries I have seen, I can commend Atom Egoyan's Calendar, brilliantly
blending a mock-travelogue with a tale of unravelling romance; Rolf De
Heer's Venice Grand Jury Prize winner Bad Boy Bubby, a bizarre growing-up
tale from Australia mixing sex, religion and comedy of (bad) manners; Tian
Zhuangzhuang's touching and majestic The Blue Kite, a banned-in-China tale
of life in Peking under Chairman Mao; and Maria Luisa Bemberg's We Don't
Want To Talk About It, featuring magic realism, Marcello Mastroianni and sly
comic insights into small-town Argentina.
Among films I know, I also scratch my head and wonder why the likes of Alain
Cavalier's Libera Me, Bertrand Blier's 1,2,3 Sun and Assi Dayan's Life
According To Agfa - groan-inducers at earlier European festivals - have been
selected for the LFF. But I said I would not be rude about the event's
gargantuan all-inclusiveness. Best to end on hope and to mention promising
but as yet unseen films such as Lindsay Anderson's Is That All There Is?
(self-portrait of British cinema's grand old man), Stephen Poliakoff's
Century (Miranda Richardson in tale of mad love and mad science) and
Frederick Wiseman's Zoo (latest fly-on-waller from the unblinking US
documentarist).
Nor let us neglect such golden oldies as John Ford's The Searchers, Alfred
Hitchcock's Under Capricorn and William Wellman's Wings, plus orchestra. The
festival, which is based at the National Film Theatre and continues until
November 21, is open to all.

A restaurant where I lunched recently employed an unusually cunning trick
when it came to the desserts. If chocolate mousse was ordered a huge bowl
was left on the table with a dish to serve yourself. The result was that the
men, not wishing to appear greedy, helped themselves to an unaccustomed
small portion - yet left the restaurant feeling that it was an abnormally
generous place. In the first of a new series of A Cook's Tour Of France
(BBC2, 8.00) Mireille Johnston has a look at the chocolate mousse in Tours.
Also back with a new series is People First which deals today with asthma
(C4, 8.00). Later on the same channel, after a debate about British politics
in Critical Eye (9.00), there is a Film On 4 Premiere Paper Mask (10.00),
with Paul McGann as a hospital porter impersonating a doctor. This black
drama is directed by Christopher Morahan
Even though the current series of Red Dwarf VI (BBC2, 9.00) is not up to
standard, it is still better than most running comedies. It is leagues ahead
of Billy (11.15, ITV) in which stand-up comedian Connolly looks
uncomfortable.

Tenfore, a Danish-Swiss company, has begun marketing a satellite-based,
real-time information system which gives companies access to the same
financial information as the banks carrying out their financial transactions
 -and at a price which should make the system attractive.
'The customer no longer has to find himself in the position of having less
information at his disposal than the bank which is disposing of his money,'
says Henrik Hvidtfeldt, managing director of Tenfore's Danish development
company.
Two factors have enabled Tenfore to launch its system - the falling price of
transmitting data via satellites and the development of PC screeen software
which gives Tenfore's customers exactly the same news and financial
information as banks and brokers, but at a much lower price than the systems
used by the banks, says Hvidtfeldt.
The service, using a Windows-based system, provides six news services (not
including Reuter or AP-Dow Jones), real-time data on 30 stock, derivatives
and commodity markets (including the London Stock Exchange, the New York
Stock Exchange and Seaq International) and foreign exchange quotes from
international banks.
The service is available only in Europe, but Hvidtfeldt says he expects to
launch it in North America and Asia next year. Tenfore's software enables a
company to filter only the information relevant to the firm and provides
calculations for exactly how prices at any time will affect its profit
margins.
The cost to subscribers includes a DKr19,000 (Pounds 1,900) investment in a
satellite dish and modem link to a personal computer, while the monthly
subscription cost, including the fee for using the software, varies from
DKr3,000 to DKr7,000 depending on which services are required.
Hvidtfeldt says Tenfore has about 150 subscribers in Denmark and as many
again in the rest of Europe, where it has sales representatives in 13
countries.
Tenfore was developed in Denmark, where the database facilities and
satellite transmissions take place, but the company is incorporated in
Switzerland and backed by Danish and international investors.

FT  04 NOV 93 / People: Wilson at the cutting edge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
More corporate moves afoot in Ipswich. Ransomes, the somewhat troubled
lawnmower company, has a new chief executive: Peter Wilson, a 48-year-old
ex-BTR man now with the utility Northumbrian Water as head of environmental
management.
Bob Dodsworth, the present chief executive, was already due to leave at the
end of this year. Wilson's background in engineering and pollution control
is not obviously relevant to a business whose main activity is cutting the
world's grass. But in such a specialised area, experience is doubtless hard
to come by.
According to Wilson, his BTR background sounds more immediately relevant. 'I
guess they were looking for someone who was used to running a tight
business,' he says. 'It's a question of tight financial controls and
building on market positions. Ransomes has a leading position in some key
markets, but they haven't always been as successful in getting their
products into some markets, such as the US.'
If he is new to the world of lawnmowers, he is not alone. The recently
appointed chairman, John Clement, made his name as head of the dairy firm
Unigate. His short-stay predecessor, John Kerridge, was previously chairman
of the drugs group Fisons. The announcement of Wilson's appointment is
accompanied by the reminder that Ransomes is still looking for a couple of
non-executive directors. In the context of a company whose shareholders'
funds have more than halved in the past four years, this is a reminder that
the investing institutions will be watching Wilson's progress with a
critical eye.

FT  04 NOV 93 / People: Nader Sultan to run Kuwait Petroleum
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nader Sultan, one of Kuwait's most experienced international oilmen, is to
leave the chairmanship of the London-based Kuwait Petroleum International to
become deputy chairman of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, which manages the
Gulf state's oil exploration, production, refining and transportation.
KPI, which is an affiliate of KPC, runs Kuwait's network of Q8 petrol
stations and the state's European refining operations.
Sultan's appointment will make him the most senior oil executive in Kuwait.
It follows last month's resignation of Abdulrazak Mulla Hussein, who left
the deputy chairmanship of KPC over differences in oil policy with Ali
al-Baghli, Kuwait's oil minister.
KPC has used Hussein's departure to expand the board, appointing also Siham
Rizouki, previously an assistant undersecretary at the oil ministry and a
familiar member of Kuwait's Opec delegations, and one of the most senior
women in the oil industry, as managing director of KPC administration,
finance and foreign relations.
Suleiman al-Omani will also join the KPC board from the oil ministry. Ali
Al-Mousa, deputy governor of Kuwait's central bank, and Farouk al Nouri,
from the foreign ministry, will add to the expanded board.

Canary Wharf, the company which owns the Docklands property development of
the same name, has appointed Patrick Garner as an executive director. Garner
(above right), who was born in New Zealand, joins Canary Wharf from the
property subsidiary of Trafalgar House, where he was business development
director. He was previously chairman and chief executive of Chase Property
Holdings.
Last Friday Canary Wharf emerged from administration under UK insolvency
legislation. Garner's fellow directors are Sir Peter Levene, the former head
of procurement at the MoD, who is chairman and chief executive, and Gerald
Rothman (above left), who is the only director to survive from the period
before Olympia &amp; York Canary Wharf - as it was formerly known - went into
administration last year.
Canary Wharf is now in the process of trying to recruit non-executive
directors. It is owned by Sylvester Investments, in turn owned by a group of
banks which provided loans for the development.

Derek Bonham, chief executive of Hanson, acquired another title yesterday,
when he was made deputy chairman, a rank that has not existed at the
Anglo-American conglomerate since Gordon White, now Lord White, who is
chairman of the US arm, left for America in the early 1970s.
At the same time, David Clarke, deputy chairman and ceo of the North
American arm Hanson Industries, has been made a vice chairman of the group,
alongside Martin Taylor. Derek Rosling, the other vice chairman, is stepping
down from that position and will retire in May 1994.
Since the position of deputy chairman is senior to vice chairman in the
Hanson hierarchy, yesterday's announcement simply underscores Bonham's
seniority. Lord Hanson plans to retire in 1997, but a large part of the
succession question had already been answered when Bonham, now 50, was made
chief executive of the group in April 1992.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Technology: Focus on Xerox's new film star - Andrew Fisher
reports on a new silver-free imaging process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Xerox Corporation announced its new technology at the start of this
week to replace silver compounds in film for the graphic arts market, the
precious metals market caught a bad case of the jitters.
Yesterday, these had not entirely disappeared, although it had become clear
that the breakthrough would affect only a small part of the film market.
Xerox's VerdeFilm is a digital imaging film, which needs strong light and
equipment that would be too bulky for ordinary cameras. The US company says
it has no plans to introduce its new film to the consumer market.
Even so, any suggestion that silver could be displaced, however marginally,
from its biggest market is bound to set the industry wondering what could
come next. Last year, 186m troy ounces of the precious metal were used in
photography, 31 per cent of total industrial demand; of this, commercial
photography accounted for 82m ounces.
Until the Xerox product, developed by its research centre in Canada, is on
the market, potential users will not be able to assess its qualities fully.
They will be waiting to see if the resolution of VerdeFilm, which dispenses
with silver halide and the need for chemical processing in the making of
commercial printing plates, is sharp enough for their needs.
Xerox, which highlights the cost and environmental advantages of VerdeFilm,
is acting fast to bring its new dry processing film into production. Its
researchers only discovered the process six months ago. Having studied its
applications, says Edward Ernst, general manager of VerdePrint Technologies,
the Xerox unit marketing the film, 'we moved very quickly to get to this
point'.
After further operational testing, he expects VerdeFilm to be in production
next summer. To speed its introduction, Xerox has contracted Rexham Custom,
a US subsidiary of Britain's Bowater, to make VerdeFilm.
The new film's images are created with a thin layer of minute particles of
selenium (a by-product of copper refining and used in photocopier imaging)
encased in polymer; these are charged, exposed and developed.
The process, using heat, causes the selenium molecules to move deeper into
the polymer and create an image. It is, says Xerox, 'no more complicated
than feeding paper into a fax machine'.
Existing image-setters and scanners will have to be modified. Ernst says
this would cost around Dollars 500 (Pounds 331) for machines whose price
runs into thousands of dollars. Agfa, part of the Bayer chemical group of
Germany, will talk with Xerox about modifications of its image-setters to
take VerdeFilm.
As a provider of film and equipment for the Dollars 1.8bn a year graphic
arts market, Agfa is both a competitor and potential partner for Xerox.
However, Mike Austin, group marketing manager of Agfa UK, says of VerdeFilm,
'we don't see this (VerdeFilm) as a major threat'. This is because it will
be aimed at the top end of the sector for high-quality uses such as
advertising.
Xerox has prepared its ground by lining up partners. As well as Agfa, it
plans talks with Fuji Photo, a much smaller player in this market. The two
companies are already linked through Fuji Xerox in photocopiers and Ernst
says talks have been held about possible co-operation on VerdeFilm - 'it's
still an open discussion'.
No comment was available from Eastman Kodak, a big film supplier in the
graphic arts field. Also in this market is Du Pont chemicals. Among
image-setting equipment manufacturers with which Xerox has developed
alliances are Quebecor Printing of Canada, Business Link Communications of
the US and Ultre, part of Germany's Linotype-Hell.
Ernst believes printers using VerdeFilm could make significant savings in
their operating cost. Much of this would come from the absence of chemicals.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Technology: Taming the volcanoes - Improved forecasting
techniques are making it easier to predict eruptions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Volcanoes, which spit ash, ooze lava and create darkness in the middle of
the day, are impressive displays of nature's restlessness. They are also
life-threatening: more than 28,500 people died from eruptions during the
1980s. They can cause millions of dollars in property damage and bring
industrial activity to a grinding halt.
New technology to improve the accuracy of eruption forecasts is helping to
minimise the devastation volcanoes can cause. After the Nevado del Ruiz
eruption killed nearly 25,000 people in Colombia in 1986, the US government
began taking volcanic forecasting seriously. The US Geological Survey, which
tracks volcanic activity around the world, was infused with new funds to
create a detailed database and update its techniques.
The new technology will not only help to save thousands of lives, it may
also save millions of dollars. According to the Aviation Safety Journal,
more than 60 aircraft have been damaged by drifting clouds of volcanic ash
since 1980. The repair of a 747 aircraft damaged during the 1989 eruption
from Redoubt Volcano in Alaska cost Dollars 80m (Pounds 53m).
The continuous eruption of Hawaii's Kilauea since 1983 has caused more than
Dollars 5m in damage, much of it to properties and crops affected by the
acid-bearing volcanic pollutants. Mount St Helens in Washington state wiped
out thousands of acres of productive timberland.
Losses from interrupted economic activity are harder to quantify, but may be
more devastating. Redoubt's eruption, for instance, caused a valuable oil
storage terminal to close for several weeks and halted most flights into and
out of the region.
Tourism often takes the hardest hit of all. When US geologists issued
eruption warnings in California's Long Valley in 1982, the resort area
turned into a ghost town almost overnight. And the tourist-based economy of
Guadeloupe neared collapse in 1976 after an international group of
volcanologists forecast the eruption of La Soufriere.
The Long Valley and Guadeloupe incidents are tinged with bitterness since
the predicted disasters never happened. Guadeloupe evacuated 72,000 people
and tourists stayed away. Yet the only crisis that hit the Caribbean island
was in the economic sphere.
Scientists blame these fiascos on insufficient data. 'The identification of
fresh volcanic glass in the erupted ash - which seemed to indicate that the
volcano was about to erupt violently - was a mistake,' wrote Richard Fiske,
a volcanologist at the Smithsonian Institution, about the incident.
Volcanologists today use more sophisticated techniques. Detailed databases
are maintained on all life-threatening volcanoes around the world.
High-frequency monitors to measure debris flows are now in place.
Earthquakes - often the first warning of volcanic activity - are tracked
with increasing accuracy. And changes in gas composition, electrical
conductivity and other clues are carefully monitored.
As a result, volcanic activity can now be forecast with substantial
accuracy, often pinpointing the eruption to within days or even hours of its
actual occurrence. When Redoubt erupted in Alaska in 1989 and Pinatubo blew
its top in the Philippines in 1991, volcanologists provided important
information, not only about the timing of the events, but also about the
direction of debris flows and ash blooms - vast clouds formed when tiny
pieces of lava or rock are thrown into the air.
'We used information on the ash blooms (during the Redoubt eruption) to know
which areas to stay away from, and which were safe to fly through,' says
Greg Witter, a spokesman for Alaska Air.
Companies can also take advantage of eruption forecasts to move valuable
equipment out of the way, and evacuate employees from the area.
'Businesses with sensitive electronics may want to shut down their air
filtration system during an ash bloom,' says Steven Brantley, public
information scientist with the US Geological Survey. Since ash blooms often
drift for many miles, they can wreak havoc on property well beyond the
life-threatening zone of eruption.
Volcanology can also be used for future planning. After much of its timber
was wiped out during the eruption of Mount St Helens, the paper group
Weyerhaeuser consulted experts to decide which areas should be replanted and
which avoided as too high-risk.
Not all businesses welcome the interference of volcanologists, however. In
Long Valley developers have refused to heed warnings in land use planning.
'We've had mixed results, because we can't force people to follow our
advice,' says Daniel Miller, a geologist with the US Geological Survey.
'We've had a very negative and unpleasant response from businesses in Long
Valley. They just don't believe that they might be in a risk zone and insist
on building things anywhere they please.'
Developers in the region complain that the volcanologists' warnings have
resulted in higher insurance rates, limited areas of potential development
and stoked the fears of tourists.
The relationship between active volcanoes and the communities that surround
them is not always confrontational. Kilauea has become a leading Hawaiian
tourist attraction. It is considered the ideal volcano. Because the eruption
is continuous, it is seldom life-threatening and ash blooms are rare.
Instead, the volcano throws up a scenic display of colourful lava, which
attracts hikers by day and creates a natural light show at night.
Scientists have gleaned much useful information from the decade-long
eruption.
'The resorts look to us to provide information on best viewing times, which
they pass on to the tourists,' says David Clague, scientist in charge of the
Hawaii Volcano Observatory at Kilauea. 'It's generally pretty tame as far as
volcano eruptions go, but it's spectacular at night because it's
iridescent.'

FT  04 NOV 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Thrown off the scent
 -Alice Rawsthorn examines the dilemma facing Yves Saint-Laurent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1986 Givenchy, the French fashion house, was hurriedly forced to paste
Xeryus labels over the first batch of its new men's fragrance after rival
Yves Saint-Laurent claimed the original name, Keryus, could be confused with
its own Kouros cologne.
The tables have now turned. YSL was last week ordered by a French court to
change the name of Champagne, its new women's perfume, after three champagne
companies, including a subsidiary of LVMH, the French luxury goods group
that owns Givenchy, claimed YSL had no right to use it. YSL is appealing. If
it loses, it will at the very least have to drop the name Champagne in
France - writing off the estimated FFr15m (Pounds 1.7m) it has already spent
on advertising there.
Yet the French court ruling also presents YSL with an unenviable marketing
dilemma. The Dollars 13bn (Pounds 9.2bn) perfume industry operates on a
global basis. The launch of a significant new fragrance, such as Champagne,
is carefully co-ordinated so that the product is presented to consumers in
the same way in every country.
YSL in September introduced Champagne throughout Europe, Africa and the
Middle East. It plans to launch it next year in North America and Asia. An
enforced name change in France would torpedo its hopes of establishing
Champagne as a global product. YSL would then have to decide whether it
would be in its best interests to adopt the new name everywhere, even though
that would mean losing the FFr100m it has invested so far in the European
launch.
'Global branding is the name of the game in the fragrance market,' says Jack
Saltzman, an industry analyst at Goldman Sachs in New York. 'It wouldn't be
impossible to launch a perfume using a different name for different markets.
But it wouldn't be easy.'
The problem facing YSL and Elf-Sanofi, the French pharmaceuticals company
that acquired it earlier this year, is aggravated by the sheer expense of
developing a new perfume. It costs roughly Dollars 50m to publicise the
worldwide launch of a new fragrance. The risk of failure is frighteningly
high. The Fragrance Foundation in New York estimates that 75 new scents have
been introduced in the US this year and industry statistics suggest that
only 15 will recover their launch costs within three years.
Yet a classic perfume can be vastly profitable. The best-sellers, Chanel No5
and L'Oreal's Tresor, make annual sales of Dollars 120m. After the expensive
launch period, the cost of manufacturing and marketing falls to 35 per cent
of sales, leaving the perfumer with the potential of big profits.
YSL already owns two of the top 10 women's scents, Opium and Paris. But
Opium came out in 1977 and Paris in 1983. YSL has not had an important new
launch since 1988 when it introduced Jazz, its men's fragrance. The success
of Champagne is critical to its chances of maintaining its place among the
leading players. It also represents an opportunity for Elf-Sanofi to recoup
part of the cost of the controversial FFr3.6bn acquisition of YSL, which has
already sparked a stock market investigation into insider dealing.
YSL went to great lengths to ensure that Champagne's launch was as smooth as
possible. It started preparing for the launch in 1991. The choice of name
was always regarded as an important part of the process given that naming,
like every other aspect of fragrance marketing, has become increasingly
complex in recent years. YSL in the late 1970s bought the rights to the
Opium name for Dollars 200 from another perfumer. Chanel 10 years later paid
more than Dollars 500,000 to an astute Paris magazine editor who had
registered the worldwide rights to Egoiste.
Yves Saint-Laurent personally selected the name Champagne in 1991. His
choice did not appear to be problematic. Champagne had in 1943 been
registered as a fragrance trademark by Parfums Caron, a perfume group. YSL
spent an estimated FFr3m to buy the trademark and to register it worldwide.
These preparations were wrecked when the champagne industry this summer
initiated legal proceedings against YSL, claiming the existence of a perfume
called Champagne could confuse consumers and imperil the prestige of its
product. When YSL sued Givenchy over Keryus in 1986, the case was resolved
before the product went on sale, allowing Givenchy to introduce it
everywhere under the new name.
But the timing of the Champagne case could scarcely have been worse for YSL.
The earliest possible date for its appeal against last week's ruling is
January. In the meantime it must comply with the court's instruction that it
drops the name Champagne in France within 30 days. This means that even if
YSL wins on appeal it will have had to use a new name or withdraw Champagne
from the French market during the pre-Christmas season. This usually
accounts for half the year's perfume sales.
In the meantime YSL faces the threat of two other lawsuits from champagne
producers: one in Germany which should start in March, and another in the UK
that may not come to court until next summer. It must also decide whether to
risk implementing its plan to launch Champagne next year in North America
and Asia.
If YSL wins the French appeal and all the other cases, the damage to
Champagne will be limited to an unhappy first Christmas in France. But if
YSL loses the case in a single country, Champagne can never be a global
product.
YSL would then have to decide whether it was worth selling a fragrance under
different names in different countries. Guerlain did so in the 1950s when
Shalimar became a bestseller despite using the name No90 in the UK, because
another 'Shalimar' was already on sale.
But the perfume market has changed dramatically since the 1950s. YSL
operates in a world of globe-trotting customers. The rationale for global
marketing in fragrances is that when a Manhattan businesswoman visits Paris,
she can spot the new scent she saw advertised in American Vogue as soon as

FT  04 NOV 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Feeding puzzle fever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Locate, million, curator, wasteland: what have these words in common?*
This and several dozen other brainteasers are this week arriving at 150,000
homes in Tyne and Wear and south Northumberland in the form of Witzend,
believed to be Britain's first free-distribution, monthly puzzle magazine.
Printed in colour, on A4 gloss paper, Witzend's appeal to the public's
thirst for puzzles is intended to give it a much higher retention rate than
the average free publication.
To enhance its appeal, its range of puzzles supplied by Mensa, the high IQ
society, is supplemented by quizzes and games offering prizes linked
directly to advertisers and their products.
'This is something new and fresh, we were keen to get on board straight
away,' says Paul Keenan, PR manager at Gateshead's MetroCentre shopping and
leisure complex, a prominent advertiser in the first issue. The magazine's
family appeal and high retention prospects were key attractions.
Witzend was devised by Metromedia, a Newcastle-based design and marketing
company.
Editor Franco Polsinelli plans a Teesside version in early 1994 and
envisages nationwide distribution in a year. Puzzles supplied by Mensa would
remain the same throughout editions, with advertising geared to local
markets. Advertising rates of Pounds 2,600 for a full page are pitched
slightly below north-east free newspaper rates; Polsinelli has had no
difficulty selling advertising, with minimal discounts. The first issue has
broken even. Profits from subsequent Witzends will depend on raising the
advertising ratio from the first issue's 25 per cent.
Mensa's executive director Harold Gale is supplying the puzzles free; in
exchange Mensa, which frequently co-operates in media puzzle promotions,
receives free publicity and the assurance that the public's puzzle addiction
is being fed.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A whopping venture -
Burger King has moved into Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five years ago Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, the head of a Japanese railway and leisure
group who regularly tops lists of the world's richest people, ate his first
Burger King Whopper in the US. The experience was so overwhelming that he
immediately set himself the goal of bringing the fast-food restaurant chain
to Japan.
Tsutsumi's dream became a reality in September when Burger King, a
subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan of the UK, opened its first restaurant just
outside Tokyo. The deal was agreed in just five minutes last November when
Tsutsumi met James Adamson, chief executive officer of Burger King, for the
first time.
However, Burger King's move into the Y400bn (Pounds 2.5bn) Japanese
hamburger market comes as competition has intensified and leading fast-food
chains are feeling the effects of the prolonged economic downturn.
Japan's hamburger market is dominated by McDonald's and two Japanese chains,
MosBurger and Lotteria. The fast-food outlets, with the exception of
MosBurger which has succeeded with its Japanese-style burgers, are facing
increasing competition from pizza deliveries, sandwich shops and convenience
store chains.
Even McDonald's, which opened its first store 20 years ago, is facing lower
profit margins. The company's sales for the business year to December last
year grew a mere 2.4 per cent, the smallest rise since the company was
established in in Japan. Operating profits fell 20 per cent.
Samuel Yong, managing director of Burger King Asia Pacific in Singapore,
says the company could not enter Japan earlier due to the lack of the right
partner. Yong hired consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand to come up with a strategy
for Japan. They eventually concluded that the market had an opening for the
American flame-broiled Whopper burger. But Japan's high real-estate costs
meant Burger King needed a business partner with extensive real-estate
holdings.
Tsutsumi, who runs the Seibu Railway network, as well as theme parks, ski
resorts and a baseball dome, seemed an ideal partner. However, with the
venture being Seibu's first move into the food-service industry and Burger
King's first step into Japan, both sides felt it was better to sign a
co-operation agreement without spelling out long-term plans.
Seibu supplies the real estate and operates the outlets; Burger King
provides the know-how and cooking appliances. The partners agreed to halve
the profits for the time being. 'We want to let the relationship evolve as
it goes,' explains Yong.
'We want to make sure that our business is acceptable to the Japanese and
the restaurant operating economics are right.'
Yong says Burger King aims to keep its restaurants smaller than competitors
 -at about 1,000sq ft, a fifth of an average Burger King store in the US -
and to offer a simple menu with only nine items.
The company hopes to avoid the problems encountered by McDonald's and
Kentucky Fried Chicken, which have diversified and changed menus so rapidly
that customers and even employees could not keep up.
Masao Okada, head of Seibu's Burger King project team, says an increasing
number of Japanese are going overseas and tasting the Whopper. He expects to
open as many as 300 outlets over the next few years in Seibu's railway
stations and leisure facilities.
Analysts say much will depend on how far Burger King can expand in the
residential areas of Kanagawa, south of Tokyo, and Chiba, to the east, where
Seibu's railway network or entertainment facilities do not exist.
In spite of this scepticism, average daily sales for the first store
totalled Y1m during the initial few weeks of opening. The figure, one of the
highest sales per square foot among Burger King's worldwide network, was
achieved with the help of Tsutsumi eating a Whopper in front of television
news crews on the opening day.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Accountancy Column: Marketing practice far from perfect -
Kate Atchley says recent research reveals that many firms are still not
meeting client needs and expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATE ATCHLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO 'understand your clients if you want to succeed' has become something of
a platitude with which few practising accountants would argue. By now they
can be expected to have nurtured the necessary client-centred approach. Or
can they?
Research carried out recently by Kato Communications and Gilchrist Practice
Development Consultants shows accountancy practitioners to be way off the
mark in understanding many client needs and attitudes.
The results deserve close attention, because the firms likely to succeed in
the medium term will only be those which are effective in narrowing the gap
between clients' expectations and clients' experience of the services
provided.
The Kato survey* polled a sample of smaller and medium-sized firms
registered with the chartered accountancy institutes in England, Wales and
Scotland, and excluded sole practitioners and the largest 20 firms. They
were asked about their clients' views of their services. Gilchrist posed the
same questions to clients themselves: typically companies with turnovers in
the range Pounds 500,000-Pounds 2m.
The area generating the most striking disagreement was over fees.
Accountants rate reasonableness of fees as a top priority for clients: 98
per cent said this was very important or important to their clients.
But only 47 per cent of clients agreed, arguing instead that fee levels are
not fundamental to an assessment of their accountants. Even so, when clients
were asked about fees, only 9 per cent rated their accountants as 'good' or
'very good' in setting reasonable fees.
Dissatisfaction with fees has been exacerbated by the economic downturn and
growing competition from firms willing to undertake work at cut-throat
prices. None the less, it presents a serious credibility threat for firms
and deserves careful attention. The first step is identifying client
attitudes to fees charged by the practice concerned.
The survey offers some useful clues to reducing clients' dissatisfaction
with fees. For instance, 43 per cent of clients said they were unsure how
fees are compiled - while just 23 per cent of the accountants thought
clients needed more help in this respect.
Accountancy practices often apply double standards. They look for
near-certainty from their own suppliers in respect of future charges; but
they construct all kinds of fanciful reasons why they should not honour
their own clients' preference for the same level of certainty.
To be successful, firms should put an end to unnecessary obfuscation of fee
levels and the compilation of bills when dealing with clients. They could
adopt monthly billing and improve their cashflow as a consequence.
The survey showed that 45 per cent of clients would prefer their accountancy
costs to be spread more evenly throughout the year. Estimates could be
provided routinely for compliance work, with a clear specification of the
work expected to be undertaken for the given fee.
However, this will only solve part of the problem. While the audit continues
to be perceived as a low-value service, clients will want to buy as cheaply
as possible.
Why do some firms appear to experience little or no resistance to their
fees? Our best guess is that these accountants are succeeding where most are
failing - they are delivering a responsive and proactive service to their
clients.
Unprompted, 31 per cent of clients said that they wanted their accountant to
be more proactive - to offer new ideas and to use more imagination when
analysing their business. Surprisingly, a mere 0.2 per cent of the
practitioners, again without prompting, said that this was what clients were
looking for.
Closing this gap between client and accountant is going to be tough for the
average firm. But successful attempts to get 'on side' is bound to improve
clients' sense of receiving value from their accountant, and to ease fee
dissatisfaction.
This will not be simple to achieve. Many firms have reduced the number of
senior staff during the recession; and partners have client lists too long
to consider personally the individual needs of each as fully as they might
wish.
Again, the firms which produce creative solutions to this conundrum will be
ahead in a few years' time. Delegation and inculcating a client-centred
approach throughout the firm can help a great deal.
The picture is not all bad, however: 95 per cent of clients said they were
satisfied or very satisfied with the services they received, which closely
matched the accountants' estimate of 90 per cent satisfaction.
More than three-quarters of clients rated their accountants good or very
good on issues such as rapport, accessibility of staff, technical expertise
and responsiveness. Good rapport came out top with a 91 per cent rating,
which augurs well as a starting point for those partners determined to
achieve greater client satisfaction.
This reinforces the maxim that 'people first choose people'. Clients choose
accountants first and foremost if they regard them as people they will feel
comfortable working with. It is no great surprise to find them happy with
the rapport achieved.
That said, the profession does seem to be slipping up in some mainstream
areas: only 64 per cent of clients were satisfied or very satisfied with tax
advice received, and 62 per cent with general business advice.
These responses appear to be linked to the call for a more proactive
approach. Tax planning advice may need to be resuscitated, after declining
in prominence during the recession and because many tax options have been
closed in recent years.
Everyone is looking for better value for money. Both the accountants and the
clients were asked to identify improvements which would achieve this. Aside
from a more proactive service, 38 per cent of clients called for greater
clarity about fees; and 10 per cent for more contact.
Surprisingly, only 1 per cent of accountants saw improvements as a result of
greater contact. But they indicated that spending less time on regulatory
and compliance issues would help them concentrate more effectively on their
clients.
Many complain of the pressures imposed by the regulatory authorities,
growing competition between accountancy firms, rising bad debts during the
recession, and the inability or unwillingness of clients to pay for services
during periods of low profitability.
What are the lessons? No matter how the economic and professional climate
changes, a firm's best course lies in finding out what the client wants and
seeking to deliver it to the best of its ability. There may be scope for
altering clients' expectations, but good practice development (alias
marketing) consists of doing the right thing.
Equally, accountants are not using their clients sufficiently to generate
new work. We found that 91 per cent of clients would be happy to recommend
their accountant to other businesses if asked to do so. Among the
accountants, 41 per cent claimed that they had asked their clients to pass
on a recommendation. But just 5 per cent of clients had got this message. It
seems that the scorekeepers are being too modest for their own good.

FT  04 NOV 93 / 'No win, no fee' law scheme attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT PLANS to allow lawyers to take cases on a 'no win, no fee' basis
came under attack yesterday from the committee appointed to advise the Lord
Chancellor on regulating the legal profession.
The public plea from the Lord Chancellor's advisory committee not to
implement the system was labelled last night as a cack-handed attempt to
push Lord Mackay into changing his mind.
There was also surprise at the timing of the committee's announcement. The
scheme's form has been known since August and Lord Mackay has made clear
that he hopes to introduce it for personal injury cases by the end of the
year.
Conditional fees - under which solicitors charge nothing if they lose but
can charge up to double their normal fee if they win - are seen by the Lord
Chancellor as a partial solution to the problem of reduced access to justice
resulting from cuts in the legal aid budget.
His original plan, which the committee says it approved of, was to allow
solicitors to charge a premium on their normal fee of just 10 per cent.
However, the profession warned the Lord Chancellor that no solicitor would
risk a case on a conditional basis for such a small reward, and Lord Mackay
agreed to increase the premium to 100 per cent.
The committee objects to the 100 per cent premium because it says there is a
danger in many personal injury cases that it could swallow up to half or
even more of the damages, which could result in serious injustice to people
of often limited means.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Pledge by Howard on prison overcrowding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT will take whatever steps are necessary to solve short-term
prison accommodation problems, Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, told
prison governors yesterday.
Prisons are becoming increasingly crowded and emergency facilities such as
military camps are likely to be needed soon. At the Conservative party
conference last month, Mr Howard unveiled a tough law-and-order stance which
is likely to lead to still more people receiving custodial sentences.
Mr Howard, addressing the Prison Service conference in Blackpool, announced
proposals to strengthen governors' powers to punish indiscipline and to
enhance the role of work in prisons.
He said work should stretch prisoners and teach trades and skills that were
needed in the community.
Mr Brendan O'Friel, chairman of the Prison Governors' Association, said
governors regarded much of what Mr Howard had said about prison regimes as
simplistic.
Providing the resources to offer prisoners a full and demanding day would
require a reversal of recent policy, when many prison workshops had been
closed - apparently as a cost-cutting measure - and new jails built without
them.
Home Office figures yesterday showed that recorded crime in England and
Wales rose by 3.8 per cent to a record 5.7m offences in the year to June.
However the rate of increase has slowed substantially, from an 11 per cent
rise in 1991-92. But violent crime rose by 4 per cent and robberies by 14
per cent.
Meanwhile, the Audit Commission says in a report today that police forces
need to develop clearer management frameworks for tackling crime.
The public-spending watchdog says in a report that the framework should
include establishing the priority to be given to crime among other policing
demands. It says such factors as the likelihood of an arrest, the
vulnerability of the victim, and the cost of a crime to an individual or the
public should help determine the degree of police response to an incident.

TWO-THIRDS of employers are not conforming with new European Community
health and safety regulations on display screens, according to a survey by
the MSF technical union.
The union said that many people could be at risk from repetitive strain
injury, stress and eyesight problems as a result.
The poll of 240 union safety officers found that 50 per cent of employers
had failed to carry out the legal requirement to assess risks to health
associated with screens.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SURREY County Council yesterday applied to the High Court for judicial
review of government plans to expand parts of the M25 into a 14-lane
motorway.
The plan will go to a public inquiry, due to start next year.
Surrey claims it is impossible to assess accurately the impact of the first
widening proposals, which include link roads between junctions 12 and 15 (M3
to M4) without knowing the consequences of widening further stretches in the
future. No date has been set for hearing the application.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Attack on 'appalling' life policy advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFE assurance sales repre-sentatives are accused of giving appalling,
inappropriate and misleading advice in a new report, Bethan Hutton writes.
The research for Which?, the Consumers' Association magazine, was carried
out on visits to 45 advisers - a mixture of independents, tied agents and
sales representatives employed by insurance companies. Researchers asked for
guidance on the cheapest way to protect their families in the event of their
deaths.
According to Which? the most appropriate solution was term assurance, which
pays out if the person insured dies within a fixed period but has no other
cash value.
Most advisers recommended this, but a significant minority suggested
endowments or whole-of-life policies, which are generally more expensive and
pay more commission. Two researchers could have bought pension-linked term
assurance, but 13 of 28 advisers failed to mention this.
Lautro, the industry regulator, said yesterday: 'Obviously we will never
eradicate all the bad apples from the marketplace, but we do our best to
minimise the risks.'

FT  04 NOV 93 / Sunday working more common
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 40 per cent of the working population work on Sunday usually or
sometimes, according to an analysis of the 1992 Labour Force Survey.
About 3m people - 12 per cent of all people in employment - usually work on
Sundays and 7m (28 per cent) sometimes do. Regular Sunday work is more
common among the self-employed (22 per cent) than employees (11 per cent).
Since 1985 about one in four people have worked on at least one Sunday in
the previous four. Hotels and catering (34 per cent) and railways (30 per
cent) had the highest proportion of regular Sunday working. Of staff in the
retail sector, some 29 per cent of all employees sometimes or normally work
on Sunday.
Among employees not working on Sundays, attitudes towards doing so were
almost equally divided: 43 per cent were in favour of doing so, while 48 per
cent were opposed. Of those already usually or sometimes working on Sundays,
52 per cent were satisfied and 21 per cent dissatisfied.
Only 13 per cent of employees who did not work on Sundays agreed with the
statement: 'I have moral or religious beliefs which would stop me working on
Sunday.'

Employment Gazette, November 1993.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Dockers lose reinstatement case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S longest industrial tribunal case was finally resolved yesterday
when the Court of Appeal ruled against the reinstatement of 12 employees of
Tilbury Docks who lost their jobs with the Port of London Authority because
of their union work.
This overturned an industrial tribunal ruling that had ordered the
reinstatement and awarded payments and costs that would have taken
compensation, including redundancy pay for some of the workers, as high as
Pounds 100,000.
The Court of Appeal quashed the order - in effect reducing the compensation
available by between Pounds 20,000 and Pounds 30,000 for the longer-serving
highest earners.
The court ruled that it was impractical for the Port of London Authority to
re-engage the activists who were sacked in 1989.
The industrial tribunal ran for a record 197 days between 1989 and 1992
before finding that an original 19 shop stewards and activists of the TGWU
general union had been dismissed on the grounds of their trade union
activities following the abolition of the dock labour scheme.
Mr Ken Reid, TGWU regional secretary, said: 'The lads are disappointed as
you would expect.
'There is nothing worse than going 4 1/2 years with expectations high and
having them dashed by three judges who have never worked in a ship's hold in
their life.'
Since the case, he said, employers had been allowed to go back to the form
of casual labour for dock work that the unions had fought to outlaw during
the 1960s.
Overall, he said however, the case had been a victory because it had
established that employers could not dismiss staff because of their union
activities.
Only four of the original 19 have secured new jobs. 'The dockers won the
moral and legal argument over their dismissals but most of them are still
out of a job,' said Mr Reid.
He added that the Port of Tilbury, now privatised, was now recruiting casual
labour directly against the reassurances given at the time that the dock
labour scheme was abolished.
Meanwhile, two offshore drilling rig workers were yesterday awarded more
than Pounds 20,000 compensation against employers who sacked them for
refusing to take a pay cut.
The two workers were among 40 who monitored mud content in oil and gas
drills on offshore rigs around the UK for Anadrill, a subsidiary of the the
French company Schlumberger.
The two workers refused to accept basic pay reductions of 25 per cent,
believing the cuts to be in breach of their employment contracts.
Both were dismissed and took their case to industrial tribunal through their
union, the MSF technical union. One was awarded compensation of Pounds
10,820 and the other received Pounds 10,410.
Mr Roger Spiller, secretary of the MSF offshore section, said the case was
the first to challenge the interpretation of such offshore contracts.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Whitehall 'risks overstretching charities'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHITEHALL DEPARTMENTS have been warned not to place additional demands on
the voluntary sector without making adequate resources available, according
to a report prepared with the involvement of key government departments.
The report, to be published today, also warns that repeated changes in
government social and training policies are making the private sector and
grantmaking trusts reluctant to support social programmes.
The involvement in the drawing up of the report of the departments of
employment, education, environment and health and the Home Office gives its
findings an important status. They are likely to be considered by the
ministerial group on the voluntary sector.
Resourcing the Voluntary Sector was compiled after discussions between
charities, corporate funders and the government departments. It is the work
of three charity umbrella bodies - the Association of Charitable
Foundations, the Charities Aid Foundation and the Corporate Responsibility
Group - and will be launched at the Charities Aid Foundation conference
today.
The report says that government demands on the voluntary sector can be both
direct and indirect.
It suggests that the sector could be revolutionised by government policies
to encourage organisations to provide services under contract to public
agencies. This would also have the effect of significantly increasing funds
flowing through the sector.
However, there was a risk that contract funding might 'destroy the very
features' of the voluntary sector that led statutory funders to use it.
'These are its flexibility, choice and diversity between big and small
service providers, advocacy and watchdog functions,' the report says.
The government sets the agenda for other funders - such as private companies
and grantmaking trusts - because of its dominant position, the report says.
But companies and trusts have found dramatic shifts in government policy
'disruptive and undesirable'. Examples of such policy changes included the
Community Programme, Employment Training and Youth Training. Just as basic
government funding could attract other financial support, its withdrawal
could lead to waste and loss of funds.
Some funders had seen projects that they had supported collapse when
government money was withdrawn. As a result, the funders 'would not readily
join in partnerships to support government-funded programmes in future'.
Last month Mr John Major, the prime minister, rejected recommendations in
another report that tax relief for charities should be abolished now that
many provide services under contract to public bodies.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Political Notebook: Turning villains into heroes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY this government could succeed in turning errant fathers into martyrs.
That judgment on the operations of the Child Support Agency came not from an
opposition spokesman looking for an easy headline but from a sharp, if
world-weary, MP on the Conservative backbenches.
Commentators at Westminster tend to focus their attention on what they judge
to be the 'big' issues of the day. Has Mr John Major restored his grip on
the premiership? By how much will Mr Kenneth Clarke raise taxes? Has Mr
Malcolm Rifkind been forced to scrap another frigate?
But every now and then an issue unexpectedly hits MPs over the head. Their
postbags swell with complaints. Constituents queue at their weekend
surgeries with tales of hardship and demands for action.
Sometimes the preoccupations of the voters will coincide with the instincts
of the legislators: the outcry over the imposition of value added tax on
heating fuel is a good example. But more often the issue will take MPs
unawares.
The operations of the CSA, the subject this week of an investigation by the
all-party social security committee, provide the latest example. MPs of all
parties have stopped arguing about whether the government has broken this or
that promise on taxes or whether or not Mr Major is done for. Instead they
have joined forces to attack the CSA.
The agency, of course, only exists because three years ago the government,
with all-party backing, decided that absent parents - almost always fathers
 -should be made to take more responsibility for their children. There was
an easy coincidence of interest between those concerned about the poverty
endured by many single parents - almost invariably mothers - and a
government which realised that the taxpayer, through income support, was
picking up the bill for many absent fathers.
MPs should have realised, of course, there would be a fuss. As Ms Ros
Hepplewhite, the chief executive of the agency, told the committee this week
the basic intention behind the move was to achieve a significant
redistribution of income.
It was always intended that the average maintenance payment should double
from Pounds 25 per week per child to Pounds 50 per week. Mothers and the
Treasury (and mainly the latter) would be the beneficiaries. You cannot
introduce a change like that without making waves.
What few MPs realised at the time was that they were voting to give the CSA
virtually unchallengeable powers in fixing maintenance in cases where their
was no burden on the taxpayer and where parents had agreed 'clean-break'
financial settlements.
Nor did they appreciate that the crude formula used to assess maintenance
payments would take little or no account of the transfer of assets,
responsibility for children taken on through second marriages, or the
financial shock of large changes in the liabilities of absent parents.
Add to that the employment disincentive to those on low incomes facing a
huge increase in maintenance payments and the fact that most of the extra
money now being collected goes not to mothers but to the Treasury, and it is
little wonder that constituency surgeries are full of angry parents.
Ms Hepplewhite failed to offer any convincing response to the committee's
concerns. It was all up to ministers, was her most frequent response. Her
habit of answering questions in management school jargon (maintenance
payments are the CSA's 'product') did not betray much sensitivity to the
complicated world of family break-ups.
Mr Alastair Burt, social security minister, who gave evidence yesterday, was
similarly opaque. He signalled that in spite of the prime minister's pledge
of a review, his department was opposed to change.
It is true that only a small minority of the agency's cases at present
involve reopening 'clean-break' settlements. But the number will increase
sharply as the CSA spreads its net wider each year. So too will the number
of low-paid absent fathers who opt for state benefits when they see their
new maintenance bills.
In the meantime, the formula gives a father leaving his partner and children
a large financial incentive to ensure that the family home is sold and that
he maximises the cost of his new home to minimise maintenance payments.
Most MPs agree with Mr Frank Field, the select committee chairman, that the
cultural shift that the agency is designed to create - a recognition that
fatherhood bestows inescapable responsibilities - remains an essential aim.
But their postbags confirm Mr Field's judgment that it is not working
properly. Whatever Mr Burt says now, sooner or later the government will be
forced to agree.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Research shows majority of defendants treated as 'economic
units'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE majority of defendants are treated as 'economic units' by their
solicitors and do not receive adequate advice or representation, research
for the Economic and Social Research Council shows, Robert Rice writes.
The study found that most defendants were encouraged by lawyers to plead
guilty to save time and costs. If they did not agree they were frequently
branded as 'nuts'.
Professor Michael McConville, the author of the research, said the main
problem was the weight of work faced by solicitors, allied to declining
levels of legal aid and a loss of values associated with adversarial
justice.

THE REGENERATION of Plymouth's historic Royal William Yard, which includes a
range of Grade 1 listed stone buildings, was launched yesterday with a
London conference aimed at attracting private-sector investment.
The 19-acre yard at the mouth of the Tamar was built in the early 19th
century to supply the Royal Navy fleet. Now surplus to Ministry of Defence
requirements, the buildings have been neglected in recent years. The yard
has been handed over to the newly created Plymouth Development Corporation,
which has a Pounds 45m budget over five years to regenerate the yard and two
other waterfront sites.
The project is one of 14 announced this week by the Department of the
Environment under its initiative to encourage private-sector involvement in
regeneration. The corporation is seeking to create a mixed usage development
which may include restaurants, speciality shops and business and leisure
space.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Confusion on Thatcher Iraq arms role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARONESS THATCHER'S role in the arms-for-Iraq affair was thrown into
confusion yesterday when a witness in the Scott inquiry was unable to
produce documents backing his claims that she had supported exporting lathes
to Iraq when she was prime minister.
According to a memorandum written in December 1988 by Mr Alan Barrett, an
official responsible for vetting defence exports to Iraq, Lady Thatcher had
authorised the exports which intelligence had indicated could be used for
making shells and missiles.
Mr Barrett told the inquiry yesterday that not only had he been unable to
find the documents, but that he might have been mistaken to believe that
such documents existed.
However, questioned by Lord Justice Scott, he agreed that the name of the
former prime minister is not something that would have been inserted
'casually'. He insisted that he had 'certainly not made it up'.
Mr Barrett said he had been told about Lady Thatcher's involvement in
approving the machine tools 'around' October 1988. However, his memory
failed him over the precise details. 'I cannot remember who told me. I
suspect somebody in the Foreign Office . . . it would have been somebody at
assistant head or lower level.'
Mr Barrett said he had sent the memorandum to Lord Trefgarne, then defence
minister, who had not queried the reference to Lady Thatcher.
The judge intends to question Lady Thatcher and Lord Trefgarne before
Christmas about the extent of their knowledge of defence exports to Iraq
which may have breached government guidelines.
Further evidence emerged yesterday that officials and ministers justified
the export of machine tools made by Matrix Churchill on the grounds that
trade with Iraq allowed the secret services MI6 and MI5 to gather
information about its nuclear ambitions.
A senior MI6 official advised a secret Whitehall committee in December 1988
that the exports should proceed even if they breached the government's
guidelines. The hearing continues.
Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, yesterday criticised officials for
apparently withholding documents from the inquiry. He alleged that the
government was involved in a 'cover-up'.

FT  04 NOV 93 / EC air policies attacked: CAA warns of threats to
competition; Blocking tactics would give rise to 'higher fares and less
choice'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Civil Aviation Authority yesterday warned of threats to competition in
the European airline industry and put forward proposals to counter delaying
and blocking tactics on 'open skies' by some European Community countries
and their national carriers.
Mr Christopher Chataway, the CAA chairman, said the EC's air transport
liberalisation policy had created the conditions for more competition but
there was a serious risk that countries would seek to undermine its
implementation.
'If the policy is not adopted in practice there could be even more
concentration, even less competition leading to higher fares and less choice
for consumers,' he warned.
Mr Clifford Paice, the CAA's head of economic regulation, added: 'The danger
is that the industry's short-term problems will lead to short-term solutions
which in turn will lead to long-term problems.'
In a document published yesterday, the CAA called for a change in EC policy
on landing and take-off slot allocation at congested airports, tougher
controls on state aid for financially troubled airlines, the application of
a more rigorous EC aviation mergers and acquisitions policy similar to the
policy applied to other industrial sectors, and stringent safeguards against
anti-competitive behaviour.
The report, which is expected to be the first of a series of documents to
maintain pressure on the EC to pursue its airline liberalisation policies,
shows that normal economy fares on EC routes in continental Europe are about
30 per cent higher than routes from the UK to the EC and domestic US routes.
It also shows that EC airline costs, with the possible exception of British
Airways, Virgin and British Midland, are significantly higher than those of
US carriers.
The report highlights the fact that most of the busiest international routes
in the EC have a congested airport at one end and that there are no more
than two airlines on most routes. 'More than 95 per cent of EC routes are
monopolies or duopolies and only 26 routes in the EC have more than two
carriers,' said Mr Paice.
The report shows that flag carriers have been forced to lower fares when a
third airline has entered a busy route.
Although the CAA is not calling for the confiscation of slots at busy
airports from dominant airlines, it is proposing a toughening of EC slot
rules which require half of all newly created slots at congested airports to
be granted to new entrants. 'We think this is not enough and too slow,' said
Mr Paice. The CAA wants all newly created, unused or otherwise available
slots to be earmarked for new competitors.
On state aid, Mr Chataway acknowledged it was unrealistic to expect it to be
completely eliminated in a European industry where only BA was a fully
privatised flag carrier. But he said a limit had to be placed on government
aid for airline restructuring which should not be allowed to finance the
acquisition of other airlines or market share.
'State aid to keep Air France afloat is OK: but financing Air France to buy
BA is not,' Mr Paice said.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Ex-MoD official found guilty over Pounds 1.5m bribes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER director of the Ministry of Defence ammunition procurement
department was found guilty yesterday of taking Pounds 1.5m in backhanders
from arms companies in what is thought to be Britain's biggest corruption
case.
Mr Gordon Foxley, 69, was convicted of 12 charges of corruption at
Snaresbrook crown court in east London.
He was allowed Pounds 100,000 bail until December 10, when he will be
sentenced. Judge Andrew Brooks warned Mr Foxley, who retired in 1984, that
he faced the very real prospect of jail.
The judge ordered a report on his assets with a view to confiscating them.
Mr Foxley's Pounds 20,000-a-year job involved awarding contracts for
supplies of mortar bomb fuses, rockets, tracer rounds and other ammunition
for the armed services, principally the Army.
He fed most of these to three companies, Fiat subsidiary Fratelli Borletti
of Milan; Gebruder Junghans, based in Schramberg, Germany; and AS Raufoss,
which has offices in Gjovik, Norway.
In return they paid him backhanders or commissions of up to 5 per cent of
the value of the deals.
The amounts - Pounds 400,000 in one case - were first sent to companies Mr
Foxley either owned or ran. He then had the cash transferred to secret Swiss
bank accounts.
A four-year investigation failed to recover the cash.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Former building chief convicted of Pounds 2m theft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORMER chief executive of Farr Construction, the collapsed building
company, was yesterday convicted of stealing almost Pounds 2m from its
pension fund in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the company going into
liquidation.
Dr Gerald Smith was found guilty by a jury at Southwark crown court, south
London, on seven counts of theft and one of forgery. He will be sentenced on
November 24 and was released on bail until then on sureties of Pounds
100,000.
Dr Smith took control of the company, based in Westbury, Wiltshire, in early
1989. He was under pressure from the company's bankers to repay a Pounds
2.2m overdraft, lawyers for the Serious Fraud Office, which brought the
prosecution, had told the court.
The first theft from the pension fund took place in September 1989 when he
stole a cheque for Pounds 940,000 and diverted the money into the company's
accounts.
In January and February 1990 he stole securities worth almost Pounds 1m from
the fund and, having deposited them in a Swiss bank account, used them as
collateral for a loan to further shore-up the company.
He misled fellow directors about the finances of the pension fund by
presenting them with a false valuation report which stated the securities
were still owned by the fund.
The thefts did not prevent the collapse of the company, which went into
liquidation in December 1990. By then the pension fund's assets had fallen
from some Pounds 3m to a few hundred pounds.
In August 1991 Dr Smith wrote to the fund trustees and members, saying the
assets had been borrowed as a temporary source of funds to finance the
company's expansionist policy. 'I believed the fund could properly be used
to save the company,' he said.
He also promised to repay the fund to ensure that members did not suffer any
loss.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Suppliers of motor parts criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE revival of the UK motor industry is being put at risk by hundreds of
smaller component suppliers failing adequately to improve quality and
productivity standards, a Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders
conference will be warned today,
The warning will come from Professor Dan Jones, who holds the chair of motor
industry management at Cardiff Business School and is the author of the book
The Machine that Changed the World.
Prof Jones will tell the conference in Birmingham that the biggest UK
component groups have learnt from the Japanese and are trying hard to reach
world-class standards.
But he added: 'You can't have smaller component companies working to a
different set of rules when they're supplying parts which all have to be
incorporated into complete systems for the vehicle assemblers.
'The lower tiers are where we have to place the emphasis since that's where
the weaknesses lie.'
The warning to the sector reinforces one delivered by Mr George Simpson,
chairman of Rover Group, to a recent Commons trade and industry committee
inquiry into UK industrial competitiveness.

FT  04 NOV 93 / MPs vote themselves a 2-phase 5.4% pay rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs in the early hours of this morning voted to award themselves a two-stage
pay rise totalling 5.4 per cent over two years.
Opening a late-night debate on MPs' pay in the House Mr Tony Newton, leader
of the Commons, defended the proposal to award MPs a pay rise larger than
the one it is trying to impose on public-sector workers.
Mr Newton confirmed that the government was proposing to offer MPs a salary
increase of 2.7 per cent next year and 2.68 per cent in 1995.
Trade union leaders and some MPs have strongly criticised the proposal. They
say the government plans to impose a much more stringent pay round on
public-sector workers, amounting to 1.5 per cent this year and a possible
freeze next year.
Mr Newton said the planned pay increase for MPs reflected wage restraint. He
recalled that MPs had received no pay increase since January 1992, despite
the rise in consumer price inflation.
He calculated that inflation had risen by 4.6 per cent since the last pay
award, and that the 2.7 per cent increase for next year would therefore make
up a little over half the amount that MPs have lost in real terms over that
period.
Miss Margaret Beckett, Labour deputy leader, gave a guarded welcome to the
proposal. She insisted that it was not an increase above the rate of
inflation, 'but rather one, properly in the circumstances, behind the rate
of inflation'.
She argued that MPs had received no increase for 18 months.
Under the proposals, the salary of an ordinary MP would rise to Pounds
31,687 next year and to Pounds 32,538 in 1995. Those receiving a
non-parliamentary salary would receive Pounds 23,854 next year and Pounds
24,495 in 1995. It is also proposed that, from 1996, increases in MPs' pay
would be annually linked to a range of civil service bands.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Alliance &amp; Leicester to shut administrative site
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIANCE &amp; Leicester, the UK's fourth largest building society, is to close
its administrative office in Hove, East Sussex, with the loss of 700 jobs to
the town over the next four years.
The withdrawal from Hove, where Alliance Building Society was based before
its merger with the Leicester in 1985, dismayed local councils. The area's
unemployment rate is above the national average.
Mr Peter White, the society's chief executive, said it had to rationalise
administrative sites, and would be concentrating its retail financial
services operation in Leicester.
He said some redundancies, almost all at Hove, would be necessary but that
it was too early to say how many. Some staff would be relocated.
The first department to leave Hove will be computer services which will move
to Leicester in the next six months.
Mr Michael Ray, director of planning at Hove Council, described the closure
as 'a devastating blow to the local economy'. Council officers are to seek a
meeting with the society. Mr Paul Bevan, economic development officer at
Brighton Council, said he was concerned because the financial services
sector was one of the main employers in the area.
The society employs about 9,500 staff in the UK, more than 1,000 of whom are
employed in sites in or near Leicester, and more than 3,000 of whom are
based in Bootle on Merseyside. Mr White emphasised that the branch network
in Sussex would not be affected by the changes, and said the measures were
needed to improve efficiency and customer service. Increased competition
within the financial services sector has put growing pressure on
institutions to reduce their administrative costs. A&amp;L's cost-income ratio
rose much more than the average for the building society sector after its
acquisition of Girobank in 1990.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Delay to pension reform signalled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER LILLEY, social security secretary, yesterday rejected demands from
both sides of the Commons for swift reforms to pension legislation, and
hinted that the changes could slip beyond next year. He said he would first
have to seek comment from the industry on the 1,000-page report issued by
the government's advisory panel, the Goode committee.
Mr Lilley said in a Commons statement that he would shortly be issuing
discussion papers as the basis for industry-wide consultation.
He said, however, that it would be impossible to introduce pension
legislation before the 1994-95 session at the earliest. 'We have to make
sure that what we do makes the system better and safer and does not make the
mistakes that ill-thought legislation might do,' he said.
Mr Lilley added: 'I want to listen carefully to any comments on the detail
of the committee's recommendations, not least to ensure that the burden on
business is the minimum compatible with effective regulation.'
Mr Donald Dewar, Labour spokesman on social security, welcomed the broad
contents of the Goode report but warned that Labour would want to radicalise
its recommendations.
He said the recommendation that one third of trustees should be appointed by
pension-fund members was insufficient. He called for legislation to
introduce requirements to increase pensions in line with inflation, a
proposal which the Goode committee debated at length but rejected.
'The report should be seen as a starting point, and not as the finished
product,' Mr Dewar said.
Mr Lilley also signalled that he was prepared to consider alterations to the
government's rules for schemes which contract out of the State Earnings
Related Pension Scheme and provide the alternative Guaranteed Minimum
Pension.
Industry sources have said that Department of Social Security officials have
privately indicated sympathy for requests to scrap or greatly overhaul the
minimum pension scheme, regarded as an administrative nightmare.
The Goode committee drew attention to the complexity of the contracting-out
rules and suggested that easing these might offset the burden of additional
regulation.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Call for residuary mines body rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TIM YEO, environment minister, yesterday rejected a call for a working
party to examine the environmental threat of minewater flooding and
pollution after pit closures, Chris Tighe writes.
A delegation from County Durham, including Labour MPs, county councillors
and officers, yesterday urged Mr Yeo to set up a residuary body to be
responsible for abandoned mineworkings in the post-privatisation period.
Mr Yeo said he believed a working party was not needed in view of existing
contact between the National Rivers Authority and British Coal.
Concern in County Durham over the risk of the water table rising, leading to
polluted water supplies and possible subsidence, has been heightened by the
rapid closure of local pits. This has led to fears that British Coal will
cease its pumping operations that prevent water rising into abandoned
workings.

FT  04 NOV 93 / UDM may challenge pit closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL was yesterday threatened with a legal challenge after it
launched its pre-privatisation programme of pit closures by disclosing plans
to end mining at Calverton colliery in Nottinghamshire in a fortnight.
Leaders of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers said British Coal would
contravene the industry's modified colliery review procedure by closing the
pit on November 19 before consultations with workers would be concluded.
Calverton was one of 12 pits reprieved by the government in March.
Mr Mick Stevens, UDM general secretary in Nottinghamshire, said the pit was
financially viable and the union would fight the closure. It hoped to
persuade British Coal to keep the mine open while talks continued but would
consider a High Court challenge.
The stance of the UDM is significant because the union, which is predominant
in Nottinghamshire, is seen as more pragmatic than the National Union of
Mineworkers, the main union in the Yorkshire region, where more closure
announcements involving two to four pits are expected next week. Further
closures and mergers are expected in the next few months, to leave the
industry with about 15 pits for privatisation.
The 640 miners at Calverton will meet on Sunday to decide their next move.
Some may be tempted by British Coal's redundancy terms, which will provide
long-serving employees with up to Pounds 37,000.
British Coal said there was a precedent, at Cadeby in South Yorkshire, for
stopping production at a pit still in the review process. Calverton would be
kept in a state where it could be re-opened. Mr John Longden, British Coal
midlands director, said average production costs at Calverton were the
highest in the coalfield.
More than 22,000 workers have left the industry since last October. The
remaining 30 pits employ 19,400 miners and British Coal has 10,700 other
staff.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Cardiff Bay barrage approved
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE scheme to build a Pounds 152m barrage across Cardiff Bay was finally
approved by Parliament last night. Ministers cut short the last stage of
debate on legislation with a 'guillotine' timetable after five years'
scrutiny.
The barrage is designed to rejuvenate the derelict docklands area of south
Cardiff. It has been opposed on environmental grounds because it would flood
a 165-hectare freshwater wetland bird habitat.
Work is expected to start soon. The scheme will control the tidal waters of
the Taff and Ely estuaries, creating a 500-acre lake. Supporters claim it
will attract investment of about Pounds 2.5bn and create 30,000 jobs.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Photo-cards 'cut credit fraud'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE USE of photographs on credit cards had cut losses through fraud by more
than 90 per cent in the five months since its introduction, the National &amp;
Provincial Building Society said yesterday.
N&amp;P, the eighth largest society, said losses on its 120,000 Visa photocards
in circulation between May and October were Pounds 9,000 compared with more
than Pounds 100,000 on a similar number of ordinary cards.
It claimed that if all UK plastic cards were issued with a laser-engraved
photograph and signature of the holder, fraud could be cut from Pounds 165m
a year to Pounds 15m. A third of its 350,000 Visa cards are now photocards.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Anger at VAT on orange juice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treasury last night moved to impose VAT on freshly squeezed orange juice
from the beginning of December, holding out the prospect of an increase of
more than 30p in the price of a one-litre carton, Philip Stephens writes.
The move, through a parliamentary order which precluded debate on the floor
of the Commons, triggered angry protests from some Tory MPs who saw it as
the precursor to a wider extension of VAT in the Budget on November 30.
It also brought accusations that the government had for the first time
extended the VAT to fresh foods.
Processed fruit juices, including orange, are subject to VAT at 17.5 per
cent because they are classed as manufactured goods.
But freshly squeezed juices - overwhelmingly orange - have been zero-rated.
The market in fresh juices is worth about Pounds 50m per year.
The Treasury said the zero-rating had been an anomaly, pointing out that
apple juice was already subject to VAT at the standard rate. The rest of the
fruit-juice industry, with sales of around Pounds 1bn a year, also paid the
tax.
But some Tory MPs said the Treasury's method of pushing through the change
suggested it was afraid of a backlash from the Conservative back benches.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Coal fund trustees reject proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRUSTEES OF the British Coal Staff Superannuation Scheme yesterday rejected
one of the government's two proposals for administration of its pension
funds after privatisation and said the other would need significant
modifications before it could be accepted.
The scheme's trustees said their legal advisers believe that the
government's so-called Option B, which sets up a free-standing fund, 'is not
capable of satisfying the government's commitment to safeguard pensions'.
The scheme is the smaller of the two coal industry pension funds to be
affected by privatisation.
In its proposal for a free-standing scheme, the government said that members
would benefit from all of the surplus generated by better-than-expected
investment returns, but offered no protection against a shortfall. In the
worst case, this proposal could lead to a reduction in members' benefits,
the scheme's solicitors said.
However, the trustees say the government's alternative proposal will also
need further safeguards to ensure that pension promises are met. That
proposal calls for the government to act as guarantor of the scheme's
solvency, allows the government and pensioners to share in distribution of
surpluses, and sets up a 'closed scheme'. Current contributors could
participate in a new industry-wide scheme to which new employers would also
contribute.
Specifically, the trustees want the government to ensure that the practice
of increasing pensions in line with inflation is maintained.
The trustees are also calling for new legislation to codify members' rights
to index-linked pensions.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Clarke warned of revolt over aid for fuel tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE, the chancellor, was yesterday warned that he could face a
backbench rebellion over his plan to limit to less than Pounds 500m the
package to help the less well-off pay for the imposition of value added tax
on domestic fuel.
Mr Clarke last night met three senior officers of the Conservative backbench
1922 Committee, and was told of 'deep concern' among Tory MPs. Some Tories
yesterday said plans to limit compensation would be 'politically
disastrous'.
Sir Marcus Fox, chairman, and Sir Geoffrey Johnson-Smith and Dame Jill
Knight, the vice-chairmen of the 1922 Committee, met Mr Clarke. Dame Jill
said: 'The elderly and those who need heat but cannot afford it must be
compensated.'
One senior Tory backbench MP said the three 'implored the chancellor to
rethink his compensation package', adding that they remained doubtful if
they had any effect.
Many Conservative MPs want a package which will help pensioners who are not
on income support - the 'nearly poor', who typically have modest incomes and
savings and many of whom are supporters of the government. But the
chancellor has decided to restrict the compensation package to less than
Pounds 500m, in effect excluding this group.
Mr Nicholas Winterton, MP for Macclesfield, said the government had 'a death
wish' if it was thinking of restricting the package. 'If the government is
determined to lose the next election then it will impose VAT on domestic
fuel,' he said. 'It is becoming an albatross around its neck. It should at
least rethink its compensation package.'
Mr Andrew Bowden, Tory co-chairman of the all-party parliamentary group for
pensioners, said: 'The key group are the nearly poor, the 2.5m pensioners
who have only a small income over the income support level. They must be
helped. If the government do not come forward with positive proposals, there
will be serious trouble on the government back benches.'
Another Conservative backbencher said the chancellor should consider
different options to help the nearly poor, such as taxing them less.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said the government could defuse the row
by scrapping the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel and instead raise
revenue by ending tax abuses and loopholes which he estimates are costing
billions of pounds.
He proposed measures to save up to Pounds 10bn over two years, including
reform of inheritance tax, closing down tax relief on executive share
options, abolishing the business expansion scheme and ending tax relief on
private medical insurance.
He also called for a shake-up of corporation tax, including an end to
allowances for sales of companies with excess management expenses.
Mr Brown said he also favoured ending Britain's position as a tax haven. He
stopped short of recommending the end of sovereign immunity, but said Labour
would deal with the abuses which allowed companies to trade under the
umbrella of national governments.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, told BBC radio: 'We
are willing, where necessary, to close loopholes and take action against tax
avoidance.'

FT  04 NOV 93 / Bank governor tells businesses to hold margins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR EDDIE GEORGE, the governor of the Bank of England, last night called on
businesses to play their part in curbing inflation by generating higher
profits through increased output and capacity use, rather than higher
prices.
In a speech to finance directors in London, he said more than half the
recent rise in manufacturing output prices had come from higher margins,
measured as the difference between input and output prices.
He said that Britain had a realistic prospect, 'if we are wise', of
achieving non-inflationary growth 'that can be sustained through the rest of
the decade'. But businesses had to play a part in this.
'If we can persuade you that we will deliver sustained, non-inflationary
growth, I would hope we might then see businesses seeking to generate
profits more through higher volumes and increased utilisation of capital,
and less through higher margins,' he said.
Mr George pointed out that UK businesses had come through the recent
recession in a far better state than that of the early 1980s. He said the
pre-tax real rate of return on capital for non-North Sea companies was well
above the average level of the past 20 years. It never fell below 6 per cent
in the latest recession and had already recovered to above 8 per cent. By
contrast, the same pre-tax return fell to nearly 2 per cent in 1981 and only
recovered to 8 per cent by 1986.
The governor said he welcomed the large gains in productivity and cost
reduction that had contributed to higher profits.
However, Mr George warned that businesses might still be looking for returns
more suited to a high-inflation environment than a non-inflationary world.
He indicated that without greater restraint on margins the Bank would find
it less easy to prolong the economic upswing by holding nominal interest
rates down.
The Treasury reported yesterday that recent economic indicators pointed to
rising domestic demand with low inflationary pressures.
However, a drop in the Central Statistical Office's longer leading index of
economic activity, also announced yesterday, could signal a downturn in
output about a year from now.
A favourable short-term outlook for the UK was confirmed by the CSO's
shorter leading index, which is supposed to indicate economic turning points
in activity around five months in advance. This sustained an advance which
began last autumn, rising 0.8 per cent to 109.1 last month.
The longer leading index, which is designed to highlight turning points in
the economy 13 months in advance, has declined from a recent high in March,
reflecting negative contributions from most of its components since the
spring. However, the CSO warned that the data used to compile the latest
index was not complete.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Round-table talks on Ulster some way off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH and Irish governments yesterday launched a fresh appeal to
Northern Ireland's constitutional political parties to resume talks on the
province's future, but made clear that round-table talks involving all the
parties were still some way off.
However, in a move that augured badly for the future pariticipation of the
hardline Democratic Unionist party in talks, the Rev Ian Paisley, the
party's leader, unexpectedly delivered a letter protesting against the
holding of yesterday's Anglo-Irish intergovernmental conference session in
Belfast.
It emerged earlier this week that the UK government was prepared to press
ahead with the peace process even without DUP participation.
Yesterday's conference followed on from the start of the new peace
initiative of Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Albert
Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, in Brussels last week.
After the meeting Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr
Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, expressed optimism that the two
governments would press ahead quickly towards a new constitutional
settlement.
They made clear that dialogue would initially take the form of bilateral
discussions with British ministers.
Sir Patrick warned that an immediate push for resumption of round-table
discussions with all parties could be counter-productive. 'The only point in
getting around the table is when there is an agreement achievable,' he said.
One possible target would be to have an agreement in place before Mr Major
and Mr Reynolds meet at the UK-Ireland summit in Dublin within six weeks.
Sir Patrick said the six-point plan put forward by Mr Spring last week would
be 'central to the ideas that the two governments must bring to a conclusion
between themselves'. The plan showed 'very encouraging evidence of the
thinking of the Irish government'.
Sir Patrick also spoke of the 'unbreakable meshing' between the UK-Irish
talks and what the province's political parties were 'prepared to compromise
over' regarding the internal government of Northern Ireland.
Sir Patrick said there was 'no question at the moment' of having reached the
stage where Ireland's constitutional claim to jurisdiction over Northern
Ireland would be replaced or where the Anglo-Irish agreement was 'going to
be repealed'.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Tories still split over defence cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT faces continuing pressure from Tory back benchers over
defence cuts, in spite of the Treasury's agreement to scale back the
spending reductions planned for the next financial year.
The settlement between the Treasury and the Ministry of Defence is thought
to involve cuts of more than Pounds 1bn over three years, with the biggest
impact on spending in 1996-97.
The Pounds 23.75bn provision for defence expenditure next year is expected
to be cut by 1 per cent or less after Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence
secretary, succeeded in fighting off more drastic Treasury demands.
Although the front-line strength of the armed forces appears to have been
safeguarded, Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Conservative chairman of the all-party
Commons defence committee, said yesterday that he would seek assurances that
important equipment plans were not being sacrificed.
He indicated that he would strongly oppose the cancellation of projects such
as new ships to replace the two amphibious assault vessels used for Royal
Marine landings. Some of the MPs also want the Treasury to allow new defence
contracts to come through.
On Monday, several Conservative MPs met Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
to raise concerns about how the unified Budget might affect defence
spending. The chancellor did not reveal details of the defence-sector budget
at the meeting, but some of the MPs were concerned that he did not give
long-term guarantees for any military sector.
The Commons defence committee will be able to question Mr Rifkind about the
MoD's plans on the morning after the November 30 Budget statement.
Sir Nicholas said: 'We will have to look very closely at where the savings
will come from.' He added that there was room for 'substantial' savings
through reducing the number of civil servants in the MoD.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Government could scrap London bus deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is getting cold feet about its plans to deregulate London
buses.
Ministers are seriously considering removing legislation to implement its
proposals from the wide-ranging deregulation bill, which is intended as one
of the cornerstones of the next parliamentary session, starting this month.
A final decision on whether or not to remove the proposals may be taken at
tomorrow's cabinet meeting.
The rationale for withdrawing the plans would be a desire to avoid
controversy. Ministers have tried to focus the new session's legislative
timetable on areas - such as law and order - which are calculated to unite
Conservatives.
This follows the damaging and protracted internal wrangling that accompanied
the passage of the Maastricht bill through parliament.
The decision on bus deregulation will be finely balanced: ministers are said
to be evenly split between those who favour caution and those who wish to
push ahead.
Advocates of the latter course argue that bus deregulation was originally
intended as the heart of the bill, which is to be piloted by the Department
of Trade and Industry.
Backbench discontent over the proposals erupted during the summer, with Sir
Rhodes Boyson, a former Tory minister, warning that deregulation was 'a form
of suicide pill' for Conservative prospects in London's council elections
next May. A poor performance in these elections would prompt renewed doubts
over Mr John Major's leadership.
The plans to bring London into line with bus services outside the capital,
which were deregulated in the mid-1980s, have also been criticised by local
authorities and London Transport on the grounds they will lead to road
congestion and fare rises.

FT  04 NOV 93 / Businesses in Notts set growth priorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 200 business leaders in north Nottinghamshire yesterday called for
a unified approach among local authorities and private-sector promotional
bodies to foster economic development in the area.
The call, at a conference in Rufford, Nottinghamshire, reflects concern
about the impact on the local economy of pit closures.
The conference agreed a set of priorities to create a climate for economic
development.
The first was a dialogue between financial institutions and local business:
there is concern about a shortage of venture capital.
There were also demands for improvements to the area's infrastructure,
especially east-west communications, and for more higher educational
facilities, including a university.
