FT  02 NOV 93 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management (4): Lower rates
bring new problems - Debt management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
UK COMPANIES breathed a huge sigh of relief when interest rates started to
come down late last year, but at the time only a few believed that rates
would fall as far as they did.
One of the main advantages of a low interest rate environment is that
companies have been able to make substantial savings by re-financing old,
high-coupon debt with cheaper debt.
Investor demand for long-dated paper has also enabled companies to extend
the maturity of their debt profiles. By issuing long-dated bonds and
redeeming short-dated debt, many companies have achieved an average life for
their debt of more than five years at the lowest interest rates in 20 years.
At the same time, the lack of supply of corporate debt, especially in the UK
bond market where demand has been great, has resulted in a dramatic
tightening in the spread on such paper, that is, the premium which issuers
have to pay above the yield on government bonds.
Many companies have also shifted the balance of their fixed-rate and
floating-rate debt in favour of floating-rate debt, in order to make the
most of further falls in interest rates.
Although the benefits to companies of lower interest rates cannot be
under-estimated, the sheer pace of the fall in rates has created a new
series of problems for company treasurers to solve.
Companies which find themselves in the most difficult position are those
with a high proportion of their debt fixed at a rate well above the current
interest rate.
Since they are having to pay more than the market rate to service their
debt, this places them at a competitive disadvantage to their rivals who
have a far greater proportion of their debt with a floating or market rate.
Each time rates fall, the competitive disadvantage becomes greater.
'It hurts to admit that you are paying well above the going interest rate
for your debt,' says a banker at a leading investment bank.
As a result, banks are noticing a rise in demand from companies for
derivative products that enable them to cut the cost of servicing their
fixed-rate debt, says Mr Paul Ward, director in the fixed-income department
at Salomon Brothers in London.
The derivative product designed to help companies in this situation is
called an 'interest-rate swap'. Using this structure, the company enters an
agreement with a counterparty, usually the derivatives unit of an investment
bank, to swap the fixed rate on its debt for a floating rate.
It is likely that the company will end up having to pay a substantial margin
above the London interbank offered rate (Libor), because of current market
conditions.
However, it will reap the benefit of the swap when Libor falls, because its
interest costs will decline accordingly. Had the company decided to stay
with fixed-rate debt, its borrowing costs would have remained the same.
Falling interest rates also harm companies which relied on the interest
income generated by their cash mountains during the period of high interest
rates. 'Corporates do not usually buy protection against falling interest
rates,' says Mr Marco Ferrazzi, senior vice-president at Chase Manhatten
Bank in London.
One solution for a company in this situation would be to enter a swap which
allows it end up receiving a fixed rate on its cash mountain. In return it
pays a floating rate to the counterparty. This is effectively the reverse of
the swap taken out by a company looking for a solution to its fixed-rate
debt problem.
Mr Ferrazzi says that another way that a company can insure itself against
falling interest rates is to buy a 'floor' or a minimum interest rate, which
it will continue to receive on its cash even if rates go below the level
specified by the floor.
Alternatively, the company can sell a 'cap' or a maximum interest rate
against its cash, whereby it gives up any potential returns above the cap in
return for a fee.
Companies also use swaps as an efficient way to adjust the
fixed-rate/floating-rate split of their debt portfolio depending on the
trend in interest rates.
Mr Arthur Burgess, group treasurer at British Gas, says that British Gas
aims to have three-quarters of its debt in fixed rate and one-quarter in
floating rate, but that the split can vary to half-and-half depending on the
company's view on interest rates. 'We use the swaps market to switch from
fixed to floating,' he says.
Derivatives are becoming an increasingly important part of a company's
strategy to manage debt. Indeed, a recent court decision in the US has
potentially opened the door for directors to be sued for failing to use
derivatives to protect their companies against volatility in the financial
markets.
The Indiana court of appeals (Brane v Roth) held that the directors of an
agricultural co-operative had been negligent in not considering the
possibility of hedging their company's grain holdings by using the futures
market.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Survey of Corporate Treasury Management (1):  Purse strings
are tightened - Volatility in European currency markets and fear of foreign
exchange dealing losses have forced companies to strengthen controls and
re-assess their approach to hedging.  Institutional investors are also
demanding greater disclosure.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WHILE THE advantages of a strong treasury function have become much more
widely appreciated by companies in recent years, so too have the potential
risks associated with a poorly managed treasury operation.
The loss of Pounds 150m in foreign exchange dealings by the treasury
department of Allied-Lyons, the UK foods group, in 1991 triggered a wave of
concern about internal management procedures.
Since then, as well as tightening up controls, many companies have also
started to pay more attention to broader policy issues. In particular, the
unexpected volatility of European currencies over the past year has forced a
number of companies to reassess their approach to hedging.
For example, many UK companies had stopped hedging their exposure to
European currencies, because they thought that they were protected by the
exchange rate mechanism. When some currencies fell outside the system, they
were taken by surprise.
'Many boards have been requiring the treasurer to be much more rigorous in
deciding the hedging programme,' said Mr Derek Ross, a partner at Touche
Ross who advises companies on treasury management.
There is a growing tendency to take shorter-term decisions on currency
hedging; for example, hedging two to three months ahead, rather than 18
months, so that if the market turns, the company is not locked in at a
disadvantageous rate for a long period.
Company board members are less likely these days to dismiss treasury
officials as bureaucrats, and more likely to have an idea of what actually
goes on in their company's treasury operation.
The other issue which has brought corporate treasury into the limelight has
been a growing chorus of demands by institutional investors for greater
disclosure of corporate treasury policies in companies' accounts.
The Association of Corporate Treasurers (ACT), a grouping of UK company
treasurers, has produced an exposure draft of guidelines for disclosure. In
the current climate, in which companies are being bombarded with new
disclosure requirements, some companies are rather unenthusiastic, while
others take the view that the guidelines should go further.
Again, currency volatility has highlighted this issue. Analysts or investors
looking at, for example, a UK company which has a large US operation could
expect that company's results to improve as a result of a stronger dollar.
However, if that exposure to dollar earnings has been hedged, this will not
be the case. Analysts would like to know not only whether the exposure is
hedged, but also what rate the company has locked in.
Only a few UK companies, including RTZ and Courtaulds, describe their
treasury activities, including interest-rate and currency exposure
management policies, in any detail.
Among companies themselves, there has been a renewed focus on cash
management. 'If you can manage Dollars 10m of liquidity better, that is
fundamental to the business,' points out one treasury adviser. The stronger
emphasis on performance management, as well as tough times at many
companies, has focused attention on an area that was often ignored in the
1980s.
But the emphasis on internal controls remains strong. The Allied-Lyons loss
was incurred by the writing of currency options, creating huge positions
which were concealed from senior management.
In the wake of that loss, the ACT issued a set of guidelines urging tighter
internal controls, regular audits and full disclosure of risk management
strategies.
However, companies have continued to report losses stemming from treasury
operations. Most have been on a much smaller scale, though a few have been
substantial.
Most recently, Showa Shell Sekiyu, the Royal Dutch/Shell group's Japanese
affiliate, revealed in February that traders in its treasury department had
run up some Dollars 1bn in unrealised foreign exchange losses.
A Dollars 6.44bn forward exposure to the dollar at the end of last year was
incurred in secret by a group in Showa Shell's treasury, which had
erroneously believed the US currency would rise against the yen. Announcing
its first-half results in August, Showa Shell described progress in
unravelling the exposure as encouraging, but said there was a 'longish
tunnel' of two to three years before it would emerge from the episode.
This latest loss points to a particular area of danger for large
multi-national companies, which lies in the difficulty in keeping tabs on
all areas of business. Most large multi-national companies now have
centralised dealing operations, rather than treasury functions attached to
each offshoot.
'Generally, there has been quite a big improvement in the amount of
attention that top management has given to internal control,' said Mr Ross,
who is also chairman-elect of ACT. 'But for many groups that is primarily
exercised in head office. Quite often, problems arise in some far-flung
branch or associated company.'
For companies concerned about the efficacy of their internal controls, there
are a number of important checks to be implemented, such as making sure that
the company's board agrees with policy, that there is complete segregation
of duties between dealing, confirmation settlement and reporting functions,
and that all transactions are marked to market value. These procedures
should also, of course, apply to financial institutions.
For example, Sumitomo Finance International incurred a Dollars 2-3m loss on
its interest-rate options book last autumn, after a desk manager had
concealed his real trading position from senior management.
The manager of the interest-rate options desk had to record the value of his
positions in management reports submitted to his chief executive, but he
gave falsely inflated values in order to hide his true position. He then
persuaded an employee with another firm, which he knew was used by
Sumitomo's accounts department to check those valuations, to quote inflated
prices that corresponded with those in his own internal management reports.
'In my experience, there are a lot of banks where a trader, believed to be
of exceptional quality, reports direct to the top,' said Mr Ross, who
advises banks and securities firms in this area. 'It's easy to develop a
culture which allows the trading-room to develop without controls.'
Since the Allied-Lyons losses were reported, there has also been a general
move to upgrade computer systems, as technology has advanced and costs have
fallen. Sophisticated systems are particularly important in certain areas of
risk containment; for example, in marking to market. 'But the key features
of internal controls are not systems issues,' Mr Ross said.
While a collusive fraud may still be hard to detect, controls involving a
range of different functions in the trading, settlement and reporting
process at least reduce the opportunities for positions to be hidden.
'You can't stop somebody doing an unauthorised trade,' admits Mr Ross. 'But
you can make sure it can be closed out the following day.'
While there is still a strong emphasis on keeping controls in place in the
treasury department, the emphasis on managing financial risk is also
spreading away from the treasury function, according to some management
consultants.
Consultants at Coopers &amp; Lybrand point out that many of the notorious losses
at companies in recent years stem from inadequate management of financial
risks in other areas of the business - production quality failure in the
case of Perrier, marketing failure in the case of Hoover, for example.
What these losses have in common, according to Coopers, is that, like
Allied-Lyons' Dollars 150m hit, they were not expected by top management and
they could have been avoided by proper financial risk management.
'Financial risk is being redefined,' says Mr Howard Lovell, a partner of
C&amp;L. 'Should companies have a risk management function, over and above the
Treasury department?' For example, a finance director could be given the
task of managing the risks facing the company in a broader context.
For all the importance of interest-rate management, interest-rate risk is
relatively small, compared with other risks to the company which could wipe
them out, he argues, adding that some companies have already taken this
point on board.
Mr Lovell takes his argument a step further. 'Is treasury going to be called
treasury in five years time? Or will it be called risk management?'

FT  02 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: India backs sugar re-export
plan - The country's proposals for retaining credibility as a supplier and,
below, on moves to let coffee growers sell their crop abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE INDIAN federal government is favourably disposed to a proposal by the
Indian Sugar and General Industry Exim Corporation to import raw sugar this
season for re-export, after processing, as white sugar.
The corporation has suggested the export-linked import of 250,000 tonnes of
raw sugar during the 1993-94 season. India, which re-entered the sugar
export market in 1990-91 after a gap of six years, will not have any
exportable surplus in the current season.
The initial sugar production forecast for 1993-94 is 11m tonnes, compared
with actual production of 10.6m tonnes last season and 13.4m tonnes in
1991-92. In spite of last year's serious setback in production, India could
export 411,000 tonnes of sugar as the 1992-93 season opened with very
comfortable stocks of over 4.9m tonnes. Indian exports in 1991-92 were
562,000 tonnes, up from 223,000 tonnes in 1990-91.
The Exim corporation has also recommended the import of another 550,000
tonnes of raw sugar in the current season to be refined for domestic
consumption. These import would be made on condition that the same amount
was exported in the following season, when production is expected to
improve.
The Indian Sugar Mills Association has warned the government that India will
lose 'credibility as a dependable source of supply' if it suspends export in
the current season. 'The now on, now off approach to export has not helped
us in the past,' an ISMA official said recently. 'We have made a
considerable effort to develop a market for Indian sugar in the neighbouring
countries. This we do not want to lose.'
Moreover, importing raw sugar for processing into white sugar would enable
the Indian industry to use capacity that would otherwise remain idle.
In the meantime, the mills association has taken strong exception to a
government move to liquidate the buffer stock of 500,000 tonnes of sugar
created six months ago. It argues that not only should the buffer be
maintained but its size should be expanded whenever there is an opportunity
to ensure regularity of export, irrespective of variations in domestic sugar
production.
According to ISMA, Indian sugar production will once again be low as the
area under cane has not increased. What it finds most disturbing is that the
area under cane in Maharashtra, India's most productive cane growing state,
has shrunk, while 'the condition of the crop in the drought affected
Maharashtra is far from satisfactory'. Floods have affected the standing
crop in Bihar and a few other places.
Total supply of sugar in the current season, which opened with stocks of
3.2m tonnes, will be 14.2m tonnes at most. As domestic consumption will be
more than 12m tonnes, compared with 11.9m tonnes last year, the next sugar
season is likely to open with disturbingly low stocks.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Xerox breakthrough worries
silver market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SILVER'S BIGGEST market could be threatened in the long term if Xerox
Corporation's claim to have developed a silver-free film process is
justified, analysts suggested yesterday.
Worries about the Xerox breakthrough forced silver's price in London down by
15 cents a troy ounce, or 3.4 per cent, to 423.5 cents by the close
yesterday. The sharp movement unnerved the rest of the precious metals
market and gold fell to Dollars 362.75. down by Dollars 6.05 an ounce.
Xerox announced its new product, VerdeFilm, at the weekend. It is aimed
solely at the graphic arts market and substitutes for the silver-halide
films used to make mastering plates for high-quality photography used in
many magazines, newspapers and commercial printing. Xerox said there seemed
to be no way yet for the process to be applied to consumer photography.
However, the US group claimed that in graphic arts applications its patented
technology 'surpasses traditional silver-halide in quality and costs and
addresses a pressing environmental concern' as VerdeFilm did not require any
toxic processing chemicals.
Graphic arts used about 1,300 tonnes of silver last year, or one-fifth of
the 5,800 tonnes used for photography and about 7 per cent of total silver
consumption - 18,300 tonnes in 1992 - according to the Silver Institute, a
Washington-based promotional organisation.
'This development could give silver a bad image,' said Mr Andy Smith,
analyst at Union Bank of Switzerland. He suggested Xerox's announcement
could have a depressing impact on sentiment in the silver market in the same
way as two other relatively recent revelations - news that Ford had
developed a non-platinum car catalyst and that some central banks had been
selling from their gold hoards - dented other precious metals markets.
'These are things that the market said would never happen. And now some of
the conventional wisdom in the silver market is being challenged.'
Mr Tony Warwick-Ching of the Commodity Research Unit consultancy group, like
Mr Smith, said he spoke without knowing the full details of Xerox's
technology or the costs of using it. But if the quality problems usually
associated with non-silver film had been overcome, 'this could threaten
silver in the long term'.
Mr Smith said the fall in the silver price towards Dollars 4 an ounce would
be a good test of demand in the Middle and Far East where 'they take no
notice of technological developments'. Demand there would probably prevent
the price falling much further.
Xerox said it would start commercial deliveries of its new product in the
second quarter of 1994. Its process uses selenium, produced mainly as a
by-product of electrolytic copper refining. About 30 per cent of the 2,000
tonnes of selenium produced each year goes to the electronic and photocopier
industries.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee growers to taste foreign
trade
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN AN important move towards liberalisation of coffee marketing, the Indian
federal government is to allow growers to export the commodity independent
of the Coffee Board.
Encouraged by the success of its earlier scheme to allow the growers to
retain 30 per cent of the crop for marketing within the country, the
government has now given in to their demand to participate in the export
trade.
According to the new scheme, described as free sale quota (FSQ), growers
will keep 50 per cent of the crop for marketing inside and outside the
country.
The scheme will, however, become operational only when certain amendments
have been made to the Indian Coffee Act of 1942. As the Indian Parliament is
not in session now and the government wants the scheme to be operational
soon, the changes in the Act will be made through an ordinance.
The growers will make over the remaining 50 per cent of the crop to the
Coffee Board.
It is now clear that the government will progressively increase the size of
FSQ, reducing the marketing role of the board and placing a question mark
over the future of many of its 4,000 employees. According to growers'
organisations the Coffee Board, in common with other commodity boards,
should be concerned with research and development and promotion of the
beverage, particularly in India.
In the meantime, growers are confident that they will be able to realise a
better unit value from export sales than the board.
In fact, the stagnation in domestic coffee prices has already been broken
after the introduction of privately organised auctions.
There is a general sense of relief that a large-scale change in the coffee
trade will coincide with an expected bumper coffee harvest of more than
225,000 tonnes in 1993-94, up from 161,500 tonnes last year.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LCE raw sugar contract hit by
volume slump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING volume in the London Commodity Exchange's new raw sugar futures
contract has slumped after a buoyant start.
Volumes in the contract, launched on October 1, fell from 1,655 lots on the
first day to as low as 15 lots on October 26, giving an average for the
month of 370 lots a day.
Mr Robin Woodhead, LCE chief executive, said: 'Whilst we want to see much
greater levels than currently, it's still very early days and there would
still seem to be a high level of support from the trade.
'We remain optimistic that volumes will increase once the physical market
becomes more active.'
The premium contract was launched to take advantage of dissatisfaction with
the raw sugar contract traded on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New
York. Many traders disagreed with a decision to allow Brazilian crystal
sugar to be delivered against the New York contract, saying it should not be
classed as raw sugar.
ED&amp; F. Man, the London trading house, said the downward trend in volume must
be causing concern to the LCE. But Ms Angela Mutton, sugar researcher with
Man, pointed out that volumes had been subdued in New York as well as London
last month.
Mr Chris Pack, sugar analyst at C. Czarnikow, another London trade house,
said the contract faced a 'catch-22 situation', with volumes unlikely to
pick up until the physical trade began to show interest.
'The sugar producers are looking for volume, and until they're in there,
there won't be the volume.'

FT  02 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pakistan's cotton crop may be
15% below target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISLAMABAD
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PAKISTAN'S cotton output may be as much as 10 to 15 per cent lower than this
year's target of 12m bales because of pest attacks in central Punjab, senior
government officials say in their latest assessments.
The new estimates may be a setback to Islamabad's efforts in recovering from
last year's large-scale damage due to severe floods and a subsequent virus
attack. Output fell then to 9m bales from the expected 12m bales.
Mr Zahoor Ahmed, head of Pakistan's leading cotton research station, in
Multan, said yesterday: 'The cotton crop could be 10m bales.'
Recent pest attacks in the Faisalabad division of central Punjab may have
damaged as much as 50 per cent of the crop in that area, he added. The final
estimates for this year's crop are expected to be made available in the next
couple of weeks.
Meanwhile, legislators elected from Pakistan's cotton belt in Southern
Punjab are expected to ask the government for special relief if the crop
damage is spread over an area which is larger than current estimates.
One member of the newly elected National Assembly - the lower house of
parliament - said: 'What I have seen out in the fields is certainly no
indication of the bumper crop that we hoped to have. It's a sad story of
last year's calamity of floods being followed by this year's viral
infection.'
Stock prices on Pakistan's largest stock market, the Karachi stock exchange,
have risen in recent weeks, partly because of expectations of a large cotton
crop and so a cheaper raw material, which would be likely to increase the
profitability of textile factories.
But with the latest damage assessments, which may raise cotton prices in the
local market, it is not yet clear if the forward movement on textile shares
will continue.
However, an official of the Pakistan Central Cotton Committee said the
rumours of pest attacks could be intended to boost prices, which have
dropped in recent weeks on reports of a good crop this year. 'It is too
early yet to discuss the damage, if any, to the crop,' he said.
Prices for fresh crop cotton have fallen sharply to 950 rupees a maund
(37.32 kg), from about 1,100 rupees a month ago.

and demand news

OIL MARKETS are likely to remain unsettled in the run-up to the release
later this week of demand forecasts for consuming countries and publication
of official figures on October production levels by members of the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, analysts said yesterday.
Prices for Brent Blend for December rose to Dollars 16.10 in late London
trading yesterday after falling below the psychologically important Dollars
16 a barrel level last Friday.
The weak prices prompted Mr Gholamreza Aqazadeh, the Iranian oil minister,
to suggest at the weekend that Opec, which meets in Vienna later this month,
might have to re-examine its production ceiling of 24.52m barrels a day in
order to stabilise prices.
But Mr Peter Bogin, of Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris, said
yesterday that 'it would be very difficult for Opec to go below' the current
ceiling, which was set in September and which is due to run until the end of
March next year.
'Everybody is surprised at how weak prices are, but we just have to assume
that there is too much supply for present demand,' he said.
International Energy Agency figures on likely oil demand in the main
consuming countries are due out at the end of the week.
'If the IEA cuts its demand forecast again then it will reinforce the
bearish market,' said Mr Bogin.
Other factors behind the recent price weakness include reduced demand from
Asia, especially Japan. Asian buyers are normally the first to take
advantage of low crude oil prices, but they are 'not leading the way'
because of the economic slowdown in important economies, said Mr Vahan
Zanoyan, a director of the Washington DC-based Petroleum Finance Company.
He also pointed to an overhang of crude oil stocks, sharply increased
production from the North Sea, the possibility of Iraq's reaching an
agreement with the United Nations which would allow it to resume oil exports
and some 'minimal' Opec output in excess of the production ceiling as
additional factors depressing the markets.
Some unofficial estimates have placed OPEC's October output at more than
24.9m b/d. The Middle East Economic Survey yesterday described such
estimates as high, but said they had 'severely undermined' market
confidence.
Mr Zanoyan said Opec may simply have to hope for an early cold spell in the
northern hemisphere to prop up prices. 'A few weeks of temperatures several
degrees below normal in November or early December can have a
disproportionate impact on prices.'
The flow of crude oil through the Brent pipeline system in the North Sea has
been cut to 60 per cent of capacity due to maintenance on a pump Reuters
reports from London.
A Shell/Expro spokesman said the pump on the Cormorant Alpha platform was
taken out of service over the weekend.
'Production levels are being maintained using available platform storage,'
he said.
Cormorant Alpha is the hub of the Brent pipeline system through which crude
oil from nine other fields passes on its way to the Sullom Voe terminal in
the Shetland Islands, where Brent Blend crude is mixed.

sub-committee to investigate Nestle India allegation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUB-COMMITTEE of the Indian Coffee Board is inquiring into an allegation
that Nestle India, an important presence in the country's domestic and
export trade in coffee, has diverted a portion of the coffee bought in
export auctions into the domestic market, writes Kunal Bose.
While the company maintains that no diversion of coffee meant for export has
been made to the domestic market, the sub-committee, which is unsatisfied
with the returns submitted by Nestle for purchases made at export auctions
between October 14 1992 and June 9 1993, thinks there is reason to debar it
from participating in future export auctions.
The commerce ministry does not, however, favour the idea of keeping Nestle
out of the export auctions. Its main concern is to step up exports as the
country heads for a bumper coffee crop in 1993-94.

ALUMINIUM prices dropped to fresh eight-year lows on the London Metal
Exchange yesterday, tumbling to Dollars 1,037 a tonne at one stage before a
short-covering rally took the three-month price back up to Dollars 1,045.2,
down Dollars 22 a tonne from Friday's close. Aluminium's collapse depressed
sentiment in other metals, particularly COPPER, which sagged back towards
six-year lows. However, traders said there was some underlying support near
Dollars 1,620 a tonne. NICKEL was lower from the outset and prices subsided
below Dollars 4,600. Silver's fall (see story above) dragged down precious
metals and GOLD tested support at Dollars 362 before closing in London
Dollars 6.05 a troy ounce down at Dollars 362.75. PLATINUM fell by Dollars
5.15 to Dollars 369.35 an ounce. 'Having failed on the upside last week,
silver gave us the excuse to take it (gold) down to test lower levels,' said
one dealer. Another said platinum 'has not acted independently for weeks; it
is just mirroring movements in gold and silver'. COCOA prices clawed back
some of their early losses, with the March contract closing at Pounds 964,
down Pounds 6, in routine trading, after dipping to Pounds 955 following a
slump in New York.

FT  02 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Offerings from Andalucia, Depfa in the
pipeline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISSUANCE in the international bond market was minimal yesterday as many
financial centres in continental Europe were closed for All Saints' Day.
However, some interesting Eurobond offerings are expected this week. The
Spanish region of Andalucia is expected to raise FFr1.3bn through an
offering of 10-year Eurobonds. Paribas, Banco Central Hispano and
Commerzbank are arranging the deal.
The bonds are likely to be priced to yield 20 to 25 basis points over
underlying French government bonds. Andalucia last tapped the Eurobond
market in February when it raised DM400m through an offering of five-year
Eurobonds.
Depfa, the German mortgage bank, is expected to launch a French franc
Eurobond issue next week.
The 10-year offering, to be jointly led by BNP and SBC, is expected to raise
between FFr2bn and FFr3bn.
Among yesterday's issues, China Travel, a mainland Chinese freight and
holiday company which is listed in Hong Kong, launched a Dollars 125m
offering of five-year convertible bonds, via Merrill Lynch.
The indicated coupon is between 4.25 per cent and 4.75 per cent and the
indicated conversion premium is between 19 per cent and 23 per cent. The
deal is expected to be priced later this week.
Banco Bradesco, Brazil's largest private-sector bank, raised Dollars 50m
through an offering of three-year Eurobonds. The bonds were priced to yield
355 basis points over the 4 3/8 per cent US Treasury due 1996. When the
bonds were freed to trade, they were quoted at par bid, according to lead
manager Salomon Brothers.
STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency, has raised its credit ratings on
GPA Group, the troubled Irish aircraft leasing company which has been
rescued by GE Electric of the US. About Dollars 2bn worth of debt is
affected.
GPA's ratings have also been removed from S&amp;P's credit-watch, where they
were placed in November 1992. By contrast, GPA's ratings remain on Moody's
watch list where they were placed in May this year.
S&amp;P said that the upgrade was based on GPA's improved liquidity and deferral
of cash commitments arising from the completion of an extensive financial
restructuring.
However, S&amp;P said that the outlook on GPA was 'developing' which indicated
that its ratings could be raised if the company was able to achieve the
aircraft sales needed to meet remaining debt maturities and lowered if it
failed.
S&amp;P raised GPA's unsecured senior debt ratings to triple C from triple C
minus, while the ratings on equipment trust certificates are raised to B
minus from triple C plus. Both ratings are below investment grade.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries ease on purchasing managers'
data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US bond market eased at both ends of the maturity spectrum yesterday
after dealers and investors sold Treasury securities following a
stronger-than-expected October purchasing managers' report.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  25/32 at 103
1/8 , yielding 6.018 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was down  1/8 at 99 5/8 , to yield 4.056 per cent.
After a subdued opening, prices turned lower when the National Association
of Purchasing Management reported that its index of manufacturing activity
rose to 53.8 in October from 49.7 in September. Analysts had expected the
NAPM index to rise to 50.9 per cent.
Investors and dealers reacted badly because they fear the economy may be
finally picking up after languishing for most of this year. They were
particularly concerned about strength in manufacturing production and
orders.
The only bright spot in the figures was the lack of growth in the NAPM's
index of prices. Analysts said that manufacturing output was growing because
of productivity improvements, which bode well for future inflation.
The market was also buffeted by speculation about the contents of the next
quarterly refunding round, which will be announced tomorrow.
Although the Treasury has said that 30-year bonds will not be part of the
November refunding, dealers were still speculating yesterday that the
government would sell bonds later this month along with new three-year and
10-year issues that may be larger than expected.
MOST European markets were closed for a holiday, but those that were open
took their lead from the US.
GERMAN bond prices fell around  1/4 point in low volume. Although Hesse, the
state in which Frankfurt is located, was open yesterday, most other German
states were closed for All Saints' Day.
'The market has run into a bit of profit-taking of late, but overall it is
extremely well supported,' said Mr Nigel Richardson, an economist at
Yamaichi International. 'The currency was weak today, which may have caused
a bit of a sell off.'
THE UK gilts market fell about  3/8 point as it continued to take its cue
from continental Europe. Dealers were disheartened by chancellor of the
exchequer Mr Kenneth Clarke's comments, in a weekend interview, that he sees
little immediate pressure to reduce interest rates further. He said he
agreed with Bank of England governor Mr Eddie George's view that UK interest
rates should not fall below their current 6 per cent level, if there is a
risk of increasing underlying inflation.
Traders had been discounting further rate cuts around the time of this
month's budget, in order to compensate for any tax increases. 'I wouldn't
say the market has written off an interest rate cut, but there is an
underlying mood of caution,' said Mr Richardson of Yamaichi.
JAPANESE government bond prices rose more than  1/4 point, with heavy volume
in the futures market due to continued speculation on interest rate cuts.
With 3 1/2 per cent 10-year yields in sight, the market's pursuit of this
target is being encouraged by continued economic weakness.
Futures volume may have been partly boosted by the opening of the new
securities subsidiaries of two trust banks, Sumitomo and Mitsubishi, dealers
said.

FT  02 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Ball denies resignation was
linked to US probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR George Ball, who has resigned as senior executive vice-president at Wall
Street brokers Smith Barney Shearson, denied that his departure was linked
to the US government's investigation of a scandal at Prudential Securities,
the firm he once led.
Prudential has agreed to pay at least Dollars 371m in fines and restitution
to clients who bought billions of dollars of high-risk property and energy
limited partnerships in the 1980s after they had been wrongly told by
Prudential brokers that they were low-risk investments.
Mr Ball was chief executive of Prudential, then known as Prudential-Bache,
between 1982 and 1991. Investigators are reported to be considering civil
proceedings against former Prudential executives.
Although reports said Mr Ball was ousted from his post at Smith Barney
because of concern that the firm's reputation would be harmed if such a
high-profile figure faced charges relating to the Prudential scandal, Smith
Barney said Mr Ball had informed them of his plans to leave several months
ago.

FT  02 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Pechiney loan oversubscribed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LARGE syndicated loan for Pechiney, the state-controlled French aluminium
group which is earmarked for privatisation, has been oversubscribed,
reflecting the dearth of quality corporate borrowers looking to raise funds
in this market.
The lack of borrower demand for syndicated loans this year has resulted in a
considerable erosion in margins as banks compete more aggressively for new
loans business.
Pechiney was looking to raise Dollars 800m, but bankers involved in the deal
said that more than Dollars 1bn had been raised during the course of
syndication. The borrower is expected to take a decision in the next few
days on whether to increase the loan.
The loan, jointly arranged by Barclays Bank, BNP, Societe Generale and CS
First Boston, will be divided into two tranches. One tranche of Dollars 400m
will have a relatively long maturity of seven years, while the other Dollars
400m tranche will have a life of five years.
Pechiney, which is unrated but is perceived by the market as a single A
credit, is paying an interest margin of 55 basis points over Libor for the
first five years, on both tranches. The spread over Libor will rise to 60
basis points for the final two years of the loan.
The commitment fee is 27 1/2 basis points for the first five years, rising
to 30 basis points in the last two years. The participation fee is 17 1/2
basis points on Dollars 40m for lead managers and 12 1/2 basis points on
Dollars 20m for managers.

state
</HEADLINE>

   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DECISIONS taken last week by the South Korean government are likely to
jeopardise plans by Samsung, South Korea's second-largest business group, to
enter the passenger car industry.
Samsung's ambitions to become a car manufacturer aroused controversy after
it appeared to be preparing a hostile takeover bid for Kia Motors, the
country's second-biggest motor company.
Samsung has long sought to add vehicle production to its operations, which
include electronics, shipbuilding and construction.
It recently increased its shareholding in Kia to 9.6 per cent, making it
Kia's second-biggest shareholder after Ford Motor of the US.
However, Samsung agreed to reduce its shareholding under pressure from Kia
management and the government, which wants to curb the expansion of
conglomerates such as Samsung.
The government last week introduced shareholding rules making it impossible
for Samsung to attempt a takeover bid.
It ordered that institutional investors associated with conglomerates must
reduce their voting stake in other companies from the current 10 per cent
ceiling to 5 per cent by the end of June.
Samsung's stake in Kia was mainly held through Samsung Life Insurance.
The government action represented a reversal of its previous plans to lift
all shareholding restrictions next year, a measure seen as paving the way
for mergers and acquisitions in Korea.
Samsung's interest in taking over Kia was belived to be in its
car-production facilities. A takeover would have averted the need for heavy
capital spending on factories of its own, estimated to have costed up to
Dollars 2bn.

CHALLENGE Bank, the Perth-based regional bank which acquired the retail
banking assets and liabilities for NatWest Australia in South Australia and
Western Australia in June, yesterday reported a ADollars 21.4m (USDollars
14.3m) after-tax profit in the year to end-September.
The figure compares with a loss of ADollars 43.2m in the previous year.
Challenge said non-performing loans fell from ADollars 68m to ADollars 53m
during the year. Lending increased to ADollars 1.45bn, including ADollars
1.04bn for owner-occupier and investment housing.
Total assets rose by 25 per cent to ADollars 4.2bn.
The banking group said it believed there were 'consistent signs that
Australia is emerging from recession'. It said Western Australia looked
'particularly promising'.
In September, the company announced a ADollars 67.5m convertible note issue,
by way of rights to existing shareholders, and a non-underwritten placement
of up to ADollars 15m.
Yesterday, it said that the full placement was likely to be made, and that
the capital raised should increase the bank's risk-weighted capital ratio to
about 12 per cent.

THE STREAM of non-core asset disposals by Foster's Brewing Group, the
Australian brewing company which owns Courage in the UK, continued yesterday
when the company announced the sale of a 45 per cent interest in Australia
Meat Holdings, a meat processing business, for about ADollars 100m
(USDollars 66.6m).
The stake is being bought by ConAgra, the large US food group, and
Australian interests associated with the D. R. Johnson group.
ConAgra already owns a 50 per cent stake in Australia Meat Holdings, which
it acquired when Foster's sold a package of agri-business assets - also
including brewing materials and wool - for around ADollars 300m.
That sale, two years ago, left Fosters with a 45 per cent interest in
Australia Meat, and D. R. Johnson, a New South Wales abattoir company,
holding the remaining 5 per cent.
Foster's, which now has a stated policy of concentrating on its main brewing
business, said it expected to book a profit of around ADollars 47m on the
sale of the remaining stake in AMH.
The brewing company also said yesterday AMH had bought the group's Portland
abattoir, which AMH had been operating since 1989 and leasing since 1991, in
a separate deal.
The latest deal, which is subject to various regulatory procedures including
a green light from the Foreign Investment Review Board, means Foster's has
now garnered about ADollars 536m from non-core asset disposals since its
June year-end.
This follows asset sales of around ADollars 650m in the previous financial
year.
Funds raised from this process are being used to pay down group debt.

FT  02 NOV 93 / International Company News: Wharf plugs in to a guaranteed
success - Hong Kong's first cable TV franchise has been worth the wait
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES

<TEXT>
PATIENCE is a virtue rarely appreciated by Hong Kong's investment community.
However, for Wharf (Holdings), which has just accomplished its six-year
struggle to deliver cable television to the colony, the rewards of
perseverance could be substantial.
A Wharf-led consortium was first awarded the cable TV franchise in 1989. It
collapsed a year later, amid accusations that the government had breached an
exclusivity agreement by allowing Hutchison Whampoa, flagship of the
diversified Cheung Kong Group, to launch satellite broadcaster Star TV in
Hong Kong.
Further delays were caused by China's insistence on approving all franchises
straddling 1997. But eight years after the government first examined the
feasibility of cable television in Hong Kong, the system has finally gone
ahead, and the outlook is far more positive for Wharf than when it signed up
in 1989.
Hong Kong is arguably one of the most attractive sites for cable television
in the world. According to Credit Lyonnais Securities, the
cost-per-household of installing a cable system there will be USDollars 50,
compared with around USDollars 300 in the US. This is because of the
vertical nature of Hong Kong's urban core.
The colony has per-capita GDP higher than the UK, and 99 per cent of
households own a television. Despite this, the Chinese population -
accounting for a vast majority of the colony's 5.9m inhabitants - is served
by only two Cantonese-language television channels.
Experience elsewhere in the western world suggests this represents a
potential gold mine for a cable television company introducing 11 channels
to a wealthy population starved of choice.
Mr Stephen Ng, managing director of Wharf, predicts that by the year 2000,
Wharf Cable will have turnover of HKDollars 4bn (USDollars 517.5m) and an
operating profit of HKDollars 1.6bn.
Investment analysts are more cautious, but the consensus is that the
business should provide an average annual return on the HKDollars 5bn
investment of between 20 and 25 per cent before interest and depreciation,
during the 12 years of its franchise.
Mr Ng said the market was better prepared for the service than in 1989,
while recent technological advances have enabled Wharf to improve the
system, while maintaining the initial costs budgeted in 1989.
It is also guaranteed exclusivity until June 1996, providing sufficient time
to pick up critical mass to prevent anything other than niche competition;
and it has unrestricted access to government-owned housing estates,
accounting for 960,000 households.
Jardine Fleming Securities estimates the system will have close to 600,000
subscribers by the end of 1996, and will break even during that year.
However, this will depend on the quality of programming, an area in which
Wharf has no expertise. If the quality is not there, even a HKDollars
198-per-month subscription fee will seem excessive.
The number of channels to be offered on the new system is already a
sensitive issue. Wharf is offering an initial package of eight, but it was
also to carry three of Star TV's existing channels, and a further four
'premium' channels to be added by the satellite broadcaster.
The two groups failed to resolve an argument over the details of this
preliminary agreement before Sunday's launch. An accord is extremely
important, since it prevents significant competition between the two groups.
Whatever the impact on television viewers, however, the network still offers
vast potential for Wharf. The company is keen to emphasise the investment as
a television project, but there has always been a hidden agenda: the group's
ambitions to set up a telecommunications network.
Wharf is bidding for a licence to compete with Hongkong Telecommunications
(HKT) when its monopoly on domestic telephony runs out in 1995. In 2006,
HKT's international monopoly also disappears, and one of the world's most
lucrative telephone franchises will be up for grabs.
Wharf suggests the existence of its cable TV network would shave around
HKDollars 1bn off the costs of a telephone network; it would also provide
entry into most Hong Kong homes, creating potential for home banking and
other interactive services. Wharf is considered certain to receive a
licence.
Mr Edmund Brandt, investment analyst at Jardine Fleming, said: 'Wharf Cable
as a stand-alone project is a viable investment and it should contribute up
to 15 per cent of Wharf's total cash flow by the year 2000. But the
potential synergies with a telecommunications network make it that much more
exciting.'
Despite writing off HKDollars 107m against its 1989 investment in cable
television, Wharf's ambitions have already proven lucrative. It purchased
the consortium's headquarters and will realise a substantial profit from it.
Second time around, however, the returns could be far more impressive.

profit slides 66% in first half

MITSUBISHI Materials, the Japanese copper, cement and industrial materials
supplier, yesterday blamed the appreciation of the yen and weak demand from
manufacturers for a 66.5 per cent fall, to Y2.02bn (Dollars 18.6m), in
first-half pre-tax profit.
Sales for the period from April until September fell 9.1 per cent to
Y342.8bn. The company said demand has been particularly sluggish from the
construction, car, and electronics industries.
It said the recent fall in Japanese interest rates should stimulate the
economy, but the continued strength of the yen was likely to hinder growth.
For the full year, pre-tax profit is forecast at Y4bn, compared with Y9.8bn
last year, on sales of Y700bn, down from Y743bn.
Sumitomo Metal Mining, a copper and gold producer, reported an 89.1 per cent
plunge to Y692m in pre-tax profit, on a 15.8 per cent slide in sales to
Y192.3bn.
The company had an operating loss of Y4.9bn, compared with a profit of Y2bn
last year. It said sales of securities holdings enabled it to report a
pre-tax profit.
Many Japanese companies are using sales of securities to bolster profits
this year, raising questions about the future of some long-term
cross-shareholdings.
Company officials indicated that an increase in capital spending in the past
two years had pushed up depreciation charges this year.
This added to the difficulties caused by the yen's strength and the
continuing decline in demand from industrial Japan.
For the full year, Sumitomo has forecast a pre-tax profit of Y1.5bn, a sharp
fall from last year's Y8.5bn, on sales of Y370bn, down from Y444bn. Capital
spending this year is expected to be Y12.2bn, compared with Y25.8bn last
year.

Singapore Telecom shares

<TEXT>
SINGAPORE Telecom (ST), the island republic's telecommunications and posts
utility, made its debut on the Singapore stock market yesterday, quickly
dwarfing other companies and accounting for about half the total valuation
of the market.
The Singapore government has floated about 11 per cent of ST, setting a
price of SDollars 1.90 or SDollars 2 on its shares. At one stage yesterday
ST shares rose to a high of SDollars 5, giving the group a market valuation
of more than SDollars 70bn (USDollars 44bn), and a p/e ratio in the mid 60s.
The combined capitalisation of companies on the Singapore exchange,
excluding ST, is SDollars 140bn. 'Investors are not bothering to look at
fundamentals any more,' said one local broker. 'There's more than a bit of
craziness in the market right now, with too much money chasing too few
quality stocks.'
At the close of trading, ST's shares were SDollars 4.14, still well above
market expectations.
The Singapore government had issued shares in three tranches. Group A and B
shares - about 50 per cent of the shares on offer and priced at SDollars
1.90 and SDollars 2 respectively - were reserved for Singaporeans only.
Group C shares were available to both Singaporean and foreign buyers on a
tender basis. The strike price for the C shares, announced last Friday, was
set at SDollars 3.60.
The feeling in Singapore is that local, rather than overseas, investors are
responsible for the aggressive ST performance.
'We are still waiting for a correction,' said a foreign fund manager.
'No-one doubts ST is a good company, but at present price levels it looks
very, very expensive.'
Market analysts said the absence of foreign buyers meant the first day's
trading in ST was not as exciting as expected.
The Singapore stock exchange had doubled its trading hours in anticipation
of hectic trading. However, late yesterday it announced trading would revert
to the normal six and a half hours tomorrow.

<TEXT>
RAYTHEON, the US electronics group, is to cut 1,150 jobs in Massachusetts,
as part of a plan to reduce costs to cope with shrinking US military
spending, reports AP-DJ.
The group said the job losses would follow a voluntary retirement programme
that has already trimmed the payroll by 800 jobs, 600 of them in
Massachusetts.
The combined cuts will bring the company's Massachusetts work force down to
21,050, compared with a peak of 31,100 in 1989.
Raytheon and other military contractors have been forced to retrench as the
federal government slashed the defence budget in the post-Cold War era.
Among the sites suffering cuts will be Raytheon's Andover plant, which makes
the Patriot missile that came to prominence in the Gulf War. It will lose
nearly 400 jobs.
Despite the falling defence budget, Raytheon has remained profitable, not
only by cutting costs, but also by focusing on other businesses such as
energy and environmental services.

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER gold output and lower average prices for gold and copper depressed
profits of Placer Dome, the Canadian international mining group, in the
third quarter and first nine months of 1993.
Third-quarter profit was USDollars 13m, or 6 cents a share, down sharply
from Dollars 33m, or 14 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of Dollars 229m,
against Dollars 264m, including investment income of Dollars 10m, against
Dollars 20m.
For the first nine months of the year, profit was Dollars 45m, or 19 cents a
share, against Dollars 68m, or 29 cents, on revenues of Dollars 699m,
against Dollars 834m. Both periods include special items.
Gold output was 450,000 oz in the third quarter, down from 508,000 oz and in
the nine months 1,354,000 oz, a decline 8 per cent from 1,473,000 oz a year
earlier.
Cash production cost in the nine months was Dollars 189 per oz, compared
with Dollars 192 in the same period last year, while the average realised
price of gold in the nine months was Dollars 376 oz, slightly above the
average market price.
Gold output declined due to lower grades and a reduced stake in the big
Porgera mine in New Guinea and the sale of several mining interests. Eight
of Placer's 13 producing mines reduced their cash costs.

FT  02 NOV 93 / International Company News: Upjohn survival hopes rest on
new medicines - The expiry of four drug patents has troubled the US drugs
group and brought R&amp;D into sharp focus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UPJOHN, America's 12th largest drugs group, has been one of the
best-performing US pharmaceuticals stocks this year. Its shares have risen
11 per cent over the past 12 months, compared with an 11 per cent decline by
other health and household stocks.
Upjohn's performance is based on the belief that the Kalamazoo-based group
has become a takeover candidate. Like other pharmaceuticals companies, it is
suffering from an increasingly hostile healthcare environment that has
reduced growth of the US pharmaceuticals market to only 3 per cent during
the first half of the year.
But Upjohn is in a worse plight than most. Its predicament has been
exacerbated by a series of patent expiries in the US, its most important
market.
Three of the group's leading drugs have lost their American patents over the
past 12 months. Those protecting Ansaid, an anti-arthritic, expired in
February. Earlier this month, Xanax, an anti-anxiety drug and Halcion, a
sleeping pill, lost their patent protection. Next May, patents for a fourth
drug, a diabetes treatment called Micronase, also expire.
Mr Ley Smith, chief operating officer, admitted last month that earnings
next year would be lower than in 1993. A combination of the patent expiries,
new legislation affecting the tax charge for its Puerto Rico manufacturing
facilities, and a faster-than-expected increase in the power of bulk
purchasers of health will affect the group's bottom line.
The expiries are highly damaging - Xanax is the group's most-important drug
and accounted for 30 per cent of its American healthcare sales in the first
nine months this year.
Brokers Wertheim Schroder estimate the medicine generated 35 per cent of
Upjohn's operating income last year. Altogether, generic competition for the
four drugs could affect between a quarter and a third of Upjohn's 1992
earnings per share by 1994, estimate the brokers.
Just when the group needed firm leadership, its misfortunes were compounded
when chairman Theodore Cooper died of cancer in April. Since he started
leading Upjohn in 1987, he had helped increase sales by nearly 50 per cent.
Since Mr Cooper's death the composition of the board has been unsettled. In
August vice-chairman Mr Mark Novitch announced his decision to step down.
The following month, Mr William Parfet, another vice-chairman and member of
the Upjohn family, stepped down as an executive director. His departure
increased the possibility the family might be willing to sell its
substantial stake.
Mr Smith, also acting chairman, insists the company will remain independent
and has a strategy to deal with the patent expiries.
'When you register a patent you know when it's going to expire. We've had
plenty of time to plan for this,' he says.
However, what Mr Smith does not have immediately to hand are new products
capable of compensating for the lost sales, which is partly a research and
development failure.
'We didn't make enough of the products we had and we missed some good
opportunities to license in some subsequently successful medicines,' admits
Mr Smith.
The top R&amp;D management has been changed and the new team is racing to bring
products through the development pipeline. Most promising is Freedox, a
treatment for stroke and head injuries. The medicine is in a class of
steroids called Lazaroids, discovered by Upjohn and named after the Biblical
character Lazarus who was raised from the dead.
Freedox should be registered with the US Food and Drug Administration for
its first indication before the end of the year, says Mr Smith, and could be
launched by the middle of next year. Some analysts believe it could generate
Dollars 500m annual sales.
Other compounds in development include fluvoxamine, a treatment for
obsessive compulsive disorder, which is being co-marketed with Solvay of
Belgium. Just licensed is a drug for cancer from Japan that could become the
largest or second-largest drug on the cancer market.
The group is also working on a blood substitute and treatments for HIV.
Nevertheless, these new drugs will take time to build up sales. In the
meantime, Mr Smith is trying to defend Upjohn's off-patent products. 'We
expect to lose between 40 per cent and 60 per cent of these drug's sales.
The question is how fast they erode,' he said.
The company has an agreement with Geneva Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of
Ciba, which will market generic versions of Xanax, Halcion, Micronase and
Ansaid. Upjohn will manufacture the product for Geneva, which avoids the
group's production facilities standing idle.
Like some other pharmaceuticals groups, Upjohn is also trying to expand its
over-the-counter (OTC) non-prescription drug business. This will allow it to
extend the product life of its medicines, such as the hair-loss treatment
Rogaine, by selling them direct to patients without a prescription. The
group's OTC business has increased 300 per cent since 1986, but with sales
of only Dollars 200m a year the operations do not have critical mass, admits
Mr Smith.
'The problem is whether to form an alliance and, if you do, how to keep
control, or whether to make an acquisition. We have no presence in Europe,
and we need to reinforce the US operations, particularly in the
dermatological area,' he says.
To minimise the fall in earnings next year Mr Smith is slashing costs. The
patent expiries forced Upjohn to cut costs earlier than most other US
pharmaceuticals groups, and last week it announced its third restructuring
package at a cost of Dollars 255m.
By the end of 1994 the group will employ 17,500 people, down from 21,100 at
the beginning of 1989.
Upjohn is also cutting 14 production pharmaceuticals, chemicals and
agricultural products manufacturing sites, although Mr Smith refuses to give
details. The entire cost-cutting programme should generate annual savings of
Dollars 150m by 1995, he says.
Mr Smith insists he will not cut R&amp;D spending, which is running at 18 per
cent of turnover - a high figure by industry standards. R&amp;D is the
life-blood of the company, he says.
'We could match 1993 earnings next year by cutting R&amp;D spending, but we just
have too many good ideas that are getting too close to fruition,' he
explains.
Upjohn's management is gambling on the success of its development pipeline,
and in particular the Lazaroids. The question is whether they will be as
effective at resuscitating Upjohn as stroke victims.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSAMERICA, the San Francisco-based insurer, is close to leaving the
property/casualty business with the sale of its remaining 27 per cent stake
in TIG Holdings.
Based on yesterday's share price, the sale of 17.3m TIG shares would be
worth Dollars 417m.
The insurer floated TIG as a separate company on the New York Stock Exchange
earlier this year as part of a move to concentrate on life insurance and
financial services.
Ahead of the flotation, it was expected to retain a substantial stake in TIG
for some time before being able to complete the disposal at a favourable
price.
However, a turn in the property/casualty underwriting cycle has led to
higher premiums in some parts of the market, bolstering profits in recent
months and adding to investors' interest in insurance companies.
TIG, which was floated at Dollars 22 5/8 a share, closed yesterday at
Dollars 24, up Dollars  1/8 , after the news.
'We had indicated at the time (of the flotation) that we had intended to
reduce our holding of the common stock as promptly as possible,'
Transamerica said yesterday.
The insurer has exercised an option under an agreement made at the time of
the flotation to sell its remaining shares.
A registration statement for the sale is expected to be filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission within the next two weeks, TIG said.
Transamerica's share price rose by Dollars  5/8 on the announcement to close

ASEA BROWN Boveri, the European manufacturer of power plant and industrial
systems, announced yesterday that it is setting up a fund with six US
investment institutions to provide equity and subordinated debt to help
finance major industrial and power projects in America.
GE Capital, the financial services arm of power equipment manufacturer
General Electric, already provides equity capital for power projects, but
ABB believes its move will give it a lead in other industrial areas served
by the company, such as petrochemicals and paper and pulp.
Mr Arun Nayar, head of ABB project and trade finance in the US, said that it
meant the group could stay 'in house' to fund the equity element of a
project, as well as the debt portion.
The partners in the investment vehicle, which has several hundred million
dollars of capital, include US West Financial, Heller Financial, and
Ridgewood Energy of New Jersey.

FT  02 NOV 93 / International Company News: Kaiser Aluminum incurs Dollars
21m loss in third quarter

<TEXT>
KAISER Aluminum of the US posted a net loss of Dollars 21m or 42 cents per
share in the third quarter. The company is the latest in a series of US
aluminium manufacturers reporting losses as a result of a worldwide
oversupply of the metal.
Kaiser said that historically low aluminium prices and weakness in prices
for rolled aluminium used to make aircraft bodies and beverage cans would
force a restructuring at its Trentwood plant in Spokane, Washington.
This would result in a fourth-quarter pre-tax charge against earnings of
between Dollars 30m and Dollars 40m.
Kaiser's third-quarter loss compares with income of Dollars 3.9m, or 6 cents
per share, in the same period a year ago. Third-quarter sales fell to
Dollars 428.4m from Dollars 458.5m a year earlier.
Kaiser's customer shipments of primary and fabricated aluminium fell to
148,200 metric tons in the third quarter, down from 164,700 tons in the
third quarter of 1992. Alumina shipments to customers advanced to 576,900 in
the quarter, from 469,300 last year.
For the first nine months of the year Kaiser, which is 68 per cent owned by
the natural resources company Maxxam, reported a loss or Dollars 57m, or
Dollars 1.05 per share, before extraordinary charges.
This compares with profits of Dollars 24.3m, or 42 cents per share for the
first nine months of 1992. Sales for the first nine months of the year were
Dollars 1.3bn, down from Dollars 1.4bn last time.
Maxxam reported a net loss of Dollars 33.3m or Dollars 3.42 for the third
quarter, compared with income of Dollars 7m or 7 cents in the third quarter
of 1992. Sales for the quarter were Dollars 506.5m, down from Dollars 531.7m
a year ago.
For the first nine months Maxxam reported a loss of Dollars 68.5m, or
Dollars 7.24 per share, excluding special charges, compared with income of
Dollars 3m or 32 cents a year earlier.
Alcan Aluminium, facing the deepest and longest post-war recession in ingot
and fabricated products prices, will become smaller and leaner, warns Mr
Jacques Bougie, president and now chief executive, writes Robert Gibbens in
Montreal.
Alcan's downstream businesses must 'demonstrate clear potential' if they are
to get further investment, Mr Bougie said in the company's internal
magazine.
Mr Bougie suggested that a new round of cuts will focus on Alcan affiliates
making end products. Those that do not measure up or lack a sound profitable
future will be sold.

brain tumour
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Walsh, the architect of a two-year turnround at US conglomerate
Tenneco and one of the most highly regarded executives in the US, said
yesterday that a tumour discovered on his brain last January was beginning
to break up. He said his doctors expected him to live a normal life span,
barring unforeseen circumstances.
The news will be welcomed by shareholders and employees of Tenneco, where Mr
Walsh, 51, is only part of the way through a restructuring of the company to
restore earnings momentum and boost the stock price.
Mr Walsh, who turned round the Union Pacific railroad before joining
Tenneco, announced the discovery of the brain tumour last January and said
then that the median survival rate for patients with this condition,
detected at an early state, was about five to six years.
Yesterday, Mr Walsh said that his doctors had assured him that the tumour
had stopped growing and that recent tests had revealed no active tumour
lesions anywhere in his brain.
He said he was working a normal schedule but would continue to have residual
physical symptoms - a weakness on the left side of his body - until time
allowed the break-up and removal of dead tumour tissue.
'The programme of accelerated radiation, combined with aggressive
chemotherapy, has been tough, but it has worked,' Mr Walsh said.
He said that he would continue with a full regimen of chemotherapy through
to next spring, a treatment intended to prevent a recurrence of the tumour.
'Obviously my family and I could not be more delighted.' Mr Walsh added.
'Thank God for modern medicine.'

FT  02 NOV 93 / International Company News: Charge pushes Cigna into the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Dollars 244m after-tax charge to cover asbestosis and environmental claims
pushed Cigna, the US insurer, into the red during the third quarter of the
year.
The company also took a Dollars 107m charge to cover 1,400 redundancies in
its health and property/casualty businesses, which have already been
reported, as well as a further 800-1,000 job losses expected in the next 18
months.
The latest charges led Cigna, one of the leaders in the US health and life
insurance businesses, to report a net loss of Dollars 94m, or Dollars 1.31 a
share, for the period, compared with a net profit of Dollars 50m, or 70
cents, a year ago.
The scale of the loss was reduced by a Dollars 48m benefit from the change
in the US corporate tax rate.
The results a year before had been struck after one-off items which led to a
net benefit of Dollars 42m.
Operating results during the period in health, pension and life businesses
had been strong, said Mr Wilson Taylor, chief executive.
Despite a reduction in catastrophe insurance losses, which were reduced from
Dollars 139m to Dollars 36m, Mr Taylor said underlying performance in the
property/casualty business remained poor.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMPAQ Computer yesterday launched an array of new personal computer
products and slashed the prices of some its models by 10 to 23 per cent.
The large number of new models reflects increasing segmentation in the
personal computer market, with separate product lines aimed at different
distribution channels and types of customers, from individual purchasers to
large corporate buyers.
Other PC companies, including Apple and IBM, are following a similar
strategy with different 'brands' or lines of products targeted at various
segments of the market.
Compaq's new products for business users include high performance desktop
PCs based on Intel's latest Pentium microprocessors, with prices starting at
Dollars 2,799.
Other new models include energy-saving features that can significantly cut
electricity consumption and costs in offices. New ProLinea models, with
built-in PC networking capabilities start at about Dollars 1,350.
Compaq also stepped up its presence in the rapidly-growing consumer PC
market with the introduction of 10 new models to its Presario family. These
include models with stereo sound and video capabilities and pre-installed
software. Prices start at about Dollars 1,650.
'With the launch of these new PCs for home and business users, Compaq
continues to play a key strategic role in the emergence of these two
distinct, but equally important PC markets,' said Mr John Rose,
vice-president and general manager, desktop PC division.
The company, which recently reported a 64 per cent rise in 1993
third-quarter revenues to Dollars 1.75bn and net income more than doubled to
Dollars 107m, also said yesterday that its third-quarter sales in Japan had
increased by 350 per cent.

continuing recovery

<TEXT>
CANADIAN Pacific, the transport and resource group, continued its underlying
turnround in the third quarter but the results were dragged down by special
charges. The improvement is expected to continue, despite a slow Canadian
economy.
The fast-expanding PanCanadian Petroleum, 87 per cent-owned, and Fording
Coal, a western exporter, made sharply higher contribution in the third
quarter and nine months. The rail unit did better in the second and third
quarters.
CP Ships, CP Trucks and CP Hotels improved their performance.
Third-quarter income from continuing operations was CDollars 1.7m (USDollars
1.3m), up from CDollars 1.6m a year earlier, but after special items the
overall loss came out at CDollars 106.8m, or 33 cents, against a loss of
CDollars 205.6m or 64 cents. Revenues were CDollars 1.7bn, from CDollars
1.6bn.
The first nine months showed income from continuing operations ahead at
CDollars 160.3m, from CDollars 95.3m, but after special items the loss was
CDollars 73.1m or 23 cents a share, compared with a deficit of CDollars
224.3m or 70 cents a share. Revenues were CDollars 4.8bn, against CDollars
5.5bn.
The special items included losses on the sale of the Forest Products unit,
CP's share of Laidlaw's special charges, partly offset by gains on asset
sales. The 1992 result included heavy write-offs for CP Rail's
restructuring.
The group recently sold control of Canadian Pacific Forest Products, one of
North America's biggest newsprint producers, to reduce its debt and to make
its earnings less volatile.
Mr William Stinson, chairman, said steps were being taken to reduce losses
at the 48 per cent-owned Unitel telecommunications affiliate and a
restructuring charge was possible in the fourth quarter.

ALCAN Aluminium, facing the deepest and longest post-war recession in ingot

Jacques Bougie, president and now chief executive.
Alcan's downstream businesses must 'demonstrate clear potential' if they are

Mr Bougie suggested that a new round of cuts will focus on Alcan affiliates
making end products. Those that do not measure up or lack a sound profitable
future will be sold.
The group will concentrate on primary smelting and sheet and fabricated
products and is seeking to lower its alumina costs further. It has already
introduced cuts at its Irish alumina plant, near Shannon. Alumina is derived
from processing bauxite and becomes a white powder and the primary material
in aluminium smelting.
Alcan has 49,000 employees worldwide, down from nearly 70,000 nearly a
decade ago. It operates more than 20 units making a wide variety of
aluminium products, used mainly in construction and transportation and
including cable. Some periphery units have already been sold.
The company has cut about USDollars 500m from its cost base, mainly in North
America, in its struggle to become a low cost producer, and effective
yesterday realigned its main business groups. It recently received a large
US consultants' study of its worldwide organisation.

SIEMENS, South Africa's Reunert and GEC of the UK are to rationalise their
South African telecommunications activities with the aim of strengthening
their position in the local market and improving export prospects.
A new company, Siemens Telecommunications, will be created to focus on
providing infrastructure.
Telephone Manufacturers of South Africa (TMSA), an existing joint venture
between the three groups, will be restructured and concentrate on making
terminals, pay-phones and key systems.
Siemens Telecommunications will be 51 per cent owned by Siemens of German,
27.5 per cent by Reunert and 21.5 per cent by GEC. TMSA will be 41 per cent
owned by Reunert, 33 per cent by GEC and 26 per cent by Siemens, compared to
equal one-third stakes before the deal.
The companies are responding to the prospect of greater competition in the
local market after international liberalisation of the telecommunications
sector and technological developments which have forced rationalisation
among equipment suppliers.
The lifting of economic sanctions against South Africa will only enhance
competition further, with companies previously prohibited from doing
business there, such as Ericsson from Sweden, now free from restrictions.
Siemens Telecommunications will have annual turnover of about R800m (Dollars
190m) while TMSA's sales will be around R400m.

<TEXT>
FORCED to cut dividends as earnings are hit by the economic slowdown,
Japanese companies are starting to compensate shareholders with produce.
With most companies expecting an earnings decline for the fourth successive
year, more shareholders are being deprived of dividends.
Comson, a farming machinery maker listed on the Osaka stock exchange, says
that instead of dividends it sent its 1,900 shareholders bags of fertiliser
made from manure and sludge, while Nippon Pulp and Paper gave 24 rolls of
toilet paper to every stockholder.
Workers are already sacrificing bonuses to help their employers. NEC
managers last year accepted vouchers that can be swapped for computers and
television sets instead of year-end payments.
Some companies hope the gifts will help restore confidence, especially among
retail investors disheartened by stock market scandals and last year's
plunge of the Nikkei average to a six-year low.
The government had hoped that the flotation of East Japan Railway (JR East),
the partially privatised regional railway operator, would bring retail
investors back into the stock market. However, profit-taking in JR East
shares clogged the Tokyo stock exchange's computers, sending the market
below 20,000 for the first time in three months.
Since Japan's traditionally low payout levels have never been much of an
incentive for investors - the current average yield for the Tokyo market is
about 0.7 per cent - companies also hope to lure investors with products. In
the late 1980s, holders of Tokyo Electric Power shares were presented with
electric kettles.
Amid anxiety surrounding a shortage of rice due to this year's bad summer,
Shinden, an electric appliance discounter based in Niigata, is sending
shareholders bags of premium brand rice.

FT  02 NOV 93 / International Company News: McDonnell Douglas posts record
third-term earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MCDONNELL Douglas, the US aerospace group, yesterday reported record
third-quarter earnings of Dollars 142m. It forecast it would top Wall
Street's expectations for the full year, in spite of the sharp downturn in
US defence spending and a recession in the civil aviation industry.
The results underscore a year-long financial recovery at McDonnell Douglas,
helped by a large cost-cutting programme. Its shares surged Dollars 4 3/8 on
the New York Stock Exchange, to end at Dollars 98 1/4 .
The earnings worked through at Dollars 3.62 a share, compared with a loss of
Dollars 42m, or Dollars 1.09, in the same period of last year, when
McDonnell Douglas took a Dollars 167m after-tax charge on the controversial
C-17 military transport aircraft, which it has been developing for the
Pentagon. Revenues dipped to Dollars 3.43bn from Dollars 3.89bn.
Its military aircraft operations made Dollars 142m, compared with a Dollars
166m loss. Commercial aircraft made Dollars 16m, down from Dollars 37m, and
missiles made an unchanged Dollars 65m, in spite of a Dollars 51m pre-tax
charge for electronic systems problems.
The figures were affected by various special items, resulting in a net
unusual gain of Dollars 41m. Stripping this out, the company made Dollars
101m, or Dollars 2.57 a share in the quarter, and Dollars 308m, or Dollars
7.85 in the first nine months of the year.
The period saw further improvement in the company's balance sheet, with debt
of its manufacturing side falling Dollars 369m to Dollars 1.97bn, 29 per
cent lower than at the start of 1993.
Mr Herb Lanese, finance director, said that the company's self-imposed aims
of cutting debt to Dollars 1.8bn by year-end and generating Dollars 1bn in
1993 cash flow, now appeared conservative.
So too were Wall Street forecasts that the group would earn Dollars 10.78
from operations for the full year, or Dollars 2.93 a share in the final
quarter. The company expected to top the record Dollars 3 a share it earned
in the final quarter of 1988.
These figures exclude any charges the company might make as a result of
discussions with the Pentagon for settlement of their dispute over the C-17.
McDonnell announced last week that such a settlement could mean a Dollars
450m pre-tax charge against earnings but would not mean a significant cash
impact and would allow the C-17 programme to continue.
Congressional officials have suggested the initial programme size could be
cut to 40 aircraft from 120.

delay

<TEXT>
A SENIOR Swedish trade union leader yesterday called on Volvo to postpone
next week's vote by shareholders on the proposed merger of its car and truck
operations with France's Renault. Mr Peter Nygards, head of the white-collar
union SIF, says more time is needed to assess the deal.
The SIF has more than 5,000 members employed at Volvo. Mr Nygards was the
first national trade union leader to publicly voice doubts about the merger,
which has run into stiff resistance from the Swedish institutional
shareholders who will decide the issue at a special shareholders meeting
called for November 9.
'(Postponement) is the only reasonable way, as there are today too many
large uncertainties about how the merger will function in practice,' Mr
Nygards said.
Union support has been extremely important to Volvo because many top labour
figures sit on the boards of shareholder institutions.
The SIF leader is a member of the board of the Fourth Fund state pension
fund, which is the second-largest Volvo shareholder after Renault, with 7.5
per cent of the voting capital. The Fourth Fund is due to announce tomorrow
how it will vote on the Renault-Volvo merger. Its decision is widely
reckoned to be a key indicator of whether the deal will stand or fall.
Mr Nygards is also on the board of the insurance group SPP, which has 4.5
per cent of Volvo's voting capital and is also due to announce its final
decision this week.
Volvo was under strong pressure from shareholders yesterday to provide
further clarification of how it will secure its interests in the merged
company.
Volvo will have a 35 per cent share. However, Swedish shareholders are
concerned by a lack of guarantees that state-owned Renault will be
privatised as promised.

PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, is to make changes to the structure of
ownership at Grundig, the German consumer electronics company in which it
has a 31.6 per cent stake.
However, Philips stressed that the move would have no effect on its
relations with Grundig, over which it has exercised management control since
1984, nor on the level of its Grundig holding, which will remain at 31.6 per
cent. Philips fully consolidates loss-making Grundig in its annual accounts.
The Dutch company said it planned to spend a sum of less than Fl 1m (Dollars
525,000) on buying out three German and Swiss banks which own shares in
Grundig Verwaltungs GmbH. This company is the managing partner in another
company, Grundig EMV &amp; CO KG, which acts as a corporate control and profit
transfer company for Grundig AG.

<TEXT>
FOKUS Bank, Norway's third biggest commercial bank, yesterday reported that
it had bounced back to pre-tax profit of NKr246.8m for the nine-month period
of this year from a loss of NKr399.7m in the same period last year, writes
Karen Fossli in Oslo.
Fokus attributed the sharp improvement to a 50 per cent increase in credit
losses, lower costs, and an improvement in securities and foreign exchange
gains.
Group net interest income slipped to NKr821m from NKr868.4m in spite of a 50
per cent reduction in interest costs to NKr1.23bn from NK2.46bn.
Operating profit, before credit losses, rose to NKr500m from NKr193m as
credit losses were cut by more than half to NKr301.1m, or 1.33 per cent of
gross loans, from NKr620.4m.
Fokus said the volume of non-performing loans had declined by 33 per cent
since end of last year but attributed the distribution of loan losses to 74
per cent by the corporate sector and 26 per cent by private customers.
'It is with satisfaction we announce that positive developments in our
result have continued. Even without income from securities and foreign
exchange operations the bank shows a profit after losses,' Fokus said.
The bank achieved securities gains of NKr131m against losses of NKr76.5m
during last year's nine-month period as foreign currency gains more than
doubled to NKr46.8m from NKr20.2m.
Fokus returned a net profit of NKr246.8m against a net loss of NKr432.2m
last year. Group operating costs were cut to NKr770.2 from NKr1.01bn.
'The bank is now seeing the results of a major turnround operation and we
will continue to reduce operating costs,' Fokus said.

FT  02 NOV 93 / International Company News: Greece to sell casino licences
for Dr80bn
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Greek government hopes to raise at least Dr80bn (Dollars 343m) from the
sale of eight new casino licences to international operators by the end of
this year.
Although the new socialist government has halted most projects included in
its predecessor's privatisation programme, the casino scheme is to go ahead
as planned, according to the economy ministry.
Hyatt International, Sheraton, and Conrad Hilton are among 16 bidders
shortlisted to set up and manage casinos in Athens, Thessaloniki and the
resort islands of Corfu, Crete and Mykonos.
Under the licensing terms, the Greek state will take a 20 per cent cut of
the casinos' earnings. Remaining profits will be taxed at the local
corporate rate of 35 per cent. The licences will have a 15-year duration.
In addition to producing estimated revenues of at least Dr120bn yearly, the
casino project will upgrade Greece's tourist industry by ensuring investment
in luxury hotel facilities.
Under the terms of the licence, the casino operators would construct or
refurbish hotels or resorts where the casinos are to be located.
Hyatt Casino Corporation, the group's gaming subsidiary, would invest
Dollars 200m in a luxury hotel and casino on a greenfield site in an Athens
suburb. ITT Sheraton is bidding to acquire Ionian Hotels, the
state-controlled company which owns the Athens Hilton.
Conrad Hilton of the US, would invest up to Dollars 300m in building a
casino complex and new hotel at a state-owned resort at Vouliagmeni near
Athens. The company has signed a contract to manage the resort, in
association with the Alex Spanos group, a California-based property
developer.
Greece's three existing casinos, which are operated by the state tourist
authority, would shut down to make way for the private operators.

FT  02 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Norway banks see a brighter day - Lower
interest rates helped Christiania Bank and DnB return to health a year after
they were on their knees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christiania Bank and Den norske Bank, Norway's two biggest banks, were
forced to their knees last year under the burden of large losses. In
desperation, the state threw them life-lines in the form of funding to
enable capital adequacy requirements to be met.
One year later, the banks are on the road to recovery and planning share
issues which could net the state large windfall gains.
Analysts have warned the government against dumping its shares in the market
at the same time as the banks' issues are launched.
At current prices, the state's shareholdings in the two banks are worth
about NKr17bn (Dollars 2.4bn).
According to Mr Ole Lund, DnB's chairman, the bank is approaching the 'sunny
side of life' but is not yet there. DnB's high volume loan losses and
non-performing loans are still lingering at unacceptable levels.
Hopes are to reduce the level of credit losses during the next 1 1/2 years
by 50 per cent to about NKr1.3bn.
On Tuesday, DnB published a record result since being formed from a merger
in 1990 between Den norske Creditbank and Bergen Bank. Pre-tax profit of
NKr720m for the nine months to September was achieved, against a pre-tax
loss of NKr2.45bn last year. CBK is due to report nine-month results on
November 4 and could, on the same day, announce the details of its planned
share issue.
The sharp improvement in the banks' health is due mainly to the low level of
domestic interest rates, a marked rise in the domestic stock market, steady
recovery of Norway's economy and emerging results of the past five years'
hard slog of consolidation and restruc-turing.
'Nobody last autumn would have believed we would have had the level of
interest rates which we see today and if it had been suggested, the
forecaster would have been quickly escorted to the nearest hospital for
examination,' Mr Lund said.
Norway's central bank has cut the important overnight lending rate 13 times
this year, to 7 per cent from 11 per cent.
The three-month domestic money-market rate has fallen by nearly 50 per cent
in the past year to 5.6 per cent after hitting a high last December of 21.6
per cent during turmoil within the ERM.
Mr Lund concedes that last autumn was a low point for the banks. 'We had
tremendous losses, turmoil in the currency and stock markets and the
collapse of UNI Storebrand (Norway's biggest insurer) and Investa (the
Bergen-based investment group).'
However, the banks' operating environment has since brightened.
Inflation is at 2.3 per cent, its lowest level in three decades, and
economic growth is forecast to accelerate to 3.0 per cent next year from 1.3
per cent in 1993.
The two banks' planned share issues will have to be co-ordinated carefully
so as not to destroy the market. And there is the matter of what the state
intends to do with its shareholdings in the banks and its rights to convert
preference capital to shares.
Analysts have forecast that DnB would try to raise up to NKr2bn in one issue
but that CBK would make an initial issue and seek a listing in an attempt to
improve the bank's market valuation before a second tranche is launched.
CBK earlier this year said it intended to launch a public offering before
1994 but Mr Lund says DnB will have to first publish 1993 accounts and,
preferably, have first-quarter results behind it before making a similar
move.
DnB wants to expand the bank's foreign ownership quota to 33.3 per cent from
12.5 per cent.
Domestic and foreign analysts believe it advantageous for DnB to be the
first off the mark because it is stronger and better known internationally
than CBK and has the added benefit of a listing on the Oslo bourse.
DnB's A-shares have increased five-fold to about NKr20 each since the end of
1992 as the Oslo bourse bank sub-index soared by 160 per cent during the
same period.
At current share prices the state's DnB stake is worth about NKr3.5bn,
excluding preference capital which, if converted to 350m shares at the
bank's current share price, would be worth about NKr7bn.
The state's shareholding in Den norske Bank thus equals about NKr10.5bn
compared to the NKr6.4bn which it has injected into the bank.
On the other hand, analysts say, if CBK's share issue is a success the
likelihood of DnB achieving good fortune with its issue would be bolstered.
The state holds a 69 per cent stake in DnB which would be increased to above
80 per cent on a fully diluted basis if preference capital was converted to
shares.
The state virtually owns CBK, but the 7 per cent held by private investors
is traded outside the bourse at about NKr17 a share.
A sale, even at this price, would net the state a handsome return. It would
underline how light has pierced the gloom of Norwegian banking in the past
five years.

to IPounds 1.77m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
McInerney Properties, the Dublin-based housebuilder and property developer
which has leisure-related construction developments in Spain and Portugal,
reduced pre-tax losses to IPounds 1.77m (Pounds 1.67m) in the first half of
1993. Losses last time were IPounds 1.84m.
The result, on turnover of IPounds 12.9m (IPounds 15m), was struck after
exceptional provisions of IPounds 753,000 (IPounds 950,000).
The Four Seasons resorts in Portugal and Spain reported a good sales
performance but incurred losses. Good progress was being made in Germany.
The company said it would incur a further loss in the second half but hoped
to return to profit in 1994.
Losses per share amounted to 1.47p (3.31p).

FT  02 NOV 93 / International Company News: Unions agree to staff cuts at
Aer Lingus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AGREEMENT was reached yesterday between management and unions at Aer Lingus,
the Irish Republic's troubled state-run airline, on IPounds 21m (Pounds
19.8m) of payroll cuts being sought by the company, out of a total of
IPounds 50m in a cost-pruning rescue plan to bring the airline back from the
brink of financial disaster.
The agreement accepts 800 job losses from the airline's 5,500 workforce, and
'radical' changes to work practices. The deal has still to be approved by
the workforce in a secret ballot of union members, but union officials
yesterday acknowledged that they would be unable to get better terms from
the company.
A clearly relieved Mr Bernie Cahill, the airline's executive chairman, said:
'A few months ago there was no future for the airline. Now there is. I
believe the rescue plan will work, I have no doubt about that.'
Mr Paul O'Sullivan, the negotiating official for Siptu, the trade union
representing the bulk of the Aer Lingus workforce, described the
negotiations as the toughest he had ever been through in an industrial
relations dispute.
He said it was 'heartbreaking' to negotiate away 800 jobs and that 'the
changes being asked of the workforce are enormous, but are necessary to
create an airline capable of competing in a deregulated market.'
The airline was seeking cuts of 1,280 man-years in labour costs, but
received acceptances for only 800 voluntary redundancies. Management then
argued that only 300 of these could be released, unless there were major
changes in work practices. These have now been conceded by the unions.
Still to be negotiated are IPounds 14m cuts in labour costs from the
airline's aircraft maintenance subsidiary, Team, and IPounds 15m in
non-labour overheads.
The company said that more rapid progress was now expected in those areas,
with the core agreement now settled with staff in the main airline business.
Two obstacles still lie in the path of finally wrapping up the rescue plan,
assuming the secret ballot approves the deal.
First, management and unions have agreed to go to arbitration over pay
settlements for the coming year - the airline management says no pay award
can be made next year.
Second, a IPounds 175m equity injection promised by the government in the
event of IPounds 50m of cost savings being achieved, is still dependent upon
approval by the EC Commission.
Aer Lingus's rivals on the intensely competitive Dublin-London route are
waging a lobbying campaign in Brussels to block approval, arguing that the
government support would create unfair competition for their operations.
Without the IPounds 175m support, yesterday's deal with the unions will come
unravelled.
The airline is currently losing about IPounds 1.2m a week and last month
reported a pre-tax deficit of IPounds 190.7m for the year ending March 31
1993 on turnover of IPounds 817m.
With net debt of IPounds 540m at the last financial year-end, gearing was
533 per cent. In the summer, the airline's bank creditors threatened to shut
off lines of credit to the airline unless a viable rescue plan was put in
place by the autumn.

BASS, the UK's leading brewer, has agreed to acquire a 34 per cent stake in
Prague Breweries, the second largest brewer in the Czech Republic, for
Pounds 9m.
The deal is Bass's first overseas brewing venture since it sold its interest
in Lamot, the Belgian brewer, 12 years ago.
Mr Ian Prosser, Bass chairman and chief executive, yesterday described the
Prague deal as 'an important first step' in the group's search for
opportunities for international expansion.
It offered good prospects for further development in the Czech market and
for increased exports, he said.
The Prague group, which will have net assets of Pounds 30m after the deal is
completed, plans to invest Pounds 50m over the next five years in expanding
and modernising its three breweries. It has a 10 per cent share of the Czech
beer market which is about a quarter the size of that of the UK.
Prague's sales of Pounds 36m last year included a significant contribution
from exports, mainly to eastern and central Europe.
Bass will introduce Prague's leading premium lager, Staropramen, into the UK
and a number of other international markets next year.
The UK brewer will have four seats on the Prague board and a number of
senior managers will be seconded to the group.

FT  02 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Cranswick shares drop 32p on warning
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A WARNING yesterday from the directors of Cranswick that interim profits
would be below their previous expectations sent the company's shares down by
32p to 159p.
Following an 'extremely disappointing' performance from the pig rearing
activities in the second quarter they expected pre-tax profits for the half
year to September 30 to be about Pounds 700,000 compared with Pounds 968,000
previously.
However, the interim dividend was expected to be held at 2.4p when the
results are announced early next month.
The directors blamed the second quarter setback on a 'substantial and
unforeseen fall in pig prices throughout August and September, compounded by
higher feed costs resulting from flooding in the US and a late harvest in
the UK.'
They pointed out that pig prices had continued to fall in October and would
have an impact on that month's profitability.
The group's other activities, grain and feed, 'were continuing to trade
satisfactorily' with most performing ahead of budget.

losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits at Bolton Group, the property investor, fell from Pounds
202,000 to Pounds 142,000 in the year ended April 30.
The result was struck after losses relating to the Langho Nursing Centre,
which had been disposed of, the directors said, as it required a
disproportionate amount of management time and would not gen-erate the
target return required.
Since the year end the decision has also been taken to dispose of certain
investment properties, which will result in a reduction in debt of about
Pounds 5m.
Turnover was Pounds 2.46m (Pounds 1.83m). Net interest took more at Pounds
1.24m (Pounds 1.13m) and earnings per share came to 1.6p (2.2p).

FT  02 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Stanley Leisure upbeat and buying
bookmakers chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Stanley Leisure rose 20p to 249p yesterday as the betting shops
and casino group issued an upbeat trading statement and announced the Pounds
6m acquisition of the bookmakers chain Selwyn Demmy (Racing).
The company said yesterday that after the first six months, 'the trading
performance in both the betting shop and casino divisions are considerably
ahead of the same period last year.'
Analysts revised their forecasts for the year to the end of April from
Pounds 9m to Pounds 10m.
Stanley is buying 49 betting shops in the north-west of England through the
acquisition of Demmy Investments, which owns Demmy Racing. Demmy's 49 shops
bring the number of outlets operated by Stanley's racing division to 401.
The company said that it expected to make significant savings from the
integration of Demmy's shops with its own.
Stanley is paying Pounds 6m for Demmy Investments. This figure will be
adjusted however, subject to Demmy's net asset position.
The consideration will be satisfied by the issue of 589,520 Stanley Leisure
shares at 229p, Pounds 250,000 in cash and the balance in loan notes
repayable within three to five years. The vendor has agreed not to sell the
Stanley shares for at least one year.
Demmy Racing returned profits of Pounds 247,000 for the year to February 27,
on sales of Pounds 25.2m. However, this was before charges of Pounds 242,000
for interest on loans to the company by directors, depreciation of goodwill,
and executives remuneration.
Demmy Investments is expected to show a debt of Pounds 1.65m to Mr Selwyn
Demmy, which will be repaid in cash on completion.
Last year Stanley Leisure returned annual profits of Pounds 8.05m, a rise of
3 per cent, in spite of foregoing an estimated Pounds 300,000 profit on the
Grand National debacle at Aintree when the race was declared void after two
false starts.
Sales for the 53 weeks were Pounds 218.4m, against Pounds 203.3m in 1992.

Grand Central Investment Holdings, the food group with interests in Asia

That compared with a profit of Pounds 1.01m last time and was struck on
turnover up from Pounds 29.8m to Pounds 32.9m.
The decline was due to the closure of the Singapore manufacturing plant and
its relocation to Malaysia and Indonesia coupled with the continued downturn
in performance of commodity-related operations, the directors said.
Losses per share were 1.27p (1.47p earnings). There is no dividend this time

The Imperial Smelting Process smelter, which employs some 600 people, was
bought from Pasminco, and is designed to give MIM downstream zinc processing
capacity.
MIM directors said that the smelter could have particular strategic
significance once output from the McArthur River mine project comes on
stream in a couple of years' time.
The smelter has the capacity to produce 120,000 tonnes of zinc and 55,000
tonnes of lead bullion, while the associated manufacturing plant at Bloxwich

Mid Kent Holdings, the water supply company, has acquired the Linkclever
group of companies, including CRI - its radio and telemetry data collection,
transfer and control arm.
The maximum possible cost of the purchase is Pounds 4.4m. However, on
current profit projections, the board estimates that the actual amount will
be about Pounds 3.3m in cash.
MKH will pay Pounds 2.5m - Pounds 2.1m on completion with a balance of up to
Pounds 400,000 dependent on the audited net asset value of CRI at the
completion date. Thereafter, a profits-related payment of up to Pounds 1.9m
is payable.
CRI estimates that the additional amount will not exceed Pounds 800,000.

FT  02 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Trinity acquires Argus newspapers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trinity International, the Chester-based publisher of the Liverpool Daily
Post and Echo, is acquiring the 27 local newspapers owned by Argus Press.
The move follows last week's approval of the deal by the Department of Trade
and Industry.
Trinity is paying Pounds 20.7m in cash for the south of England pre-paid and
free titles. In addition, Trinity will pay a further estimated Pounds 1.5m
cash for stock, reimbursement for the benefit of pre-payments and to assume
trade creditors. In the year ended March 31 1993, the assets being acquired
made a net profit of about Pounds 600,000 on turnover of Pounds 25m, with a
net book value of about Pounds 5.7m.
The deal gives Trinity a presence in the south of England for the first time
and furthers its strategic aim of expanding and diversifying its regional
newspaper interests.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WILTON GROUP, the USM-traded toys, hardware and electrical goods concern,
cut pre-tax losses to Pounds 785,000 in the first half of 1993. This
compared with Pounds 2.51m last time, which was after a Pounds 2m provision
for future losses on discontinued operations.
Losses included Pounds 463,000 attributable to Glenchewton, in which Wilton
held a 70 per cent stake until August 1993, when it was reduced to 34 per
cent. In accordance with FRS 3, Glenchewton's results have been reported as
relating to discontinued activities.
Total turnover for the period fell from Pounds 14.67m to Pounds 8.85m, of
which Pounds 481,000 (Pounds 462,000) related to continuing operations. Net
interest charged was Pounds 253,000 (Pounds 819,000) and losses per share
came out at 0.12p (0.37p).

FT  02 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Ruberoid bounces back to the market -
Flotation completes Tarmac's programme of disposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUBEROID yesterday announced a return to the stock market almost five years
to the day that Tarmac fought and won a bitter nine-week battle to take over
the roofing materials company with rival bidder Raine Industries.
The flotation, which is likely to value a now substantially smaller Ruberoid
at about Pounds 70m, completes Tarmac's programme of disposals intended to
strengthen the building materials and construction company's balance sheet
weakened by recession.
About 65 per cent of the new issue, sponsored by Robert Fleming, is likely
to be placed firmly with institutions and 35 per cent placed subject to
clawback in an open offer. The company does not expect to raise a
significant amount of new money.
Tarmac's Pounds 141.3m bid, described in 1988 as a classic white knight
operation, engaged the City for weeks as Mr Thomas Kenny, Ruberoid's then
chairman, engaged in a pointed public debate with Mr Peter Parkin, Raine's
chief executive.
Mr Ian McPherson, who is stepping into the top job at the new Ruberoid
company, said: 'I know Ruberoid will be remembered. It has only been off the
market since 1988.'
Ruberoid currently generates about 60 per cent of its sales from
contracting, of which 70 per cent comes from less cyclical refurbishment
work. The balance is in manufacturing bituminous waterproofing systems
predominantly for the construction industry and distributing them from
warehouses in Lancashire, Dundee and Enfield.
The company, which Tarmac roughly halved through disposals, has been on the
market for trade buyers since April but the parent said no realistic price
was suggested during preliminary talks with potential purchasers.
This made the prospect of seeking a listing on today's high market, with
investors now generally willing to pay more than trade buyers, all the more
attractive to both Tarmac and Ruberoid's management.
Mr Neville Simms, chief executive of Tarmac, said: 'Of course you take
advantage of the fact that there is a more obvious and visible value to the
people who are running the business.'
Mr McPherson, who is quitting the post of president of Tarmac America to
become chief executive of the new company, said: 'They are good businesses
and they always have been.' He said: 'Personally I have always wanted to run
a plc company because I have done everything else. I have lived with a huge
division inside a big group which has all of the disadvantages of a plc and
none of the advantages.' To fulfil this ambition he is bringing the
waterproofing businesses of Ruberoid and Tarmac to the market, of which the
main companies are Ruberoid, Permanite, Briggs Amasco, NEBI and ATAB.
Mr McPherson claims for the Ruberoid businesses a 25 per cent share of the
UK roofing market and a 16 per cent share of the country's specialist
roofing contracting market. The large shares might have given any trade
buyer difficulties with the Office of Fair Trading.
ATAB in Belgium and NEBI in the Netherlands are leading manufacturers of
waterproofing products as well as roofing and cladding contractors.
The businesses brought together for the flotation made pre-tax losses of
Pounds 12.8m (losses of Pounds 6.7m) in the year to December 31 on turnover
of Pounds 280.4m (Pounds 263.8m).
The deficit was struck after provisions of Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 6.9m) with
the bulk against redundancy and reorganisation as well as some to cover poor
contract results. There was also a notional interest charge of Pounds 6.1m
(Pounds 6.8m).
There are no exceptional items forecast for 1993 and the interest charge for
the current year is likely to be just below Pounds 1m following a
refinancing which should ensure an average gearing of about 10 per cent
during the year.
Mr McPherson said: 'The current order position supports our forecasts: we
don't yet see any major upturn in the UK: we think the market will be strong
by 1995.'
He said the board's strategy would be to 'major on the brand names' such as
'all the Permas and Rubers' which, he said, had become for builders as
generic as Hoover. The company expects to capitalise from roofs which have
been neglected during the recession.
Mr McPherson plans to hold equity in the company as do all the directors:
'We are going to put our money where our mouth is,' he said.

FT  02 NOV 93 / UK Company News: ASW shares fall 41p after profits warning -
Margins squeezed by rising scrap metal costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN ASW Holdings plunged by 41p to 147p yesterday after the
Wales-based steel products group issued a profits warning because of rising
scrap prices and reduced selling prices in the recession-hit continental
European market.
Analysts had been predicting pre-tax profits ranging from Pounds 7.5m to
Pounds 15m or more, but yesterday one said he had 'pencilled in' a
downgraded forecast of Pounds 2m for 1993. Last year, the company suffered a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 10.8m.
ASW had warned at the interim stage in September that the price of scrap,
its main raw material, had risen sharply in June. Yesterday it said the
price had fallen in August but had since risen again.
The company said that as a result of this, together with weak selling prices
for ASW's principal products in continental Europe, margins had declined
significantly from those experienced in the second quarter, with weak
selling prices for principal products in Europe adding to pressure.
Provided that market conditions did not change substantially, the group's
steel activities would stay in profit during the second half, but profits
would be lower than the Pounds 5.7m achieved in the steel business in the
first six months, the company said.
ASW's steel businesses were the star performer in the first half, rebounding
from profits of just Pounds 900,000 a year earlier, and a loss of Pounds
4.4m for all 1992.
In contrast, ASW's much smaller construction systems business suffered a
Pounds 2.5m loss for the first half, but is expected to reduce its deficit
in the current half. Overall, ASW had a first-half pre-tax profit of Pounds
1.5m.
Mr Alan Cox, ASW's chief executive, said in September that he was 'more
confident than for a long time' about the company's main steel business. But
he was cautious about the outlook for steel margins.
Yesterday ASW said that, given the volatility of European margins, it was
too early to make any comments about 1994 - when some analysts were
expecting big rises in profits.
Mr Ian Lowe at Smith New Court has downgraded his 1993 profits forecast from
Pounds 11.7m to Pounds 1m, reflecting reduced losses in construction systems
as much as the problems in the steel business. 'These have some longevity
about them,' he said.
His 1994 prediction is reduced from Pounds 20m to Pounds 9m.
ASW said that, in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, it intended to
pay an unchanged final dividend of 3p a share, making a total of 6p, also
unchanged, for 1993.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Capital Cities in stock buy-back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL Cities/ABC has offered to buy from its shareholders up to about 12
per cent of its existing common stock which could cost the cash-rich group
between Dollars 1.18bn and Dollars 1.26bn (Pounds 851m).
The move stands in contrast to the current emphasis within the US media
industry on building new technological alliances though acquisitions and
joint ventures.
Capital Cities, which owns the ABC television network, also announced
yesterday that its president and chief executive, Mr Daniel Burke, 64, would
retire in February. Mr Thomas Murphy, chairman, will assume the duties of
chief executive while continuing in his present position.
The enhanced role for Mr Murphy, who is 68, is surprising. Industry
observers had expected Mr Robert Iger, who as president of the television
network helped increase the profitability of its prime-time programming, to
be given at least one of Mr Burke's titles.
Under terms of the tender offer, Capital Cities has invited shareholders to
specify a price - within a range of Dollars 630 to Dollars 590 a share - at
which they are willing to sell their stock.
Assuming the offer - known as a Dutch auction - generates sufficient
interest, the company will then determine the lowest price at which it would
be able to buy 2m shares and proceed with the purchase of all shares offered
at or below that price.
On Wall Street early yesterday, the shares were Dollars 5 3/8 higher at
Dollars 615 in light trading.
Capital Cities said it had decided to make the offer because it was the most
attractive use for its cash surplus of about Dollars 1.2bn.
'Acquisitions have not been available at prices the company believes would
result in attractive returns for its shareholders.' It said that after the
stock repurchase it would have ready access to sufficient capital to pursue
any attractive investment opportunities that might arise.
The company added it had paid off all its long-term debt available for
repayment, including Dollars 500m in liabilities this year.
Mr Peter Appert, an analyst with CJ Lawrence, the New York securities house,
said the offer 'shows Capital Cities is going to stick with its financial
discipline and not get sucked into the euphoria over consolidation and
acquisitions'.

FT  02 NOV 93 / B&amp;B to build German operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRADFORD &amp; Bingley, the UK's seventh largest building society, has become
the first non-German institution to be given permission to set up a
Bausparkasse, the German equivalent of a building society.
The society said yesterday that it would establish two operations in
Hamburg: a Bausparkasse and a marketing company. The latter would distribute
the B&amp;B Bausparkasse tariffs, or contracts, through brokers and sales
companies. It would also target independent insurance and investment houses,
which could add B&amp;B products to their ranges. Most German societies are
owned by insurance companies or by banks with a link to an insurance
company.
The move marks a further stage in UK societies' interest in developing
businesses in continental Europe.
Halifax, the largest society, has been granted a licence to take retail
deposits for mortgage lending in Spain and will open a bank in Madrid later
this month.
The B&amp;B Bausparkasse will open in January and take deposits for 18 months
before issuing loans. B&amp;B believes the project will make a small profit in
its first full year.
It aims to win 1 per cent of the market. The 34 existing Bausparkassen
accounted for DM4.5bn (Pounds 1.8bn) in net lending in 1991 - some 15 per
cent of the total, according to the Bundesbank. About 17m Germans have
contracts with Bausparkassen.
Formerly, the German home loans market has been served almost exclusively by
domestic institutions, apart from loans made by foreign-owned banks.
While the relatively low level of home-ownership - 40 per cent of Germans
are owner-occupiers compared with 67 per cent in the UK - makes the German
market attractive, regulatory requirements have deterred other societies
from establishing operations.
Mr John Smith, B&amp;B's finance director, said the German system of fixed rates
for lenders and savers had benefits for both sides, and gave an extra
stability to the arrangements.
The move represented 'a good way into a major market without any great
balance-sheet risk', he said.
B&amp;B also believes that the operation will enable it to market a range of
financial services. It should leave it well placed for the opening up of the
life insurance industry when the EC's third life directive comes into effect
next July.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Banking system feels a chill wind: Muramoto Construction's
fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's collapse of Muramoto Construction, Japan's largest since the
second world war, sends a chill through the banking industry at the worst
possible time.
The big question hanging over the Japanese banking system yesterday was
whether the damage from Muramoto would be localised, or whether the harm to
its 50 bank lenders would trigger more collapses among construction industry
suppliers. Bank of Japan and finance ministry officials last night played it
down, predicting the collapse was unlikely to destabilise Japan's financial
system.
'The total is so large that adverse effects to creditor banks will be
inevitable. But overall, I think they can absorb the loss in their financial
strength,' said a senior central bank official. The Bank of Japan would
monitor the effects on lending banks and on the general economy, but did not
expect 'any significant adverse impact', he said.
Muramoto struggled on after other over-extended property groups collapsed
two years ago, only to hit the banking system at a moment when banks are
already cautious about lending, in the middle of the worst recession since
the 1973 oil crisis.
A mark of the seriousness of the construction industry's recession came
yesterday with the announcement of the steepest decline in construction
orders among the top companies for 19 years - down 22.3 per cent in the six
months to September, according to the Japan federation of construction
contractors.
Yesterday's failure can hardly encourage banks. It was unclear yesterday
exactly what triggered Muramoto's banks to withdraw their support, in
contrast to other shaky construction and property companies kept afloat by
banks.
Muramoto began work on a debt restructuring last April, with its two main
creditors Daiwa Bank and Nanto Bank, the main regional bank in Nara
prefecture where the company is based. The main bank creditors put their own
management into Muramoto, in line with Japanese banking practice, and
proposed to change the company's president and liquidate its assets.
However, other lenders opposed the restructuring, and Muramoto found itself
unable to honour its bills.
Teikoku Databank, a private credit research agency, believes the discovery
of large off-balance sheet loans by Muramoto to its own contractors prompted
banks to withdraw support. Failures of property companies in joint
developments with Muramoto contributed to a sharp rise in bad debts, said
Teikoku.
Muramoto would not comment and Nanto Bank simply said it judged that further
support would not improve Muramoto's fortunes. If Teikoku's theory is true,
then the Muramoto collapse could be localised, rather than be read as a more
worrying sign that banks were unable to afford the continuing risk.
Until yesterday, Muramoto was an obscure unquoted family controlled company,
Japan's 24th largest construction group, and largely unknown outside Nara
prefecture, where it is a pillar of the industrial establishment. Founded in
1908, it has 2,200 employees and recorded sales of Y291.5bn in the year to
last June, on which it made a Y2.8bn loss.
Muramoto lawyers were yesterday quoted as saying it would take 10 to 15
years to restructure the construction group.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Queens Moat House shareholders consider legal action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in Queens Moat Houses are considering legal action against
former directors and advisers, writes Peggy Hollinger. A lobby group formed
by Mr Denis Woodhams, a former QMH hotel manager, is seeking legal advice
following news that the heavily indebted company would have to complete a
severely dilutive debt for equity swap in order to survive. QMH owes more
than Pounds 1bn .
Mr Woodhams' action group aims to establish 'the reasons for the decline of
the company, whether any persons or body can be held responsible for the
losses, and the likelihood of successfully obtaining compensation'.
Mr Peter Bruton-Phillips, the solicitor who, with consultant Mr Michael
Harkavy, of Alvechurch, Worcester, is representing shareholders' interests,
said yesterday there were very important issues to be investigated.
Meanwhile, the London Stock Exchange confirmed it was investigating alleged
breaches of the Companies Act.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Debts sink Japanese builder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MURAMOTO Construction yesterday became Japan's biggest financial failure for
more than 45 years when it filed for protection from its creditors, with
debts totalling Y590bn (Pounds 3.7bn).
This is the largest single potential loss to hit Japan's banking system
since the collapse in asset prices began two years ago, sending the economy
into recession.
Leading creditor among the 50 banks exposed to the group is Nanto Bank, the
main regional bank in Nara prefecture, western Japan, where Muramoto, the
country's 24th largest general construction group, is based. Nanto has Y56bn
of loans to Muramoto, compared with a deposit base of Y3,000bn.
It is followed by Daiwa Bank with Y45bn, which has led creditors'
negotiations with the company, Long Term Credit Bank of Japan with Y38bn and
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank with Y28bn.
Muramoto's creditor banks could absorb the loss, a senior Bank of Japan
official said. However, the move could increase banks' caution when lending
is already sluggish.
Teikoku Databank, the private credit research agency, attributed Muramoto's
collapse to the failures of property companies with which it had undertaken
joint developments. Like other property companies across Japan, they were
hit by the prolonged decline in property prices.
Muramoto, an unlisted company capitalised at Y2.4bn and with sales of
Y291.5bn last year, specialised in public works projects. However, it
diversified into golf course construction and property development in the
late 1980s.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Red bookfails to explain red ink: Divergent valuations of
the QMH chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ask chartered surveyors about property valuations and - in the spirit of
Chairman Mao - they raise their little red book of professional guidelines.
This revered text - just like that of the former Chinese leader - has been
called into question following the widely divergent valuations given to the
assets of Queens Moat Houses, the hotels group.
In the audited accounts of QMH for the year to December 31 1991, Weatherall
Green and Smith, a leading firm of chartered surveyors, valued the company's
properties at Pounds 2bn. One year later, a draft valuation by the same firm
offered a figure of Pounds 1.35bn. QMH opted instead for a rival valuation
from Jones Lang Wootton, for the 1992 accounts, which was still lower at
just Pounds 861m. QMH's assets include 22,000 rooms in 189 hotels - mainly
three and four-star hotels in the UK, as well as interests in Germany,
France, the Netherlands, Belgium and the US.
The size of the discrepancies has become a talking point in the profession.
One surveyor said yesterday: 'It doesn't help our reputation, but there are
very few incidents where you have a disagreement as large as this.'
Mr Terry Knight, senior partner of Weatherall, would not discuss the QMH
valuation in detail on the grounds of client confidentiality, but said his
firm stood by its figures. Jones Lang Wootton also refused to comment.
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which produces the red book,
has launched an investigation into the differences and requested the
valuation certificates produced by the two firms for QMH. Officials were
keen to stress yesterday that they needed to gather more information. There
was no evidence the two firms had breached its valuation guidelines.
A number of factors may account for the divergent figures. The hotel sector
was in decline during 1992, which could account for the fall between the
1991 and the draft 1992 Weatherall valuations - although the downward trend
may have been detectable as far back as late 1989.
In contrasting the two firms' figures, Weatherall's 1992 estimates were
prepared several months before those made by Jones, by which time even more
pessimistic views on the market had developed.
Equally, it is unclear whether the two sets of figures were prepared on the
same assumptions. Jones may have been asked to estimate a worst-case for
sale of hotels in the current depressed market; while Weatherall may have
assumed the hotels did not need to be sold and could remain more in line
with its previous figures.
The UK's other principal hotel groups were yesterday keen to reject
suggestions that they needed to reduce the value of their assets any further
in response to the position at QMH.
Mr Donald Main, finance director at Forte, said the group revalued its
entire portfolio last January - cutting the total by Pounds 344m - against
its normal practice of revaluing a third each year. Ladbroke, which owns the
Hilton International chain, said the book value of its hotels had been
reduced by Pounds 195.6m last year and by Pounds 56m the previous year.
Speaking on the position at QMH, Mr Andrew Cherry, senior valuation partner
with Healey &amp; Baker, and immediate past chairman of RICS' assets valuation
standards committee, says: 'If both valuations are in accordance with the
red book, what we have is a genuine difference of opinion. Professional
judgment counts for an awful lot.'
That may suggest that the RICS guidelines - notably the seven pages of
statement of asset valuation practice 12 - need to be more tightly drafted.
Mr Russell Kett, an associate with the hotel and leisure consulting division
of Touche Ross, says: 'The reason that many hotels have gone into
receivership in the last two years is as a result of properties being
ascribed values which have proved unsupportable against their debts.'
That has led to the insolvency arm of Touche Ross reputedly becoming one of
the largest hotel operators in the country. It has also led to consideration
by RICS of new guidelines, as well as a draft statement of recognised
accounting practice on valuation from the British Association of Hotel
Accountants, of which Mr Kett is chairman.
What is less likely to change is the commercial pressures - to which
surveyors admit only in private - to deliver figures in line with what the
directors of a company may want.
There have been no public statements and just a handful of confidential
reprimands of RICS members related to asset valuations. A more likely
pressure for change may come from litigation. Mr Kett says his firm alone is
acting in three imminent legal battles where banks are suing surveyors on
the basis that their figures were too optimistic.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Supreme Court to review California's unitary tax: Surprise
decision appears to favour Barclays Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Supreme Court placed the Clinton administration in a painful quandary
yesterday by announcing that it was going to review the constitutionality of
California's unitary tax system - which taxes multi-national corporations on
the basis of their worldwide income.
The nine-member court said it would review both the case brought by Barclays
Bank of the UK, questioning California's right to apply the unitary system
to foreign-owned companies, and a parallel case brought by Colgate-Palmolive
raising similar issues in relation to US-owned businesses.
Together, the two cases may affect about Dollars 4bn in tax revenues that
California has either collected or assessed.
Fulfilling a campaign pledge, President Bill Clinton reversed the policy of
the last three administrations by backing California's argument that the
case should not be heard. The administration is anxious that California,
politically crucial and virtually bankrupt, should not lose the Dollars 4bn
(Pounds 2.6bn) at stake.
At the same time, the Clinton administration is unwilling to stand
forthrightly against its foreign partners - especially the UK - who have
unrelentingly criticised unitary taxation as contrary to the internationally
accepted arm's length system.
In a brief filed with the Supreme Court last month, the US solicitor-general
argued that although the decision by the California Supreme Court upholding
the unitary system was 'subject to serious question', there was no practical
need for a review because of changes California made last month to its tax
law to meet foreign objections.
The unitary method assesses tax on a proportion of a group's worldwide
income, whereas the arm's length system taxes only the revenues of the
companies doing business in the state.
Yesterday's announcement surprised many legal experts and appeared to shift
the odds of victory strongly in Barclays' favour, but Mr Jerome Libin, a
lawyer representing the UK government in the case, cautioned against any
such prediction.
Mr Brad Sherman, a member of the California franchise tax board who was
active in promoting the changes to the unitary tax system, said he was
disappointed by the Supreme Court's decision.
In reviewing the Barclays and Colgate cases, the Supreme Court will revisit
its 1983 decision in a case brought by Container Corp, in which it upheld
the fairness of the unitary system.
Barclays' argument against the unitary method is that by running against the
grain of internationally accepted tax practice, it interferes with the
federal government's authority over foreign commerce, enshrined in the US
constitution.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Ealing owner plans revival of film-making at studios
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS were announced yesterday to revive film-making at the birthplace of
classic British films such as Passport to Pimlico, Whisky Galore and Scott
of the Antarctic.
The new owners of Ealing Studios - where nearly 100 films were made between
1929 and its purchase by the BBC in 1957 - hope to use Business Expansion
Scheme funds to make Ealing a fully operational studio again. The aim is to
make up to 10 films a year.
After the era of Sir Michael Balcon, the most famous Ealing producer, the
BBC made television programmes there, including The Singing Detective,
Fortunes of War and Colditz.
Mr David Bill's BBRK group, which owns scenery, lighting and special-effects
companies, bought the studios from the BBC for Pounds 6m last December.
'We have a huge responsibility here,' Mr Bill said. 'When we're not aware of
the ghost of Michael Balcon, the shadow of the BBC looms large. Some of
their greatest work was done here.'
The group hopes to raise Pounds 750,000 to develop Ealing movies. The BES
scheme allows tax-free investments ranging from Pounds 500 to Pounds 40,000.
Possible ventures include a thriller about Lord Lucan and a children's film
directed by actor Bob Hoskins. The studio has entered into a trading
relationship with Screen Partners, which will provide deficit finance.
Although BES funds have helped finance films such as Henry V and Leon The
Pig Farmer, Ealing Studios said yesterday it was the first time they had
been used for a studio-based development.
The money will be invested in Ealing Studios Productions and investors are
being promised stakes in a 'varied five-year portfolio' of films.
Last night Hollywood director Martin Scorsese, speaking of his career at a
London lecture - paid tribute to the effect of the Ealing influence.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Baltic Exchange to sell London head office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S oldest shipping market, the Baltic Exchange, is to sell the
freehold site of its City of London headquarters and move to alternative
accommodation in the City.
The Baltic will also look at other proposals to develop the grade 2 listed
building, which was badly damaged in an IRA bomb attack in April 1992.
Mr Jim Buckley, chief executive of the Baltic, said the 91-year-old
exchange, referred to as the 'cathedral of shipping', no longer meets the
needs of the shipbrokers, who buy and sell space on ships for bulk cargoes,
ranging from oil to phosphate.
The exchange's decision to leave the building follows two tough years. Last
year's bomb destroyed many of the small offices that surrounded the trading
floor, severely reducing the exchange's rental income and leading to a sharp
reduction in staff numbers.
Even before the bombing, a growing number of brokers had started to conduct
business by telephone, making the exchange uneconomic. Only about 400
brokers regularly work on the trading floor, compared with about 1,000 20
years ago.
Hillier Parker, the estate agent, has been appointed to find a buyer for the
40,000 sq ft site. Mr Nick Baucher, partner at Hillier, is confident of
making a sale, even though a buyer will have to pay between Pounds 12m and
Pounds 15m to complete restoration work, including the rebuilding of a
granite facade.
Mr Baucher, who expects at least part of the site to be used for an office
block or hotel, said: 'We are selling a piece of land that is in a very good
position in the City.'
The marble-clad 13,000 sq ft exchange with its Rhodesian walnut floor is a
'wonderful space' that could be converted for use as a food hall or night
club.
With land prices now about a fifth of their levels of five years ago, Mr
Baucher expects UK property companies and institutional investors to show
interest. Hillier Parker will also market the property overseas.
Hillier Parker will advise the exchange in its search for new premises,
which will provide members with better information technology facilities and
other services.
The Baltic's 1,700 individual members, representing 600 companies, earn
Pounds 800m of commission income a year on deals worth tens of billions of
pounds. The exchange accounts for more than half the world's bulk cargo
chartering business - buying and selling space in oil tankers and in
dry-cargo vessels carrying commodities - and an even larger share of ship
sale and purchase contracts.

FT  02 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Bradford &amp; Bingley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rules on German mortgage lending look so advantageous to lenders that
one is surprised that Bradford &amp; Bingley is the first building society to
open a Bausparkasse there. Not only does Bausparkasse lending carry a
guaranteed margin of 2 per cent. The minimum loan-to-value ratio of 80 per
cent means the risk of bad debts is smaller than in the UK where B&amp;B is
currently lending up to 95 per cent of a property's value. Besides,
Bausparkasse borrowers must save with the institution for at least 18 months
before taking out a loan.
Nothing comes without a price, of course. B&amp;B has jumped the first hurdle of
obtaining its licence. Now comes the struggle to acquire a share of a market
which is pretty well stitched up by established operators. B&amp;B reckons its
German operation can become profitable on the basis of a 1 per cent market
share. That, though, would hardly constitute a meaningful diversification
for Britain's seventh largest building society. Yet B&amp;B deserves applause
for having latched on to the long-term opportunities in a market that is
opening up, particularly to insurance products. Exploiting these
opportunities will require patience, but quick-fix efforts at
diversification can easily end in tears, as Abbey National's humiliating
foray into French commercial lending shows.

FT  02 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: UK budget
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a timeliness to BZW's warning of possible action in the budget to
remove the institutions' tax credit on dividends. Other options for raising
revenue by pushing up indirect taxes look less attractive, given the
strength of political opposition and worries about their impact on the
headline rate of inflation. Mr Norman Lamont's initial attack on the credit
in April passed with minimal protest. Granted, the equity market fell as it
adjusted to lower yield horizons, but that has long been forgotten in the
dizzy heights reached subsequently.
There is a beguiling argument that, by removing the credit, the government
would be creating a level playing field where institutions receive the same
return as other investors. In reality, its main purpose would again be to
raise revenue. One way or another, companies would end up paying, most
probably through an early end to pension holidays such as BT and Guinness
have already announced. That would have the same effect on their cash flow
as an increase in corporation tax.
Nor is there much consolation in the thought that increased pension fund
contributions would find their way back into equities. The chances are that
an increasing proportion would flow into higher-yielding gilts to meet
actuarial requirements on return. Mr Clarke might be deterred by the desire
to avoid his first budget being greeted by a slumping stock market. Then
again, he would doubtless be delighted if the counterpart was a rising gilt
market - in which he will still have to fund a large deficit next year.

FT  02 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Queens Moat Houses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a fair bet that Weatherall Green and Smith will not be seated next to
Jones Lang Wootton at the chartered surveyors' Christmas bash. The striking
disparity in the two firms' valuations of Queens Moat Houses' hotels has
caused a furore among property valuers. It is of particular alarm to the
owners of QMH's Pounds 215m mortgage debenture stock. They previously
believed their stock was generously secured on several of QMH's hotels. They
now discover that the revised value of that property no longer covers the
nominal value of the outstanding debenture stock.
Undoubtedly, there are particular difficulties in valuing hotels. A hotel's
income stream can vary enormously depending on market conditions, and future
forecasts rely on subjective opinion. How that income stream is capitalised
to give a present value is also fraught with difficulties. In QMH's case,
these calculations were perhaps especially tricky. The fixed fees QMH
derived from many of its hotels may have induced a false sense of security
about future income flow.
Nevertheless, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors should urgently
review its valuation procedures if the profession is to retain credibility.
As for debenture holders, they will always depend on vigilant and active
trustees to protect their interests. But that task would be greatly
simplified if borrowers were obliged to provide prompt and full disclosure
about valuation criteria. That may raise issues of commercial sensitivity.
But it would also provide its own rewards: those revealing such information
should be able to secure funds more cheaply.

FT  02 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: BT's cheap chatline
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BT's decision to turn price cuts required by the regulator into a marketing
drive deftly makes a virtue of necessity. Its RPI-7.5 per cent price control
is a heavy ball and chain to carry. BT was also a little unfortunate that
the low inflation rate in the month when the irons were clamped on has made
the burden heavier - the company has to cut prices by Pounds 500m this year.
Yet it chose to announce only Pounds 150m of the reduction yesterday. From a
marketing perspective, it perhaps makes sense to spin out the good news and
ram home one message at a time. It soothes the profit and loss account to go
slow on the implementation of lower tariffs, as the regulator has already
noted. BT is well within its rights. Yet upsetting Oftel might be unwise.
The weighting of price cuts is significant. BT has focused on domestic
customers as competition from Mercury and cable companies increases. Since
competition in business services has already cut margins, defending or
acquiring domestic customers is the logical next step. Further initiatives
will probably be in a similar vein. Such price initiatives may blunt the
erosion of BT's domestic base and slow Mercury's advance. Yet if the focus
is away from the business market, its impact on Mercury's profitability
should be limited.
As Mr Michael Hepher, BT's managing director, points out, telephone systems
have high fixed costs. They also require high capital spending. Any
increased use of the system is thus welcome. To prosper, BT is going to need
to use good marketing to stimulate those domestic call volumes now that the
watchdog is biting and the competitive wolf is at the door.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Big chopper falls with a thud: The trials of China's
reformists as they try to cool an overheating economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER and EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Zhu Rongji, China's economic supremo, can scarcely have encountered more
testing times than these in his stewardship of the Chinese economy. Nor can
China itself have entered a more critical phase in seeking to expand its
economic reforms.
When Mr Zhu surfaced in Shanghai a few days ago to open a bridge, it marked
one of the very few recent public appearances for a man rarely out of the
news in the first half of this year. China's senior vice-premier has had
much on his mind, and on his plate, since he unveiled in July a 16-point
austerity programme to control China's over-heating economy. For the
measures - which have raised interest rates, curbed speculative real estate
investments and imposed a credit squeeze on state enterprises - have
antagonised entrenched interests in the central bureaucracy, and among
powerful local officials.
Under pressure from the provinces, and from the state enterprise lobby at
the centre, Mr Zhu, who in June assumed the role of governor of the People's
Bank, the central bank, has begun to ease monetary policy. The bank loosened
credit restrictions in August and September, allowing money in circulation
to grow by Yuan10bn (Dollars 1.75bn) compared with Yuan1.46bn in the same
period last year.
As the Communist party prepares for the crucial third plenary session later
this year of its 14th Central Committee, an important policy-making body,
there are two questions: have Mr Zhu and his reformist colleagues managed to
preserve the integrity of measures advanced to cool an overheating economy;
and perhaps more important, have they laid the groundwork for progress
towards the next phase of the economic reform programme.
At this preliminary stage it appears that Mr Zhu, having weathered harsh
criticism over some aspects of his austerity package, is close to seeing a
fairly ambitious programme for reform of the banking, finance, and trade
sectors adopted by the third plenum. China is planning to stiffen the
regulatory functions of the People's Bank to enhance its authority over
monetary policy and enable it to concentrate primarily on fighting
inflation; to unveil a radical reform of the taxation system, including the
introduction of a new revenue-sharing formula between the centre and the
provinces; and to further liberalise trade to satisfy requirements for
accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. However, reform of
crumbling state enterprises remains a murky area, and Mr Zhu may well have
been obliged to back away from measures that would bring further hardship to
loss-making industries.
Little has emerged publicly of the heated debate within the Chinese
leadership over the way ahead, but interviews conducted by the Financial
Times with influential figures in economic policy-making have given a flavor
of the intensity of discussions. Mr Zhu, at a series of stormy private
meetings in Beijing and the provinces, has been forced to defend his
actions, especially those that have squeezed funds for state enterprises,
some of which are encountering wage difficulties.
Mr Dong Fureng, a member of the standing committee of the National People's
Congress (which acts like the UK cabinet), and a leading economist, was
surprisingly forthright. 'Personally, I think Zhu Rongji's macro-control
measures should be more flexible. Banks should quicken steps to provide
loans to troubled enterprises. The negative effects are growing. If he is
more flexible now, the economy will pay a lower price in the end.'
Other prominent officials such as Mr Ye Sen of the Commission for Economic
Restructuring were more circumspect, although they made little attempt to
disguise their misgivings. 'It is very necessary to have macroeconomic
controls, but we have to distinguish different situations  - we cannot just
cut with one big chopper,' he declared.
Mr Zhu's 'big chopper', a reference to the heavy-bladed kitchen utensil
wielded by Chinese cooks, has certainly fallen heavily. But it has fallen
less discriminately than Mr Zhu may have wished. His credit restrictions
were aimed at recalling loans made to the 'hot money' areas of the economy,
such as speculative property ventures. Commercial banks have since struggled
to recover real estate loans, so instead have recovered funds from
profitable state enterprises, which depend on bank credit to finance their
working capital.
A significant proportion of the new credits that the government has released
since September have been directed to state enterprises, many of them
faltering industries which need continuous cheap loans to stay afloat. Such
a move may make political sense, but hardly squares with Mr Zhu's policy of
redirecting investment towards profitable enterprises. Commercial bank
portfolios are bulging with what the Chinese classify as 'overdue' loans,
but are, in effect, non-performing.
In defence of his measures, Mr Zhu is likely to have argued that initial
gains in restraining unsustainable economic activity, and puncturing what
had become known as the speculative 'bubble economy', vindicate his
approach.
His 16-point plan has, in effect, put an end to illegal interbank lending
through financial intermediaries such as bank-controlled trust and
investment companies - so-called 'triangular debt'; drawn funds back into
the banking system by clamping down on the issuance of enterprise bonds; and
stabilised the exchange rate in currency trading houses known as 'swap
centres'. The exchange rate slipped to nearly Yuan11 to the US dollar in
June, while the black market rate depreciated even further. But higher
interest rates and central bank intervention have since stabilised the
exchange rate at about Yuan 8.7 to the dollar, while some exporters complain
that it is increasingly hard to sell their foreign exchange.
The austerity package has also taken some of the steam out of inflation.
Annual inflation in the 35 main urban centres was 20.7 per cent in
September, down from 23.3 per cent in July. Prices of commodities are also
down sharply. For instance, steel prices fell by 34 per cent in the third
quarter. Retail sales growth has also moderated.
Mr Zhu has also managed to find the money for infrastructure projects which
were starved of funds in the first half of the year and, perhaps more
important, he has ensured that restive farmers are being paid promptly for
produce acquired by the state. Delays in honoring commitments to peasants
had provoked political unrest.
In the six months to June, only 19 per cent of big construction projects
under the present 1991-95 five-year plan were being adequately funded. The
figure had risen to 70 per cent by September. However, fixed asset
investment fell by more than 10 per cent in August over July, although the
heady capital spending of the early part of the year resulted in a nearly 70
per cent increase in the eight months to August compared with last year.
But Mr Zhu is not out of the woods yet. World Bank officials express concern
that monetary policy has been loosened, even though inflation remains high
and industrial output and retail sales are both rising by more than 20 per
cent a year. Meanwhile, senior leader Deng Xiaoping's recent reported
intervention in the economic policy debate to urge a commitment to reform
and to continued economic growth was seen as a possible strike against party
conservatives.
The reformists are engaged in a delicate balancing act: they must exercise
continuing restraint over an economy expected to grow by 13 per cent this
year; at the same time they must confront the political difficulties
associated with pressing further ahead into the uncharted waters of China's
reform process. Mr Zhu will be worried that in his attempts to restrain
activity he risks a hard landing, which may impede his ability to implement
the reforms necessary to avoid another boom-and-bust cycle; but if he yields
too much ground to those urging an easing of credit he risks a resurgence of
inflation.
'Zhu Rongji has a much bigger agenda than slowing the economy,' said a
western official in Beijing. 'Without the next stage of reforms of the
institutions of macroeconomic policy, he knows that China will continue to
run the risk of excess demand and instability . . . He is trying to put the
thread through the eye of a very small needle.'

FT  02 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Russian land
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT BORIS Yeltsin's decree last week, giving Russia's collective and
state farm workers the right to buy, sell, lease and pass on their share of
the land, is an unambiguously good move. It gives Russian peasants a
long-awaited right - and one long blocked by the now defunct Russian
parliament - to emancipate themselves from state-serfdom and to become
farmers, or to sell that right to others.
Privatisation of farmland is one of the most essential steps towards
building a market economy, but in Russia it has been particularly
problematic, thanks to the conservatism of farm directors and to the inertia
of the peasants themselves. Subsidies to inefficient state farms are a huge
burden on the state budget. Privatisation will push them into the free
market, which is already growing as the more enterprising make deals for
their produce with traders and middlemen.
But this is only the beginning. People long ago forced into a style of
agriculture that emphasised dependence on the state and which criminalised
initiative cannot suddenly become efficient producers of food. Like Soviet
industry, Soviet agriculture has been pounded into its present shape over
decades: that shape is visible in the vast acreage of most farms, in the
huge obsolescent tractors and combines and, most of all, in the inadequate
storage facilities and hopeless roads via which a quarter of all production
is lost.
The Nizhny Novgorod region, test bed for reform in association with the
International Finance Corporation, shows how much preparation is needed for
a successful transition. There, the owners are being guided towards auctions
in a week's time which should see the emergence of a group of medium-sized
farms run by farmworkers and bosses, with privatised machinery bases
providing them with services. This approach will no doubt serve as a model,
but will not be available in many parts of Russia.
The state must thus play an active role for some time to come - backing up
the right to buy and sell, ensuring that conservative directors do not
render it meaningless. Mr Yeltsin's decree creates a state inspection
service with this task: like the relatively successful state property
committees, this must gird itself for prolonged and potentially disruptive
conflict with vested interests, region by region.
Most contentious of all will be the sale of land to foreign companies -
though the decree clearly allows this, in association with Russian partners.
The taboo has to be broken if foreigners are to be encouraged to become part
of Russian reform. The first signs of confidence are returning to foreign
companies after the roller-coaster of the past two years. Provided it is
properly implemented, this measure could do more than any other to
strengthen it, and at last begin to raise the Russian economy from its
sickbed.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Personal View: Nuclear answers need right questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN FELLS and NIGEL LUCAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The government review of the UK nuclear industry, scheduled for 1994 and
then brought forward to 1993, is getting off to a slow start. The Treasury,
the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of the Environment
disagree about the scope of the terms of reference and discussions are
stalled awaiting the decision on whether the Thorp reprocessing plant is to
go ahead.
The terms of reference could be narrow, as Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister,
hinted in June, when he identified the central question as: 'Would new
nuclear power stations be commercially viable in the UK . . . without any
subsidy from government or taxpayer.' A narrow review is unlikely to do more
than conclude that the industry may build new plant if it can find private
capital. With such terms of reference the review will be futile.
None the less, this is apparently the route that government would like to
take, because it is consistent with the market-led energy policy, stoutly
reaffirmed in the White Paper, The Prospects for Coal. The danger of a
market-led policy is that it is at the mercy of market distortions. These
distoritons are serious in the energy sector, and have led to the perverse
closure of viable coal mines and power stations while gas-fired plant are
opened at higher costs. Taking the same approach to the nuclear industry is
likely to have the same effect.
The situation is pressing. The ageing and obsolescent Magnox plant and, very
soon, the first of the advanced gas-cooled reactors must be replaced if the
nuclear industry is to have a future, and if it is to continue to make the
20 per cent contribution to UK electricity supply wisely proposed by the
then energy secretary, Cecil Parkinson, when he designed the privatisation
of the electricity supply industry.
Many advantages of nuclear power are not expressed in the marketplace.
Supply is secure compared with natural gas, which in the next few decades
will have to be brought from ever-more remote areas. Nuclear electricity is
one of the few energy forms which pays its environmental costs. If the idea
of climate change arising from the greenhouse effect is taken seriously,
then it is important to be able to express this benefit in decision-making.
In the US, Congress has written into the 1992 Energy Policy Act the idea of
integrated resource planning, which will provide the means to measure the
social impact of energy planning. Something similar is needed in the UK. The
review offers the opportunity to develop acceptable means of incorporating
non-market factors into decision-making to establish a balanced portfolio of
cost-effective, clean and secure energy sources.
It is one thing to establish what should go into this portfolio; it is
another to achieve it in a sector that is largely privatised and
market-oriented. The City would not buy nuclear generators the first time
round. In the event, Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear performed well,
with output per employee rising by more than 50 per cent in three years, and
costs falling and profits rising rapidly.
But the fundamental obstacles to privatisation remain; the perception of
possible liabilities from decommissioning, fuel reprocessing and waste
disposal are intimidating for private investors. There is still uncertainty
about the cost of electricity from any new nuclear plant. We believe that
electricity from a Sizewell C can be competitive with gas, but it is a
question of convincing prospective investors. The main economic advantage of
nuclear is that, once built, the fuel costs are low and stable and,
therefore, so is the price of electricity.
A new nuclear plant is unlikely without government support. Government must
find mechanisms that are coherent with Brussels' competition policy.
Instruments are available. Funding could be by issuing hypothecated
government-backed bonds; access to markets could be facilitated by obliging
regional electricity companies to contract part of their requirement over,
say, 30 years; licences for construction of power stations could be
auctioned, with conditions specifying fuel choice, giving government
influence over the type of fuel burnt, while maintaining competition.
But the best answers will not be found without asking the right questions.
The first step is a broad review seeking the methods of measuring the social
impact of energy choices and then the means of implementing the desirable
choices.
The authors are, respectively, professor of energy conversion, University of
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and professor of energy policy, Imperial College of
Science, Technology and Medicine

Former KGB major-general Oleg Kalugin had reason to fear arrest throughout
most of his eminent spying career, not least during his stint as a Soviet
agent in the US. His escape from punishment at the hands of the KGB itself,
when he publicly exposed its ruthless methods in 1990, was also something of
a feat. So he can't have been expecting the handcuffs to snap shut at
Heathrow airport over the weekend as he tried to slip into Britain on a
brief visit.
Kalugin may not have been up to his old spying tricks, but the British
authorities could have been unsettled by his latest counter-espionage
mission - taking up the invitation of the BBC's Panorama programme to talk
about MI6.
Perhaps they were serving Kalugin, who was later released, a none-too-subtle
hint that the kind of frankness he had demonstrated in exposing the KGB's
deeds was less than welcome in the west.
Alternatively, Kalugin's troubles may date back to the interview he gave to
The Mail on Sunday in April. Therein, he took it upon himself to spill the
beans as to how the KGB had supplied Bulgarian 'colleagues' with the
infamous umbrella that fired poisoned pellets to kill a dissident in London
15 years ago.
Kalugin described the weapon in detail; he also revealed that it had been
tested by his department first on a horse, which died, and on a man, who
didn't.

More klaxons wailing in the long-running offensive between Northumbria
Ambulance Service's chief executive Laurie Caple and his critics.
Labour MPs from the north-east, bitterly opposed to Caple's management style
and his enthusiasm for commercial income-generation schemes, have tabled an
early day motion drawing attention to the latest in a series of tussles over
subjects ranging from employees' conditions and dismissals, to the auditing
of NAS accounts and the purchase of personalised NAS number-plates.
It transpires that the Pounds 70,000 American-made Chevrolet ambulances
ordered by NAS do not fit into some of its more modestly proportioned
garages.
'There's an element of farce about it all, but it clearly calls into
judgment the competence of the original decision to buy the vehicles,' says
Newcastle Central MP Jim Cousins.
But NAS will have none of it. We've only ordered six, it says, and they will
happily fit into 19 of the 24 garages.
Observer just hopes that the right ambulance will be in the right garage at
the right time.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Observer: Lack of the Irish
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The London office of the European Parliament, doing its bit to celebrate the
onset of Maastricht, yesterday invited an expat from each of 10 states of
the European Community - sorry, Union - to talk to the press about their
new-found rights both to vote in next year's Euro-elections as well as to
participate in local polls at a later stage. Somehow missing from the
line-up was Ireland.
Joelle Garriaud-Maylam, elected representative of the French community in
the UK and Ireland, went on the defensive by explaining that, while
Ireland's ambassador had been invited, the Irish did not actually need to
take part in this particular celebration since 'for historical reasons' they
have had the vote in the UK for many years.
But this failed to satisfy one Irish member of the audience, who suggested
that they could have hastily substituted 'any Irish building labourer' in
the event of the ambassador's no-show. 'But I suppose alongside all those
lawyers and actors, that would have been a bit embarrassing.'

FT  02 NOV 93 / Observer: Sir Peter, QED
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One might have thought Sir Peter Middleton, donnish former permanent
secretary to the Treasury, would have delighted Bank of England directors
last week with his wholly unexpected remarks about the desirability of Bank
independence. But the terms in which he couched his remarks have done
nothing to endear the waspish ex-mandarin to several directors of the court.
In evidence to the Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee last week,
Sir Peter opined that the composition of the court would have to be changed
if the Bank were to assume control in setting interest rates. In particular,
all the members would have to be committed to fighting inflation, he went
on, 'unlike the present mob who look rather like a pressure group in the
opposite direction'.
Sir Peter, who did not return telephone calls to elaborate on this
statement, was doubtless referring to the widespread assumption that many
industrialists are less than fanatical about keeping inflation at bay,
believing that a degree of price pressure may oil the wheels of the economy.
False, cry the outside directors. Sir Christopher Hogg, chairman of Reuters,
says he considers the remarks 'very strange', while Sir John 'Chips'
Keswick, chairman of Hambros Bank, says he has 'never met an industrialist
either on the court or off it who doesn't think inflation is appalling'.
Another court member thought Sir Peter was being 'fatuous'. The
longest-serving Bank non-executive, Sir Adrian Cadbury, termed Sir Peter's
comments 'totally incorrect'.
Sir Peter does have the occasional tendency to upset people, which may have
been one of the things that counted against him when he was supposedly in
the running for the governorship of the Bank before Eddie George was chosen.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TO THE Anglo-Saxon eye, the structure of Airbus Industrie is an oddity. The
four-nation aircraft group is not an ordinary limited company with its own
balance sheet and profit-and-loss account but a marketing consortium, whose
shareholders own the group's assets and share out the lion's share of the
manufacturing contracts. To outside observers, its accounts are opaque and
its manufacturing decisions often seem excessively influenced by political
considerations.
Airbus's shareholders - especially France's state-owned Aerospatiale - have
in the past argued that this structure was essential in the group's start-up
phase. They say it enabled the company to operate on a trans-European basis
and establish itself as a competitor to Boeing, the world's largest aircraft
group. But now some insiders have again begun to question the structure.
British Aerospace and Deutsche Aerospace - two of Airbus's shareholders -
argue it should convert to a more conventional company structure which owns
its assets and awards contracts on a commercial basis. Last week, Mr Jean
Pierson, the group's managing director, who is on secondment from
Aerospatiale, gave his backing to speedy reform.
Whatever the pros and cons of Airbus's consortium structure in its infancy,
the arguments in favour of reform are compelling now that it has matured
into the world's second largest civil aircraft supplier. One reason is that
an ordinary corporate structure would provide greater transparency in its
accounts. This should enable Airbus's ultimate owners to judge whether
further investment provides value for money. It should also reduce the
threat of a trade war with the US, which is able to argue that foggy
accounting practices act as a channel for subsidies.
A second, equally important reason for converting to a limited company is
that it would help improve efficiency and so enhance Airbus's chances of
competing successfully in world markets. If Airbus owned its assets, it
would find it easier to control costs. It would also have greater freedom to
follow commercial considerations in awarding contracts to suppliers.
At a time of deep recession in the airline market, the need to compete
aggressively for orders is particularly strong. Boeing has already embarked
on a far-reaching efficiency drive. Airbus's partners are doing the same,
but not uniformly or with the same vigour. One worrying sign is that Airbus
has suffered a fall in net orders so far this year, while Boeing's order
book is still rising.
Although Mr Pierson has now been persuaded of the case for speedy reform,
this does not mean that the political battle has been won. The French
government, in particular, will be reluctant to lose influence over Airbus's
operations. But if greater freedom is necessary to secure Airbus's future,
that is a price worth paying.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Tip of Japan's debt iceberg
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WOULD be churlish not to be generous in praise of the Japanese
authorities' macroeconomic management over the past three years. The Bank of
Japan has succeeded, using both interest rate cuts and arm-twisting, in
maintaining financial order following the 1990 Tokyo stock and property
market collapse. The Ministry of Finance, after some prompting, has used
both administrative measures and three fiscal injections to put a floor
under share prices and prevent a slump. Faced with similar problems, the US,
UK and Scandinavian countries have all suffered recessions. Japan, by
contrast, has just about kept growth alive.
It is against this background that the significance of the bankruptcy of
Muramoto Construction should be judged. The collapse of the Japanese
property contractor, leaving Y590bn in unpaid debts, may be the largest
bankruptcy in Japan since the second world war. What is surprising is that
there have been so few Muramotos, given the scale of Japan's property market
collapse.
Yet Muramoto Construction represents the tip of a large iceberg. Last March,
official Japanese government figures put the total of 'non-performing' loans
at the top 21 city banks at Y12,700bn, a little over 3 per cent of
outstanding loans. But government sources also acknowledge that, when the
debts of non-bank subsidiaries are included, the true figure is at least
three times the official level, raising the ratio of bad debts to loans to
Scandinavian levels. Even the official stock of non-performing loans
represents four times last year's operating profits of the 21 city banks.
Meanwhile, the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company (CCPC), the agency set
up last year without public money in order to remove non-performing loans
from bank balance sheets, is moving at a slow pace. Between February and the
end of September, it purchased loans with a face value of a mere Y1,050bn.
Of course, as the Bank of Japan points out, the evidence that Japan is
currently facing a credit crunch is far from conclusive. Yes, bank lending
is falling and the broad money supply is barely growing. But, with Japanese
companies themselves restructuring after the over-investment of the late
1980s, the demand for credit is hardly buoyant.
Moreover, the Bank of Japan is probably right to claim, citing the Muramoto
Construction liquidation as an example, that the disposal of these
non-performing loans can occur gradually, in orderly fashion, without a risk
of systemic crisis in Japan's financial markets. And the bank is
understandably worried that a publicly financed bail-out of the banking
industry would generate moral hazard problems, although a few more
resignations by senior bank officials would help.
Yet unless the Bank of Japan provides funds to capitalise the CCPC, it will
take years rather than months for Japan's bad debt iceberg to thaw and melt.
And until the banks are restored to health, the prospects for economic
recovery will remain poor.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Picture of Belarus prospects not so
bleak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ROBERTA FELDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Matthew Kaminski's and Anthony Robinson's article, 'Belarus finds
breaking up is hard to do' (October 12), may paint too bleak a picture of
reform there. In fact, many economic officials at both the local and
national levels are anxious to implement reforms and ready to listen to
advice.
For example, the International Finance Corporation's small-scale
privatisation assistance project in the city of Brest, begun in June,
resulted in Belarus's first open auction on September 29, ahead of schedule.
Cities and regions all over Belarus are now requesting privatisation
assistance from IFC, and the government of Belarus has requested advice on
rationalising privatisation legislation, including the voucher law.
Reformers in Minsk and the provinces often want and welcome assistance.
Unfortunately, western experts have so far largely overlooked Belarus in
favour of its neighbours.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Why judges are jumping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Britain's elected politicians become less judicious, the country's judges
become more political. It is not surprising that the judiciary is expanding
its influence. The government thinks only of its day-to-day survival; the
opposition is immobilised by fear of upsetting anyone. Our politicians are a
sorry lot. The courts are presided over by some of the brightest minds in
public life. Like it or not, the latter are doing their best to compensate
for the deficiencies of the former.
We have seen much evidence of this over the past few years. The modern half
of the story begins in 1987, when the then new Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay,
intimated that judges could decide for themselves whether they wished to
address the general public by talking to the media. He thus abolished the
convention established in a letter written to the BBC by one of his
predecessors, Lord Kilmuir, in 1955. The essence of the 'Kilmuir rules' was
that, in order to keep the judiciary 'insulated from the controversies of
the day', their lordships should keep their honourable traps shut when off
the bench.
Two years later the judges rewarded Lord Mackay's liberalism by publishing
their objections to his proposals for reform of the legal profession. Senior
judges handled the back-up campaign on TV. The result is instructive. The
Mackay reforms have been, shall we say, modified on legal advice. Call it a
positive result of open government.
It is not possible to be so kind about the government's strategies for the
control of crime, the dispensation of punishment, and the administration of
justice. The 1991 Criminal Justice Act was in need of urgent repair the day
after it became law. Prisoners rioted at Strangeways; Lord Woolf was asked
to find out why. His subsequent report awaits implementation. Spectacular
miscarriages of justice were revealed. Lord Runciman was asked to make
recommendations. His report, delivered in July, has been used as a bran-box
from which to pick measures that suit the home secretary's mood.
Enter Lord Taylor. At the end of April 1992, a few weeks after one of the
most ill-starred administrations since 1979 had been returned to office, the
erstwhile Sir Peter Taylor became Lord Chief Justice. Unlike his
predecessor, Lord Lane, the new top judge is willing, anxious even, to speak
his mind. Just 18 months on, he has become a serious player in the political
game. He appears at social events around town, cheerful and chatty. His
demeanour is that of a public office holder campaigning to reshape parts of
the law.
The new Lord Chief Justice led the assault on Lord Mackay for the latter's
parsimony with legal aid. Result: zilch. He demanded more judges, and got
them. He was critical of the 1991 Criminal Justice Act; his points of
substance will doubtless be incorporated in a bill to be presented next
month. The Judges Party is determined that Britain shall incorporate the
European convention on human rights into domestic law; if not by Parliament,
then by judicial stealth. Lord Woolf, a fellow crusader for better
governance, recently slipped. In an otherwise brilliant address on the
inadequacy of merely building more jails which produce more criminals, he
spoke of prosecuting property owners who failed to burglar-proof their
houses or cars. Enemies of the Judges Party trained their fire upon him.
Outspoken judges are not unique in British history. A biography* of Lord
Denning by Iris Freeman, just published, will convince you of that. Still
alive at 94, the former Master of the Rolls was in his time the most popular
jurist anyone could recall. He stayed on the bench too long and made some
silly mistakes towards the end of his career, but prior to that he was
outstanding, the most brilliant legal mind of the century.
A grammar school boy like Lord Taylor, Lord Denning used the law creatively
in order to change it. His views were made plain in many books and speeches,
but he owed his appointment as Master of the Rolls to Lord Kilmuir, he of
the Trappist rules for judges. 'In general,' says Freeman, 'Tom agreed with
the rules for others, if not for himself . . .' He was most effective on the
bench, where, ever the opportunist, he grabbed at cases that he could
manipulate to make a particular point. His first-class mind and
encyclopaedic memory enabled him to devise fresh interpretations of both
statute and, more particularly, common law.
The present generation of reforming judges may have profited from the
Denning example, which, of course, they all know by heart. Like him, many of
them have learnt to speak plain English, without pomposity. Unlike him, they
are not absolutely in tune with common opinion - although, to be fair, we
live in a more heterogeneous society. Tom Denning, born to a Hampshire
draper in 1899 and a believing Christian, could be ever the English
pragmatist. His successors must grapple with Europe, the break-up of the
family, the decline of the inner city, and the social chaos we all know and
love.
Lord Denning led a frontal assault on the iron rule of precedent, which
obliged judges to deliver patently absurd verdicts. The Law Lords freed
themselves, but not lower courts, from the rule. He insisted on reading past
the text to establish what legislators intended. Today judges may at least
consult Hansard. He extended the law of negligence, and defended the
ordinary subject's right to compensation from ministers. He was a corkscrew:
finding against a Labour trade union law here and a Conservative one there.
Catholics, Jews, the Irish, blacks and others may feel slighted by some of
the references in this otherwise sympathetic book. My reading of it is that,
if Lord Denning harboured the prejudices of his fellow Englishmen, he did
not allow them to influence his judgments.
Iris Freeman gives us a great many facts. She lists all the Dennings'
travels and refers to more than 150 cases. She does not, however, spend much
space putting his legal achievements in context. Perhaps it is too soon. We
cannot yet know which judges will have turned out to be the most effective:
the cunning maverick Denning, or the more overtly political Taylor &amp; Co.
Meanwhile, if you're worried about judge-made law, elect better politicians.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Europe's metal fatigue: The threat from Japan's machine tool
makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pile of aluminium castings bore little resemblance to car wheels. But
after two minutes each inside an innovative Japanese machine tool - which
can replace the three normally used by wheelmakers - they were the real
thing.
The Yamazaki Mazak machine was one of many examples at the recent Emo
machine tool fair of new products aimed at helping their customers find
better, more efficient ways of cutting, drilling and shaping metal.
In a neighbouring hall from the Japanese company's stand in Hanover, there
were five machines on show from Traub, the big German producer of turning
machines, or lathes. But no amount of smartly painted equipment can disguise
the fact that Traub and its fellow European producers are worried.
While some of them can match the Japanese on the flow of new products, they
find it hard to compete with their rivals' financial muscle. Japanese
manufacturers' higher sales volumes enable them to weather recessions more
easily and support a more aggressive global manufacturing and marketing
policy. Hitachi Seiki, for example, has started producing in Germany, and
has recently slapped its first 'Made in Europe' sticker on a machining
centre produced in a joint venture with the Klockner industrial group.
Traub, meanwhile, announced in September that it is receiving a capital
injection from banks and its main family shareholders to reduce its debts by
DM80m (Pounds 32.5m). It is also receiving help from the Treuhand, the
agency charged with privatising east German industry, to buy Heckert, an
east German producer of milling machines, in a deal that broadens its
product range.
The question of the competitiveness of the European machine tool industry is
the main talking point among producers. There are about 1,450 machine tool
builders in Europe, and their problems are summed up by Cecimo, the umbrella
body for national associations from Europe's 12 main machine-tool countries.
It says companies making standard machinery are too numerous and too small
to compete effectively in the world market. And builders of more specialist
machines lack the financial power to create a global presence and survive
recessions. For many, this recession has been the worst - over the past
three years, the value of machine tools sold in the European market has
fallen by 20 per cent to Pounds 8.6bn.
In spite of this bleak analysis, the share of total world production of
machine tools by Cecimo countries has risen from 40 per cent in 1990 to 47
per cent last year. Europe has maintained a trade surplus in machine tools,
albeit down from Pounds 2.45bn in 1989 to Pounds 1.92bn last year, as sales
to growing markets in China and south-east Asia offset the collapse of
traditional markets such as the former Soviet Union.
But Europe is still seeking a long-term solution through a two-pronged
strategy to resolve the problems of an industry which has lost 32,000 jobs -
17 per cent of its workforce - over the past two years. First, Cecimo is
asking the European Commission to adopt industrial and trade measures that
would help the industry cope with its competitors.
Among its requests are: action to reduce the financial and employment costs
for European producers, relative to those of the US and Japan: financial
incentives for customers to buy machine tools whenever the market is in a
severe downturn; a programme to help small and medium-sized companies take
part in EC research and development programmes; a positive conclusion of the
Gatt trade negotiations; and a co-ordinated EC policy to promote exports.
The aim, according to Mr Yves de Boisfleury, Cecimo's president, is to
correct what he sees as the 'flagrant imbalances' between the costs of doing
business in Europe, compared with those of Japan and the US. Cecimo claims
that 'social costs' in Germany - salaries, benefits and other
employee-related expenses - are 27 per cent higher than in Japan and 37 per
cent more than in the US.
Such pleas might be dismissed as another unrealistic wish list from
industrialists struggling in a recession, were it not for the fact that the
industry has accepted the need for restructuring through mergers, takeovers
and co-operation deals. This is the second plank in its survival strategy.
The recession can be credited for the new note of realism. 'I have been
through four recessions, but none has been as bad as this,' says Mr Walter
Trick, Traub's export manager.
For German machine tool makers, the crucial competitive battle is with
Japan. The two countries account for 47 per cent of total global machine
tool production, and Germany has far more producers competing head on with
the Japanese than is the case in the rest of Europe.
Mr Hans-Joachim Holstein, sales and marketing director at Traub, speaks of a
'vicious circle' in which the company is entwined in the system of high
German labour costs and at the same time is the victim of cost pressures
among its domestic customers.
'If we have cost cuts, then we have a chance to continue manufacturing here
in Germany,' he says. Traub already manufactures in France, Italy and
Brazil, and plans to reduce manufacturing in western Germany from 80 per
cent of total production to 50 per cent over the next 12 months.
It needs to reduce the cost of its high-volume standard machines by up to a
quarter over the next year or so, says Mr Holstein, or else make them
outside western Germany. Such an admission would have been unusual three
years ago but is now common among leading European producers.
Cecimo says the problem of high labour costs is not confined to Germany.
Only if the European industry can reform its cost structure will it be able
to respond to customers who are increasingly looking for value for money
rather than technical wizardry.
According to Mr Hans-Jurgen Marckzinski, general commissioner at the Hanover
show and chief executive of Dortmund-based Thyssen Maschinenbau, customers
want equipment that is 'as good as it needs to be', rather than 'as good as
possible'.
Giving customers what they want cannot be a strategy which relies for help
on the European Commission. Producers are increasingly aware that they
should take the future into their own hands rather than wait for concrete
proposals. The response from the Commission to Cecimo's plea has so far been
cautious, although it clearly recognises that Europe's machine tools could
unlock increased manufacturing productivity.
Mr Daniele Verdiani, a senior official at the Commission's industry
directorate, says: 'The Community can always make business conditions more
favourable', but adds pointedly: 'The microeconomy cannot be regulated by a
magic wand.'

FT  02 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Strong argument for relaxed
management style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr GEORGE FIELDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The psychological research published in the FT (Recruitment, October
27) on problem-solving styles indicated that a goal-orientated or telic
approach is less productive than an interest-orientated or paratelic
approach. This finding is fascinating indeed and, if confirmed by other
studies, has important implications both for managers and for management
training.
It is a powerful argument for relaxed management styles which encourage
staff to follow their own insights and intuitions, at least for tasks which
involve problem-solving. Such an approach is also likely to reduce
psychological strain in staff which, in turn, should promote their physical
and psychological well-being.
So much then for the dogged Thatcherite influence upon management. In this
view external pressure was seen as the principal means of promoting British
economic productivity; what an appalling waste that may have turned out to
be. Of course, the notion that people can be brow-beaten into world-class
performance always lacked credibility.

answer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JEREMY HALE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader 'Monetarism in retreat' was confused. If monetarism really
lives on in Paris, as you claim, French interest rates should now be much
lower. The authorities' broad money aggregate, M3, continues to grow very
slowly (0.7 per cent year on year in August) and thus to undershoot targets
(4-6.5 per cent). Predictably, nominal gross domestic product growth is also
now close to zero. Why are short-term interest rates still above 6 per cent,
or 3.5-4 per cent in real terms? Because the French authorities believe not
in monetarism but, even now, in an exchange rate target.
Further evidence of the dangers of targeting exchange rates, not of
monetarism, n'est-ce pas?

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr LAURENS VAN DEN MUYZENBERG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial 'Monetarism in retreat' (October 30/31) states: 'France
is defiantly refusing to enter the pro-growth era. It has refused the
significant cut in interest rates that France's low inflation rate allows.'
This is a statement typical of a continuous stream of articles in the
British press, with very little resonance on the Continent. Why? The franc
one-year interest rate is 6 to 5 7/8 per cent as compared with sterling 5
1/2 to 5 7/16 per cent. A difference of  1/2 - 1/8 percentage point. This
result has been achieved by keeping the franc owners almost 20 per cent
wealthier than the sterling owners.
The other side of the ocean, David Mullins, vice-chairman of the US Federal
Reserve, said last week: 'I think you have to be very careful with rapid
short-term rate cuts. There is a great risk that long rates react in the
opposite way.'
The French, English and German unemployment problems are not caused by high
interest rates, but by the combination of business globalisation and lack of
European competitiveness and flexibility. The jobs that have disappeared
will not come back. They have migrated to other countries.
The container and the fax, which make it possible to carry out any task
where best value for money is delivered, will not disappear. Investments
will only be made, and so jobs created, when there is much greater
flexibility in increasing and decreasing company size, working hours,
compensation, geographical mobility, acceptance of new technologies and work
practices, etc.
This flexibility, combined with stable currencies and entrepreneurial
enthusiasm, can solve the unemployment problems, but not another short-term
interest rate cut, in France or in the UK. That is a commonly held view on
the other side of the Channel.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Eyebrows may indeed be raised in Downing Street and elsewhere at the
remuneration received by Mr Alamouti, head of arbitrage trading at Tokai
Bank in London ('Arbitrage dealer defies recession to earn Pounds 9m',
October 27). However, before the cynics get into a lather, it is worth
considering what benefits, if any, Mr Alamouti contributes to the British
economy.
First, there is the obvious point that he has highly transportable skills
and could, with a phone and Reuters screen, practise his chosen trade in New
York, Frankfurt, Paris or Tokyo pretty much as easily as he can in London.
The fact that he works here not only helps the City in maintaining its
pre-eminent position in the global financial markets but also benefits the
Exchequer not immaterially. His income tax bill and Tokai's increased
corporation tax liability no doubt add up to a tidy sum.
Second, arbitrage is itself an economically important activity. Without it,
price imperfections and illiquidity would disadvantage market users and make
the process of risk transfer less efficient. As the layers of mystery behind
financial derivatives are stripped away, Mr Alamouti will find increased
knowledge and competition making arbitrage less profitable and the markets
more efficient. But by then, no doubt, he will either have retired or moved
on. In the meantime we need more, not fewer, Alamoutis.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Unit trust buying practice at heart
of system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From SHEILA A NICOLL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Landman (Letters, October 26) has misunderstood the roles both of
unit trust managers and of stockbrokers and marketmakers in running
principal positions.
Far from being punished, as he suggests, such behaviour is at the heart of
the trading system at the London Stock Exchange and many other financial
markets, where liquidity is provided by firms which are willing to take a
risk using their professional judgment of the market and buying and selling
for their own account.
When unit trust managers take principal positions (which they have to do,
for example, if they are to deal on a historic basis, a service appreciated
by many private investors), the interests of investors are fully
safeguarded.
The price which an investor pays for units or receives for selling them is
carefully regulated through detailed pricing rules drawn up and imposed by
the regulatory authorities. The price will be within the same parameters
regardless of whether units are created or cancelled with the trustee or the
manager sells on units which have previously been sold back to him.
The independent corporate trustee who must be authorised under the Financial
Services Act 1986 holds the unitholders' assets and has a responsibility to
ensure that investors' interests are kept paramount.
If there is a fall in the market, the manager takes a loss and if he sells,
the price he receives is again calculated according to the pricing
regulations: he will receive the cancellation price applicable at that time.
Investors are unaffected.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Arts: A prize commitment to painting / Review of the 18th
John Moores exhibition at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite all the brouhaha about the Turner Prize, the televised dinner,
speeches and fuss with envelopes, it is still the John Moores Liverpool
Exhibition that artists want to win. Perhaps this is because the John Moores
was the first of the open submission prize exhibitions; and the peculiar
affection in which this competition is held reflects the late Sir John's
personal enthusiasm and support for it over many years following its
creation in 1957.
Of course there will be grumbles and speculations about the collective
interests and judgments of the jury, and disappointed incredulity
afterwards, as much at failure to get in as at the disposition of the
awards. But the Moores is the talking point among artists, who show a degree
of interest and involvement much greater than they do for the Turner Prize.
Sir John Moores' recent death at 97 has naturally cast this exhibition, the
18th, as his memorial, while throwing some doubt on its future. The doubt
was quickly put to rest, however, when the Moores family said it would
continue to support the exhibition in principle. Although the form might
change, this is good news. The Moores has often modified itself in any case,
and its current limitation to paintings and but the lowest of reliefs is a
long-standing grief and irritation to sculptors. I am firmly on the side of
the painters and see little need for change. The commitment to painting in
particular, in a time when it seems to be increasingly discounted by the
orthodox apologists and promoters of the institutional avant-garde, is its
greatest strength.
In an intriguing essay in the catalogue, Andrew Brighton, one of this year's
jurors, dilates upon the ever-shifting relationship that the Moores has
enjoyed with its critics. It began 36 years ago as an opportunity for the
more advanced artists, who were at that time excluded by the Royal Academy,
to set themselves against their peers. Ironically, it has now become the one
serious opportunity to remind the avant-garde itself of one of the principal
disciplines in the great tradition of art, putting paint on canvas.
There is nothing of controversy to this year's Moores, nothing of the
conceptual bias or feminist agenda of last time or the time before. And it
is precisely its disengagement, its lack of controversy that makes it
useful. It is a straightforward survey of current British painting, the 54
works that the jury considered the best of the 2,013 submitted. There are,
in proportion, more figurative paintings than I can remember, and inevitably
particular inclusions, indeed prize-winners, that I find inexplicable. But
overall the emphasis is placed, as it should be, on good painting of
whatever kind.
Little in this exhibition is objective, that is derived from direct
observation of the real and visible world. Sarah Raphael's small portrait of
a friend, Joshua, is the outstanding example of that sort and certainly
deserved a prize. There is no landscape or interior that is not to some
extent photo-based in its reference (Paul Winstanley, Geoff Stalker, Martin
Greenland), or schematic (Adrian Berg, Adrian Henri). Perhaps this is
nothing more than fair reflection of the submission, but, by my own
experience as juror on the Moores, I doubt it.
The first prize of Pounds 20,000 has gone unexceptionally to Peter Doig for
his large and characteristically elegant and mannered amplification of a
photograph of a man standing on ice - or perhaps in a puddle - in a winter
forest landscape. But the best of the painting is, perversely, abstract,
notably Trevor Sutton's minimal roundel; a low relief panel in white and
gold that is as physical as it is seductive, by Stephen Buckley, a former
prize-winner; and Simon Callery's large, allusive, exquisitely reticent
canvas worked in horizontal bands of pink and grey, red and violet. Best of
all is Michael Ginsborg's sharply cursive, linear image, as taut as a
carriage spring, pale red on paler pink and orange. I would have given it
the prize.
Am I damning this Moores with faint praise? Not at all. 'Has the Moores
become an exhibition of, perhaps, relatively sophisticated, consensual (sic)
painting?' asks Mr Brighton. 'Or can it still within its limitations . . .
attract . . . work which is part of the tradition of modern art? Which is
the case and which desirable seems to me the general issue . . . now for
critics to address.' This seems to miss the point. I only wish that the
Moores would embrace a wider scope to take in that more objective strain,
worked direct from model or landscape that sustained Cezanne, Matisse,
Giacometti, Balthus, Freud. Even so, by its very sophistication, and the
professional consensus it celebrates, the Moores still and most effectively
displays work that is indeed truly 'part of the tradition of modern art'.
John Moores Liverpool Exhibition 18: Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, until
January 23.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Arts: Down but not out - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After years of steady growth, expenditure on arts sponsorship came to a halt
in 1992-93. Against the odds it had risen by an impressive 14 per cent in
1991-92, to Pounds 64.4m, encouraging the belief that somehow sponsorship
was recession proof. But when the Association for Business Sponsorship of
the Arts announces the most recent figures later this week they will show a
fall, not a mammoth fall, but enough to force the sponsorship industry to
reassess its approach.
The smaller, regional, first-time sponsors are still joining up with
enthusiasm, but the large commitments from the major traditional sponsors
are harder to find.
                        *        *        *
On cue, two of the great British arts sponsorships, the Royal Insurance
support for the Royal Shakespeare Company, and the Digital Dance Awards come
to an end next month.
Royal Insurance pumped Pounds 3.5m into the RSC over six years and both
sides gained tremendously from the link. The RSC is now seeking a similar
big backer. In the meantime it is having some success finding sponsors for
individual new productions. Unilever subsidiaries, Lever Bros and Van den
Bergh's, will put their brand names behind the new Macbeth opening in
December, and there is a first-time sponsor, JBA International, a
Stratford-based computer company, for the new Moby Dick. This has attracted
a top-up grant from the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme administered
by ABSA.
The RSC still has one long-term admirer in English Estates, which has given
Pounds 200,000 towards the small venue tour of Julius Caesar, currently on
the road. But next year English Estates disappears into the Urban
Regeneration Agency and no one knows whether it will continue its
imaginative approach of bringing the arts to culturally starved areas of the
country.
The RSC has one big attraction for sponsors. It has an enthusiastic chairman
in the Prince of Wales. On Thursday night its main sponsors and some
prospective friends were invited to Buckingham Palace for a Shakespearean
soiree.
Although dropping the Digital Dance Awards, Digital Equipment Corporation,
the computer company, is sticking with sponsorship, and with dance. In six
years it invested Pounds 700,000 in 70 new dance works. It now feels that
dance, and dancers, are better able to stand on their own feet. However, it
is keeping the Pounds 30,000 Premier Award for an individual, the biggest
cash sum in the field, and is spending a further Pounds 180,000 in 1994 on
training and the development of dance projects for larger venues. So the
investment in dance has actually increased.
At the international level, Digital is reorganising. Its long-term support
for the European Community Youth Orchestra has come to an end, but a future
global sponsorship will not be decided upon for a year or so, by which time
Digital's financial position should have improved.
                        *        *        *
Next week, Lloyds Bank will announce a Pounds 500,000-a-year sponsorship in
the film area. The bank, which in 1994 will spend over Pounds 2m in
sponsorship, believes that film is an under-exploited art form. It already
backs the Lloyds Challenge for young scriptwriters and directors.
If fashion counts as art then Lloyds rivals BT as the leading British
sponsor of the arts. Along with its involvement in film and fashion it also
supports the Young Musician of the Year contest, which will fill BBC screens
again next spring. Apart from a bias towards youth all its links have one
thing in common: they attract television coverage. Next year, Lloyds is
expecting more than 15 hours of prime-time television to be devoted to
events it supports.
                        *        *        *
Substantial one-off sponsorships of costly new opera or ballet productions
are rare these days, but PowerGen came up with Pounds 110,000 for Sylvia,
David Bintley's new work for the Birmingham Royal Ballet, which opened last
week. But even here the sponsor is being hard-headed. If the ballet is a
success, and stays in the BRB repertoire, PowerGen will raise its support to
Pounds 150,000. Fortunately for BRB, the initial reaction was favourable.
                        *        *        *
Two unusual new sponsors are Jigsaw, the fashion retailers, and Elisabeth
the Chef. Jigsaw is sponsoring a tour of a new dance work by the Harlemation
Dance Company choreographed by Bunty Matthias. The Company will visit
regional towns where Jigsaw has shops; and the dancers' costumes were
designed by Maria Cornejo, a Jigsaw consultant.
Elisabeth the Chef is a Leamington Spa based supplier of bakery products to
supermarkets. One of its largest clients is Sainsbury, and inspired by the
sponsorship programme of its important customer, it has funded a Pounds
5,000 postgraduate art student award. The winner of the New Art Award will
be announced on Wednesday.
                        *        *        *
Beck's, the brewers, is one of a growing number of sponsors that want to be
associated with the avant-garde. (It is a myth that sponsors only support
the tried and tested: many companies think they can quickly acquire a
go-ahead image if they back the experimental.) Beck's latest commitment, a
mummified concrete house constructed by conceptualist Rachel Whiteread in
East London, was unveiled last Monday. It will stand for just a few weeks.
Working with Artangel, an organisation devoted to placing art in unorthodox
settings, Beck's will contribute Pounds 60,000 over three years to create an
annual landscaped creation, built to disappear.
                        *        *        *
Sponsorship may be faltering in the UK but there is still plenty of
potential for international connections. The Orchestra of the Age of
Enlightenment embarks in February on its first European tour, thanks to
Pounds 50,000 from Goldman Sachs, which, as a first-time sponsor, should
attract a substantial uplift from the BSIS. The American-owned bank wants to
show off its European credentials.
Conversely, Banco Santander, along with the Royal Bank of Scotland, is
generously backing the Spanish Arts Festival in London next spring. Between
them they are putting almost Pounds 300,000 into the Festival, helped by a
Pounds 35,000 BSIS grant for the Banco.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Arts: Garbarek at his best - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What with World Cup soccer wins, his country's stock exchange riding at a
three-year high and the diplomatic coup in bringing the PLO and Israelis to
a peace accord, you would think that Norway's Jan Garbarek would cheer up a
bit. His most recent album Twelve Moons (ECM 519 500-2), which set the
searing vocals of folk singing against his own plaintive reeds, has heaped
success on success and yet he remains an old gloomy boots.
This was the gist of a conversation overheard at the Festival Hall last week
mid-way through the saxophonist's chilly set. But in this marvellous small
group with sidemen Rainer Bruninghaus (keyboards), Eberhard Weber (bass),
and Marilyn Mazur (percussion), the ascetic Garbarek is at his atmospheric
best. Sparse arrangements of hypnotising melodies are worked up into
landscapes of uniquely north European complexion. Where the accompaniment is
bleak, the soloists scorch a path through. The ensemble playing is both
elemental and transcendental.
Garbarek's band balances perfectly in an unorthodox way. Denmark-born
Marilyn Mazur stands behind a kit which combines traditional drums with a
hanging garden of exotic shakers and bells. In contrast to this natural
rhythm, at the other end of the stage Bruninghaus creates a fine synth mist
embedded with twinkling notes. Centre stage and alongside Garbarek, Weber at
the electron-bass (a hybrid of upright fiddle and bass guitar with a delay
pedal) weaves plangent lines with the bow in sympathy with Garbarek's
keening soprano.
But the second set brought a new, airborne tenor sound from the leader.
Enlivened by Mazur's brilliant, dervish-like performance behind the shakers
and more angular, discordant phrasing from Weber, Garbarek took off, quoting
Gilberto and leading the group out of the fog and into an almost jolly
Norwegian funk - if such a thing is possible.

Writer Michael Frayn is a great fan of Prague and he manages to excite our
interest in the city in Omnibus: Magic Lantern (BBC 1, 10.20). The Czech
capital has escaped extensive war damage, and Communist poverty has further
hindered re-development.
The result is a city that is an architect's dream, with every historical
period well represented from the baroque to art nouveau.
More wholesome diversion is First Tuesday (ITV, 10.40). Johnny Kingdom is a
countryman who has spent his life on Exmoor. But he is modern enough to own
a video camera and has built up his record of the region. It will be a
treasure trove for a late 21st century historian.
This is National Library Week and Channel 4 is doing its bit with short
dramas from five works of fiction, Blow Your Mind (8.00). If you enjoy your
brief taster you will be directed to the local library for more. Among the
authors included are James Joyce and Edgar Allen Poe.
Big film of the night is that classic of Grand Guignol, Whatever happened to
Baby Jane? (BBC1, 11.20), with Bette Davis and Joan Crawford.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Arts: Andsnes's Grieg - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sunday afternoon's piano recital by Leif Ove Andsnes formed a coda to the
Barbican's weekend celebration of the Grieg 150th anniversary. The
23-year-old Norwegian had launched this on Friday, playing the original
version of Grieg's Piano Concerto, and here the composer was represented as
centrepiece of the programme.
Grieg was above all a master of small-scale forms, and Andsnes offered a
string of miniatures - the fourth Albumblatte and six of the Lyric Pieces.
One had to admire him for playing pieces some might regard as too
insubstantial for a major recital. Simple only on the surface, they require
fluent technique to be brought off as enchantingly as they were here.
Andsnes's selection proved very satisfying, like a series of delicate
water-colours. He proved sensitive to their varying moods and vivid
characterisation, capturing his country's folklore in the Hardanger fiddlers
of the Albumblatte, and the humour in the 'March of the Trolls'. Other
highlights were a glistening 'Butterfly', the impressionistic
'Bell-ringing', and the touching simplicity of 'At Home'. Where other
pianists might have turned heavy-handed, he maintained an easy dexterity,
investing quieter dynamics with colours of extraordinary subtlety.
To leave the audience in no doubt of his virtuoso credentials, Andsnes
framed his Grieg with Liszt and Chopin. He opened with a bravura account of
the former's second Ballade, cogently argued, but Andsnes showed his serious
intent best of all in an elegant performance of the Chopin Third Sonata -
the Largo radiant, the outer movements majestic yet measured with an inward
calm which spoke of the interpreter's astonishing maturity.
Although the Grieg remained longest in the memory, this was a well-balanced
recital. An all-Grieg programme would have been too obvious, and this
versatile young Norwegian is right to avoid being typecast so early in his
career.

FT  02 NOV 93 / People: Crawford moves up at Bull UK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The vacancy at the top of Bull UK and Ireland caused by the elevation of
George McNeil to the presidency of Bull Europe has been filled by Philip
Crawford, formerly managing director of the UK company's services
operations.
Crawford, 41, represents the new face of Bull as the French computer
manufacturer struggles to restore growth and profitability. He is young even
by computer industry standards and says he has 'a lot of energy'.
For the past five and a half years he has been developing Bull's services
business, now seen as a principal plank in the company's strategy. Starting
from virtually nothing, he built it up to a Pounds 30m business this year
out of the UK company's total turnover of about Pounds 200m. He sits on
Bull's worldwide council for services strategy.
Crawford trained as a metallurgist at Sheffield Polytechnic and worked
initially at GKN Contractors in the US where he learned about manufacturing
automation. He moved into the computer industry as a manufacturing
consultant with the then leading software house Management Science America,
now absorbed into Dun &amp; Bradstreet Software.
'Bull', he says drily, 'is not short of challenge', but he speaks warmly of
the freedom the company allows for local managers to make their own
decisions. Whether this is likely to continue under new chairman Jean-Marie
Descarpentries is something he will learn shortly when the two have their
first meeting.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Bates, who has been sales and marketing director of the Savoy group of
hotels and restaurants for the past five years, is moving next month to do
the job with the same title at Mount Charlotte Thistle Hotels.
To those who might be puzzled by the move and think the Savoy is about as
grand as you can get, Bates' riposte is that the Savoy has just six hotels
and an annual turnover of Pounds 75m; Mount Charlotte Thistle, meanwhile,
had a turnover in 1992 of Pounds 217m and 112 hotels. 'It's a much bigger
job and therefore a great challenge,' he says.
Mount Charlotte, which is 70 per cent owned by Brierley Investments of New
Zealand, could be floated in the next couple of years. Bates' previous
experience with the privatisation of Gleneagles Hotels in Scotland and the
flotation of the Mandarin Oriental Hotels in Hong Kong could come in handy.
Bates, 42, is also keen to scotch rumours that his move is in any way linked
to the enthusiasm Rocco Forte has expressed in the past for his Forte group
to acquire the Savoy.
Peter Haigh, currently regional director of sales and marketing UK and
Ireland for Marriott Hotels and Resorts, takes over from Bates. Haigh, 45,
was with Marriott for 14 years, working in both the UK and US and has been
responsible for sales and marketing throughout Europe, the Middle East and
Africa.
Bates also happens to be a director of Isis, an executive search agency
specialising in the hospitality and travel industry, a connection which came
in handy when it was time to look for his successor. Haigh was recruited
through Isis, although Bates himself landed his new job 'after an invitation
to breakfast', he says.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Support for the small
firm - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The role of trade associations and similar small-firm support bodies is
discussed in a 37-page booklet* which has just become available.
Written by Ray Parr, previously manager of the Department of Trade and
Industry's Small Firms Information Centre in the Midlands and now a
volunteer counsellor in a local enterprise agency, it sets out to help
readers choose the most appropriate representative organisation. It details
the cost of membership as well as listing the services provided.
Parr believes the value of support is often overlooked.
'All too often attention is concentrated on that essential and often
necessary trip to the accountant, bank manager and solicitor, but that
should not obscure the potential of a fourth leg to the support framework.'
*'Any other Body' is published as a private venture, price Pounds 2.95. It

FT  02 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Changing terms for
commercial agents - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Businesses which use commercial agents have been giving them notice to avoid
the impact of European Community regulations.
The regulations, which cover the legal relationship between the parties and
come into effect on January 1, generally strengthen the position of agents.
In particular they provide for compensation where an agreement is terminated
by the principal other than for breach of contract (for fuller discussion
see FT Growing Business page, 27 July).
Stephen Sidkin, of London solicitors Fox Williams, reports that some
manufacturers and suppliers are reappointing their agents as distributors or
franchisees, buying and selling goods for their own accounts. Others are
offering them direct employment.
'In brief they are taking on liability as employers as opposed to facing the
quasi-employee benefits which agents will soon enjoy.'
The Department of Trade and Industry issued a draft compliance cost
assessment in September which estimated that annual compensation costs could
be anything between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 80,000 per sales force.
Sidkin points out that unless the notice brings the contract to an end on or
before 31 December, companies will have to honour their existing terms as
well as comply with the new regulations.

from single market - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European single market appears to have been a non-event for most small
and medium-sized UK manufacturing businesses. According to Pera
International, the management and technology consultant, 70 per cent of
those interviewed for a survey* said they had derived no business benefits
since borders were formally removed on 1 January 1993.
The research demonstrates that British reluctance to exploit new
opportunities stems from continued export difficulties, additional expenses
and the effects of the recession. Less than half of all UK respondents found
transportation or paperwork easier since the start of this year; one quarter
stressed the difficulty of meeting new EC technical quality standards.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): A challenge to the
chancellor / A look at proposals for a private-sector, long-term credit
institution in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Medium-sized UK companies have long yearned for the sort of secure,
long-term finance available to Germany's Mittelstand. If proposals presented
by the Small Business Bureau to Cabinet ministers ahead of this month's
Budget are accepted, they may soon get it.
The idea is for the creation of an independent, private-sector funded,
long-term credit institution similar to Germany's Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau (KFW), which would disburse fixed-rate, seven-year loans.
This so-called Enterprise Fund, its supporters claim, would provide funds
for expansion on substantially easier terms than anything currently
available to UK small and medium-sized manufacturing firms.
Even if the proposal does not make it to Kenneth Clarke's dispatch box - and
most pre-Budget ideas floated by the small business lobby do not - the idea
is being studied as part of the review of business financing being
undertaken by Anthony Nelson, the Treasury economic secretary.
The Enterprise Fund is the creation of Peter Hanratty and Mark Gheerbrant*,
bankers at Industrial Bank of Japan International, and is one of five
proposals** which will be announced by the Small Business Bureau this week.
The new institution would issue 10-year eurobonds guaranteed by the UK
government. The authors envisage an initial Pounds 2bn being raised over
five years, a figure which seems less ambitious set beside the Pounds 7bn
lent by the KFW in Germany in 1991.
The fund would lend to companies introduced by UK commercial lending
institutions, which would jointly administer the scheme. The draft proposal
suggests banks would start by taking 25 per cent of the credit risk; the
fund, and ultimately the government at the time the bonds were repaid, would
bear the remaining 75 per cent.
The authors say banks would be encouraged to approach the fund because
clients would be pressing for access to seven-year, fixed-rate money
(probably at an all-in cost of about 10 per cent after a 330-basis point
profit for the bank).
Established businesses with sales of at least Pounds 3m and up to Pounds 50m
would be the target, effectively positioning the Enterprise Fund above the
cut-off level for the government's Loan Guarantee Scheme.
Because the fund is a private-sector institution, the authors believe the
government's guarantee would not affect the size of the PSBR, a concern that
torpedoed proposals for a long-term credit institution two years ago. It is
far from clear, though, that this hurdle has been overcome.
The key attraction of the proposed plan is that it would reduce one
important area of risk in the expansion of a business - the risk of
commercial banks withdrawing credit. Barry Baldwin, head of the Small
Business Bureau policy unit, says many businessmen decide not to invest for
expansion because bank covenants are too extensive.
They do not allow for quite normal deterioration in financial ratios at
times when either the trade or economic cycle has turned down.
Enterprise Fund money would be structured, the authors say, with the minimum
of onerous covenants. Only in exceptional circumstances would loans become
repayable before maturity.
Academics have welcomed the initiative. They argue the UK has suffered from
the absence of a KFW or Japan's three long-term credit institutions, which
played a big role in post-war economic reconstruction.
But there could be considerable resistance from the commercial banks,
without whose co-operation the fund would get nowhere. Crucially, they would
need to be convinced the new institution could work alongside them and would
not compete for business.
Given the chequered history of the Loan Guarantee Scheme, where default
rates have been relatively high, the government would also need to be
persuaded it is not being asked to guarantee what are effectively unbankable
propositions.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Happy to be cut down to
size

Sean Titterington confides that his friends thought him adventurous, if not
foolhardy, when he joined a small, impecunious company after 19 years with a
UK clearing bank. When he opted for redundancy from the Royal Bank of
Scotland, rather than relocate, he had been looking for an employer of a
similar size.
Titterington, a marketing manager, assumed his temperament and experience
would be better suited to a big company.
One hundred failed applications later he welcomed the opportunity to join
Laser Grafix, a small Hertfordshire-based company employing 16 people. Today
he admits those previous assumptions were incorrect ones. Although he gets
frustrated at times, particularly over the lack of formal structure, he
enjoys the challenge of a business that has to respond quickly to changing
customer tastes.
Titterington is one of the thousands of managers who have successfully moved
from a big company to a much smaller one. But according to Oliver Johnston,
national campaign leader for economic development at the Industrial Society,
most people making the transition can benefit from professional training.
There are many sources of such expertise - business schools, for example -
but one of the most recent is a scheme called Connect for Growth funded by
London's Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) and run by Enterprise
Partnership, a London-based training and management consultancy.
The scheme matches the skills of professionals and managers who have been
unemployed for six months with the needs of small companies. After two weeks
of training, managers are hired on short-term contracts and may be offered
full-time employment at the end of the placement. Previous courses have had
success rates of over 50 per cent.
Linda Stoker, managing director of Dow-Stoker, a small business which
provides training courses including ones for redundant executives, says:
'I've hired a few people who had worked in big companies and some have
failed. They have not been able to roll up their sleeves. We had one person
who when we moved to new offices over a weekend was conspicuous by her
absence. She was also very status conscious and suggested that all the
parking spaces in the new offices went to managers. We don't do that sort of
thing.'
Managers making the move should be prepared to leave behind not only the
perks but also many of the qualities that made them successful in a big
company, according to the Industrial Society. 'An individual may have had up
to a 10-year time-frame for planning and been good at it,' observes Johnson.
'In a small business decisions may have to be taken in 10 minutes.'
Some managers, meanwhile, feel insecure in organisations where there may not
be formal performance assessment. Geoffrey Burn, a former director of
information systems with a large retailing organisation, says: 'In my old
company I knew exactly where I was. We had clearly defined objectives and
formal systems of appraisal. In my new company we have none of that. One can
feel insecure.'
The suspicion may be mutual. Owner-managers are often alarmed by
professional managers, says Mike Anyon, who now works as sales director with
RS Colour, a Manchester-based printing company employing 70 people. He used
to work for Du Pont and Philips Electronics. 'It has to be a two-way
learning process. But I am getting a lot of satisfaction from teaching a
very enthusiastic sales force the best practice in the business.'

FT  02 NOV 93 / Technology: Science turns to ancient diets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Archaeologists and water scientists are joining forces to identify the diet
and diseases of people living thousands of years ago, by studying their
semi-fossilised faeces.
The Institute of Archaeology at University College, London, is working with
Thames Water's Spencer House laboratory in Reading to develop the new gene
amplification technique of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for use on
'paleo-faeces'.
According to Mark Spigelman of the Institute of Archaeology, these are quite
common in dry parts of the world.
'In the southwestern US, there are cave-fulls of the stuff,' he says. 'My
oldest specimen is from a 19,000-year-old campsite in Egypt.'
Spigelman, who has already used PCR to find traces of tuberculosis bacteria
in ancient skeletons, believes that paleo-faeces contain enough surviving
genetic material (DNA) to be detected by the technique.
He hopes to identify fragments of genes both from disease-causing bacteria
and from the plants and animals in the ancient diet.
Colin Fricker, Thames Water microbiology manager, has an obvious
professional interest in identifying traces of human faeces, in order to
test water quality.
'We have been developing new methods of detecting E. coli, a bacterium found
in faeces, for some time, so it was an incentive to improve the sensitivity
and accuracy of these tests,' he says.
The latest PCR test for E. coli, developed by Thames Water, picks out a
bacterial gene for an enzyme called beta-glucuronidase.
The scientists plan first to look for this gene in ancient faeces and then
move on to others.
Recent experiments have shown that the DNA molecule is far more robust than
scientists had imagined a decade or so ago.
PCR has recently been used to extract and amplify traces of genetic material
from insects trapped in amber more than 100m years old.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Technology: Power to the people - The UK's National Grid has
just invested in a sophisticated control network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sight of Chris Waddle missing a vital penalty at a World Cup soccer
semi-final three years ago may not appear to have much to do with
electricity use, but the behaviour of television viewers after England lost
to Germany led to a record surge of power that night.
The management of power demand is a complex task. To ensure it continues to
be handled smoothly, from times of normal use to emergencies such as
hurricanes, the National Grid - which distributes electricity in England and
Wales - has spent Pounds 32m on a computerised energy management system it
believes is the biggest and most modern in the world.
Electricity demand in the area covered by the National Grid can vary between
16,000 megawatts early on a summer morning to nearly 48,000 MW on a very
cold winter evening. Power consumption also rises sharply after popular TV
soap operas or blockbuster films. Viewers get up after a long evening's
viewing, switch on the lights and put on the kettle for a cup of tea.
This is what happened after Waddle and his team-mate missed the deciding
penalties at the end of one of the most exciting matches of the
championship, televised from Italy. Electricity use briefly shot up by as
much as 2,800 MW after the game, equivalent to the output of a very large
power station.
On an average day, enough electricity is used in England and Wales to keep
10m kettles boiling round the clock; in winter, the equivalent is 17m. This
is what the National Grid's new system, formally opened last month after 100
days in faultless operation, is designed to manage. From the new control
centre at Wokingham, Surrey, with the help of four area centres in St
Albans, Birmingham, Leeds and Bristol, electricity is routed around the
7,000km of the country's transmission routes.
By spending some Pounds 80m on its new control network (including the energy
management system), the National Grid has streamlined its activities and
closed two regional sites at Manchester and East Grinstead. It now has an
array of new computers and sophisticated software capable of evolving in
line with future advances in technology.
The previous system dated from 1970, when the national control centre was at
London's Park Street, south of the River Thames. Its Argos computers made by
Ferranti of the UK - now the subject of a humiliating 1p a share bid from
General Electric Company of the UK - were kept running until earlier this
year, although new equipment was also added over the past two decades.
'In the early 1980s, we realised we needed to get to the next level of
technology,' says John Tomlinson, system control manager. After going out to
tender, National Grid narrowed the choice down to Ferranti and
Minnesota-based Empros Power Systems Control, then owned by Control Data of
the US but now part of Siemens, the German industrial group.
Having decided on Empros, which has more than 400 energy systems installed
around the world, the National Grid went to great lengths to ensure its
systems would be as error-free as possible. It subjected the hardware and
software to 14 different audits each. Testing was so rigorous that the test
plans took up 45 feet of paper.
As a result, the company believes it has a system which is as reliable as it
is possible to obtain. Roger Hunter, EMS project manager, is suitably
cautious, however, when he says: 'As far as we know, at the present time,
there are no errors.' The system was also delivered on time and within
budget, a rarity for such big computer projects.
The National Grid went to such lengths to ensure both quality and robustness
because it wanted a system which could do much more than its previous one.
The Empros system, with its host of computers, workstations, display units
and 4m lines of software code (capable of running 46 applications and 40,000
displays) is not just designed to switch energy around the grid system,
including the import of power from Scotland (where distribution is handled
by the generating companies) and France. It also has a far greater capacity
to deal with emergencies such as freak storms or terrorist bombs.
To ensure the utmost degree of fail-safe security, each centre has three big
Cyber computers from Control Data for normal, stand-by and emergency use. If
a disaster causes the Wokingham centre to go down, national control can be
switched to St Albans which controls the London region.
Here, there is a fourth Cyber, normally used for training - faults such as
those caused by the 1981 blizzards have been modelled into the simulator
with frightening realism - but which can be switched to run the whole grid.
'You can't have a day off while you put something right,' says Tomlinson.
In the old system, this degree of integration did not exist. Nor was it able
to perform advanced applications at a level far beyond the normal ones of
monitoring power flows, voltage levels and other daily functions.
With the Empros equipment, says Hunter, the grid system can be subjected to
'limits and capabilities never before possible.' Readouts on any aspect of
the grid system can be obtained in seconds rather than minutes; 22,000
separate items of information are checked every five seconds.
This vast flow of data is needed not only to update the rate of daily power
flows from the privatised energy groups to the regional electricity
companies (who own the National Grid), but also to deal with the unexpected.
'This system can handle the most onerous of power station conditions,' adds
Hunter. The Empros system was tested to see how it would stand up to all
types of use from normal demand to the impact of lightning strikes and
hurricanes.
Now its system is in operation, the National Grid is keen to work with
Empros and Siemens, on foreign contracts. 'The whole market place is worth
nearly Dollars 1bn (Pounds 714m),' says Tim Kenealy, general manager of
Siemens Empros, which has a share of around 20 per cent. He sees strong
possibilities in eastern Europe and other developing areas, despite scarce
funds, as well as in industrialised countries wanting to update electricity
distribution.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Technology: The world's data at your fingertips - A new a
software system which will aid analysts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1990, China spent Dollars 2m (Pounds 1.4m) on US motor vehicles. The
figure for this year totals as much as Dollars 230m for the first six months
alone.
US vehicle sales have been rising throughout Asia. Between January and June,
sales increased in Japan by 4 per cent over the same period of 1992. In
Taiwan, they jumped by 11.4 per cent, but in Hong Kong they soared by 543.7
per cent.
These trends were gleaned from US Commerce Department data. Normally, they
would take weeks to spot, but a new computer software system called World
Trade Atlas now brings the figures to trade analysts and exporters in
seconds.
Donald Brasher, president of Global Trade Information Services (GTI) of
Columbia, South Carolina, wrote the program.
As a trade consultant to Thailand and Bangladesh, he saw the need for
increased access to international trade data through computer technology and
improved data for policy decision-making.
One of his clients recently requested information about the US wood trade in
the wake of the spotted owl controversy, which froze logging on many federal
lands. A few seconds of key pushing revealed a 53 per cent increase in the
value of rough wood exports to Japan and one of 56 per cent to China in the
first half of this year, while the volume of exports remained flat. The
conclusion was that price rises, averaging more than 50 per cent, had failed
to depress demand.
The development of CD-Rom technology and subsequent price reductions which
make it available to small entrepreneurs are driving the information
revolution, says Brasher. The World Trade Atlas is a prime example.
'Anyone can publish a CD-Rom,' he says, noting that CD-Rom players are
rapidly becoming standard personal computer peripherals. After six months on
the market, Brasher predicts sales of between Dollars 200,000 and Dollars
300,000 this year.
He has only 15 subscribers, but they are important ones.
They include the US Chamber of Commerce, the American Association of
Exporters and Importers, the International Footwear Association and the
Retail Industry Trade Action Coalition. Their numbers are growing. Brasher
expects to have between 40 and 50 clients by the end of this year and at
least 100-200 by the end of 1994.
GTI is signing leading international distributors to market the program
globally. Next year, he expects to add EC and Japanese trade data to the
program and he may include numbers from Chile and Canada.
Each month, Brasher updates the software from data acquired from US
government computer tapes. It is reorganised and sent to subscribers by
express mail on a CD-Rom disc.
The World Trade Atlas provides information for a three-year time comparison.
By hitting a key, subscribers can: display product and country information;
sort data by market share or percentage change; switch from country to
product sequencing; compare quantity and average unit price data among
countries; shift between export and import data; and check the balance of
trade data for the world and individual countries.
The service is particularly helpful for exporters, Brasher says.
Brasher learned the ways of Commerce Department data production when, as a
young analyst there, he helped to reconcile the differences between US
import statistics and Hong Kong's export figures. Now, the Commerce
Department is his chief competitor. It sells a system which transmits
information electronically. Although it cannot produce trends in seconds
like the World Trade Atlas, it has become more accurate since the
introduction of an automated interface that reduces data entry errors.
The atlas is sold by GTI on a subscription basis for Dollars 4,920 a year
(Dollars 2,880 for educational institutions).

FT  02 NOV 93 / Business and the Law: Light in arbitration's obscure corners
 -A H Hermann examines the Steyn committee's draft bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By A H HERMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
English arbitration law, probably the best system in the world, is far from
perfect. But it is made worse than it need be by the unjustified assumption
of most arbitrators and lawyers that they are bound to follow the
adversarial and predominantly oral procedures developed in the English civil
courts.
This shortcoming, together with other orthodoxies which drive arbitration
away from London to friendlier and cheaper shores, has been tackled in a
draft arbitration bill, drawn up by the Departmental Advisory Committee on
Arbitration, chaired by Sir Johan Steyn, the Appeal Court judge.
If adopted, it would improve English arbitration law and make it more
understandable. With those objectives in mind the committee entrusted the
drafting of the bill to a privately financed group (although it was revised
by a parliamentary draftsman) and instructed it to follow the structure of
Uncitral's Model Law of Arbitration, now followed by the legislation of 16
states.
Many of the substantive provisions of the bill would make English
arbitration law more acceptable internationally. For example, recent
decisions by the Court of Appeal have reversed the orthodox view that
disputes as to whether a contract was invalid from its beginning always fell
outside the arbitration clause. The Appeal Court decisions confirm that the
arbitration clause is separable and survives an invalid contract. To make
sure that this useful advance is not overturned by the House of Lords, the
committee has included a separability clause in the bill.
But the committee was not so daring when it came to the question of the
arbitrator's power to decide that he has jurisdiction to hear a case.
The arbitrator's decision can always be appealed to a court. That is as it
should be. However, the process is greatly abused by parties who wait to see
whether the result of the arbitration is to their liking before launching an
appeal.
A decision, at the end of a long arbitration procedure, that an arbitrator
did not have jurisdiction makes the resolution of a dispute unnecessarily
expensive. For this reason the Uncitral Model Law requires that any appeal
against the arbitrator's exercise of jurisdiction must be made at the
beginning. The committee, however, shrank from following the Model Law on
this.
Explaining this and other aspects of the draft bill at the Freshfields
arbitration lecture recently, Sir Johan, agreeing with a recent Law
Commission report, said he did not see why arbitrators should be obliged to
follow the courts' technical rules of evidence.
This was particularly true in relation to the labelling of technical and
production records as 'hearsay' evidence. Appellants without a proper issue
of law on which to base an appeal often argued that such records were
'hearsay' and not admissible evidence, and that lack of evidence was an
issue of law on which they could base an appeal.
The bill would avoid all this by providing that 'the tribunal shall
determine all procedural matters including the admissibility, relevance,
materiality and weight of any evidence'.
This provision of the bill also ought to do away with the widely held
assumption of English arbitrators and lawyers that they are bound to adopt
the purely adversarial and predominantly oral procedures peculiar to common
law jurisdictions but unknown in half the industrialised world.
Sir Johan said he could see no justification for such an assumption, either
in statutory law or in precedent. If adopted, the bill would make the
English arbitration procedure both faster and cheaper.
The committee did not, however, adopt any recommendation on the crucial
difference between the English and most other arbitration systems which
allow awards to be made according to a perception of fairness or on the
basis of internationally recognised principles of law. The orthodox English
view is that arbitration clauses allowing the arbitrator to go by his
conscience rather than by the law - clauses commonplace in civil law
countries - are invalid in England.
Sir Johan appears to sympathise with the Model Law where it provides that,
if parties agree, the arbitrator may decide according to what appears to him
to be right and fair.
The Court of Appeal moved in this direction and towards the recognition of
the lex mercatoria - the free floating 'international law of merchants' -
when it held in the 1987 Deutsche Schachtbau case that it was not against
public policy to enforce in England a Swiss arbitration award applying
'internationally accepted principles of law governing contractual relations'
 -lex mercatoria for short.
If this is not against public policy in the case of a foreign award, why
should it be against public policy in the case of an English award? To adopt
the Model Law approach would bring English arbitration closer to the
conciliation procedures favoured not only in civil law countries but also in
the Far East and particularly in China, with its fast-growing economy
reaching out for more intensive international trade. The Steyn committee has
not dared go this far - yet.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Business and the Law: Burst of competitive energy - The
European Commission's intervention in plans for a Portuguese power plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission has demonstrated through its intervention at a
Portuguese power plant that it will pursue its ambitions to liberalise the
European electricity market in spite of strong opposition.
Using European competition law, it has restricted to 15 years the period in
which Electricidade de Portugal, the state-owned monopoly, will have
exclusive rights to the electricity that will be produced from a power plant
at Pego which is due to be completed in 1995.
The consortium building the plant, including the UK's National Power, had
expected to have 28 years of exclusivity. It says it will not be hurt by the
change, owing to a compromise deal with the Commission. But the EC
intervention has set a precedent that, say EDP's lawyers, could affect the
funding of future power stations in Europe.
The Pego case comes at a time when the Commission is fighting hard to gain
acceptance for its 'third-party access' plans, which are aimed at
liberalising the European gas and electricity markets. It argues that a free
market in all goods throughout the Community can be achieved only if energy
is traded without restrictions imposed by monopolies. Competition would
force a reduction in electricity prices, it believes.
Most of Europe's electricity companies, and in many cases the states that
own them, have put forward arguments against the Commission's proposals.
Unbridled cross-border competition along the lines proposed by the
Commission, they say, would endanger security of supply. It would also
reduce incentives for companies to invest in transmission systems.
Large sections of the European Parliament agree. MEPs have tabled 324
amendments to the 30 articles in the third-party access directive. If the
directive is adopted, it is likely to be in a much diluted form.
However, the Commission has made it clear that it will use existing law to
ensure that monopolies cannot exert what it considers to be too much
influence over markets. Its chief tool is competition law, including article
85 of the Treaty of Rome prohibiting restrictive agreements which distort
trade between states. The Commission's interpretation is that an exclusive
supply obligation of more than 15 years is restrictive.
Ironically, the Portuguese electricity system is making considerable
progress in introducing competition in energy generation and supply along
the lines the Commission hopes to achieve through its third-party access
directive.
The Pego plant, which may eventually supply about 10 per cent of the
country's electricity, is being built by a consortium that includes National
Power, Electricite de France and Endesa - the UK, French and Spanish
utilities - as well as EDP. Most European countries would baulk at providing
such an inroad for foreign companies.
The Commission therefore apparently tried to avoid damaging Portugal's
progress. It agreed that, after a 15-year exclusive agreement, Tejo Energia,
the company set up by the consortium to operate Pego, will be able to sell
surplus capacity to third parties providing EDP does not need it.
That harms none of the deal's participants, since EDP will be provided with
all the electricity it needs from the plant, and the consortium is likely to
find ready buyers in other countries, including Spain, for any excess.
But such a compromise may not be so easily achieved elsewhere. Countries
without the capital to build the power capacity they need - especially in
southern Europe - may find it more difficult to gain funding from the
private sector. 'Banks want the certainty of a strong revenue stream over a
long period if they are to provide funds. The danger is that the
Commission's approach will restrict the way that finance is raised,' says Mr
David Marks, a partner with McKenna &amp; Co, a law firm that advises on big
power projects including Pego.
The Pego decision and others that follow are likely to prove fertile ground
for merchant banks and the lawyers.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Business and the Law: Employers must justify unequal pay -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRICK COURT CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice ruled last week that the equal pay provisions
of the EC treaty require employers to demonstrate an objective justification
of the existence of appreciable differences in pay between male and female
workers doing work of equal value.
The Court's ruling was made in a case referred by the English Appeal Court
involving a female speech therapist, who brought an action against her
employers for sex discrimination.
Mrs Pamela Enderby claimed that her pay, in a profession that is
overwhelmingly staffed by women, was less than that for members of
comparable professions, such as clinical psychologists or principal
pharmacists, which are largely staffed by men.
The European Court of Justice was first asked whether employers were bound
under the EC treaty provisions to justify objectively differences in pay
such as those which had occurred in this case.
The Court said that, although normally the onus of proving alleged facts in
support of a claim lay with the claimant, the burden should shift when it
was necessary to avoid depriving workers, who appeared to be victims of
discrimination, of any effective means of enforcing their rights to equal
pay.
It then said that, in spite of the fact that the circumstances of the
present case did not constitute de facto discrimination, they did constitute
a prima facie case of discrimination.
Given that workers would be unable to enforce their rights to equal pay
before national courts if evidence of a prima facie case of discrimination
did not shift the burden to the employer of showing that the difference was
not in fact discriminatory, the Court ruled that, in circumstances such as
those of the present case, it was for the employer to show that an objective
justification existed for the difference in pay.
The Court was also asked whether it was sufficient justification for the
difference in pay if the rates of pay for the jobs in question had been
decided by collective bargaining processes. It said the fact that rates of
pay had been decided by such processes did not preclude a finding of prima
facie discrimination, where the results of the collective bargaining showed
that two groups with the same employer and the same trade union were treated
differently.
The third question asked by the English Appeal Court was whether or to what
extent the fact that the differences in pay were attributable to a shortage
of candidates for one job and the need to attract them by higher salaries
could serve as objective justification for the pay differential.
The Court said that such a finding of fact was for the national court.
However, it made it clear that, if the national court was able to determine
what proportion of the increase in pay was attributable to market forces
such as those suggested, the pay differential would be objectively justified
to the extent of that proportion.
If, on the other hand, the national court had not been able to determine the
particular proportion, then it would have to assess whether the role of
market forces in determining the rate of pay was significant enough to
provide objective justification for part or all of the difference.

October 27 1993.
Application to reopen Commission merger proceedings inad-missible
An application by third-party shareholders for the annulment of a decision
by the European Commission refusing to reopen its merger proceedings in
relation to a particular transaction has been ruled inadmissible by the
European Court of Justice.
The Court said the applicants had failed to demonstrate that they were
directly and individually concerned as required by the Rome treaty
provisions.
The Commission's decision that the transaction between the two companies did
not fall within the scope of the merger regulation did not of itself affect
the substance or extent of the shareholders' rights.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Survey of The Slovak Republic (8): An amicable divorce -
Anthony Robinson traces the tortuous road to Slovak independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SLOVAKIA may be a state without a history, but the grounds for its divorce
from the Czech republic have deep historical roots.
The disintegration of Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia mark, in their very
different ways, the liquidation of the last multi-ethnic compromises to
survive the collapse of the Hapsburg and Ottoman empires 75 years ago.
In former Yugoslavia the principle of ethnic purity, absurd and tragic given
centuries of intermarriage, is being pursued to its bloody end through the
mass transfer of people accompanied by systematic rape and pillage. The
emergence of separate Czech and Slovak states, by contrast, came about
through a negotiated divorce and legal division of state property.
The underlying historical and cultural differences between the Czech and
Slovak peoples are almost as great, or as small, as those between Serbs and
Croats. The contrast is due principally to the total absence in the Czech
and Slovak case of any tradition of violent conflict between two ethnically
and linguistically linked peoples.
The re-emergence of Serbia has revived memories of the medieval Serb
kingdom, subjugated by the Ottomans 500 years ago, while the rebirth of the
Czech republic has restored, in essence, the Kingdom of Bohemia. The latter
was assimilated into the Hapsburg Empire after the fateful battle of the
White Mountain near Prague in 1618 at the outset of the Thirty Years War.
Slovakia and Croatia, by contrast, were both junior partners in their former
federations and share a long history of domination by Hungary. While Croatia
enjoyed periods of semi-independence, however, Slovakia was never a
sovereign state, except as a Nazi puppet during world war two.
Slovakia, including its former large Jewish and gypsy minorities and smaller
Ruthenian, Saxon, Ukrainian and other populations, remained under Hungarian
domination for almost a millennium. Much of the sometimes almost hysterical
tone of Slovak-Hungarian relations is inexplicable without reference to this
past relationship.
The Slovak leaders who took their country into the first Czechoslovak
republic after the first world war did so because they felt too weak to
survive on their own. Even in 1919 they wanted Czechoslovakia to be a
federal state in which Slovakia would have enjoyed considerable autonomy.
Only reluctantly did they accept the unitary state insisted on by Jan
Masaryk and the Czech fathers of the republic, rather than risk a return to
Hungarian rule.
It was a wise choice. In contrast with the 19th century, when millions of
Slovaks had emigrated to America, or sought work as masons and builders
elsewhere in Europe, the inter-war years of this century enabled Slovaks to
strengthen their economy and build up cultural and educational standards
with assistance from Prague.
The Slovak search for recognition and cultural awareness took systematic
form in 1863 with the creation of Matica Slovenska, the Slovak cultural
foundation. But Slovaks found their nightmares come true in 1939 as
Hungarian power moved back into eastern and southern Slovakia following
Hitler's rape of Czechoslovakia.
Even Kosice, the second biggest city in Slovakia, passed back under the
control of Hungary's crypto-fascist regime while nominal autonomy over the
rump of Slovakia was given to a clerico-fascist regime led by Father Jozef
Tiso. The spectacle of Hungary's Admiral Miklos Horthy riding on a white
horse in triumph through the streets of Kosice cheered on by its ethnic
Hungarians is still remembered by older residents and recounted to their
children.
More than 60,000 Slovak Jews were deported to concentration camps along with
unknown thousands of gypsies during the Tiso regime. Those who lived in the
Hungarian occupied regions met the same fate in 1944, after Hitler seized
power from Admiral Horthy and imposed direct rule on his former ally. As
Soviet forces advanced from the east a sometimes bloody settling of scores
took place. Thousands of ethnic Hungarians were deported from eastern and
southern Slovakia, mirroring the expulsion of 3m ethnic Germans from the
Czech Sudetenland.
During the war the Nazis built up Slovakia as a powerful centre of arms
production. Central Slovakia in particular was out of range for allied
bombers but conveniently close to the Russian front. As the Cold War
developed and Stalin tightened his hold on Czechoslovakia after the Prague
Coup of February 1948 the tightly centralised communist regime continued to
invest heavily in big arms factories.
In the 1960s the the East Slovakian Steel Works (VSZ) was built outside
Kosice by Czech engineers with Czech equipment. The completed plant used
iron ore transported over 1,000kms from Krivoi Rog in Ukraine. Its steel was
needed for the arms industry and the other heavy engineering plants set up
in what was still a largely rural country before the war.
The close integration of the Slovak economy with the Soviet military machine
and the Comecon market was reinforced by construction of the Slovnaft oil
refinery at Bratislava, the main terminal of the Druzhba oil export
pipeline. Moscow's refusal to risk losing its strategic control lay behind
the crushing of the Prague spring in 1968 and the humiliating removal from
power of Alexander Dubcek, the Slovak communist who endeared himself to
Czechs and Slovaks alike by his espousal of 'socialism with a human face'.
Vladimir Meciar, the current prime minister, was among those purged from the
communist party in 1969 as the Slovak apparatchik Gustav Husak was appointed
by Moscow to 'normalise' Czechoslovakia and create a phoney federal state
which gave greater autonomy, but only on paper, to Slovakia.
After 20 years of 'normalisation' the loose anti-communist coalition calling
itself 'People against Violence' celebrated the victory of the velvet
revolution in Bratislava as its Czech counterpart, the Civic Forum,
spearheaded by the writer Vaclav Havel, celebrated the downfall of communism
in the streets of Prague.
The superficial unity of both coalitions soon broke apart, however,
accompanied by a bitter dispute over the economic impact in Slovakia of
decisions made by high-minded politicians in Prague and over the name to be
given the newly democratic Czechoslovak state.
For months debate raged over a hyphen. Was it enough, as most Czechs argued,
to call the new state the Czecho-Slovak Federal Republic or was it to be
called the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic. Behind the war of words
nationalist and separatist emotions were whipped up by new politicians in
both countries who sought new ways to identify themselves and their
movements or parties.
The defining moment came with the elections of June 1992. Czechs voted for
rapid market reforms and integration into Europe under the leadership of
Vaclav Klaus while Vladimir Meciar's ill-defined nationalist-populist
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and the avowedly separatist Slovak
National Party won the elections in Slovakia.
Since that date the two nations have moved rapidly apart. After six months
of detailed, top level negotiations between the Czech and Slovak leaders and
their closest advisers, the two nations formally divorced on January 1,
1993. Slovakia gained its sovereignty and independence under Mr Meciar,
whose espousal of Slovak nationalism only really took off in 1991 after he
was removed as premier of the first elected post-communist government.
Six weeks into independence the political divorce was followed by the
division of the former common currency into separate Czech and Slovak
crowns. Six months later the once invisible border was clearly demarcated,
institutionalised and patrolled by armed border guards. Suddenly, and
unintentionally, Slovakia found itself on the wrong side of what has become
in effect an East-West border, thanks to a deal worked out by Bonn with its
immediate neighbours, the Czech republic and Poland to help implement
Germany's tougher new asylum laws.
It has been a rough start for the new Republic, made worse by a collapse in
bilateral trade with the Czech republic, rising unemployment and recession
in western markets. But, aware that there is no turning back, Slovaks have
to press ahead with building their new state into a viable member of a
future enlarged European Community.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Survey of The Slovak Republic (9): Unwanted tanks - Patrick
Blum visits an unemployment blackspot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IN A large industrial area on the outskirts of Martin, a small town lying on
the foothills of the Lower Tatra mountains in picturesque north-western
Slovakia, a sprawling group of factories is fighting for survival.
Martin, population 60,000, is home to ZTS, one of Slovakia's biggest
companies and heart of the country's once thriving military-industrial
complex. But military production, which represented about half of ZTS
Martin's output, collapsed in the wake of the 1989 revolution that ended
communism, and the company's future looks uncertain.
Turning the tanks made at ZTS Martin into ploughshares is more easily said
than done. The decision taken in Prague during the heady days of the velvet
revolution to abandon the 'dirty' trade in armaments has had a catastrophic
impact on Slovakia's industry and economy, causing much local bitterness.
Between 1988 and 1992, military production which accounted for about 32 per
cent of the output of Slovakia's engineering industry declined by almost 90
per cent.
'It was the hardest blow', says Mr Jaroslav Kubecka, economy minister.
'Armament production was virtually liquidated in the course of two years
without any replacement.'
At the time, around 40 major plants were involved in military production.
Many have been closed down, and some 60,000 jobs have gone, and many more in
related industries.
Ironically, the decision that devastated a major part of Slovak industry has
since been reversed in the Czech Republic whose government is now seeking
export markets for its own military hardware. The Slovak authorities, who
encouraged the conversion of military facilities to civilian production, now
believe they can re-enter the market, albeit under much more difficult
conditions and on a smaller scale than in the past.
It will not be easy. 'No country in the world is able to rebuild all its
main industries in two years. Restructuring requires enormous capital
investment beyond the capacity of local resources,' Mr Kubecka says.
ZTS Martin provides a striking example of the efforts and costs involved. In
the 1980s, about half of military production in the former Czechoslovakia -
which then ranked among the world's top 10 exporters of weaponry - and about
80 per cent of Slovak military production came from ZTS Martin which
specialised in heavy equipment, notably tanks, most of which were sold to
the former Czechoslovak and Warsaw Pact armies.
In 1988, the company produced military and civilian equipment worth SK14bn
(Dollars 450m); it had 13,000 employees, and made a SK1.6bn profit. Last
year production was down to SK6bn, its workforce was cut to 9,000, and it
made an operating profit of SK32m, but this was wiped out by restructuring
costs and mounting debts.
Mr Josef Skrko, the company's financial director, will not disclose the
volume of debt, but says one third is primary debt and two thirds is caused
by non-payment by customers. He says about SK1bn of the debt was the result
of conversion.
The social consequences for the people of Martin have been dire. 'Every
family in town used to have a worker here,' says Mr Skrko.
The pain is not over. The company has borrowed SK2bn to modernise production
lines to improve productivity and develop new products, but there have been
more lay-offs since the beginning of the year. Short-time working has been
introduced on some lines, and the marketing and strategy department closed
recently to save costs. The buildings badly need repairing, and new markets
are difficult to find even for new products such as diesel engines produced
under licence from Lombardini of Italy for sale only in former Comecon
markets,
The agreement with Lombardini was signed in 1990 with production starting
that year on existing lines. The objective was to manufacture up to 40,000
engines a year, rising eventually to 60,000. New equipment and machinery
worth SK1.3bn was imported to develop a new production line which is now
almost completely installed. Current capacity is 15,000 engines, but even
that smaller number is proving difficult to sell as shown by the stocks of
new engines lined up in the factory warehouse.
The ZTS company now produces a wide range of engines, is improving the range
of its tractors, and producing bulldozers and loaders under licence from
Hanomag of Germany with the hope of establishing a joint venture with the
German company in the near future. Large engines of 1,000 horse power used
in giant trucks are produced under licence from a French company while other
products include forest tractors. Production of the latter, however, is down
to about 150 a year, compared with exports of more than 1,000 such tractors
a year to the former Soviet Union.
Overall, military production at ZTS Martin declined from SK10.3bn in 1988 to
SK2.7bn last year, but production of the heavy T-72 tank and other armaments
has resumed. 'As far as we could see, other countries including members of
the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe continued to sell their
armaments, and nobody really helped us to convert our factories. We think we
should do what we are able to do, though the situation now is more difficult
because we have lost our former markets to competitors,' Mr Skrko says.
Foreign interest in the T-72 tank remains high, especially from potential
third world buyers with little cash.

must make it work

VLADIMIR MECIAR will take his place in the history books as the man who led
Slovaks to independent statehood.
But 11 months after jubilant crowds ushered in the Slovak republic the
stocky 51 year old Prime Minister's opinion poll rating is languishing as
doubts accumulate over his ability to lead this nation of 5.3m towards a
prosperous, secure and democratic future.
Last month, in an ornate, gilded room in the former Archbishop's palace
which now functions as the seat of government, Mr Meciar parried questions
about his ability to retain loyal support and political allies, his attitude
to ethnic minorities and more powerful neighbours, his prospects for the
economy and his vision of Slovakia's future.
On the hustings he jabs the air with his finger, cracks jokes and extracts
belly laughs from the crowd. In private he is extraordinarily immobile, big
but not tall, with a strong handshake and expressionless face in which only
his eyes seem to move. During 90 minutes of conversation there were no
flashes of inspiration, no vivid phrases, no clear vision of the future
Slovakia. Just flat words.
'We have four priorities; to establish a democratic system and democratic
institutions; introduce market mechanisms; guarantee the security of the
state and ensure integration with the European Community.' Slovakia, he
adds, is in transition from one system to another 'in the midst of a
dangerous river and moving from one bank to another'. It might take five
years to get to the other side, he adds.
Buoyed up by the strong showing of the former communist-era parties in the
recent Polish elections, the Party of the Democratic Left (SDL), led by the
youthful Mr Peter Weiss, is pressing for early general elections and hoping
to administer the coup de grace to the current prime minister and his
demoralised HZDS.
Is Mr Meciar worried by the left-wing threat? Would he be prepared to
become, say, Minister of Transport, in a future coalition government led by
the former communists in which the HZDS was relegated to a junior role?
He is not amused by the question. 'All this talk of elections is premature.
If there are to be elections I will decide the timing, and the results will
not turn out as my opponents think. The HZDS is a pragmatic, non-ideological
party of the centre. It is true we are under attack from left and right, but
we are a stabilising factor in Slovak politics.
'At the last election my opponents accused me of being an StB and a KGB
agent and a rapist of small children, but my party went on to become the
largest party with 38 per cent of the vote and we formed the government, not
them.'
His reply revealed the kind of steely will to power which his various
political opponents have underestimated at their peril before. Mr Meciar has
shown in the past that he is never more dangerous than when his back is
against the wall. A former close political aide describes him as ' a genius
at outmanoeuvering his rivals, a player without rules who cannot tolerate
peers and is driven by his complex personality into a confrontational
approach both at home and abroad.'
Appointed as premier of the Slovak part of the Czech and Slovak Federal
Republic after the June 1990 elections, he was deposed nine months later
when he lost a vote of confidence in the Slovak parliament. Behind the vote
lay dislike of his authoritarian ways among the liberal and Christian
Democratic members of Slovakia's People against Violence, the anti-communist
equivalent to the Czech Civic Forum, and disquiet in Prague at the
increasingly separatist tone of his pronouncements.
Deprived of power, Mr Meciar became an implacable foe of the new government
led by Mr Jan Carnogursky, and whipped up growing popular resentment against
both the 'morally superior' attitudes displayed by the federal President, Mr
Vaclav Havel, and the Bratislava government which he portrayed as unable to
stand up for Slovak economic and political interests.
As unemployment in the Slovak arms factories and other big plants dependent
on Comecon trade soared to four times the Czech level, the tireless Meciar
barnstormed the country, whipping up nationalist fervour and promising to
raise Slovakia's status in the world, complete the controversial Gabcikovo
dam project on the River Danube and improve the economic and moral wellbeing
of its people.
Portraying himself as a martyr sacrificed on the altar of Czech arrogance
and Slovak government weakness, the one-time boxer and largely self-educated
enterprise lawyer, reached a peak of popularity at the general elections of
June 1992 after addressing packed crowds in pre-electoral meetings.
After his first post-election meeting with Mr Vaclav Klaus, the victor in
the Czech elections of the same date, it became clear that the self-assured,
fanatically pro-market Czech leader preferred a quick divorce from Slovakia
to endless recriminations and a loose confederal arrangement which would
have left the Czech republic footing much of the bill for Slovakia's greater
internal autonomy and higher profile abroad.
Both men had a unique opportunity to appraise the other. Whatever his
private thoughts Mr Klaus has taken care never to criticise his Slovak
counterpart in personal terms, and makes it understood that, whatever his
reservations, he fears that whoever comes after Mr Meciar could well be
worse.
Mr Klaus, who has a Slovak wife and campaigned for Slovak votes during the
1992 election campaign, recognised that Mr Meciar faced a harder task, with
far fewer resources, in building his new state.
The Slovak leader acknowledges that 'founding the new state brought many
problems. The Czechs started preparing the technical basis for the divorce
in January 1991 but Slovakia only began from July 1992, While the Czechs
inherited the federal institutions there were no equivalents to these Prague
based institutions in Slovakia.' At the same time the divorce left the new
Slovak state with a legacy of over-sized arms, heavy engineering and
consumer goods factories orientated towards the defunct Comecon market.
Since January, he points out, the government has gained international
recognition, joined a raft of international institutions, including the IMF,
World Bank and EBRD, set up a new independent central bank, created a
separate national currency, and forged a national army.
But, after recounting the achievements of the last few months, Mr Meciar
complained that all this had been done against the background of what he
described as 'a campaign of hatred against Slovakia and a wave of hostile
propaganda which assaulted Slovakia and its official representatives'. When
questioned about Slovakia's image, however, Slovak diplomats ruefully
concede that in many cases the problem has been created by Mr Meciar's own
abrasive style. The issues which have provoked most international criticism
include the unilateral decision to go ahead with completion of the Gabcikovo
dam despite Hungarian objections, and insensitivity to the human and other
rights of ethnic Hungarian and gypsy minorities. These are all complex
issues with no easy solution. They cry out for quiet diplomacy and a search
for reasonable compromise.
But subtle diplomacy and a desire for compromise are not easily associated
with Mr Meciar's confrontational approach to political problems. Like most
of the grey men in his cabinet and Mrs Anna Nagyova, his blonde special
adviser on international as well as domestic issues, Mr Meciar speaks no
foreign languages, apart from the closely related Czech and a smattering of
Russian. But he insists on representing Slovakia abroad whenever possible.
In an international setting he always looks the odd one out, even among a
gathering of fellow leaders from post-communist Europe. At this year's
annual international get-together in Davos, Slovak diplomats watched in
despair as the Mr Meciar and his group sat talking among themselves in
Slovak as other leaders split into ever-changing informal groups exchanging
gossip and building informal ties.
At a recent summit meeting in Budapest of the Central European Initiative,
the 10 nation grouping which includes Italy and Austria as well as eight
central European states, the Slovak leader fiddled constantly with a
recalcitrant translation machine as Mr Klaus, the Czech leader, replied to
questions in fluentGerman and English.
On his return from Budapest Mr Meciar announced his intention to obtain new
fighter aircraft from Russia to counter-balance similar purchases by
Hungary, raising the prospect of a mini arms race between states with ethnic
minorities on both sides of the border.
Mr Meciar does not compare well with the founders of the original
Czechoslovak state. Having led the move to independence he seems to lack the
human and political skills needed to inspire Slovak citizens of all ethnic
groups to make the best of their difficult inheritance. What is more, having
won independence, he seems to underate the importance of building bridges in
this potentially dangerous region for a small country with suspicious
neighbours.

Politics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE victory in Poland of leftwing political parties with communist roots
only four years after the collapse of communism throughout eastern Europe is
leading to a reappraisal of political probabilities throughout the former
communist world, writes Anthony Robinson.
The Polish left's turnabout has aroused particular interest in Slovakia,
Poland's southern neighbour, where the Party of the Democratic Left (SDL),
led by Mr Peter Weiss, closely resembles Poland's Democratic Left Alliance
guided by Mr Alexander Kwasniewski.
In Poland, the election results were as much a defeat for the fragmented
anti-communist parties of the Solidarity-era opposition as a victory for the
re-packaged communist-era politicians.
There are similarities in Slovakia where the centre stage is tenuously held
by the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). This movement, a loose
alliance bound together more by the personality of Mr Vladimir Meciar than
any ideological cement, was formed in 1991 after the disintegration of
Slovakia's 'velvet revolution' alliance called People Against Violence
(VPN).
To its left the HZDS is challenged by the neo-communists, to its right by
the Christian Democrat party (KDH), led by Mr Jan Carnogursky, the Slovak
National Party (SNS) led by Mr Ludovit Cernak, and smaller parties
representing ethnic Hungarians.
But the ability of the HZDS to command the centre ground has been undermined
by the inability of the government to deliver the promised economic recovery
and growing disillusionment with the suspicious, combative personality of
its leader.
The erosion of confidence in the HZDS and deep, often personal animosities,
between leaders of the non-communist parties has inevitably rebounded to the
benefit of the former communist SLD. Like their Polish counterparts, Mr
Weiss and key aides such as Mr Pavel Kanis, the SLD deputy chairman, have
spent the last four years trying to shed the stigma of the Soviet-imposed
communist past, and present themselves as a respectable, democratic party,
eligible for membership in a future government coalition.
At the last elections in June 1992 the SLD already emerged as the second
largest party with 28 seats in the 150 seat Narodna Rada, the single chamber
Slovak parliament. The SLD was dwarfed by the HZDS which won 74 seats won
but came out well ahead of the Slovak Nationalist Party (SNS), which was the
only party to stand unambiguously in favour of Slovak independence. The SNS
won only 15 seats and agreed to become a junior coalition partner in the
post-election HZDS-SNS government.
This government collapsed last March when Mr Ludovit Cernak, the SNS leader,
took his party out of the coalition after attacking Mr Meciar for his
alleged authoritarian style and his closeness to politicians such as the
Defence and Culture Ministers with shady political antecedents and ties to
Czechoslovakia's Moscow-dominated past.
Last month, however, Mr Cernak agreed in principle to take his party back
into the government, mainly because his reluctance to risk early elections
which the former communists might win proved stronger than personal and
political antipathy to Mr Meciar.
A renewed HZDS-SNS coalition, still to be finalised at the time of writing,
would create a secure parliamentary majority and ensure passage of next
year's budget. It would give a reprieve to Mr Meciar whose shaky minority
government has been dangerously weak since Mr Milan Knazko, a former actor
who was a popular idol of the VPN movement in 1989, was sacked as foreign
minister five months ago. Mr Knazko left the HZDS after fierce arguments
with Mr Meciar over policy towards ethnic minorities and neighbouring
states. He has since formed his own breakaway party, the Alliance of
Independent Democrats, with eight seats in parliament.
The new alliance patches up the government but does not reduce the
underlying challenge from the former communist SLD or the risk of sharing
the fate suffered by Poland's Solidarity era parties. But Slovakia does not
share Poland's deeper political culture or its self-confidence as one of the
historic nations of eastern Europe. The reform communists, who form the
frontline of the Polish Democratic Left Alliance, were committed to
reformist politics before being swept from power in 1989 and have been able
to attract support from the new business class which has since emerged.
Slovakia has no so such self-confident past. The communists who ran
Czechoslovakia in the Stalinist years and after the Soviet invasion of 1968
were, almost to a man, grey mediocrities who showed an insensitivity bred of
ignorance to tradition and theenvironment.
Nowhere was the deliberate destruction of the creative and productive middle
class more complete than in former Czechoslovakia which before the war,
together with its large German and Jewish minorities, formed perhaps the
most successful democracy in continental Europe. And the Slovak part of the
old republic, singled out for investment in heavy industry, suffered the
most.
Given this history, the risk of a return to power of parties with their
roots in Slovakia's communist past is a sobering one. The men who lead the
party seem bright and intelligent. But with Slovakia's slow record of reform
to date, many of the old nomenklatura bosses are still running the various
bureaucracies, the big state owned factories and the security forces.
Several former communists are already in the HZDS government. It is
difficult to escape the conclusion that once the reformed communists
regained power in their own right it might be difficult to remove them.
Ironically the widespread sense that the former communists represent the
most likely alternative to the HZDS, together with the personal rivalries
and relative inexperience of the non-communist opposition parties, are the
main factors keeping Mr Meciar in power.
'Meciar is a confrontationalist. With him Slovak politics cannot be brought
to the level needed to modernise the economy and society,' says Mr Igor
Uhrik, vicepresident of the SNS and one of a handful of expatriate Slovaks
who have returned to contribute their skills and foreign experience to
building up the new state. But Mr Meciar is in charge, and while he remains
that way he will be the one to choose the timing of the next election to his
greatest advantage.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Survey of The Slovak Republic (4): A model from Frankfurt -
The banks have been organised at top speed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM

<TEXT>
THE creation of viable banking and financial institutions has emerged as a
top priority throughout the former communist world. But in Slovakia this has
entailed the additional burden of creating a new central bank at the apex of
the system which unexpectedly had to assume the additional task of
introducing and managing an independent national currency.
Finding staff at all levels with the necessary experience and knowledge of
modern central banking principles, including the vital supervisory
functions, has been complicated by the fact that before the divorce central
bank functions were concentrated in Prague.
'The federal state had its administration in Prague. The whole of the state
machinery stayed in Bohemia after the split. Very few Slovaks worked in
important positions in Prague, and most of them stayed there. We had to
start from scratch and this inevitably had an impact. That is the price we
had to pay for independence,' says Mr Jozef Magula, head of the finance
ministry's financial and economic policy department.
What is more, the new central bank had to be established and personnel had
to be found for a wide range of state institutions including the finance
ministry in competition with the banks and a new stock exchange, not to
mention private companies.
Before the divorce on January 1 the central bank's presence in Slovakia was
limited to a small branch of the State Bank of Czechoslovakia in Bratislava.
The newly founded Slovak National Bank (SNB) struggled to get organised in
the weeks following the breakup of the federation. It received help from the
British know-how fund and the Austrian National Bank which provided training
courses for staff, many of whom had little experience. Only one of 10 senior
employees working in the federal bank came back to Bratislava - and became
head of the SNB's dealing department.
As if these handicaps were not enough, the bank was soon put through its
paces with the collapse of the currency union with the Czech Republic in
February, accompanied by a run on reserves. As originally conceived, the two
countries planned to run a joint currency for at least six months after the
divorce. But the precipitate drop in bilateral trade as the frontiers were
established accelerated the need to establish a new independent currency
under strong pressure from the markets, and the IMF, to devalue. These
pressures were resisted until July.
As the first year of independence draws to a close the dust is beginning to
settle, and the central bank is looking forward to a more stable
environment. But Mr Marian Jusko, deputy governor, says that only five of
eight positions on the bank's ruling council have been filled. The total
number of employees, however, has doubled from the initial 200 to more than
400.
In principle the central bank enjoys an independent status modelled on the
German Bundesbank. This is enshrined in its founding statutes and last
July's devaluation was formally decided by the central bank rather than the
finance ministry which had taken the lead in resisting devaluation pressures
for seven months.
The bank's principal tasks are to maintain control over monetary policy and
inflation, to ensure currency stability, and to supervise the banking
system.
For their part, the commercial banks are having to learn to live with tight
supervision and growing competition. They have had more time to adapt than
the central bank during three years of radical reforms that began in 1990.
As in the Czech Republic, the pace of change has been dramatic, transforming
the banking system beyond recognition from its former role as a conduit for
money distributed under a central plan into a western style financial
sector.
The number of commercial banks has grown from two in 1991 to 26 today, with
new specialised financial institutions including 17 universal banks - six of
which have foreign currency licences - and nine foreign bank branches.
Foreign institutions represented in Slovakia include the Credit Lyonnais,
and Banque Paribas of France, Creditanstalt and Oesterreichische Volksbanken
of Austria, and the Internationale Nederlanden Bank of the Netherlands, as
well as banks from Germany, the Czech republic and Russia. At the end of
June total subscribed bank capital was SK11.8bn with foreign participation
of SK1.6bn.
Although legislation has been brought into line with western practice,
Slovak banks continue to face difficulties in modernising their operations
and introducing new technology and services.
There are other problems. The concentration of deposits with savings banks
exacerbates a general liquidity shortage throughout the banking system and
the economy. At the same time, doubtful loans to military and other state
industries made under the communists are forcing the banks to sharply raise
their bad debt provisions.
Mr Jan Jansta, senior deputy chairman of Vseobecna Uverova Banka (VUB), the
largest commercial bank, says: 'The problem is that no institutional
investor or company is depositing money with any bank for a period of more
than one year.'
VUB was established on January 1, 1990, when the Czechoslovak State Bank was
broken up to form new commercial banks. At the time it had 30 branches and
about 85 per cent of the Slovak credit market. Since then the VUB network
has expanded to 40 branches including one in Prague, and 180 small retail
outlets serving more than 800,000 customers. Initially its customers were
mainly state institutions. Now they represent less than 70 per cent of its
portfolio and VUB, like other Slovak banks, must raise provisions for bad
debts from both the state and the often shaky private sector.
Like a giant jigsaw puzzle, the pieces are slowly falling into place for
Slovakia's young banking sector, but as the country moves towards a market
economy, it faces a more urgent problem, Mr Jansta says. 'The greatest need
is for new capital, not more banks.'

FT  02 NOV 93 / Survey of The Slovak Republic (3): Comecon's unhelpful
legacy - Economy has a weak base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE economic basis for Slovakian independence is shaky.
Czechoslovakia as a whole was deeply integrated into the Comecon and Warsaw
pact system, but Slovakia with its concentration of heavy engineering and
arms plants as well as large scale shoe, textile and other consumer goods
factories, was much more orientated towards the east than the more
variegated Czech economy. Slovakia therefore suffered more from the break-up
of the old Comecon trade links and the collapse in military orders which
followed the end of the Cold War and Prague's post 'velvet revolution'
dictum about the immorality of the arms trade.
Slovakia's historical development as a supplier of steel and semi-finished
components for finishing and sale in the Czech republic has also made it
more vulnerable to the collapse in bilateral trade which followed the
division of the country and the disintegration of the 74 year-old
Czechoslovak economy. The Czechs, with their geographical proximity to
western Europe and experience in selling finished products, have found it
much easier to switch to EC markets, especially Germany.
Coping with these two severe shocks - the loss of the Comecon and then much
of the Czech market - in quick succession has been traumatic. A return to
economic growth is not likely before 1995.
The scale of the problems is illustrated by a single statistic - since 1989,
Slovakia's gross domestic product has declined by 30-40 per cent. The arms
industry has been decimated; agriculture, accounting for about 20 per cent
of GDP, has been severely disrupted; and service industries such as tourism
have also suffered from the inadequacy of the existing facilities to cater
for western tastes.
In the first six months of the new state's existence Slovak GDP fell by a
further 6.2 per cent compared to the same period in 1992 while unemployment
rose to 12.5 per cent of the workforce. Inflation rose to 14.2 per cent.
Officials say the introduction of value added tax last January added about 9
percentage points to inflation, while a 10 per cent devaluation in July, and
additional tax increases introduced during the summer, will have a further
negative impact on the consumer price index. Inflation is now forecast to
rise to around 25 per cent on an annual basis by the end of the year. Over
the whole year GDP could fall by 8 per cent.
Next year the government hopes to reduce inflation to around 10-15 per cent,
but expects the economy to continue to contract. The GDP is expected to fall
by a further 3-4 per cent in 1994 while unemployment will rise further to
around 20 per cent. A resumption in growth is not expected until 1995.
On the positive side, imports and exports are now roughly balanced at an
overall lower level, and the current account is expected to show only a
small deficit this year of around 1-1.5 per cent of GDP, according to Mr
Marian Jusko, deputy governor of the National Bank of Slovakia. Foreign debt
 -both public and private - stands at a relatively low Dollars 2.78bn, due
partly to a successful Dollars 240m bond issue raised in September and
Dollars 90m borrowed from from the International Monetary Fund as the first
tranche of a Dollars 180m structural transformation facility agreed in the
summer.
Thanks to foreign borrowing and balanced external accounts the National
Bank's foreign exchange reserves, which fell to below Dollars 140m in
February when the currency union with the Czech Republic came to an abrupt
end, rose to Dollars 566m by mid-September. Total foreign assets held by
commercial banks and the National Bank, including gold, rose to Dollars
1.67bn. The long expected devaluation of the Slovak Koruna in July has
helped.
Officials say there is no need for further devaluations, but independent
analysts say this will depend on maintaining tight monetary control. The
authorities are aware of this. The national bank is keeping a sharp daily
watch on government revenues and expenditures to ensure that the government
keeps to its July agreement with the IMF to keep the deficit to within a
SK14bn-16bn range, representing about 5 per cent of GDP.
But with revenues slashed by the recession, insufficient manpower to collect
taxes, and rising expenditure on unemployment benefits, the authorities will
be hard put to keep to the target. The size of the social security budget is
a particularly onerous constraint. About one third of this year's SK158bn
budget will be spent on unemployment benefits, health and other social
benefits, compared with an OECD average of 9/10 per cent. Reducing this
burden is politically difficult.
Officials believe the government will manage to keep to this year's deficit
target, and will be able to decrease it next year as national insurance is
taken off-budget as part of a broader reform of government finances and
improvements in tax collection. Higher income from privatisation, to be
accelerated next year, should also help boost revenue.
There are still many potential pitfalls, however. Bankruptcies are expected
to rise next year under the impact of a new bankruptcy law which aims to
clear an estimated SK 80bn in inter-company debt. Privatisation has been
prone to delays, and the private sector still only accounts for about 10 per
cent of GDP, though the proportion is growing 'from month to month', says Mr
Jaroslav Kubecka, economy minister.
Restructuring the still largely state-run economy into a viable market
economy will need substantial amounts of capital investment, the bulk of
which can only be provided by foreign investors who have been deterred by
fears of political instability.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Survey of The Slovak Republic (2): Austrians head the queue
 -Foreign investors study pace of privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM

<TEXT>
THE collapse of traditional markets in the former Comecon trade bloc was
felt more acutely in Slovakia than in most of its neighbours.
Short of raw materials and energy sources, and with many of its biggest
companies geared to serve highly specialised markets for heavy engineering
products in central/eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, Slovak
industry faces an uncertain future without heavy investment beyond the
capacity of local resources.
With only about Dollars 320m disbursed since 1990, Slovakia has attracted
only a tiny share of foreign investments in the region. But interest is
growing, especially from neighbouring Austria, and more investments are said
to be on the way.
Faster privatisation is one of the keys to greater foreign investment. But
the sacking of Mr Lubomir Dolgos, the former privatisation minister, without
a replacement being appointed has raised question marks about the commitment
of the government to recovering the momentum lost after the divorce from the
rapid privatisation-orientated Czechs.
Government officials dispute the complaints of opposition parties and
businessmen that privatisation has ground to a virtual halt after the first
round of coupon privatisation which was set in train while Slovakia was
still part of Czechoslovakia. 'We believe we should privatise more quickly
as it is a basic prerequisite for restructuring our economy,' says Mr Ivan
Lexa, state secretary in charge of privatisation.
He rejects criticism that the privatisation process has been slow and prone
to bureaucratic delays. 'Speed is relative. Seen from the perspective of the
World Bank and the IMF, privatisation in Slovakia is considered among the
best. The pace and range of privatisations compare well with other
post-communist countries, but we are looking at improving and speeding up
the process,' he claims.
Since 1990, state assets worth SK120bn (Dollars 4.1bn) have been sold
including about 500 companies with a book value of more than Dollars 3.1bn
which have been disposed of through mass voucher privatisation. The voucher
privatisation programme was launched in 1992, but it is only being completed
now because of delays caused by the division of the former Czechoslovak
state.
As with the neighbouring Czech Republic, Slovakia's voucher privatisation
was considered a success by western analysts, and a second wave of voucher
privatisation is planned for next year. But the government has shifted
emphasis, intending to resort more extensively to standard methods of
privatisation.
Shares in Slovak companies may also be floated on the Prague and Vienna
stock exchange once company accounting has been harmonised with Austrian
requirements, says Mr Lexa.
The new privatisation programme provides for the planned sale of 600
companies with a book value of about SK210bn (Dollars 7.2bn) of which
voucher sales will only account for assets worth SK50bn-SK70bn. Furthermore,
voucher privatisations will only take place in the third quarter of next
year. Until then the government will seek to sell as many companies as
possible by direct sales and public tenders.
'Voucher privatisation resulted in too great a dispersal of shareholders
with small stakes who are not always committed to further investment in
their companies,' Mr Lexa says to explain the shift in emphasis. 'There was
just a change of ownership, but it brought nothing to the state or the
companies. With the second wave we aim to accelerate restructuring. Slovak
industries need new technologies and they must modernise their production.
This requires a lot of money and can only be done with foreign capital,' he
says.
The importance of attracting foreign investors is underlined by the shortage
of capital of the Slovak banks which exhausted their funds in the first wave
of state disposals. Foreign investors will be able to buy up to 100 per cent
of a company's shareholding, and benefit from a wide range of tax and other
incentives. But the authorities will seek a commitment by investors on
further investments to modernise and develop their companies.
Mr Lexa says interest has picked up this year after a slow start. 'In 1992,
and early 1993, opinion about Slovakia was not favourable. We were seen as
backwards and politically unstable, but since then the IMF, the World Bank
and the EBRD have helped to give us recognition. We are also much more
active at targeting investors abroad, and people are getting a clearer
picture of opportunities in Slovakia.'
Officials are trying to market Slovakia as a convenient production and
trading centre with a relatively good transport infrastructure and good
access to both western and eastern markets. Telecommunications, which are
currently very poor, especially inside the country, are being upgraded
through an Ecu227m modernisation programme. The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is providing Ecu44m and Slovak
Telecommunications Ecu122m with the remaining Ecu61m coming from export
credit agencies.
The project will improve services for 414,000 existing customers and bring
in 200,000 new subscribers. By 1995 all main cities should have a digital
telephone network. Bratislava will be equipped with a combined local,
transit and international exchange and be the focus of a nationwide optical
fibre backbone system.
A recent EBRD study of some 400 small-to-medium size Slovak companies with
500-1,000 employees, identified more than 50 with good prospects for
potential investment in a wide range of sectors. 'People are finding much
greater scope for investment than they expected.' a western consultant says.
The EBRD, which is playing a catalytic role in attracting foreign investment
to Slovakia, is considering investing Ecu10m in a proposed Ecu20m fund to
invest in such companies. It will work alongside the European Community
which plans to put up Ecu5m through its Phare programme, with the rest
coming from elsewhere.
The EBRD is also providing a total of Dollars 125m for the completion of a
new aluminium smelter at Ziar nad Hronom. Over Dollars 185m had been spent
on the 65 per cent finished plant before construction was suspended five
years ago because of lack of funds. The new financing will allow the plant
to be completed with the installation of state of the art technology from
Norsk Hydro which is also taking a Dollars 15m equity stake in Slovalco, the
operating company. The EBRD is also taking a Dollars 15m equity stake in the
company, but the bulk of its commitment is a Dollars 110m loan which will be
used to finish construction, buy the equipment and also close down the
existing, heavily polluting, smelters.
Other investors so far include Volkswagen, with a Dollars 32.5m investment
in an assembly plant near Bratislava for its Passat model; K-Mart of the US
with a Dollars 30m investment in the Prior retail chain stores; Rhone
Poulenc (Dollars 20m); and Samsung (Dollars 11m). Volkswagen is reported to
be planning a further Dollars 25m investment at Bratislava.
The close proximity of Bratislava to Vienna - just over an hour's drive away
 -has encouraged Austrian investors, including Siemens' Austrian subsidiary.
With more than 1,000 Austrian companies established in Slovakia and Dollars
76m invested, Slovakia's western neighbour has both the largest number and
volume of investments, representing about 30 per cent of total foreign
investments. Complex negotiations are continuing with OMV, the Austrian
energy group, which is seeking an important stake in Slovnaft, the Slovak
oil and petrochemical company.
With Austrian plans to up-grade transport and rail links between Bratislava
and Vienna, Austrian investment is likely to continue to grow. The Austrian
commercial office in Bratislava says that in the first half of the year it
has had some 7,000 inquiries, two-thirds from Slovak companies seeking
foreign partners. These developments offer hope for an economy in its fourth
year of deep recession.

Slovaks were wary when their 74 year-old 'marriage' with the Czechs ended
peacefully at the start of 1993. Now caution has been replaced by a quiet
determination to succeed. Anthony Robinson describes the new Republic's
problems and prospects

<TEXT>
ON New Year's day, 1993, Slovaks sloughed off a thousand year subservience
to Hungary and seven decades as the junior partner in Czechoslovakia and
celebrated the birth of a sovereign, independent, internationally recognised
republic.
But only six months earlier most Slovaks went into the crucial general
elections of June 1992 intending to negotiate a new and looser union with
their richer and more numerous Czech cousins, but not to be divorced from
them.
Opinion polls showed that divorce was only sought by a small minority in
both the Czech lands and Slovakia. Many Slovaks were in favour of seeking
greater political and cultural autonomy, but fewer than 10 per cent voted
for the openly separatist Slovak National Party (SNS). The 600,000 ethnic
Hungarian minority was virtually unanimous in opposition to breaking ties
with Prague as were the less politically organised Gypsy, Ukrainian,
Ruthenian and other minorities living mainly in the east and south of the
country.
But the election results put political power into the hands of politicians
with incompatible ideas about acceptable terms for cohabitation in a common
state. The Czech leader, Mr Vaclav Klaus, made clear from the outset that a
clean divorce was preferable to a messy, protracted squabble over the terms
of cohabitation. As the Czechs were the richest and the most populous
members of the 74 year-old Czechoslovak state Mr Klaus was able to determine
the subsequent course of events.
Mr Vladimir Meciar, the pugnacious Slovak leader who turned his Movement for
a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) into the dominant force in Slovak politics by
his attacks on Czech arrogance and insensitivity to Slovakia's needs, found
himself with no alternative but to negotiate the best terms for divorce.
In contrast with Yugoslavia, where the number of states, nationalities and
cultural and ethnic groups involved was much greater, and where past violent
conflicts over borders and between groups had left indelible scars, the
Czech and Slovak divorce negotiations were tough but amicable.
But a mere 10 months of separate existence have already brought about
palpable changes in perspective. On both sides of what is now an
international border between the two states apprehension about the possible
unforeseen consequences of separation has been largely replaced by a
determination to make independence work. Both states insist on their
European vocation and their desire for the fastest possible integration into
a suitably extended European Community and revamped Nato.
A young Slovak diplomat from the east of the country, the part which was
most opposed to the idea of rule from Bratislava and gave the lowest votes
to Mr Meciar, summed up the reaction of many of her generation. 'We did not
want to be cut off from Prague and the Czech part of our country. We felt
nervous about being alone in this part of the world. But now I am amazed to
find how little we have in common with the Czechs and how tied up we are in
trying to solve our own problems here in Slovakia.'
For Prague, the divorce meant the end of an implicit economic subsidy to
Slovakia, at the cost of a 30 per cent loss of trade between the two new
states. It also freed the Czechs from entanglements inherited from the
inter-war republic whose borders were drawn to include a large Hungarian
minority at the end of the first world war.
For Bratislava, independence promised the psychological and spiritual
satisfaction of permitting the majority ethnic Slovaks the opportunity to
develop and assert their own national personality at home and abroad after a
millennium as a largely ignored or subservient people.
But it has required an enormous effort to build up the institutions and
trappings of a sovereign state. For more than 70 years many of the most able
Slovaks moved to senior jobs in Prague, and few were prepared to return to
Bratislava to create a new state, especially under the political conditions
created by the HZDS victory in the elections.
In spite of the difficulties, however, Slovakia now has an independent
central bank, a national currency (hastily introduced in six weeks instead
of the expected six months after the divorce), a national army and security
forces and diplomatic representation abroad. It has obtained international
recognition and membership of a wide range of international institutions,
including the IMF, the World Bank and the EBRD. It has also signed a
separate association agreement with the EC and gained membership of the
Council of Europe, after the last minute withdrawal by Hungary of objections
linked to the rights of ethnic Hungarians. Both economically and
strategically, however, the new Slovakia inherited substantial real and
potential problems. Already hard hit by the collapse of Comecon markets and
the end of the Cold War, the disintegration of the highly integrated
Czechoslovak economy has led to a sharp drop in trade with the Czech
republic at a time when recession in western markets has reduced the already
limited ability to shift to OECD markets. Unemployment is high and foreign
investment remains low while the pre-divorce wave of Czechoslovak
privatisation has not been followed by a similarly determined all-Slovak
version. Without rapid privatisation and higher foreign investment
Slovakia's ability to build a less energy and raw material intensive economy
more attuned to international trade will remain in doubt.
The potential certainly exists for a successful transformation of the
economy, given the high level of technical skills and current low wage
rates. In the service sector tourism also has good prospects, once the
unfriendly, rigid state hotel structure is replaced by small scale private
and local tourist initiatives. This year Slovakia is expected to earn only
Dollars 200m from tourism, a fraction of what could be earned by creative
exploitation of a rich natural endowment which includes the high and low
Tatra mountains, much untouched countryside and a plethora of castles,
churches and cultural treasures.
A lot depends on Slovakia's ability to project itself properly as a
peaceful, stable, democratic country, at ease with its neighbours and not
only open to foreign investment but able to create the banking, legal and
institutional framework that potential investors can feel familiar with.
This is not always the case and some small investors have found difficulty
seeking redress for alleged irregularities.
But the main question hangs over Slovakia's ability to forge a mutually
satisfactory relationship with Hungary. This is highlighted by the dispute
over Slovakia's unilateral decision to go ahead with completing the
Gabcikovo dam on the River Danube, and irritating resistance to the ethnic
Hungarian minority's desire for dual Hungarian-Slovak place names in areas
of Hungarian settlement and the right not to use the Slovak suffix added to
female Hungarian surnames.
The dam issue, which aroused greater passions in Hungary than merited by the
controversial ecological issues alone, is currently under adjudication by
the International Court at the Hague. The Slovak side points out that it was
Budapest which first acted unilaterally by pulling out of the joint scheme.
Mr Jozef Moravcik, the foreign minister, also compares the high degree of
cultural and linguistic autonomy enjoyed by Slovakia's Hungarian minority
with the assimilation pressures to which ethnic Slovaks have been subjected
in Hungary.
Wise heads in Bratislava have tried to defuse potential tensions by quiet
diplomacy, fearing that the intemperate words sometimes used by Mr Meciar
when referring to both the Hungarian and Gypsy minorities could inflame
passions and contribute to the re-ignition of latent ethnic tensions
throughout the wider Carpathian region. The rise of nationalist parties in
Hungary and Romania underlines the risks involved in playing the ethnic
card.
Opinion polls indicate that Mr Meciar still retains a core following in his
home territory of central Slovakia, in the scenically attractive villages of
the Vah valley and the Tatra mountains. These are the areas economically
hardest hit by the collapse of the arms industry and the loss of Comecon
markets on which Slovakia was so heavily dependent before the death of the
Soviet system.
It is far harder to find supporters in Bratislava, the capital which is
tucked away at the extreme south west of the country, only 65kms from
Vienna, or in Kosice, the regional capital of eastern Slovakia, even though
unemployment and the attendant social pains are lower in these two big
cities.
Mr Meciar may not be the ideal politician to lead Slovakia into
independence, but his latest deal with the Nationalist Party (SNS) should
give him the parliamentary majority needed to get next year's tough budget
approved and fight off left wing opposition demands for early elections. The
international financial institutions are helping to fund investment
projects, pending the hoped for awakening of foreign private investment.
The next years will not be easy. But independence seldom comes cheap.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Male managers 'block progress for women'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SIEGE mentality among male junior and middle managers is continuing to
block the progress of women in the workplace, a leading campaigner for
women's employment rights said yesterday.
Lady Howe, chairman of Opportunity 2000, the Business in the Community
initiative, told the organisation's second anniversary celebrations that
lack of awareness among men in lower management turned them unwittingly into
'benign saboteurs'.
She was backed by Ms Kay Struth of the surveyor-personnel management unit at
Customs and Excise, who said: 'There are some men who do not want to accept
that women can be equal in some areas.'
Mr David Sainsbury, chairman and chief executive of supermarket group J.
Sainsbury and a founder member of Opportunity 2000, said his company had not
felt a backlash from promoting career opportunities for women.
'It makes commercial sense to encourage women to progress to higher
management positions,' he said. 'For every woman at section manager level
who leaves because her wish for development is frustrated, we estimate it
costs us Pounds 5,000 to find and train a new recruit to the same standard.
For store managers and their deputies the figure is nearer Pounds 10,000. No
business can afford this level of waste.'
Lady Howe said the campaign's membership had doubled to 216 in the past
year. She said members were beginning to change their employment cultures,
bringing greater opportunities for women.
As examples of good practice she cited part-time working opportunities
introduced this year by the Metropolitan Police, a personal development
programme for women at clerical level at Barclays Bank, and senior
job-sharing at British Airways.
She said more than a third of the campaign's members had said that the
recession had restricted their scope to alter the balance of their
workforce.

FT  02 NOV 93 / TGWU warns it may cut MP funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BILL MORRIS, the general secretary of the TGWU general union, has given
his starkest warning yet to the Labour party that as his union seeks to
improve its efficiency it will be examining all political payments to see if
they provide value for money.
Although the TGWU has just endorsed its sponsorship of all its 38 Labour
MPs, including leading Labour modernisers such as Mr Tony Blair who was
under threat from the left, Mr Morris has questioned the union's policy.
'Would it make any difference to us if we sponsored 10 Labour MPs instead of
38?' he said in an interview with the Financial Times. Mr Morris's comments
suggest that the level of sponsorship will not prevail indefinitely.
Mr Morris, who tomorrow opens a TGWU computer centre in Newcastle upon Tyne,
claimed that since he took over the reins from Mr Ron Todd at the end of
1991 'we have changed the culture'. He said that at the political level the
old 21-17 left-right split on the executive had been broken down, and that
in terms of organisation his main ambition was to leave behind a 'highly
professional outfit, but one which has not abandoned its culture and
values'.
Mr Morris said the organisation had been too hesitant about adopting modern
business methods, for example in the way that people pay for membership. 'It
is absurd that I can buy almost anything I want from my armchair except for
membership of the TGWU,' he said.
The computer centre will cost Pounds 1m but is meant to save the union
Pounds 500,000 a year in running costs. Mr Morris says it establishes a
'state of the art' network linking the union's self-standing personal
computers to a central computer.
The network, being masterminded by Mr Peter Regnier, the TGWU's new chief
executive, will help to give the union a much clearer profile of its 1m
members.
Mr Morris said that Mr Regnier had already made a big difference to the
union's bargaining power with its banks and suppliers. He added that the
union had decided to break with the company which had been doing all its
property business since 1972. The company has since closed as the TGWU was
its only customer.
After a record Pounds 12m deficit in 1991, following smaller deficits in
1989 and 1990, the union had to start eating into its assets which fell from
Pounds 76m in 1988 to Pounds 53m in 1991.
Last year the union made a small surplus, having increased its subscriptions
by 11 per cent and having cut expenditure from Pounds 67m to Pounds 60m.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Union abandons BT strike ballot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAIN UNION at British Telecommunications has backed away from a fight
over this year's pay offer of 1.9 per cent after consulting local officials.
The National Communications Union, led by a leftwing executive since June,
had rejected the offer and decided to recommend strike action in a ballot of
its 140,000 members.
But local officials strongly advised that union members were far more
concerned about job security than pay.
Although the 1.9 per cent will now be accepted, it is not clear whether
union members will also receive the extra Pounds 20 BT had originally
offered as an inducement to union officials to recommend acceptance - it was
withdrawn after they refused.
The pay rise will take the pay of a top-grade technical officer from Pounds
17,770 to Pounds 18,108, and a lower-grade clerical worker from Pounds
10,700 to Pounds 10,903.
The union and BT both fear that some conflict may be unavoidable over the
company's aim to shed a further 15,000 employees next year after two years
of heavy, but voluntary, job-shedding. Unions have received a strong
endorsement from Sir Colin Marshall, chairman of British Airways.
In the GMB general union's magazine, Sir Colin says unions help motivation
and play a 'good role' at British Airways.
'British Airways is happy to work with the unions and there is no question
of derecognising them,' he says. 'Unions play an important role in the
company because they collectively represent the interests of the workforce.'
His comments were reinforced by Mrs Rhiannon Chapman, director of the
Industrial Society. Writing in the society's newsletter, published today,
she urges employers to resist the temptation to de-recognise unions and says
it is easy to underestimate the value of a good, experienced union
representative in 'oiling the wheels' and solving day-to-day problems.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Cells crisis looms, prisons chief says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLICE CELLS, former military camps and a floating prison may be used to
tackle a growing accommodation crisis in Britain's jails, Mr Derek Lewis,
director-general of the Prison Service, said yesterday.
He told the service's conference in Blackpool that he was 'on the verge' of
using emergency accommodation.
Mr Stephen Shaw, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said Mr Lewis's
statement was 'the clearest warning to the home secretary of the dangers he
is running with his prison policy'. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, has
called for a law-and-order crackdown, claiming at the Tory party conference
last month that 'prison works' and that his plans were likely to increase
the prison population.
Mr Lewis said pressure on accommodation would lead to delays in some of the
service's plans to refurbish prisons. Decisions on which projects would be
deferred would be made during the next few weeks.
He warned that overcrowding increased the risk of security and control
problems. Recent incidents of unrest in prisons had shown that 'there are
limits to how far or fast we can push the service without incurring
unacceptable risks'.
The service, he said, had a duty to accommodate those sent to prison by the
courts. But it had an equal duty to make it clear if it believed the size of
the prison population, resources or any other factor made it impossible to
achieve its goals. The rate of growth in the population threatened the
Prison Service's ability to look after prisoners with humanity and help them
lead law-abiding lives, he said.
Bibby Line, the shipping company, said it had been discussing the
possibility of floating prisons with the government for the past couple of
months. 'We have been discussing with the government as one of the many
options they are looking at.' But it added: 'There has been no firm
decision. We have also been looking at possible sites.' Two Bibby ships are
already being used as prisons in New York.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Female corporal awarded Pounds 17,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A WOMAN sacked by the Army after becoming pregnant, but now serving again as
a corporal thanks to a rule change, will receive Pounds 17,000 for the
16-month gap in her career, it was agreed today.
Corporal Kim Castledine, had told a Newcastle upon Tyne industrial tribunal
that she was unfairly dismissed, and claimed sexual discrimination. But
after discussions behind closed doors, the Ministry of Defence accepted
liability and she withdrew her application.
After the hearing, Corporal Castledine, from North Shields, Tyne and Wear,
said she would receive Pounds 17,000 through the agreement.
Her case was the first of 19 involving women claiming unfair dismissal
against the MoD after losing service jobs through pregnancy that are due to
be heard in north-east England tribunals over the next fortnight.
Corporal Castledine, now earning Pounds 12,000-a-year, said: 'I felt bitter
when, due to an unplanned pregnancy, I was told I couldn't stay on in August
1989, but I am pleased with the way things have turned out and I have no
hard feelings.'
The case follows last month's Pounds 33,000 award to Ms Deborah Miller, a
former RAF woman dismissed after becoming pregnant. The previous month, in
an out-of-court settlement, Ms Jackie Thornber, a former RAF medical
assistant, received Pounds 22,000 after her dismissal.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Limit on bias case payouts to end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to abolish the Pounds 11,000 compensation ceiling on both
race and sex discrimination cases, it announced yesterday.
The decision to remove the ceiling in cases of sex discrimination was forced
on the Government by the European Court of Justice, which ruled in August
that Britian's statutory ceiling was unlawful.
The government has gone further than the EC law required in deciding also to
abolish the limits for racial discrimination, and for religious
discrimination in Northern Ireland.
Announcing the government's decision in reply to a parliamentary question
from Mr Iain Duncan-Smith, Tory MP for Chingford, Miss Ann Widdecombe, the
employment minister, said: 'The government believes that all types of
unlawful discrimination should be liable to the same penalties.'
Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, said he hoped that regulations to
abolish the compensation ceiling for sex discrimination cases would come
into force later this month.
Amending the penalties for other forms of discrimination will take longer,
since it requires primary legis-lation.
The move has generated speculation that the government may have to concede
at some stage that the Pounds 11,000 limit on industrial tribunal cases of
unfair dismissal is no longer tenable.
Mr David Pannick QC, who has been examining the implications of the European
Court ruling, said there was nothing in EC law that barred an upper limit
for unfair dismissal claims.
However, he said 'There is a strong argument that no rational distinction
can be drawn between unfair treatment of one sort and unfair treatment of
another. You should get compen-sation to fit the loss you suffered.'

FT  02 NOV 93 / Unusual comrade at Transport House / A look at why the
country's biggest union has appointed a former finance director of Rover to
be its new chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SORTING out a troubled trade union is much the same as dealing with a
declining business. Both require cost control, improved sales (or
membership), better services to customers and better information flows.
So says someone who should know: Mr Peter Regnier, formerly a finance
director at carmaker Rover and chairman of the Pounds 100m-turnover Chloride
Electronics, who is now chief executive of the million-strong Transport and
General Workers' Union.
It is an unusual journey from the boardroom to Transport House, the union's
headquarters, and it has not been without controversy. Mr Regnier, 48, is
the son of an east London clerical worker who joined the Labour party when
he was 16. His political views did not change as he climbed the greasy pole
and he recalls the pain of having to face beaming boardroom colleagues in
the mornings after successive Labour election defeats.
In spite of taking a large pay cut to go to the TGWU he has disturbed
internal differentials by being paid a lot more than anyone else in the
organisation - including Mr Bill Morris, the general secretary. There has
also been grumbling from the left about the fact that he once reported to
Sir Michael Edwardes at BL and was indirectly involved with a union conflict
at Chloride.
Such sniping has not prevented Mr Regnier feeling at home in the TGWU. He
could be mistaken for a TGWU official. He already talks about 'surplus'
rather than profit and says that the obstacles to efficiency are no greater
than in a hierarchical, profit-driven company.
'You do not have the same authority as in a company,' he says. 'That means
you have to persuade rather than command. But when people have been
persuaded it runs very well. It's rather Japanese.'
Before his arrival Mr Morris had made a start with the shake-up of the union
by commissioning a consultancy report from Mr Adam Klein, a specialist in
trade unions.
The Klein report resulted in a reduction in the number of TGWU regions from
11 to eight and a 'clustering' of the 100-plus district offices.
That was the easy part. Mr Regnier's challenge, signposted in the Klein
report, is to establish proper financial disciplines and a suitable
information technology system in what has been one of Britain's most
politically divided and poorly managed unions.
At least the union's finances are now more respectable and it is no longer
living off its assets. Mr Regnier is also modernising its cashbook
accounting system and using the union's purchasing muscle more effectively.
But the real challenge, according to Mr Regnier, is for the TGWU to 'see
itself strategically'. And to do that it needs a new approach to information
technology and a new political culture.
The ethos of collective bargaining, says Mr Regnier, has been so dominant
(only about 2 per cent of union members are not covered by collective
bargaining) that it has not sold its other services well. For example, it
recovers more than Pounds 70m a year for the 35,000 members with industrial
injuries.
The fact that the administration of membership has been done at regional
level means the union has not had a proper national profile of its members.
'We have used information technology for administrative purposes and not to
understand our members,' he says.
But in 1992 118,000 people left the union and only 32,000 were recruited.
'To stop that drain we have to communicate with people and identify the
benefits of membership. We've got to start being proactive and our new
computer network can help us do that,' says Mr Regnier, who reckons he will
be at the union for another three years helping this become reality.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Tory peer keeps up pressure over rail sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD PEYTON, the former Conservative transport minister, warned he would
continue to oppose any watering down of the government's obligations to the
railway pension fund, as the government cut short its Commons debate on rail
privatisation.
Mr Tony Newton, leader of the House, last night unexpectedly announced that
debate was not going beyond 10pm and that debates today would be
'guillotined' through a timetable measure.
Mr Tim Rathbone, a Tory backbencher and potential rail rebel, warned that
the government risked losing 'quite a considerable amount of good will' if
it did not allow sufficient time tomorrow for discussion of key changes
decided by peers.
The government plans to change the Lords amendment to the bill in order to
require BR bids to be vetoed if there are 'credible alternatives'.
Mr Nicholas Winterton, another potential rail rebel, said he would abstain
in tomorrow's vote on the Lords change to the franchise rules. He said the
government's legislation was 'misguided'.
While the government is not expected to lose the vote, its problems over
rail privatisation were exacerbated by last night's intervention by Lord
Peyton. He has already been instrumental in forcing ministers to retreat
over their initial refusal to allow BR to bid for any franchises.
Ministers hope to overturn a Lords amendment tabled by Lord Peyton,
reimposing an obligation on the government to secure the pension trustees'
written agreement before altering the government's financial commitments.
The government believes the amendment would in effect give the pension-fund
managers a veto over government expenditure. However, Lord Peyton said he
would continue to oppose the government measures. 'The whole thing has been
a messy process and is typical of the mess the government has got itself
into over its rail proposals.'
Earlier in the day the government outlined its plans to encourage BR
management buy-out teams to bid for franchises in co-operation with
private-sector companies.
Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, said priority would be given to bids
where railway employees had a substantial interest. 'We are talking about
the management and staff of BR, either alone or in conjunction with other
private-sector companies, joining to bid for franchises.'
The government amendment ensuring priority for BR staff with a 'substantial
interest' in any franchise was backed by 321 votes to 283, a government
majority of 38.

FT  02 NOV 93 / National print talks may resume
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL negotiations in the printing industry look set to return next year
after being suspended this year. The GPMU print union said last night that
talks with the British Printing Industries Federation had 'proved positive'.
The union added: 'Whilst a number of difficulties still remain, both the
GPMU and BPIF representatives believe that there are sufficient grounds to
commence national negotiations in 1994.'
A report on the informal negotiations will be made to both the GPMU's
executive council and the BPIF national board of management on November 17.
Another announcement is expected after that meeting.
The union has threatened to withdraw from all its national agreements with
printing employers if industry-wide bargaining is scrapped.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Subcontractors' lobby formed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN UMBRELLA organisation has been established to represent the interests of
specialist construction subcontractors, which perform the largest value of
work done by builders.
The Constructors' Liaison Group will bring together trade organisations
acting on behalf of plumbers, electricians, structural steel contractors and
plasterers.
The move will meet demands from Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, who wants access to ministers and civil servants to be restricted
to a smaller number of better resourced and more powerful trade
organisations in each industrial sector.
The liaison group said that although specialist sub-contractors were often
small businesses, together they accounted for more than 44 per cent of all
staff and operatives in the construction industry.
The group wants to increase sub-contractors' representation on the Joint
Contracts Tribunal, responsible for developing standard forms and conditions
for the construction industry.
It will also seek improved arrangements with main contractors and clients to
ensure that subcontractors and their suppliers are paid on time.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Ford cuts Escorts by up to Pounds 1,370
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD, the leader of the UK new car market, has cut the prices of some of its
Escort range by up to Pounds 1,370, Kevin Done writes.
Ford, which has been heavily criticised in recent weeks by the retail motor
trade for 'forcing registrations' and 'distorting' the true state of the new
car market, said it was 'moving away from dealer incentives towards more
customer-focused incentives'.
The Escort was the best-selling car in the UK for the first nine months of
the year on aggregate, but came under pressure in September when it fell to
fourth place with the rival Vauxhall Astra coming second. Ford's market
share fell to 18.8 per cent in September.
The company said yesterday that it was launching a 'One Price' programme for
the Escort range, offering the saloon, hatchback or estate models at one
maximum price in each of three specification levels.
The Escort LX range, for example, previously at Pounds 10,890 to Pounds
12,260, will now have a maximum list price of Pounds 10,890 regardless of
body style or engine capacity.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Midlands rail freight depot proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBCOTT Estates, a private property company half-owned by Severn Trent
Water, yesterday asked Daventry District Council for planning permission to
construct a rail freight terminal with 2.3m sq ft of associated
manufacturing and distribution floorspace.
The move emphasises the growing importance as sites for distribution depots
of Midlands open land or surplus industrial sites close to the M1, M6 and
M42 motorways. It reflects the assumption that rail freight traffic will
increase after the Channel tunnel opens next year.
The Abbcott scheme, covering 160 acres five miles south of the M1/M6
interchange, would cost Pounds 140m to complete, but the terminal could
start operations after an investment of Pounds 35m on infrastructure.
The Daventry terminal could open in November 1995, depending on planning
procedures. It is then likely to be in competition with the terminal at
Landor Street, Birmingham, operated and recently expanded by Railfreight
Distribution, a British Rail subsidiary.
Railfreight Distribution has been examining sites in the Midlands to secure
long-term facilities after Landor Street reaches full capacity. It is
awaiting the result of a public planning inquiry over a proposed terminal
and business village at Hams Hall, east of Birmingham.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Unions receive strong endorsement from BA chairman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS have received a strong endorsement from the Sir Colin Marshall,
chairman of British Airways.
In the GMB general union's magazine, Sir Colin says unions help motivation
and play a 'good role' at BA.
'British Airways is happy to work with the unions and there is no question
of derecognising them,' he says. 'Unions play an important role in the
company because they collectively represent the interests of the workforce.'
His comments were reinforced by Mrs Rhiannon Chapman, director of the
Industrial Society. Writing in the society's newsletter, published today,
she urges employers to resist the temptation afforded by legislation to
de-recognise unions and to treat them instead as a 'valuable avenue' for
solving problems.
She says it is easy to underestimate the value of a good, experienced union
representative in 'oiling the wheels' and solving day-to-day problems.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Farming budget set for heavy cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT YEAR'S agriculture budget is likely to suffer significant cuts as a
result of the public spending round, with new measures for environmentally
sensitive farming and support for hill farmers both under threat.
Most of the Ministry of Agriculture's Pounds 2.77bn budget for next year
will go on Common Agricultural Policy spending and cannot be touched. But
the Treasury is expected to examine the domestic part of the budget, due to
reach Pounds 826m.
Conservationists and farmers are concerned that the start of the so-called
agri-environment programme, announced only three months ago, may be put off
for a year.
A delay would be embarrassing for Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture
minister, who has committed herself to ensuring more widespread adoption of
'green' policies in farming.
The programme, costing Pounds 30m over three years, is part of the reform of
the Common Agricultural Policy agreed by the European Community last year.
'This is a bad thing for two reasons,' said Ms Melinda Appleby, agriculture
policy officer for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which was
closely consulted by the government on the package. 'The introduction of
these schemes is the minimum the government need to do anyway, and there's a
fear when schemes like these are put off that it weakens the confidence the
farming industry will have in them.'
Hill farmers are worried about further sharp cuts in government support
after a reduction of Pounds 20m last year. Payments, which amount to about
Pounds 130m this year, go to 66,000 farmers in difficult upland areas,
particularly in Scotland and Wales. But the farmers have seen their incomes
soar this year by 40 per cent to 50 per cent on average as a result of
increased support from Brussels, falling interest rates and the devaluation
of the pound, which pushed up the Ecu-based prices they receive.
Mr Michael Jack, fisheries minister, yesterday said the government was
planning changes to the new rules to restrict from January the number of
days that fishermen can spend at sea. He said an announcement would be made
after a High Court application, which began yesterday, by the National
Federation of Fishermen's Organisations for a judicial review on the rules.
The federation rejected the changes. It said the government was suggesting
only minor alterations and not abandoning the policy.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Ex-MoD man 'acted properly'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CASE against a former Ministry of Defence official accused of accepting
'backhanders' from overseas arms companies rests on innuendo, Snaresbrook
Crown Court heard yesterday.
Mr Gordon Foxley, who led the MoD's ammunition procurement directorate,
acted properly as he awarded contracts for mortar fuses, rockets and tracer
rounds, said Mr Roy Amlot QC, defending.
He said the retired civil servant, who denies 12 charges of corruptly
receiving commission totalling Pounds 1.5m, had never 'pushed' for the deals
to be given to the companies said to have been paying him.
'If you are going to bribe someone in life, human nature being what it is,
there must be a reason for doing so,' Mr Amlot said. 'You do it to undermine
their integrity and loyalty and affect their position improperly.'
But in this case there was clear evidence that Mr Foxley had done nothing
'underhand, wrong or improper'.
On one occasion he had even recommended 'dual sourcing' to meet one of the
orders so that a company that the prosecution said was one of his secret
paymasters would not capture the market. 'What is the point of corrupting a
man who is not doing your bidding?' asked Mr Amlot.
The prosecution's case 'reeked of speculation', and suffered from an
'astonishing' lack of witnesses. The only live evidence came from two MoD
police officers.
The prosecution had sought to rely almost exclusively on documents. Nobody
had been called from the ministry, or the companies which allegedly paid out
money. There had been no evidence that Mr Foxley lived extravagantly.
The trial continues today.

FT  02 NOV 93 / US nuclear fuel move may threaten Dounreay plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOVES by the US government to persuade Belgium not to send spent nuclear
fuel for reprocessing in Britain are causing alarm at the UK Atomic Energy
Authority's plant at Dounreay in Caithness, which sees the US action as a
serious threat to its reprocessing operation.
Dounreay has a contract worth about Pounds 3m with a Belgian research
nuclear reactor to take 144 rods of spent fuel and reprocess them,
separating uranium from other waste and returning it all to Belgium.
But the US Department of Energy is understood to have offered the Belgian
authorities a highly advantageous price for taking the spent fuel and
storing it in South Carolina. It is also believed to have offered to
indemnify the Belgians against legal action from Dounreay for breach of
contract.
In order to allow the speedy import of the spent fuel into the US, the US
Energy Department has waived the rule requiring an environmental impact
study to be carried out before it can be imported.
The Dounreay plant, where the experimental fast-breeder reactor is due to
close next year, is concerned that the US could make similar moves with
other consignments of spent nuclear fuel in Europe, wiping out Dounreay's
reprocessing business.
It hopes to win a contract to reprocess a further 500 rods from Belgium,
giving it a total of Pounds 15m-worth of business. It now fears it might
have to close the reprocessing plant with the loss of 40 jobs.
The Clinton administration opposes reprocessing because it increases the
stock of weapons-grade uranium.
The Studiekentrum voor Kernenergie, which operates the BR2 reactor at Moll
in Belgium, is close to deciding whether to accept the US offer, which is
understood to involve a price of about Dollars 4,000 (Pounds 2,700) per rod
compared with the Dollars 20,000 cost of reprocessing it.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Lamont hits at 'fantasy' of EC union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the former chancellor, warned yesterday that Britain was
in danger of being drawn into a new 'bout of fantasy' by its European
Community partners as the new European Union received a low-key reception at
Westminster.
As Mr John Major told MPs that last week's EC summit had confirmed a new
spirit of 'realism', Mr Lamont attacked the decision to press ahead with the
creation in January of the European Monetary Institute.
Confirming his position as one of the leading sceptics on the backbenches,
the former chancellor said the timetable for economic and monetary union
drawn up in the Maastricht treaty had been shown to be totally unrealistic.
But by giving its consent to the establishment of the European Monetary
Institute in Frankfurt, the government was 'in danger of being drawn into a
further bout of fantasy by the European Community from which we will find it
difficult to extricate ourselves'.
Acknowledging the timetable for economic and monetary union as unrealistic,
Mr Major insisted nevertheless that Britain's agenda for the Community was
now centre-stage.
Every leader had agreed that the highest priority was to 'restore
sustainable non-inflationary growth and increase employment'.
Mr Major, who made no explicit reference in his prepared remarks to the
establishment of Maastricht's three-pillared union, said that he also
expected concrete proposals next month from the European Commission to give
force to the principle of subsidiarity, or decentralisation of
decision-making.
Brussels officials said the Commission would consider tomorrow a radical
list of Community directives that might be repealed under the subsidiarity
provision. But Britain's claim to authorship of the principle drew a laconic
response. During the negotiations that preceded Maastricht, Mr Major had
originally opposed German suggestions that subsidiarity be incorporated in
the treaty, the officials said.
Britain's fears that its planned white paper on growth, competitiveness and
employment might be used by the Commission as an excuse to propose rises in
spending were partially allayed.
A draft of the paper does suggest a significant expansion of trans-European
networks to give force to the single market. But it concentrates on a range
of measures - many of them tax changes - through which governments could
make their economies more 'employment-friendly'.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Unionist party welcomes peace moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of the Ulster Unionist party yesterday welcomed the announcement
that the British government would put forward its own proposals for bringing
about a lasting peace in Northern Ireland.
But they poured cold water on the notion that round-table talks were the
right format for discussing the proposals. The UUP's preferred structure
would be bilateral meetings between the UK government and the province's
constitutional parties.
Mr Ken Maginnis, UUP deputy leader and security spokesman, said the party
would not sit with Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and
Labour party, as long as the latter continued his talks with Mr Gerry Adams,
the Sinn Fein leader.
Mr Maginnis called on Downing Street to take a firmer line on terrorism if
it expected to get unionists back to the negotiating table.
In the wake of one of the worst weeks of sectarian violence in Northern
Ireland for two decades, 'the greatest danger now is in doing nothing about
terrorism, not doing nothing about talks', he said.
Speaking from Peru, where he is official UK observer to the constitutional
referendum, Mr Maginnis warned Mr John Major not to be 'panicked into new
political measures'.
He rejected the Dublin government's six-point plan, announced by Mr Dick
Spring, the Irish foreign minister, last week, as a basis for resuming
negotiations.
'The Irish government will try to seize the initiative, and if we move
forward solely on the basis of the Spring principles, this opens the door to
all sorts of interpretations and which will only increase the level of
violence,' he said.
A long-time advocate of selective internment of key paramilitary cadres, he
said that if internment measures were taken to 'disrupt the command and
control structures of the paramilitary organisations, the government would
get a very positive response from unionists'.
Mr Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, made no direct
reference to the possible resumption of round-table talks in Commons remarks
that were interpreted as surprisingly conciliatory. But he said many in
Ulster were 'alarmed' by some of the Spring plan's contents.
Mr John Taylor, UUP Europe spokesman, welcomed Downing Street's intention to
bring forward its own proposals but described round-table talks as 'a
mistaken formula'.
Pressure for such talks to resume was 'misplaced', Mr Taylor argued, calling
for new British proposals to be discussed instead in bilateral meetings
between Downing Street and the province's constitutional parties.
Mr William Ross, UUP chief whip, said the time for talks was past and action
was now needed. He joined Mr Maginnis in calling for the government to give
'careful consideration' to selective internment. The aim should be to
'behead' terrorist organisations of their command and control centres, he
said. Enough of the terrorist 'godfathers' were identifiable to make a
difference.
Sir James Kilfedder, the Ulster Popular Unionist MP, said it would be
'sensible and desirable' for talks between the province's constitutional
parties to resume as soon as possible. He also called for unequivocal
support for the security forces.
Mr James Molyneaux, the UUP leader, has so far refrained from commenting in
public on the increased pressure on his party to join round-table talks.
According to his office he will not do so until Wednesday at the earliest.
The party's nine Westminster MPs plan to hold their weekly meeting on
Thursday as usual.
In Dublin, the foreign ministry expressed disappointment at the unionist
reaction to its proposals, but said: 'We must wait for Mr Molyneaux to
respond.'

FT  02 NOV 93 / Think-tank attacks utility regulators' power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE regulators of privatised utilities are too powerful and should be made
more accountable, says a report from the Adam Smith Institute, the
free-market think-tank.
The institute says their style of regulation is confused, secretive and
ruled by personality cults. One of the worst features is that regulators
take advantage of the absence of a require-ment to justify their decisions,
in order to avoid court challenges of weak arguments.
This leaves utilities in the dark about the regulator's thinking and the
direction of policy. Serious mistakes are made, imposing heavy costs on the
utilities and their customers. The power of the regulators could also be
used by an incoming government in effect to renationalise the utilities.
The report calls for a radical rethink of the 10-year-old regulatory system
for gas, water, electricity, telephones and airports. These utilities should
be subjected to greater competition and the role of the regulators scaled
back accordingly, while being made more accountable to parliament.
But Who Will Regulate the Regulators? Adam Smith Institute, 23 Great Smith

FT  02 NOV 93 / Forth road bridge scheme attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S conser-vation body in Scotland yesterday urged the Scottish
Office to consider alternative options to building a second Forth road
bridge.
Scottish Natural Heritage said that a second road bridge could have serious
effects on the 'natural heritage'.
The Scottish Office is expected to announce early next year whether it wants
to go ahead with the bridge.
However the office it has already invited construction companies to register
interest in building a privately funded bridge, and says it believes a
second bridge will be needed in the next century.
Scottish Natural Heritage said moves to build a second bridge reflected a
policy of accommodating projected growth in road traffic rather than
exploring alternatives under an integrated transport policy. It said a new
bridge would increase dependence on cars and boost emissions of carbon
dioxide.
It said only a comprehensive review which included the option of not
building a second bridge and looked at transport, economic activity,
settlement patterns and environmental quality would provide an adequate
context for a decision on the Forth crossing.
The heritage body was set up by the government last year to administer
nature conservation in Scotland.
Its shot across the government's bows over the bridge came on the day of the
formation of an alliance of environmental and transport groups which
condemned plans for a new bridge.
ForthRight proposed higher tolls on the existing bridge, more money for
public transport in the Edinburgh and south Fife areas, and road
improvements both north and south of the Forth.

FT  02 NOV 93 / House prices are up on year, says society
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES have recorded an annual increase for the first time since
Nationwide started its house price index in 1990.
The building society said yesterday that an average house price of Pounds
53,932 during October was 1.7 per cent higher than in the corresponding
month last year.
Nationwide said the comparisons had been distorted partially by large price
falls which occurred last autumn when sterling left the European exchange
rate mechanism.
Nationwide is the second building society to announce that prices have begun
to rise year-on-year.
Halifax, Britain's biggest building society, reported a 1 per cent rise in
the 12 months to the end of September, the first annual increase since
January 1991. Halifax is due to publish its October house price figures
tomorrow.
Despite the improvement, the industry says the housing recovery remains
fragile.
Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide's operations manager, said yesterday: 'Although
conditions for a more substantial recovery in activity are in place, the
market remains muted to some extent, perhaps because of uncertainty ahead of
the Budget.
'Our estate agents report that in many areas there is a shortage of
good-quality, reasonably priced property available as potential sellers
delay putting their houses on the market. Even so, the market is less
volatile than it was a year ago.'
Nationwide said prices had risen by 1.5 per cent between September and
October, an increase of Pounds 783 in the average price.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Submissions for Channel 5 grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Independent Television Commission has received 131 expressions of
interest in future options for a new Channel 5 in the UK.
The number compares with the 30 submissions sent in three years ago when the
ITC was first thinking of advertising a new national television channel. In
the end the ITC turned down the only resulting bid from a consortium led by
Thames Television, mainly on the grounds of insufficient investor
commitment. Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act the commission is obliged 'to do
all it can' to get such a channel off the ground.
Seventy-six of the most recent submissions dealt with the three main options
for Channel 5 - re-advertisement of the original licence, using the
frequencies for digital broadcasting and a more local city-based service
that would require new legislation.
The total included 24 submissions from community groups interested in more
local broadcasting in Scotland. The further 55 submissions were in response
to an earlier ITC consultation documention the future of digital television.
The ITC declined to break down the Channel 5 submissions into support for
the three options. 'We do not want to give any more information without
context,' it said.
Those who have expressed an interest in a re-advertised Channel 5 include
Lord Hollick's Meridian Television, Thames Television (part of the Pearson
group, which owns the Financial Times), FiveTV and Time Warner. Associated
Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail and the Evening Standard, is
believed to have won a contract for the first London-wide cable television
channel.
The channel will be carried on the London-interconnect system, which links
the main cable television franchises of London. The linking of the
franchises of six major cable television operators makes such a channel
viable for the first time.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Legal right to interest on late debts is urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIALISTS, business people, bankers and opposition politicians
yesterday joined a campaign for legislation to give suppliers the right to
receive interest on overdue trade debts.
Launching a 1,200-strong register of supporters, the Forum of Private
Business called for legislation to 'give businesses the money that is
theirs'.
Supporters of the Prompt Payment Register include Sir Richard Greenbury,
chairman of Marks and Spencer; Lord Alexander, chairman of NatWest Bank; and
Midland Bank as well as opposition MPs.
The Department of Trade and Industry said it had not ruled out legislation
to tackle the problem of late payment, but it was concerned that legislation
had not been shown conclusively to work. For example, measures in some
Continental countries had 'not improved things very much'.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said the government had
spent 15 years studying the issue since the Law Commission first called for
legislation, and should now act.
Lord Ezra, Liberal Democrat spokesman and former chairman of the National
Coal Board, said the UK should enjoy the kind of legislation most
continental European countries already had in place.
Mr Stan Mendham, founder of the Forum of Private Business, said 89 per cent
of small and medium-sized companies in the UK were paid late. On average,
these businesses were paid 81 days after the invoice, or 51 days after the
average due date.
Dun and Bradstreet, the business information company which is also a
supporter of the register, says UK companies have to wait on average 20 days
longer after the due date than their counterparts in France, the next-worst
payers in Europe.
Writing in the Financial Times in September, Lord Alexander said more than
Pounds 15bn of trade debts to small and medium sized businesses were overdue
at any one time. 'Too many businesses consider it acceptable, and some even
consider it astute practice, not to pay their bills on time,' he wrote.
By setting up a national register, the Forum of Private Business hopes to
demonstrate that pressure for legislation has wide support from businesses
and their pressure groups.
The forum wants the government to focus on late payment, the main problem
facing small businesses, rather than the issue of non-payment or disputes.
Mr Mendham said a central element of legislation should be provision for
statutory rights to interest payments after the agreed due date. These
should be collected after the principal had been paid, and should be
collectable up to six years after the interest liability was first incurred.
Mr Steve Hill, insolvency partner of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy
firm, called late payment 'the Aids virus of the commercial community' and
'economic madness'.
Marks and Spencer said it had found that paying promptly led to better
service from its suppliers.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Top civil servants seek new ethics code
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CIVIL SERVANTS are to press Lord Justice Scott to consider proposals for a
new code of ethics for Whitehall in the light of evidence emerging in the
arms-for-Iraq inquiry.
The Association of First Division Civil Servants, which represents middle
and high-ranking civil servants, is submitting a report to the judge
underlining the need for greater 'clarity and openness' in the relationship
between officials and ministers.
Ms Elizabeth Symons, the union's general secretary, said last night that the
submission had been prepared at the request of 'a lot of our members' who
were concerned about issues of accountability and responsibility that have
emerged in the Scott inquiry.
Yesterday Mr Alan Barrett, a senior Ministry of Defence official, told the
inquiry that he had no choice but to go along with a decision by ministers
not to announce to parliament a relaxation to the curbs on arms sales to
Iraq.
'We may have been playing with words, but once ministers had decided what we
were going to publish or not publish we had no choice,' he said.
Other Whitehall officials have told how they prepared advice for their
ministers which glossed over the extent to which the export of dual-use
equipment contravened declared policy.
A wide-ranging inquiry into the role of the civil service is to be published
early next year by the Commons Treasury and civil service committee.
It is hoped that the judge will focus on the role of policymakers in
Whitehall and on the responsibility of ministers to parliament.
The association has advanced the case for a code of ethics which would in
effect supersede the notes of guidance, drawn up in 1985 by Sir Robert
Armstrong, then head of the civil service. The notes state that civil
servants owe their first duty to the government. The association, however,
argues that its members have a wider duty towards the democratic system.
Yesterday Mr Barrett said MoD officials had been forced on the defensive
regarding policy towards Iraq in the face of the opposition to the
government guidelines pursued by Mr Alan Clark, defence minister from 1989
to last year.
The hearing continues today.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Decline reported in export losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NCM, Britain's leading export credit insurer, yesterday said it had detected
tentative signs of economic recovery in continental Europe.
In its latest report on the export outlook it says fewer exporters are
suffering losses because of non-payment, and payment delays have become less
severe.
The quarterly study by Cardiff-based NCM Credit Insurance shows that
non-payment problems eased in 11 of the 12 EC markets in the year to
end-September compared with the year to end-June. The exception was
Luxembourg, which is not a significant export market for the UK.
Payment delays increased by 12 per cent in the year to September, but this
marks a significant improvement from the picture three months earlier, in
which NCM reported a worsening of 52 per cent year-on-year.
'Our findings suggest that in some parts of continental Europe the recession
may have bottomed out,' said Mrs Connie Randall, NCM's director for business
strategy and reinsurance.
She nevertheless warned that bankruptcies were expected to be high in
Germany and business conditions uncertain in Belgium, France and Greece. 'In
the short run, the outlook for UK exports to Europe remains bleak,' she
said.
NCM, which provided insurance cover for Pounds 14bn of UK exports last year,
accounting for 80 per cent of the market, reported a dramatic deterioration
in payment delays in Italy - 72 per cent up in the year to end-September. In
Spain and France delays were reduced by 10 per cent and 18 per cent
respectively. Whereas one in five exporters to France experienced payment
defaults in the year to end-June, just one in 11 reported defaults in the
year to end-September.

FT  02 NOV 93 / New powers for child agency
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SINGLE MOTHERS struggling to bring up children on benefit may be able to
jump a three-year queue for maintenance assessments, the government
announced yesterday.
The controversial Child Support Agency, set up in April, has been given new
powers to deal with urgent cases.
The announcement from Mr Alistair Burt, social security minister, received a
lukewarm welcome from pressure groups. They said the reforms of the agency -
responsible for the assessment, collection and enforcement of maintenance
payments from fathers - had not addressed fundamental flaws.
The Commons social security committee is to examine claims that the agency
concentrates on fathers who already pay towards the upkeep of their
families, rather than chasing runaway fathers.

FT  02 NOV 93 / The secret art of disguising tax rises: Emma Tucker explains
what fiscal tricks Kenneth Clarke may have up his sleeve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS an art to disguising tax increases which the UK government has
started to refine. Tax increases announced in the March Budget amounted to
the equivalent of an extra 7p on the basic rate of income tax, a fact which
escaped the notice of most taxpayers.
So whatever else happens on November 30, an increase in the basic rate from
25p to 26p or more should be ruled out. But that does not mean Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, cannot raise revenue through higher income tax.
One option, potentially lucrative and harder to interpret than a rise in the
basic rate, is to alter the present system of personal tax allowances.
All taxpayers currently receive a certain part of their income tax-free. For
single taxpayers below the pension age, that personal allowance is Pounds
3,445 a year.
The value of the tax relief that this provides is determined by the
taxpayers' marginal tax rates. So those paying tax at the rate of 40 per
cent receive relief worth Pounds 1,378 - 40 per cent of Pounds 3,445. Bottom
rate taxpayers get only 20 per cent, or Pounds 689.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that restricting the
personal allowance to the lowest 20 per cent rate for all taxpayers would
generate revenue of more than Pounds 5bn a year.
Such a move would lead, in effect, to all individual tax bills being
calculated as if the allowance did not exist. The bills would then be
reduced by Pounds 689 - 20 per cent of Pounds 3,445.
People who pay only the bottom rate of tax would thus be no worse off. High
earners would be hit hardest as the threshold at which the top rate of tax
starts to be paid would be reduced. The 40 per cent band now cuts in at
Pounds 27,145 (after the tax-free Pounds 3,445, the next Pounds 2,500 is
taxed at 20 per cent and the next Pounds 21,200 at 25 per cent). With the
allowance restricted to 20 per cent, the top rate of tax would be paid on
any income over Pounds 23,700. But as the institute points out: 'A reform of
this sort would represent a very hefty increase in taxation, especially if
it were to be imposed on top of the tax increases already announced.'
To soften the blow, Mr Clarke could spend some of the revenue raised on
widening the 20 per cent income tax band, due to be widened to Pounds 3,000
in April next year. The institute reckons that half the revenue raised
through restricting allowances to 20 per cent would be enough to widen the
20 per cent tax band to about Pounds 5,250.
Such a move would look good coming from an administration that insists it is
still aiming for a 20p in the pound basic rate of income tax. Even after
doing this, the package would raise more than Pounds 2.5bn.
'If restricting the value of allowances were to be presented as part of a
move towards a 20 per cent standard rate of income tax, then widening the 20
per cent band would add credibility to this claim and would also reduce some
of the cash losses,' the institute said.
More adventurous, and politically easier to sell, would be to 'give back'
some of the Pounds 5.7bn raised by restricting allowances in the form of a
basic rate tax cut.
According to the institute, a cut in the basic rate to 24 per cent from 25
per cent would reduce the additional revenue earned from the restricted
personal allowance scheme to about Pounds 3bn. A more drastic cut - to 23
per cent - would leave only about Pounds 400m net additional revenue.
Whichever way the chancellor chooses to play it, both packages would
generate more revenue than the unpopular decision, announced in the March
Budget, to levy value added tax on domestic fuel, which next financial year
will raise a paltry Pounds 950m. Restricting allowances would also be less
regressive.
The government is unlikely to go as far as restricting the personal
allowance to 20 per cent in this Budget, even with the sweeteners. On top of
the measures announced in March, it would eat heavily into the pay packets
of top-rate taxpayers. A simpler and more palatable option is to freeze the
value of the personal allowance rather than increasing it in line with
inflation. When this happens taxpayers do not see the amount they take home
at the end of the month decrease even though, in real terms, they are worse
off.
According to the institute, freezing allowances, coupled with freezing the
point at which higher-rate tax starts to become payable, would raise an
extra Pounds 670m a year.
'With low inflation this is a relatively inconspicuous and painless way of
raising income for tax,' the institute says.
Tinkering with tax allowances thus offers the government a potentially
lucrative source of revenue. It also has the advantage of being harder to
grasp than a straightforward rise in the basic rate.
As Mr Chris Giles of the institute puts it: 'You would notice the bottom
right hand corner of your pay package go down, but generally you wouldn't
understand why.'

The decision was forced on the government by the European Court of Justice,
which ruled in August that Britain's statutory ceiling was unlawful. The
government has gone further than the EC law required and decided also to
abolish the limits for racial discrimination, and for religious
discrimination in Northern Ireland.
Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said he hoped that regulations to
abolish the compensation ceiling for sex discrimination would come into
force later this month. Amending the penalties for other forms of
discrimination will take longer, since it requires primary legislation.
The move prompted speculation that the government may have to concede at
some stage that the Pounds 11,000 limit on Industrial Tribunal cases of
unfair dismissal is no longer tenable.
Mr David Pannick QC, who has been examining the implications of the European
Court ruling, said there was nothing in EC law that barred an upper limit
for unfair dismissal claims. He added: 'There is a strong arguement that no
rational distinction can be drawn between unfair treatment of one sort and
unfair treatment of another.'

FT  02 NOV 93 / Joint bids for rail franchises allowed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to allow British Rail management buy-outs to bid for
franchises in co-operation with private sector companies, Mr Roger Freeman,
transport minister, announced yesterday.
He said priority would be given to bids where railway employees had a
substantial interest. 'We are talking about the management and staff of BR,
either alone or in conjunction with other private sector companies, joining
to bid for franchises.'
Some of the proposed franchises cover large parts of the BR network. Some
critics of the railways bill, which returned to the Commons yesterday after
its passage through the House of Lords, believe buy-out teams will only be
interested in bidding for smaller rail franchises.
The government also plans to bolster buy-outs by weakening a Lords'
amendment to the bill which seeks to allow BR itself to bid for franchises.
The government's change would require the franchise director to veto a BR
bid if there was a 'credible alternative'.
Mr Freeman believes subsidies would make loss-making Regional Railways and
Network SouthEast attractive to bidders. Almost half their operating costs
would be met by the government over seven years.
The government has now said bidders could be awarded franchises that last as
long as 15 years, more than twice the length previously expected. This may
attract more private bidders.
However, it emerged yesterday that British Rail's advisers fear the Treasury
may not allow the Department of Transport to transfer subsidies over the
long term to franchises running loss-making services.
The government yesterday denied that short-term franchises would make it
difficult for bidders to finance operations.
Ministers believe franchises would not need large amounts of working capital
because they would have revenues from operations or a government subsidy if
the ventures were loss making.
Mr Nick Harvey, Liberal Democrat transport spokesman, said 'virtually
nobody' was showing any interest in bidding for franchises.

FT  02 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Lloyd's to study Bosporus safety
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S Register of London has been commissioned by a group of western oil
companies to study shipping safety in the Bosporus.
Lloyd's confirmed it had been commissioned by unnamed US oil concerns to
present findings on environmental and navigational safety by mid-December as
western oil companies expanding in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan seek Turkish
government support for an early decision on the export route. The latest
move is apparently aimed at assuaging Turkish concern at the dangers posed
by the projected increase in tanker traffic.
Separately, a study by Murray &amp; Fenton of London commissioned by the
Turkish-led pipeline consortium concluded that limited increases in tanker
traffic could be accommodated with a new radar system.
The Turkish Transport Ministry has an outstanding tender for a computerised
system, for which Marconi of the UK and Thompson CSF of France have made
proposals.

airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS

   DALLAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Federico Pena, the US transportation secretary, yesterday delivered a
strongly worded threat that the US would 'vigorously defend' US airlines
against foreign competitors whose governments discriminated against US
carriers.
He said the US would take action 'through all available means' against
airlines whose governments failed to honour the rights of US airlines under
bilateral agreements. 'We reserve the timing and force of our actions to our
own judgment,' he said.
'No one should underestimate our resolve in this regard.'
Mr Pena, addressing the world's airline industry at the annual meeting of
the International Air Transport Association, said the strong defence of
existing bilateral agreements was part of the US strategy of moving towards
full airline liberalisation.
Protectionism, he said, imposed 'huge' costs on the travellers and
businesses in the very countries that attempted it.
By protecting inefficient carriers instead of prodding them to adjust,
governments harmed every other sector of their own economies and constrained
the entire world economy.
Mr Pena singled out for attack the efforts of 'a group of airlines in the
east Asian markets' to curb the access of US carriers to the world's fastest
growing aviation market, accusing their governments of 'playing with fire'.
'The US is weary of running chronic, multi-billion-dollar trade deficits
with nations whose governments lecture Americans on the need to produce more
efficient, more desirable products,' he said.
'Let me be direct: US air carriers are providing exactly the sort of highly
efficient, competitive services that Asian customers will buy - if only
their governments would let them.'
Mr Pena said the US planned to explore the formation of a global coalition
of like-minded, free-market-oriented nations that recognised the benefits to
citizens and national economies of expanded air travel.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Sutherland, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, yesterday urged the 116 nations taking part in the Uruguay Round
of trade liberalising talks 'to speed up progress in the negotiations' in
order to conclude the round by the agreed deadline of December 15.
Pointing out that there were only 45 days left, he told the top-level trade
negotiations committee that he believed it was 'still within our grasp'.
However, he warned against leaving too many unresolved issues on the table
for the final phase of the negotiations.
Talks on improving access to markets for farm and industrial goods have made
slower progress than hoped.
Mr Sutherland said there had been some positive moves over the past month
but criticised the 'lamentable failure' of the Quad nations - the US, the
European Community, Japan and Canada - to nail down the details of the
tariff-cutting package agreed in principle in Tokyo last July.
He said the Quad, especially the US and EC, had a particular responsibility
to provide leadership in the market access negotiations.
'Mutual recrimination is neither useful nor helpful,' he added.
Trade officials present at the meeting said a number of delegations had also
lambasted the US for creating other difficulties in the negotiations.
They were particularly critical of Washington's intention to take a blanket
exemption for taxation under the proposed services accord, which would allow
it to discriminate against foreign companies in tax matters in breach of
fundamental Gatt principles.
The US also came under fire over financial services, where it plans to bar
Japan and developing countries from improved market access to its banking
and insurance markets, and over its opposition to a strong Multilateral
Trade Organisation to succeed Gatt.
Under the present negotiating schedule, the hope is still to have 'a
well-defined approximation of the content, size and final shape of the
overall market access package by November 15', alongside revised texts on
the MTO and disputes settlement.

FT  02 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Azerbaijan in Caspian Sea oilfields deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AZERBAIJAN has agreed terms with a consortium of western oil companies to
develop oilfields in the Caspian Sea, in a contract worth more than Dollars
7bn (Pounds 4.6bn).
An official for the consortium, led by British Petroleum, Statoil of Norway
and the US companies Unocal, Pennzoil and Amoco, confirmed yesterday that an
agreement in principle had been signed in Baku to develop the Azeri and
Chirag fields.
The agreement was initialled by the team set up by the Azeri authorities and
the consortium members. It still has to be ratified by the Azeri parliament
and approved by the government, but it would appear to end months of
deadlock as the Azeri government of Mr Gaidar Aliyev sought to renegotiate
the contract terms. It is understood the consortium will split the proceeds
with the Azeri authorities on a 20:80 production-sharing basis, after
development and loan costs have been deducted. The larger share would go to
the Azeris.
The consortium is to pay the Azeris a signature bonus of Dollars 500m, half
paid when the agreement is ratified by parliament, the rest when an export
pipeline deal is finalised.
The two fields, which are expected to be in production by 1996, comprise
about 3bn barrels of known reserves.
The original negotiations included a third field at Gunashli, which is
already in production and operated by Socar, the state oil company. Gunashli
accounts for close to a third of Azerbaijan's current total output.
The latest deal will spur negotiations about a possible export route for the
oil. Turkey is urging Baku to use a proposed pipeline to its Mediterranean
coast, avoiding congestion in the Bosporus if the Black Sea route is chosen.

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A GERMAN consortium headed by the big plant contractor SMS Schloemann-Siemag
has won the contract for a DM1bn (Pounds 406.5m) steel plant at
Magnitogorsk, in the heart of Russia's Urals steel industry.
The cold reduction mill will have a capacity of about 2m tonnes of sheet
metal a year, and will come into production at the beginning of 1997,
according to an announcement from SMS company head-quarters in Dusseldorf
yesterday.
The 10-member consortium includes Siemens, the engineering conglomerate,
Hochtief, the Essen construction company, and MAN Gutehoffnungshutte, as
well as Magnitostroy, the construction company in Magnitogorsk.
The contract is worth DM300m to SMS, which has just announced a 54 per cent
drop in profits for 1992/93, to DM39m on a turnover of DM1.968bn, because of
the worldwide slowdown in investment plans, especially in the steel
industry.
The company is involved in three other big projects in Russia, including
another cold reduction mill (with Siemens) at Novo-Lipetsk, the
modernisation of a hot rolling mill at Novo-Lipetsk, and the modernisation
of an aluminium plant at Samara.
A spokesman said yesterday that the contract was on a cash basis, and would
be financed by revenues from steel exports of the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical
Kombinat (MMK).
It does not have any export credit guarantees from Hermes, the German export
credit agency.
With production capacity of 16m tonnes and a workforce of 65,000 people, MMK
is one of Russia's biggest steel makers.

FT  02 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Texan to invest DM550m in new Berlin
complex

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PROMINENT Texan property developer will invest more than DM550m (Pounds
223m) in building a new office, hotel and residential complex in the heart
of Berlin's cultural centre despite the federal government's repeated delays
in moving the entire administration to the capital.
Hines Interests Limited Partnership, which has been responsible for
complexes ranging from Postal Square, Washington, to the 30th Street
Station, Philadelphia, will develop the area around the Gendarmenmark. Now
east Berlin's cultural centre, it was the city's banking quarter before the
second world war.
This is the first time Hines has moved into the European property
development market. Mr Gerald Hines, its chairman, said Berlin provided 'a
unique opportunity. This is an untapped sector. It is also a crucial axis
between eastern and western Europe. There is no other city which offers so
much potential.'
In addition to developing over 50,000 sq metres of property on 8,400 sq
metres of land, the company has been chosen by Sony to design the interior
of its new European headquarters on Potsdamer Platz, which straddled the
eastern side of the Berlin wall.
Unlike other property developers who arrived in Berlin after the wall was
pulled down four years ago this month, Mr Hines has not encountered big
difficulties over outstanding property claims. Instead of dealing with each
individual case, the company bought the entire property from the Senate, or
government of Berlin, which in turn will compensate any claimants.
Since 1990, property developers have already invested DM11bn in this part of
the Mitte, or centre of old Berlin. The other prominent developers include
Tischman Spier, which is building a Galeries Lafayette shopping and office
complex, and the American Business Centre backed by Mr Ronald Lauder, heir
to the US cosmetics magnate.

FT  02 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Fiat gears up to boost Polish operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIAT, the Italian carmaker, is to expand its operations in Poland, with the
local assembly of its Uno small car set to start early next year.
Initially Fiat will carry out the final assembly of the cars at its plant at
Bielsko Biala in southern Poland from SKD (semi-knocked down) kits supplied
from Turin.
The Italian group, which has established a dominant position in the Polish
car industry following its takeover last year of FSM, the former Polish
state-owned car producer, will supply fully welded and painted Uno car
bodies and other important components from Italy.
Production of the Uno is planned to begin in January, with output likely to
total around 20,000 in 1994.
Fiat is also conducting a feasibility study into the building of a new paint
plant at its outdated Bielsko Biala factory as part of its plans to invest
around Dollars 840m (Pounds 565m) in its Polish operations from 1993 to
1996.
The new paint plant would allow the assembly capacity of the Bielsko Biala
factory to be raised and would enable Uno production in Poland to move later
to more sophisticated full CKD (completely knocked down) kit assembly, in
which the Uno car bodies would also be welded and painted in Poland.
Overall Fiat car production in Poland this year is expected virtually to
double to around 280,000 from 144,000 in 1992, according to Mr Paolo
Marinsek, managing director of Fiat Auto Poland.
Fiat's takeover of FSM, which was originally agreed with the Polish
authorities in May last year, was finally completed six weeks ago, when the
Italian carmaker assumed full operating control in the biggest privatisation
deal ever reached in Poland and one of the biggest ever undertaken in
eastern Europe.
The former FSM, which has now been renamed Fiat Auto Poland, is Fiat's sole
production location in the world for its smallest cars, the outdated 126,
which is sold only in Poland, and the Cinquecento, which has been launched
in the last 18 months for sale throughout Europe.
Fiat's strong local production presence had also allowed it to raise sharply
its share of the Polish market for imported cars, said Mr Marinsek.
The Polish new car market was expected to total more than 200,000 this year
compared with 198,000 in 1992 and Fiat expected to account for around 55 per
cent of all new car sales compared with 39 per cent last year, he said.
It expected to control around 31 per cent of all imported new cars and 65
per cent of sales of domestically produced cars.
Overall Fiat production in Poland should be running by December at 1,090
cars a day (280,000 a year) at its two plants, compared with 850 at the end
of 1992 and only 350 a day in September 1991, when it began the
restructuring of the FSM operations.

FT  02 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Devaluation - and Asia - lift Italian
exports / A remarkable expansion into the newly industrialised countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PAOLO BARATTA has the rare distinction of possessing the one problem-free
portfolio in the Italian government.
As minister of foreign trade, he is presiding over the most remarkable
export growth any industrialised country has seen in the past two decades.
On average the value of exports in the first half of the year is up 19 per
cent compared with the same period in 1992. They are also up more than 7 per
cent in volume terms.
The growth is across the board. Italian exporters have been quick to switch
away from the stagnant markets of the main industrialised economies into the
fast growing economies of Asia and Latin America. But thanks to the free
float of the lira, which has seen it depreciated by about 20 per cent since
September 1992, Italy has also managed to increase its share of EC markets,
notably in Germany.
One reason for the sharp rise is the fact that exporters are no longer
under-declaring sales in the wake of the lira devaluation. In the two
previous years exporters had taken advantage of an over-valued lira to
under-invoice.
'Devaluation obviously has been important but I don't share the view that
this is the sole reason,' says Mr Baratta. 'One has to ask why British
exports, which have enjoyed a similar competitive advantage from devaluation
at the same time as the lira, have not performed nearly as well.'
Among the strongest sectors of Italian exports have been industrial
machinery and mechanical goods, the core of which are machine tools. This
industry, which has shrunk in the UK for instance, has remained well-rooted
in central and northern Italy.
'These are not big groups producing very large sophisticated machinery like
the Germans and the Japanese; but they are small and medium-sized, very
flexible and ideal for finding niches between what the Germans and Japanese
can offer,' says Mr Baratta.
He believes both the size and flexibility of Italian engineering groups
adapt well to the specific needs of the fast modernising economies of the
Far East, where the demand for machinery is rising exponentially. Their less
complex technology makes it easier to train people, both on the spot and in
intensive sessions.
China is a case in point where exports this year are set to double to more
than L4,000bn (Pounds 1.6bn), accounting for nearly 3 per cent of total
exports. The bulk of this is accounted for by machine tools and engineering
goods, especially machinery for the textile industry.
Such are the business prospects in China that the ministry, in conjunction
with its Chinese counterpart, is to set up a series of 'base camps' there.
These will be geared to small and medium-sized exporters, offering them
space near industrial zones for logistical support, parts storage space and
training facilities.
There is also strong demand for Italy's consumer products as a result of the
new income being generated in the fast growing economies. Clothing, shoes,
luxury goods and furniture and top-range household goods are all doing well.
They are competing less on price than they are on brand labels, design and
quality.
Trade with non-OECD countries in the first half this year was 26 per cent of
total exports compared with 18 per cent for 1992 and 15 per cent in 1990. If
this trend continues, non-EC exports will soon be more important than those
of the Community. So far this year Italy's exports to the EC account for 54
per cent of the total. Two years ago they were close to 60 per cent.
At the same time, with depressed domestic demand, Italy has seen its import
bill drop in spite of the devaluation. Thus in the case of Germany, Italy
has recorded a first half trade surplus of L2,734bn compared with a L3,995bn
deficit in the same period in 1992. A similar trend was evident with France
its second trade partner and to a lesser extent with the UK.
Italy's real exchange rate is now back to the level of the 1970s, when the
current account was broadly in balance. In the latter part of the 1980s and
in 1990-91 exports lost their momentum and the trade balance deteriorated.
The annual growth in 1991 exports was down to 3 per cent.
This reflected a combination of an over-valued lira and a period of
sustained high increases in production costs, especially wages. Having long
risen above inflation, wages for the past two years have been below
inflation in the main manufacturing sectors. So far this year wage rises
have been held down to at least one percentage point below inflation, which
has averaged 4.4 per cent a year. Exporters believe an agreement with the
unions in July, which abolished the indexation of wages and linked rises to
productivity, has introduced an important element of wage cost stability.

FT  02 NOV 93 / US industrial growth continues for October
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE current US expansion in manufacturing continued in October, but with
little evidence of a wave of job creation, according to the National
Association of Purchasing Management.
Its monthly index of economic activity, based on reports by purchasing
executives, rose to 53.8 per cent last month from the 49.7 per cent of
September. Any reading over 50 per cent indicates expansion.
Production was at the highest level since last March, with 15 of the 20
industrial sectors covered reporting improvement over September. The new
orders index jumped to 60.8 per cent compared with 50.3 per cent in the
previous month and was the highest since the 67.2 per cent recorded in
January.
The backlog of orders increased significantly in October, with new export
orders rising for the third consecutive month. Both inventories and prices
also fell.
The NAPM, noting that its main index had averaged 51.8 per cent over the
first 10 months of this year, said a continuation of October's levels for
the final two months would imply an overall real growth in gross domestic
product for 1993 of about 2.6 per cent.
However, despite this expansion, manufacturing employment fell again in
October, although by a much smaller amount than the previous month. The
employment index stood at 45.5 per cent, up one point from September and the
highest since last March.
A reading below 48 per cent indicates no net growth in jobs. But the current
employment figures do also imply measurable gains in productivity.
The only industries reporting growth in employment in October compared to
September were furniture, fabricated metals, plastics and rubber, leather
and transportation equipment.
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department yesterday said spending on new
construction projects rose by 0.8 per cent in September.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Industry may face Dollars 4bn bill to clean US rivers

<TEXT>
THE US Environmental Protection Agency proposed tough new regulations on
pulp and paper makers yesterday in an attempt to clean up US rivers.
The regulations, which might cost US industry more than Dollars 4bn (Pounds
2.6bn) in capital expenditure, would call upon pulp and paper mills to
'virtually eliminate' dioxin discharges to rivers and cut toxic air
emissions by 70 per cent.
Dioxin enters the human food supply when it is absorbed by fish in
contaminated rivers. Under the terms of the Clean Water Act, the EPA must
take both economic and public-health effects into account when setting
environmental policy.
EPA officials estimate that 350 mills might be affected by the proposals.
Environmentalists and industry leaders were quick to criticise the new plan
yesterday.
The paper industry opposed the regulations, saying they would hurt the
economy, cost jobs and threaten the fledgling recycling industry.
The American Forest and Paper Association estimated that the regulations
would close 30 mills, leaving 19,000 mill workers without jobs and possibly
causing the loss of 250,000 related jobs.
Mr Red Cavaney, president of the AFPA, said the proposed changes would
divert resources from capital expansion and productivity improvements for
'insignificant environmental benefits'.
Mr David Bailey, a lawyer with the Environmental Defence Fund, said the
regulations would not go far enough to prevent dioxin from entering food
supplies and water life, and that the EPA standard for allowable emissions
was still too high.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Dinkins struggles in NY race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Rudolph Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate, remains the slight
favourite to oust Mr David Dinkins, the Democrat, as mayor of New York today
in the most eye-catching of dozens of elections across the United States.
The latest polls put the two men on a virtual dead-heat, but this may
understate the extent of support for Mr Giuliani, the former federal
prosecutor.
Four years ago Mr Dinkins beat Mr Giuliani by only 2 per cent, having taken
an apparent double-digit advantage into polling day. Voter turnout among the
city's minorities, especially blacks, will be pivotal.
In other closely watched races, Mr James Florio, the Democratic governor of
New Jersey, still leads Mrs Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican
challenger, though by nothing like the 10-15 point margin he was accorded
two weeks ago.
This race is seen as a mini-referendum on the policies of the Clinton
administration. Both President Bill Clinton and his wife have campaigned for
Mr Florio, whose tax increases three years ago reduced his popularity to
near oblivion.
In the governor's race in Virginia, Ms Mary Sue Terry, the Democrat, is
still trailing Mr George Allen, the Republican son of a famous football
coach.
Mr Michael Farris, the even more conservative Republican candidate for
lieutenant governor, appears headed for defeat.
Changes are also expected at the helm of several troubled US cities, partly
brought about, as in Detroit and Atlanta, by the retirement of the old
generation of Democratic black urban leaders. Contests in Cleveland, Seattle
and Minneapolis will be closely watched.
So, despite its different racial composition, will be the outcome in Miami,
where Mr Stephen Clark, an older white Democrat who speaks no Spanish, is
favoured over a Cuban exile and an outspoken black. Mr Clark, however, is
endorsed by the outgoing mayor, Mr Adolpho Suarez.
In California, Proposition 174 would provide education subsidies, in the
form of vouchers worth about Dollars 2,600 (Pounds 1,750) a head, useable at
private schools.
In spite of the support of former President Ronald Reagan and leading
national and religious conservatives, it is expected to lose today because
of an effective campaign against it by Mr Pete Wilson, the incumbent
Republican governor, and by Mr Clinton.
But a more modest version could well carry the day in the future.
In Washington state, two initiatives, 601 and 602, are designed to force
rollbacks in state spending. Public opinion on both seems evenly divided.
The Wall Street securities house Kidder, Peabody has agreed to keep its
headquarters and 3,000 employees in New York city in return for Dollars 31m
in tax incentives from the municipal government, writes Patrick Harverson.
The decision was a victory for Mr Dinkins, as the loss of Kidder would have
been a blow to the city's shrinking tax base and his re-election hopes.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Washington builds bridges to Beijing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR US defence department official is in Beijing for talks which mark
the end of Washington's four-year ban on high-level military contacts and
are the latest sign of a revitalisation of its policy towards China.
The discussions being held by Mr Charles Freeman, assistant secretary of
defence for regional security affairs, with the People's Liberation Army
follow separate visits to Beijing in recent weeks by Mr Mike Espy, the
agriculture secretary, and senior State Department and trade officials.
Also indicating an improvement in relations, Mr Li Peng, China's premier,
said in remarks published yesterday that this month's meeting in Seattle
between President Bill Clinton and Mr Jiang Zemin, China's president, 'is a
good thing and is of great significance'.
Officials of both sides have, however, been careful not to raise hopes that
significant Sino-US agreements could be reached in Seattle.
The recent visits by US officials to Beijing represent an attempt by Mr
Clinton to broaden the relationship between the two countries, which has
been tense and restricted since the 1989 killings in Tiananmen Square.
Recently relations have been further clouded by heightened US pressure on
China over human rights and weapons sales.
The new US strategy is to maintain insistence on improvement in these areas
but at the same time to engage China in a much broader range of discussions
so that the issues in dispute cease to dominate the bilateral relationship.
'We are now embarked on a policy of re-engaging,' a US official said. 'We
are no longer denying ourselves the possibility of talking to the Chinese at
the level necessary.'
The hope is that a broader dialogue would make it easier for the US to
explain where it found Chinese policies to be objectionable and to ob-tain
changes acceptable to China.
However, US officials are in no doubt that Mr Clinton may revoke China's
most favoured nation (MFN) trading status next year if progress is not seen
on several fronts.
Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, told businessmen recently: 'I
don't believe we can sustain the position for MFN for beyond next June
unless we see some improvement in the human rights field by the Chinese, as
well as reform in connection with trade practices and progress in the
non-proliferation front.'
He made clear that Washington wanted changes soon rather than at the last
minute before Mr Clinton's decision next year.
China dismisses US linkage of human rights and trade as a relic of the Cold
War and has called for greater US-China contacts. It says MFN is normal
practice rather than a favour to be granted by the US.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas yesterday called on all Mexico's political parties
to sign a pact of civility to ensure 'transparent and exemplary'
presidential elections next August.
In his annual state of the nation address, President Salinas promised the
contenders 'full respect, abiding by the terms of the law, and proper
conditions for them to present their options to Mexicans in full freedom'.
Mexico's 1988 presidential election, which brought Mr Salinas to power, was
widely held by observers to have been marred by ballot-rigging. Mr Salinas's
government has recently passed new democratic reforms, but they have been
dismissed as inadequate by the main opposition candidate, Mr Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, and some foreign and domestic observers.
Despite the call for an electoral pact, Mr Salinas suggested there would no
more significant concessions to the opposition.
The president appeared to rule out the possibility of foreign observers
participating in the electoral process, saying 'only Mexicans' would be the
guardians of 'our' democracy.
The president announced that Mexico's reserves rose to Dollars 23.017bn
(Pounds 15.2bn) at the end of October, from Dollars 22.597bn.

IRAQ'S clandestine nuclear weapons programme has either been destroyed or
neutralised, with no 'big pieces' missing, Dr Hans Blix, head of the
International Atomic Energy Agency, said yesterday, Reuter reports from New
York.
Dr Blix told the UN General Assembly that after 21 inspection missions gaps
still had to be filled in about Iraq's nuclear supply channels and sources
of scientific information. But, at a news conference following his speech,
he said: 'Through a piecing together of the evidence we have found, we have
a consistent and coherent picture of the nuclear programme. There are no big
pieces missing.'
He said declared non-irradiated highly-enriched uranium had been removed in
November 1991 and a schedule set up to remove declared irradiated
highly-enriched uranium.
Iraq has not yet agreed to a long-term monitoring programme to ensure it
does not reacquire weapons of mass destruction.

<TEXT>
NORTH KOREA'S failure to comply with international nuclear safeguards 'has
been widening' and continuity of some data was already damaged, the head of
the UN inspection's body said yesterday, writes Michael Littlejohns in New
York.
Dr Hans Blix, director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency,
said the longer verification was blocked the less assurance there could be
that even North Korea's 'declared facilities' were for peaceful uses.
Reporting to the UN General Assembly, he rejected Pyongyang's attempt at
piecemeal verification, saying that inspection must be an integral whole.
As he addressed the UN, the North Korean delegation published the text of a
message agreeing to inspection 'for the purpose of maintenance and
replacement of the safeguards' equipment.' As for routine and random
inspections proposed by IAEA, these would depend on progress in talks now
being held with the US and on the agency's own attitude, which currently was
one of 'partiality and injustice'.
With North Korea casting the sole negative vote, the General Assembly urged
Pyongyang, by 140 votes to 1, to co-operate immediately with the IAEA.

<TEXT>
MR CHUNG JU-YUNG, the founder of South Korea's Hyundai business group,
yesterday received a three-year suspended prison sentence for illegal
campaign practices during his failed presidential bid last year, writes John
Burton in Seoul.
Mr Chung, now honorary chairman of Hyundai, was convicted of embezzling
Dollars 64m (Pounds 43m) from Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI), the group's
shipbuilding unit, to finance his presidential campaign. He was also found
guilty of forcing Hyundai employees to work on the campaign.
Mr Chung said the money from HHI was from the sale of his shares in the
company and was not corporate funds as alleged by the government. Hyundai
employees who campaigned for him did so as volunteers. The Seoul district
criminal court said it would not imprison Mr Chung because of his advanced
age - he is 78 - and his contribution to the nation's economic development
as head of Korea's biggest conglomerate.
The allegations about Mr Chung's use of illegal campaign funds surfaced in
the closing days of last December's presidential election and played a
crucial role in his poor third-place finish behind the victor, Mr Kim
Young-sam. Mr Chung's United People's party subsequently virtually
collapsed.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Japanese new car sales show steep decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SEVERITY of the downturn in Japan's car market was underlined yesterday
by registration figures for October which showed that sales of new cars were
down 11.3 per cent on October last year.
The figures, from the Japan Automobile Dealers Association, represent the
seventh consecutive monthly decline in new car sales, and a 15.5 per cent
fall from September. Vehicle sales in October amounted to 374,227 units,
while car sales were nearly 10 per cent down to 253,516 units.
The gloomy figures, which came despite the opening of the biennial Tokyo
Motor Show last month and the recent launch of several new models by
Japanese manufacturers, reinforced growing concerns in the country's motor
industry about the timing of a possible upturn.
Nissan Motor, which on Friday announced a pre-tax loss of Y28.9bn (Pounds
180.6m), over double its loss in the previous first half, said it was
becoming extremely difficult to keep to its goal of breaking even this
fiscal year and returning to profit in fiscal 1994.
While the company was still pinning its hopes on stronger demand during the
winter bonus season, the growing possibility that Japanese employees would
receive lower bonuses this year casts a cloud over that scenario. 'The
recovery may not come until next year,' Nissan conceded.
Honda, which saw its sales in October, excluding imports from the US, drop
28.4 per cent, said it was becoming very difficult to read the market.
Other Japanese carmakers are expected to confirm the difficult trading
environment when they announce figures for the six months to September in
the weeks ahead.
Meanwhile the rise of the yen is leading one Japanese carmaker after another
to raise prices in the US market, a trend which many of them fear could
result in a loss of market share.
Mazda became the latest company to announce a price rise, of 2 per cent,
yesterday, following a 4 per cent increase in September.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT is considering unprecedented moves to trim a KD1.5bn (Pounds 3.3bn)
budget deficit for the current year, including charging fees for public
services, allowing foreign participation in upstream oil operations and
possibly levying taxes on its citizens.
Mr Nasser al-Rodhan, Kuwait's finance minister, told the local Al-Seyaaseh
newspaper that the 'decision is approved' to charge for some services,
though he did not specify which, or when fees would begin. Kuwaitis enjoy
considerable subsidies on power, water and local telephone services.
Mr Al-Rodhan said the fees would be introduced only after consultation with
the Gulf state's parliament, which reconvened last week, and that low-income
Kuwaitis would be exempt.
The minister also said that allowing foreign oil companies to participate
with the state Kuwait Oil Company in drilling and exploration was 'under
study', adding: 'The motives behind such decisions are economic.'
Kuwait has since the Gulf war entered joint contracts with BP for technical
support and Union Carbide for construction of a petrochemicals plant. But
upstream activities have been kept in state hands since Kuwait became the
first Gulf state to buy control of its oil production industry in 1975.
Diplomats in Kuwait City said talks between KOC and some oil groups had
already begun on possible opportunities, which Mr al-Rodhan said would offer
Kuwait both fresh foreign expertise and, more particularly, foreign capital.
The government is doing more than ever to trim outgoings in the face of a
budget deficit of KD1.49bn - including statutory expropriations for the
Reserve Fund for Future Generations - and under the close eye of the
country's increasingly economically sophisticated parliament. The true
deficit in Kuwait's public finances is almost certainly bigger than the
published figure, which does not include all Kuwait's military spending or
foreign debt repayments.
Mr al-Rodhan said that 'until now and with our financial resources we can
cope with the demands', but added: 'The situation in the next stage will
make it necessary for us to start thinking seriously of taxation.'
Mr al-Rodhan's remarks follow leaks in Kuwaiti papers of an International
Monetary Fund report, handed to the government in late August, which
recommended cuts in subsidies, shrinkage of the public sector and other
revenue-raising measures, including limited privatisation.
Economists in Kuwait reckon that service fees could raise KD300m a year.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Israeli poll is test for peace drive

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAELIS go to the polls today to vote for new municipal authorities in the
first test of nationwide public political sentiment since the signing of the
historic Israeli-Palestinian peace accord.
Although the 3.3m registered voters will be influenced by a range of issues
from education to rubbish collection, political analysts say the poll will
also indicate national feeling about the unfolding peace process. Mr Yitzhak
Rabin, prime minister, has said he views the elections as a vote of
confidence by the public in his peace drive.
The two greatest electoral battles, and the ones which are most likely to
provide a political weather vane, are in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
In Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek, an 83-year-old veteran of Mr Rabin's Labour
party, has been fighting a tough race to keep control of the Holy City
against competition from Mr Ehud Olmert, a member of parliament from the
right-wing Likud party.
Opinion polls show the two neck and neck after a campaign marked by personal
attacks and questions about whether Mr Kollek is fit enough to stand another
term of office.
Jerusalemites, who live on the fault-line of the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict, are deeply concerned about security issues particularly for the
massive Jewish settlements nearby and the future status of the city.
Both candidates in Jerusalem agree on the unity of the Jewish West with the
Arab East of the city and both back Jewish development of East Jerusalem.
But Mr Olmert favours a much more aggressive settlement policy, with Jews
moving into neighbourhoods reserved under Mr Kollek's administration for
Arabs.
Palestinians say a victory by Mr Olmert would exacerbate Arab-Jewish
tensions in the city and make a compromise on its final status - such as
joint or international administration - much more difficult. However, the
80,000 registered Palestinians living in occupied East Jerusalem are divided
about whether to vote in the poll, even if to do so would ensure victory for
Mr Kollek.
In Tel Aviv, usually a more liberal and secular city than Jerusalem, Mr
Ronni Milo, a former Likud police minister, is fighting Mr Avigdor Kahalani,
a war hero from the Labour party, to succeed Mr Shlomo 'Chich' Lahat, the
long-time mayor.
Defeat for Labour in both cities could be a serious setback to the peace
process and bolster the right-wing opposition, which has seemed increasingly
divided and marginalised by Mr Rabin's initiatives.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Corruption probe jeopardises Kenya aid

KENYA'S donors are investigating financial mismanagement and allegations of
corruption involving more than Dollars 125m (Pounds 82.7m) at the
state-owned Kenya Post and Telecommunications Company.
Further irregularities have been revealed by a former manager of KPTC, now
living abroad, who told the Financial Times that an inventory check last
year on stock worth Dollars 250m on paper produced 'huge discrepancies'.
Donor officials believe that some of the funds were channelled to a group of
local banks which lent the money on to government officials or supporters of
the ruling Kanu party.
These banks are already under investigation by the government, acting with
the encouragement of donors.
Negotiations for a new International Monetary Fund agreement and plans for a
donor conference in Paris this month could be jeopardised unless the
government of President Daniel arap Moi takes urgent steps to overhaul KPTC,
one of Kenya's largest state-owned companies. Without the IMF endorsement of
economic policy, donors are unlikely to resume financial aid frozen since
November 1991. And without the renewal of aid, Kenya faces a balance of
payments crisis. It is Dollars 700m in arrears to its foreign creditors.
Donors are seeking an explanation of KPTC's failure to remit to the Treasury
the 18 per cent value added tax it charges on telephone bills. The
information is disclosed in an auditor general's report which also reveals
that the company has not paid corporation tax since 1988.
The report shows that KPTC has accumulated arrears on its own foreign debt,
on its contributions to the National Social Security Fund, and on a special
telecommunications tax.
The monies owed are said by western officials to total more than Dollars
125m, an amount equivalent to about half the company's annual turnover.
KPTC deposited hundreds of millions of shillings in scandal-tainted domestic
banks. According to a western official investigating the KPTC management,
these funds were on-lent to government supporters.
Although four of these banks were closed earlier this year, auditors are
still trying to trace the deposits of KPTC and the company pension fund held
at another, Transnational Bank. The bank has fended off closure by promising
to inject fresh capital to cover bad loans, but one of Transnational Bank's
main shareholders, Mr Jared Kagwana, has fled the country after being
questioned by police over alleged embezzlement.
A former manager at KPTC has also accused company executives of faking the
theft of millions of dollars of equipment so that it could be resold to KPTC
for instant self-enrichment.
Mr Stanley Bell, KPTC's chief general manager until October 1992, says he
was fired for refusing to authorise a Dollars 20m procurement order for
spare parts. According to him, thefts of stocks were being reported to
justify the purchase of the same goods.
He ordered an inventory check and encountered 'huge discrepancies'.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Turkmenistan leads new rouble refugees: The launch of a new
currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE, GILLIAN TETT and JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CENTRAL Asian republic of Turkmenistan yesterday introduced its own
currency, the manat, launching it at a value of 50 US cents and 500 Russian
roubles.
Turkmenistan is the fifth of the 15 former Soviet republics to introduce a
fully independent currency - and it does so as other republics prepare to
leave the rouble zone, many of them complaining that the conditions set by
Russia for remaining in the zone are too strict.
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the three Baltic republics, each has its own
currency, while the smallest central Asian state, Kyrgyzstan, introduced its
unit, the som, in May. Three other republics - Azerbaijan, Georgia and
Ukraine - use coupons, all of which are highly inflationary.
Turkmenistan, with between 10,000bn and 15,000bn cubic metres of natural gas
and oil reserves estimated by the government at 6.3bn tonnes, has eschewed
backing - though not advice - from the International Monetary Fund, relying
on its own reserves of more than Dollars 300m held in foreign banks to
support the manat.
Foreign observers in the capital, Ashgabad, expect the manat to fall to
between 5 and 7 manat to the dollar when currency trading begins on
Saturday. However, Mr Valery Otchersov, the deputy prime minister in charge
of the economy, says that 'it is simply a matter of time before the currency
is accepted at other currency exchanges and traded internationally'.
Turkmenistan, whose regime under President Sapurmerat Niyazov has retained
tight control built round a growing presidential personality cult, is
presenting itself as a stable location for foreign investment. Prices for
the largely state-controlled staples are to be raised and a privatisation
programme - which will exclude the oil and gas sector - is also due to be
launched.
In spite, or because, of Mr Niyazov's gestures - such as erecting statues
and portraits of himself all around the capital and his receipt last week of
a bust from Turkmen businessmen containing 1.6kg of gold - most foreign
diplomats and observers expect the Turkmenistan economy to prosper.
'Russia and Turkmenistan are the only two former Soviet republics which can
stand on their own,' said Mr Vadim Cherepov, the Russian ambassador. A US
diplomat said that 'if it follows the IMF recommendations it will have the
most successful currency introduction of the former Soviet states'.
Dissatisfaction with the rouble zone may force other republics to follow.
Last week, President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan was granted powers
by his parliament to introduce a national currency after a demand by Russia
that the roubles issued to Kazakhstan must be backed by its reserves of gold
and hard currency reserves.
'We made all possible concessions (to Russia), but now Moscow has asked us
to do the impossible - hand over billions of dollars,' Mr Nazarbayev was
quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying at the parliamentary session
last Thursday.
An agreement signed in September between Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan,
Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan committed these six republics to remain in
the rouble zone under the control of the Russian central bank, in spite of
the publicly expressed scepticism of many in the Russian cabinet. However,
no new Russian roubles have yet been delivered to the other states, forcing
them to use pre-1993 notes which the Russian central bank has withdrawn from
circulation in Russia itself.
The Moldovan government has said it is to introduce its new currency, the
leu, this month - rumoured to be on November 20.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Trade figures for September boost markets, dollar
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BETTER than expected trade figures for September yesterday gave new heart to
the Australian stock market and dollar, as investors concluded that the
country is moving out of recession with a fairly strong export performance.
The balance of payments deficit in September was ADollars 1.14bn (Pounds
533m) on a seasonally adjusted basis. This compared with a deficit of
ADollars 1.3bn in August, and was below most market forecasts, which ranged
between ADollars 1.2bn and ADollars 1.5bn.
On the trade front, Australia enjoyed a surplus in September, with exports
up 9 per cent to Dollars 5.64bn, while imports rose only four per cent, at
ADollars 5.53bn. This left a ADollars 110m positive balance on merchandise
trade, compared with a ADollars 151m deficit in August.
The news caused the Australian dollar, badly buffeted in the recent stalled
passage of the budget, to close almost one US cent higher, at 67.29 cents
after touching 67.35 cents. On the stock market, shares also rallied
strongly, with the all-ordinaries index closing 20.2 points higher at
2,132.4.
Some analysts, however, cautioned that the trade figures had been boosted by
exceptionally strong exports of gold, and that the previous weaknesses in
the Australian dollar had aided exporters' performance generally. Gold
exports in September jumped 87 per cent.
'There are still some grounds for pessimism about the immediate future of
the current acccount,' warned Mr Chris Caton, chief economist at Bankers
Trust Australia. 'The rest of the world remains quite weak, and we may not
have yet seen all the valuation effects on imports of the lower Australian
dollar.'
Industrial unrest looms again on Australia's notoriously difficult
waterfront after a breakdown in talks between Australian Stevedores and the
Maritime Union of Australia over forced redundancies.
Australian Stevedores announced plans to shed 317 workers several months
ago. This led to a brief national strike in September.
Yesterday Mr John Coombs, national secretary of the MUA, claimed the company
had renewed attempts to sack employees, despite agreement by some 231
workers to take voluntary redundancy.

SOUTH AFRICA'S right-wing Freedom Alliance yesterday agreed to meet the
government to try to hammer out a last-minute compromise on a new
constitution, while the ultra-left Pan Africanist Congress took a further
step toward renouncing violence, writes Patti Waldmeir in Johannesburg.
The government and the Freedom Alliance, which includes the mainly Zulu
Inkatha Freedom party and white supremacist groups, will meet for two days
from today at a secret bush venue. The government will make a last-ditch
effort to persuade the alliance to accept a draft constitution due to be
adopted by multi-party negotiators. The deadline for multi-party adoption of
the constitution was pushed back to November 12.
The government is also pressing the PAC, which has participated in
multi-party constitutional talks, to end its violent struggle against
apartheid. The two sides met yesterday in the Zimbabwean capital, Harare,
and issued a communique calling for a moratorium on violence but stopping
short of agreeing the government's demand that the PAC halt its guerrilla
war. The Azanian People's Liberation Army, the PAC's military wing, has
claimed responsibility for recent murders of whites.

<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA is to allow about 19,000 Chinese citizens, who were living in
Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre, to apply for
permanent residence, the federal government announced yesterday.
They had previously been granted only temporary residence.
Yesterday, announcing a number of changes in Australian immigration policy,
Senator Nick Bolkus, the immigration minister, said Chinese nationals who
were in the country at the time of the 1989 upheavals, and families who had
joined them subsequently, would be granted permanent residence provided they
met certain health and character criteria.
He estimated that about 28,000 Chinese could become permanent residents
under the scheme. 'We will basically give formal legal recognition to
(their) status here by this decision,' Mr Bolkus told a press conference in
Canberra.
He said the treatment of these individuals would be outside the 'normal'
migration programme, but the cost to the country would be limited. 'Those
people are here, they're working here, they have very low dependence on
social security.
'The cost of them coming into the community, the further integration of
them, is minimal, if anything at all.'
Meanwhile, asylum-seekers who arrive in Australia before applying for
refugee status will also be entitled to permanent residence rather than the
temporary residence they are now offered if their applications are
successful, the government announced. Since 1990, people granted refugee
status after they arrived in Australia, such as the Cambodian boat people,
have been given only temporary residence permits.
And a third new measure, also announced yesterday, will create a new onshore
permanent residence category for Chinese nationals who arrived in Australia
after Tiananmen, and for Sri Lankans and nationals of the former Yugoslavia
who live in Australia under special humanitarian concessions. To be eligible
for this category, applicants must satisfy certain age, educational and visa
conditions.
Immigration to Australia dropped sharply last year, from 107,391 in 1991-92
to 76,330 in the following 12 months.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY is considering reducing tax concessions to oil companies that retain
high levels of debt, in an effort to stabilise government revenues from the
North Sea.
The measure would seek to offset revenue losses suffered after special tax
concessions were introduced last year, Mr Arne Oeien, permanent finance
ministry secretary, said yesterday.
The new rules had led to higher dividend payments and profit repatriations,
Mr Oeien told a petroleum tax conference in Oslo.
The measure being considered would affect both domestic and foreign oil
companies operating in the North Sea.
'We are currently considering different measures to avoid substantial
revenue losses as a consequence of the increase in dividend payments and
profit repatriations after the introduction of the new (petroleum) tax and
accounting rules in 1992,' Mr Oeien said.
Last year Norway introduced important tax reforms in the energy sector in
which it substantially increased the so-called special income tax rate, and
abolished a production allowance, together with petroleum royalty payments
on natural gas.
Mr Oeien said that as a result of these changes the reserve fund
requirements and dividend taxation rules were no longer effective in terms
of binding capital in the Norwegian petroleum tax jurisdiction, which mean
dividends are no longer taxed under under Norwegian petroleum law.
'As a result we foresee that the companies will increase the value of their
debt substantially, one effect being large (tax) revenue losses,' Mr Oeien
said. The Finance Ministry was reviewing ways of discouraging high debt
levels.
Mr Oeien said Norway actively used income tax to ensure the state a larger
share of total (petroleum) revenue when the oil price increased, and to
avoid a serious worsening of the working climate for the oil companies in
times of lower pre-tax incomes.
Options being considered were an increase in the so-called special income
tax and changing the regulations so that companies would be discouraged from
maintaining high debt levels as a way of increasing tax allowances.
Norway's current account surplus jumped to NKr15.37bn (Pounds 1.4bn) in
January-August from NKr10.63bn in the same period a year ago, the Central
Bureau of Statistics said, Reuter reports from Oslo.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Kurd rebellion spoils Turkey's 70th birthday
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ISTANBUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE worsening rebellion in Turkey's Kurdish-speaking region is putting
intense strain on the conservative-led coalition of Mrs Tansu Ciller. One
government minister has publicly conceded that the revolt has escalated into
a full-scale war - ironically, at a time when the country is celebrating its
70th year as a republic.
Last week hardliners from Mrs Ciller's True Path party were promoted to key
defence and interior ministries, apparently without the junior partner
Social Democratic Populists being informed.
Both parties are now setting sights on nationwide municipal elections next
March and questions are being asked about the coalition's survival as True
Path and the Social Democrats appeal to their traditional constituencies.
If the coalition breaks up, as Turkish newspapers were already predicting at
the weekend, western diplomats believe Mrs Ciller could win support for a
minority government. Should her party emerge strongly from the March polls,
Mrs Ciller might be tempted to call early general elections, probably in the
autumn.
Since they swept the municipalities in the last local elections in 1989, the
Social Democrats' standing has been hurt by a corruption scandal in the
municipality of Istanbul, which it runs, and the failure to unite with other
left-of-centre parties.
When the coalition was formed following the election in October 1991, there
was a popular expectation that the need to find common cause would force
both parties to moderate their traditional positions - with True Path forced
to take on a more reformist Kurdish policy, and the Social Democrats made to
adopt a more pro-business and economic stance.
But Mrs Ciller has paid only lip service to the need for a national policy
on the Kurds, while ceding more powers to the military in the conflict. With
the bloodshed escalating - more than 2,000 people have been killed this year
alone - last week's cabinet reshuffle reflected her party's concern that the
military might use the current crisis to impose martial law in the region.
Equally, Mrs Ciller's economic reforms have been hampered by what one senior
western diplomat called the 'bureaucratic inertia' of the Social Democrats.
Her efforts to legislate by decree have now been overruled by the
constitutional court.

Three Turkish officials will go to Damascus this week to urge Syria to curb
the activities of guerrillas battling for a separate Kurdish state in
Turkey, Reuter reports from Ankara.
Turkey has long urged Syria to help prevent cross-border infiltration by
Kurdistan Workers' party (PKK) rebels fighting a secessionist struggle in
south-east Turkey.
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller last week accused Syria, Iraq, Iran and Armenia
of allowing the PKK to use their territory and said she would pursue
diplomatic efforts to persuade them to desist. Syria says it regards the PKK
as an illegal organisation and arrests its members when it finds them.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK'S Social Democratic-led coalition government, which promised a
'decade of decency' when it came into office in January, has become
embroiled in a controversy over a banking rescue operation.
The opposition is calling for the resignation of Mr Ole Stavad, minister for
taxation, for allegedly misleading the Folketing, or parliament, over his
part in a rescue action in August for a bank in Mr Stavad's North Jutland
constituency.
Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the prime minister, whose government has only a
one-vote majority, was forced at the weekend to give in to demands both from
the opposition and from within the ranks of the coalition parties for an
'impartial investigation' into the rescue.
Mr Stavad's troubles began when the government negotiated a deal with a
North Jutland savings bank, Sparekassen Nordjylland (Spar Nord) to keep open
the offices of a small local bank, Himmerlandsbanken, in the town of Hobro,
which had collapsed with debts of around DKr400m (Pounds 40.2m). According
to Spar Nord's managing director, Mr Jorgen Giversen, the savings bank
obtained a 'crystal-clear' agreement that, as the price of taking on
Himmerlandsbanken's operations, the savings bank would be allowed to make a
tax-loss deduction of DKr173m.
However, when opposition politicians looked at the deal, they concluded that
the offer of a tax-loss deduction was illegal. A tax-loss deduction is legal
only if a company takes over another company in its entirety, but Spar Nord
took over only part of Himmerlandsbanken, which was subsequently declared
bankrupt.
Confronted with this argument, Mr Stavad said the government had never
promised the savings bank a tax deduction, only that it could make normal
loan-loss provisions for DKr173m.
In that case, retorted Spar Nord's Mr Giversen, the government misled the
savings bank's shareholders.
He published a fax from the Customs and Excise Board, sent to him at 4 am on
Monday August 23, after a weekend of negotiations with the government, which
appears to confirm his version of events. 'We told the government during the
negotiations that the alternative to a tax-loss deduction of this order was
payment of about DKr53m in cool cash to make up the difference between the
assets and liabilities we were taking on,' he says.
Mrs Kirsten Jacobsen, of the right-wing Progress party, who has spearheaded
the attack on Mr Stavad, claims that the minister has repeatedly misled the
Folketing and its committees in his attempts to escape blame.
The opposition parties yesterday accepted the government's proposal for an
impartial investigation, which for the moment takes the pressure off Mr
Stavad.
Mr Rasmussen's government took office when the prime minister for over 10
years, the Conservative party's leader, Mr Poul Schluter, resigned following
a judicial inquiry.
The inquiry's highly controversial report found that he had misled the
Folketing when reporting to it on the so-called Tamil scandal, in which his
minister of justice illegally denied Tamil refugees the right to bring their
families to Denmark.

THE International Red Cross yesterday warned of mass expulsions in central
Bosnia amid allegations that civilians were being summarily executed, writes
Laura Silber in Belgrade.
The ICRC denounced the 'blatant violation' of international humanitarian law
around Vares, a Croat-held town in central Bosnia, appealing to the mostly
Moslem government army and Bosnian Croat forces to stop the 'harassment' of
civilians. 'Thousands of civilians have been forced to flee from their homes
. . . they are fleeing looting, death threats, mistreatment and are
desperately searching for protection,' the Geneva-based organisation said.
The Bosnian army is fighting against Croat forces for land near Vares.
The town straddles one of the main aid routes linking Sarajevo to Tuzla.
In Belgrade yesterday, Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, UN peace envoy, protested
against the detention of the crew of two Sea King choppers, who had been
delivering relief supplies to Srebrenica, the Moslem enclave in eastern
Bosnia. The incident comes after Serb forces flouting Srebrenica's status as
a UN 'safe area', seized control of part of the Moslem enclave.

Moscow's city council has banned all demonstrations by all political parties
and groups on communism's most cherished anniversary, Revolution Day, on
November 7, Reuter reports. The ban was being introduced because some of the
groups which had applied to take part in Sunday's rally had been involved in
the abortive uprising against President Boris Yeltsin on October 3.

Austrian Airlines flight crew have called off their four-day-old strike with
immediate effect, supervisory board head Rudolf Streicher said last night
after mediation talks with union leaders.
The decision to end the strike, called last Friday to protest against
management job cut plans, requires the approval of a meeting of the AUA's
1,200 flight crew. But their leader, Mr Albin Schwarz, said he was confident
the decision to go back to work would be endorsed.

A pyramid investment company which launched a money-spinning craze in
Romania said yesterday it had suspended payments to investors for two days
because of 'organisational problems' but denied reports it was about to
collapse, Reuter reports from Bucharest.
The Caritas company described as unfounded a wave of local press stories
saying the money chain was losing momentum and that it would soon grind to a
halt. 'It is true Caritas suspended payments for two days,' a company
official told Reuter by telephone from Cluj. 'But this was only because the
company wants to organise its work better.'
It was the second time in a month that Caritas has interrupted payments for
several days. More than 4m Romanians have billions of lei tied up in the
scheme, which works like a chain-letter game and promises depositors a
return of eight times their initial deposits after just three months.
This has captured the imagination of a nation where monthly pay rarely
reaches Pounds 40, the annual inflation rate runs at almost 300 per cent and
bank interest rates lag behind at 70 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY was a strange birthday for what may be the most discussed, least
read piece of paper in history.
The Maastricht treaty finally came into force on a day when the Catholic
half of the revitalised European Community was having a day off.
No champagne, no fireworks. Most citizens of the 'new European Union' as
they are described were oblivious to the fact that overnight their
solidarity had been 'deepened', the democratic and efficient functioning of
their institutions 'enhanced', and their economic and social progress
'promoted'.
In Brussels, those same institutions were barely functioning. The European
Commission and Council were enjoying the All Saints Day holiday. The treaty
itself also appeared to be on holiday.
The Gower Street branch of Dillons the UK booksellers had no copies, 'and we
haven't had them for some time'.
There was some confusion over copies at HMSO Books, source for UK government
publications - 'there's one done by the EC, which would be for Europe and
Britain generally, and the government itself has done one that relates to
Britain' - before the Commission's version was tracked down.
As for the specific rights of the EU citizen, some may find them rather
disappointing.
Expatriate EU citizens get the privilege of being able to vote in or stand
for elections to their local municipalities or the European parliament in
the place where they live, but as there are only 5m expatriates in the whole
Union that may not amount to much of a democratic breakthrough.
Mr Len Lewis, electoral services manager at Lambeth Borough Council, was
certainly not expecting a flood of requests from disenfranchised Portuguese
wishing to represent south London at Strasbourg. 'You're the first to call
about it,' he said yesterday.
Not satisfied? The Maastricht treaty tells you how you can complain about
this new-fangled Community and its institutions. You can petition the
European parliament directly or - in particularly bad cases - complain to an
ombudsman, appointed by the parliament.
Alas, the ombudsman could not be contacted yesterday. He, or she, has not
yet been appointed.
As for the town of Maastricht itself, it was possibly the only place to
allow itself a modest celebration. Now that it is no longer synonymous with
particularly nasty disputes between Euro-enthusiasts and Euro-sceptics it is
thinking of subtitling itself 'treaty town'.

A PYRAMID investment company which launched a money-spinning craze in
Romania said yesterday it had suspended payments to investors for two days
because of 'organisational problems' but denied reports it was about to
collapse, Reuter reports from Bucharest.
The Caritas company described as unfounded a wave of local press stories
saying the money chain was losing momentum and that it would soon grind to a
halt.
'It is true Caritas suspended payments for two days,' a company official
told Reuter by telephone from Cluj. 'But this was only because the company
wants to organise its work better.'
It was the second time in a month that Caritas has interrupted payments for
several days. More than 4m Romanians have billions of lei tied up in the
scheme, which works like a chain-letter game and promises depositors a
return of eight times their initial deposits after just three months.
This has captured the imagination of a nation where monthly pay rarely
reaches Dollars 60 (Pounds 40), the annual inflation rate runs at almost 300
per cent and bank interest rates lag behind at 70 per cent.
'Caritas is agonising. . . investors will withdraw their money and the
scheme will collapse,' the independent daily newspaper Romania Libera
claimed yesterday.
The daily Evenimentul Zilei said: 'Caritas has run out of steam. The
decision to suspend payments will spark panic and concern among investors
and cut the number of investors.'
The Caritas official, however, said payments would resume today.
A fall-off in the number of new depositors would erode the base of the
pyramid. Pyramid schemes have spread like wildfire in Romania since Caritas
hit the limelight last July.
Eyewitnesses in Cluj said there was no panic outside Caritas offices there
yesterday. 'Everything is quiet here,' a local reporter said.
The company said in a fax that payments had been suspended because it was
understaffed and wanted to avoid 'mistakes which might occur in handling the
large volume of work'. 'It is more and more difficult for us to adjust our
schedule to the programme of banks, which close down over the weekend, while
we stay open round the clock,' it said.
Last week, Caritas opened a branch in the Jiu Valley coalfield and thousands
of miners lined up to deposit funds.
The scheme has drawn warnings from opposition critics, and even from
President Ion Iliescu, that it could spark financial chaos or riots if the
chain broke down.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Reconstructing bankrupt east Germany: A tale of two cities -
Judy Dempsey talks to the mayors of Halle and Rostock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW yearn for the days when eastern Germany was communist-ruled. But many
remember how the capital, East Berlin, selected the party bosses who ran the
main cities.
There were several key cities to which the aspiring party apparatchik sought
promotion. One was Rostock, on the Baltic Sea, another Halle, deep in the
heartland of 'middle Germany'.
Each with a population of 300,000, they were important political and
economic sinecures of the old regime. Resources were pumped into Rostock,
aimed at making it the most important port in eastern Germany and showing it
could compete with the western shipbuilding centres of Hamburg and Bremen.
Red Halle, as it was known, also had funds directed its way to shore up
heavy industry. But the infrastructure, including water, sewerage, housing
and heating, was neglected.
Over-fulfilling the Five Year Plan in machine tool production took
precedence over everything else.
Three years after unification, the mayors of both cities are struggling to
rebuild an entire social, economic and local government infrastructure from
scratch. They also have to cope with unemployment rates of more than 40 per
cent.
No wonder Mr Klaus Rauen, mayor of Halle, Saxony-Anhalt, sees his job as a
mission. As a 'Wessi', or westerner, he believes he can contribute to
unification by passing on his experience as former mayor of Bonn.
'It has been rewarding and frustrating. I work about 15 hours a day. I don't
know for how much longer I can continue this life-style,' he says in his
office in the centre of Halle.
Mr Klaus Kiliman, his counterpart in Rostock, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, is an
'Ossi', or easterner. He had never dabbled in politics before unification.
He is a theoretical physicist. 'I thought I had something to contribute
after the Wende (the change). It has been hard. I often think about
returning to my physics,' he says.
Weak, coalition-led councils, suffering from inexperience and internal
bickering, have hindered the consolidation of local government structures in
both cities. Moral and financial bankruptcy have played their part as well.
'The people of the former east Germany still feel disoriented, and ashamed
because they feel they were in a system which has lost all respect,' says Mr
Rauen. He wants to restore the inner city as a means of generating
self-confidence, pride and a sense of the pre-communist era. The problem is
money.
Halle is also virtually bankrupt. It has a current expenditure budget of
DM1bn (Pounds 400m) and an investment budget of DM300m. However, the
collapse of the region's uncompetitive industry means that the city's share
of company tax revenue is less than DM65m a year. Personnel costs, including
administration wages, kindergartens and other employee services, account for
53 per cent of expenditure. To finance the deficit, the city has borrowed
DM100m from banks and in the bond market.
Rostock has a budget of DM700m and a deficit of DM81m. The council's
personnel costs account for 55 per cent of the budget - the average in
western Germany is 35 per cent. Mr Kiliman has raised DM81m in the bond
markets or through bank credits to finance his city's deficit.
Both mayors are legally obliged to reduce personnel costs. Halle has already
cut staff from 13,000 in 1991 to 6,000. Mr Rauen intends to reduce it to
4,000. He has until the end of the year to dismiss staff. After that, each
council employee will have tenure.
Mr Kiliman, a Social Democrat who heads a weak coalition government of
Christian Democrats and Social Democrats, says he also is committed to
cutting his staff to 4,000, a third of the 1990 level. But the local
parliament is opposing it. Cuts mean closing down kindergartens and other
employee services.
Neither Mr Rauen, a Christian Democrat, nor Mr Kiliman needs any persuading
about the need to create a lean, efficient city council. In 1992, the
eastern Lander, or states, employed 304 civil servants for each 10,000
inhabitants - 30 per cent more than western Germany. The eastern local
councils employed 427 civil servants for each 10,000 - twice the western
level. According to the German Federation of Taxpayers, 'eastern German
administration has about 440,000 employees more than can be justified'.
Yet some see a positive side to the dire state of the cities' finances. A
shortfall of revenue could speed up the privatisation of local services,
almost taboo in western Germany.
'If we do not have a mixture of public and the private investment, we will
not be able to overcome our (financial) problems,' says Mr Rauen.
Privatisation of water services in Rostock and electricity in Halle, both of
which were difficult to push through, revealed the unstable and paradoxical
nature of eastern Germany's political alliances. In Rostock, the Social
Democratic SPD voted for privatisation, and the Christian Democrat CDU
opposed it. In Halle, the SPD and the refashioned communist PDS tried to
block it.
Mr Tjark Woydt, head of Deutsche Bank in Rostock, explains how unification
has thrown unexpected alliances. 'Three years ago, politics in eastern
Germany was like a casino game, with everyone vying for a place in the new
order,' he says.
'Today, officials are slowly trying to make up their minds about where they
stand politically. It's taking time. People still don't know where they
stand ideologically. They don't know what the main parties stand for.'
Neither Mr Rauen nor Mr Kiliman has decided whether to remain on the eastern
German political scene long enough to see the emergence of stable political
structures. 'It's an uphill struggle,' says Mr Rauen. 'But both westerners
and easterners have to make it together.'

<TEXT>
THE number of ethnic Germans seeking to live in Germany has fallen sharply
in the past 10 months, with the former Soviet Union accounting for the
greatest reduction, the Interior Ministry announced yesterday.
Mr Horst Waffenschmidt, state secretary, said 187,658 ethnic Germans, or
Aussiedlers, from the former Soviet Union, had applied to move to Germany,
nearly 100,000 fewer than in the same period last year. More than 158,815,
particularly from the Omsk and Volga regions, and Saint Petersburg, have
arrived in the country since January.
Applicants from eastern Europe are also falling, partly because the ethnic
German community has dwindled over the past 10 years, but also possibly
because of the economic climate and growing unemployment in Germany. The
number of ethnic Germans from Poland fell to 9,100 from 25,045, and from
Romania to 5,643 from 12,922. In all, 168,653 ethnic Germans have settled in
Germany since January.
The German authorities have tried to restrict the number of ethnic Germans,
who have an automatic right to citizenship, by promoting German-language
schools, newspapers and cultural centres where they live. But Mr
Waffenschmidt said yesterday they would only remain in their region if they
had incentive to do so.
German prosecutors yesterday began investigating an assault by right-wing
extremists on US athletes at the weekend, Reuter reports from Berlin.
Authorities in Oberhof said about 15 skinheads shouted racist insults at two
US athletes, both of whom were black. A team-mate who came to their aid was
beaten.

NEGOTIATIONS failed yesterday to end a strike by pilots and cabin staff at
Austrian Airlines that has grounded the loss-making national carrier for the
past four days amid recriminations between unions representing flight and
ground personnel, writes Patrick Blum in Vienna.
Mr Christian Schmid, leader of the ground staff, denounced as senseless the
strike called after management announced plans to cut 500 jobs next year
from the 4,500-strong workforce. On Sunday, Mr Albin Schwarz, leader of the
1,200 striking flight staff, called for a new management, guarantees of the
airline's independence in any future co-operation agreement with other
airlines, and for a decisive say for unions in decisions affecting
personnel.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Italy moves nearer state steel sell-off
</HEADLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY's state steel company Ilva has decided to split its activities into
three, marking an important step in the state's withdrawal from loss-making
steel production.
One operational company will be formed round flat products produced at
Taranto's integrated complex and at Novi Liguri, Genoa. A second will
concentrate on stainless steels at Terni in Umbria.
Iri, the state holding that controls Ilva, intends these two operational
companies to be privatised. A third company will include all those assets
and activities which it intends to liquidate.
Mr Romano Prodi, the head of Iri, first unveiled plans to split up Ilva in
July in an attempt to break the deadlock between Italy and the European
Commission over state subsidies to the industry and to remove the financial
burden of Ilva's L7,580bn (Pounds 3.15bn) debts. However, the idea came
later of forming a special company to liquidate unsaleable assets - and it
is assumed that that company will take on Ilva's losses which totalled
L1,700bn in 1992.
The company charged with liquidation will also handle 5,545 of the 11,500
redundancies envisaged over the next three years from Ilva's present
workforce of 34,000. The job losses risk provoking serious unrest, but the
government is to be asked to fund generous early retirements and back new
industrial projects in the worst affected areas.
It is thought likely that Mr Hayao Nakamura, the Japanese steel executive
brought in this year to run Ilva, will be asked to take over the management
of the flat products company. But much will depend on who decides to buy out
this operation based round Taranto, Europe's biggest steel complex, with a
capacity of 10m tonnes a year.
This week, Mr Nakamura, who formerly worked for Nippon Steel, is
accompanying Mr Prodi on a trip to Tokyo to discuss the privatisation of Iri
activities with Japanese investors.
Ilva was formed in 1988 from the collapse of the previous state-run group,
Finsider.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Volvo defers shareholders meeting on Renault merger
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLVO has bowed to domestic criticism of its proposals to merge with Renault
by postponing a planned shareholders' meeting called to approve the
agreement. The Swedish carmaker said it was seeking 'further clarification'
of French plans to privatise the state-owned automotive group.
The two companies, which have operated a strategic alliance for the past
three years, announced their intention on September 6 to create one of the
world's largest vehicle makers.
But opposition to the deal in Sweden has escalated over the past month as
critics said it amounted to a takeover of Volvo's car and truck operations
by the French state, raising doubts that it would win shareholder support at
a meeting planned for November 9.
Volvo's Swedish institutional shareholders expressed concern that there were
no guarantees that Renault would be privatised by 1995 as promised, and that
Volvo's proposed 35 per cent stake in the new company could be compromised
by the provisions of a 'golden share' the French state plans to hold after
privatisation.
'We have been influenced by the intensive debate that has been conducted
recently and we have been taking the criticism that has been advanced with
the greatest seriousness,' said Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo's chief executive,
after the board's decision to postpone the shareholders' meeting to December
7. '(The delay) will give us the possibility to see if there is information
which would change the situation.'
Volvo said it would take up the issue of privatisation and the golden share
with the French government. But it was not clear whether Paris would be
prepared to give further assurances on its timetable for the sale of
Renault, or on its determination to hold the right of veto over any
shareholding in Renault-Volvo above 20 per cent through the golden share.
Volvo had until yesterday insisted that the merger deal could not be
renegotiated, and had rejected suggestions that the merger be postponed
until after Renault had been privatised.
The decision to postpone the shareholders' meeting was a stinging blow to Mr
Pehr Gyllenhammar, the Volvo chairman, who has said the future of Volvo's
car and truck making in Sweden depends upon the deal.

FT  02 NOV 93 / BT tariff cuts to take Pounds 125m off phone bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BT is cutting the cost of weekend telephone calls and reducing certain
business rates in a parcel of tariff changes which should take about Pounds
125m off the nation's phone bills.
Further reductions are in prospect, including a version of a US scheme,
'Friends and Family', where discounts are given on frequently dialled
numbers.
The cuts, which will take effect from December 4, reflect increasing
competition between telephone operators and a tough pricing regime. Under an
agreement with telecoms watchdog Oftel, BT is bound to keep increases in its
main charges to the rate of inflation minus 7.5 percentage points. With
inflation below 2 per cent, BT has to find ways to cut prices by some Pounds
500m.
Mr Michael Hepher, BT group managing director, refused to predict the effect
of the cuts on profitability, arguing that BT was due to report its
half-year results in a few days.
The cuts were welcomed by the Telecommunications Users Association, which
said the new tariffs showed that BT was taking seriously the influence of
new competitors. The association said it would continue to lobby for more
accurate time-based tariffs rather than BT's existing 4.2p basic unit
method.
Mercury Communications said the changes were a response to its own
residential pricing initiatives and the launch of the One-2-One portable
phone system.
BT's price reductions were aimed mainly at residential subscribers. A
permanent national weekend rate is being introduced that will cut prices by
up to 60 per cent. A three-minute call that would have cost between 15p and
25p at the old rate will cost 10p.  Public payphones and BT chargecards are
included in the new scheme. BT says a three-minute, 100-mile, weekend call
will cost 8.4p compared with 40.24p in Germany, 25.09p in the US and 18.47p
in Australia.
For business users who lease private circuits, BT has to meet new price
controls which limit overall price changes to the rate of inflation. For its
advanced Kilostream data communications rentals are being held steady, while
connection charges for the faster Megastream circuits will be cut from
Pounds 6,200 to Pounds 4,650. Charges for analogue services will increase by
an average 1.1 per cent on rentals and 2.5 per cent on connnections.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Major pledges detailed peace plan for Ulster: Non-violent
political parties told to agree to fresh talks as condition for deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British government promised yesterday to table a comprehensive peace
plan for Northern Ireland if the province's four non-violent political
parties agree to a fresh round of peace talks.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, told the Commons that the proposals would
give 'focus and direction' to the so-called three-strand talks, which
collapsed last year when the Unionist parties walked out.
Mr Major gave no details of the peace plan, but Downing Street said it was
an attempt to bring about a permanent settlement of the Northern Ireland
conflict.
The plan is believed to focus on the establishment of a Northern Ireland
assembly and the revitalisation of local government, which has been moribund
since the imposition of direct rule in 1974. It also builds on the agreement
between the British and Irish governments in Brussels last week, which set
out a framework for talks with all Northern Ireland parties except Sinn
Fein, the political wing of the IRA.
The plan is aimed largely at the Ulster Unionists, who have long pressed for
devolution from Westminster to remove control of the province from the
Northern Ireland Office.
Initial reaction from Unionists suggested that the government may have to
offer further concessions to tempt the parties back to the negotiating
table.
The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, last
night warned the prime minister that further talks with the Irish
government, due to take place tomorrow in Belfast, could 'bring yet further
outrages'. In a letter to Mr Major, Mr Paisley says: 'I implore you to hold
it elsewhere.' He believes further talks with the Irish government would
inflame the Protestant community.
He said that he would agree to talks with the Irish government only if it
gave up its constitutional claim to a united Ireland. Mr Paisley said Mr
Major had agreed to meet him soon.
Mr John Taylor, Europe spokesman for the Ulster Unionist party, the biggest
Unionist grouping, welcomed the prospect of fresh proposals but dismissed
the round-table format as 'flawed'. He called for the plan to be discussed
in a series of bilateral meetings between the government and the
constitutional parties.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, appeared willing to go
along with that approach last night.
Sir Patrick said the peace process could resume with 'bilateral private
discussions to clear things out of the way, bank what is bankable from last
time, and to see what ultimately is a really serious obstacle. Then may be
the time to sit round the table'.
Ministers were also drawing comfort from the measured response of Mr James
Molyneaux, the UUP leader, who plans to take wide soundings among UUP
members before commenting later this week.
Mr Major's decision to offer a fresh incentive to the Unionists to reopen
round-table talks marks the end of any prospects for progress on the joint
proposals produced by Mr John Hume, leader of the constitutional nationalist
SDLP, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein.
Mr Major yesterday accepted a request from Mr Hume for a meeting at Downing
Street to discuss the proposals, but the government has ruled out even
indirect contact with Sinn Fein until the IRA declares an unconditional
ceasefire.
In Belfast, Mr Adams attempted to resuscitate the Hume-Adams proposals by
issuing a statement asserting that 'the leadership of the IRA welcomed the
initiative and pointed out that it could provide the basis for peace'.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Clarke wins battle over spending: Transport, housing and
local government budgets hit hardest as government agrees freeze on
expenditure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday agreed the terms of the toughest public spending
round for a decade, heralding a freeze in real terms in most Whitehall
budgets for the next three years.
In an unexpected announcement, Downing Steet signalled that a row over
defence spending had been settled by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, ahead of a special cabinet
meeting this morning.
With only some minor details for the main Whitehall budgets still
unresolved, the planned meeting has been scrapped. The remaining details of
the spending package will now be finalised at Thursday's regular cabinet
meeting and will form part of the first unified tax and expenditure Budget
on November 30.
It was clear last night that the transport, housing, local government and
agriculture budgets had been the principal victims of the public spending
cuts.
Among the projects facing delay or cancellation were the London Crossrail
link and the Channel tunnel rail link. The City Challenge urban regeneration
scheme is also under threat.
Despite the risk of a Tory backbench rebellion and Mr Rifkind's own threat
of a full-scale defence review, the defence budget has also suffered
significant cuts from the mid-1990s onwards.
Officials confirmed that a proposed spending ceiling of Pounds 253.6bn for
all Whitehall departments for the 1994-95 financial year had been met. In
the following year, the total would rise to a maximum of Pounds 263.3bn. The
ceiling for the third year allowed for an increase of no more than 1 per
cent in real terms.
Mr Clarke's success in freezing expenditure at present levels will please
Conservative right-wingers by reducing the pressure to increase taxation.
The Pounds 80bn budget for social security spending - by far the largest of
any department - would continue to rise in real terms. Ministers conceded
the threat of backbench rebellions had curbed the Treasury's ambition for
radical cuts in the welfare state.
But Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, had agreed to
legislation to curb invalidity benefit and a clampdown on fraud.
The biggest source of tension in recent weeks had been the level of defence
spending for the next three years. Treasury officials had threatened to cut
the Pounds 23bn defence budget by several billion pounds, but Mr Rifkind
enlisted the support of 20 Tory MPs in resisting deep cuts.
Agreement yesterday followed a meeting between the prime minister and
defence chiefs last week. But last night Sir Nicholas Bonsor, the chairman
of the Commons select committee on defence, was said to be among those still
threatening rebellion if defence spending was reduced by more than Pounds
1.3bn over the next three years.
Health and education were said last night to have won real increases in
their spending, though much less than in recent years.
Yesterday's statement took MPs by surprise because there had only been a
limited opportunity to discuss spending at last Thursday's cabinet meeting,
which was dominated by Northern Ireland.
Last year, five sessions of the cabinet were required to reach general
agreement on spending levels before the Autumn Statement.
The spending agreement will allow Mr Clarke to finalise his proposals for
revenue. Treasury officials have yet to inform ministers of their taxation
plans.

FT  02 NOV 93 / Dividends are on a roll for Japanese shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FUND MANAGERS investing in Japanese stocks may find themselves with a pile
of manure and toilet paper. Forced to cut dividends as earnings are hit by
the country's prolonged economic slowdown, companies are starting to
compensate shareholders with produce instead.
With a majority of Japanese companies expecting an earnings decline for the
fourth successive year, more shareholders are being deprived of dividends.
Comson, a farming machinery maker listed on the Osaka stock exchange, says
that instead of dividends it sent its 1,900 shareholders bags of fertiliser
made from manure and sludge, while Nippon Pulp and Paper gave 24 rolls of
toilet paper to every stockholder. The move also helps reduce high
inventories.
Japanese workers are already sacrificing bonuses to help their employers.
Managers at NEC last year agreed to accept vouchers which can be swapped for
computers and television sets instead of year-end payments.
Some companies hope the gifts will help restore confidence, especially among
retail investors disheartened by stock market scandals and last year's
plunge of the Nikkei average to a six-year low.
The government had hoped that last week's flotation of East Japan Railway
(JR East), the partially privatised regional railway operator, would bring
retail investors back into the stock market. However, massive profit taking
in JR East shares clogged up the Tokyo stock exchange's computer system,
sending the market below the psychologically important 20,000 for the first
time in three months. The Nikkei fell 264.73 points yesterday to 19,438.24.
Since Japan's traditionally low payout levels have never been much of an
incentive for investors - the current average yield for the Tokyo market is
about 0.7 per cent - companies also hope to lure investors with products. In
the late 1980s, holders of Tokyo Electric Power shares were presented with
electric kettles.
Amid public anxiety surrounding a shortage of rice due to this year's bad
summer, Shinden, an electric appliance discounter based in Niigata, northern
Japan, has decided to send shareholders bags of premium brand rice.
And as for the products now on offer, 'I don't know what I'd do with the
manure, but I could do with the toilet paper,' says Mr Patrick Thompson at
Fleming Investment Management in London.

FT  01 NOV 93 / US airline threatened with strike

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Airlines, the second biggest US carrier, faces the threat of a
strike by its 21,000 flight attendants following the collapse of talks on a
cost-cutting pay and conditions deal at the weekend.
The strike could cause chaos for US air travellers because it is set to
begin on or before November 22, the Monday before the Thanksgiving holiday
weekend - one of the busiest travel weekends.
The dispute casts a shadow over attempts by beleaguered US airlines to
restore profitability through deals aimed at big cuts in labour costs.
United Airlines is currently trying to persuade its employees to agree to
Dollars 4bn worth of cuts in jobs and pay in exchange for a stake of up to
60 per cent in the ownership of the company.
American Airlines has been talking to its unions for a year about new
conditions of employment that would cut labour costs by 20 per cent.

FT  01 NOV 93 / German far-right launches Euro-campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   RASTATT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLICE armed with machine guns stopped and searched cars as they approached
the outskirts of Rastatt in south-west Germany yesterday. Helicopters buzzed
overhead and hundreds of green-clad riot-police milled about the streets.
The reason was the gathering of the Republicans, one of Germany's most
prominent far-right parties and a disconcerting threat to the country's
political establishment in next year's 'election marathon', when there will
be no fewer than 19 elections in Germany.
Mr Franz Schonhuber, the former Waffen SS sergeant who heads the party, to
applause from 500-plus delegates declared the campaign for the election to
the European parliament under way.
His message, well-tempered to the ears of the shopkeepers, small-businessmen
and retired policemen and soldiers who swell the party's ranks, was that the
Maastricht treaty on European integration was a 'Versailles without war', an
agreement which had sold Germany's interests down the river as effectively
as the Treaty of Versailles which followed the First World War.
The German Volk had been denied the opportunity to vote directly on the
issue, betrayed by Bonn's traditional parties in the same way that Germany's
interest were betrayed by those in the political elite who put their seal to
the Treaty of Versailles. The Republicans would be the only party to be
campaigning in next year's European elections on a clear anti-Maastricht
ticket.
Support for the Republicans in the electorate appears to have slowed down,
as they have been tarred with the brush of skinhead violence against
foreigners. But they only just failed to gain 5 per cent of the vote in
recent elections in Hamburg.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Dublin puts pressure on Ulster Unionists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and TIM COONE
</BYLINE>

   LONDON, DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRISH government yesterday tried to add to the momentum behind the
Northern Ireland peace process by stepping up pressure on Unionist leaders
to join round table talks on the province's future, in the wake of
Saturday's murder of seven people by the Loyalist Ulster Freedom Fighters.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said he was determined not to
allow the process to be derailed by the killings in a bar in Greysteel, Co
Derry.
The initiative was rejected by Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the
hardline Democratic Unionist party, who warned that Northern Ireland was
close to civil war.
Terrorists from both sides have killed 23 people in the last two weeks in a
cycle of violence triggered by last weekend's bombing of a shop in Belfast
which killed 10 people. The violence continued yesterday when an RUC officer
was wounded in Newry.
Mr Reynolds said Unionists had 'nothing to fear' from the initiative
launched by the British and Irish governments in Brussels on Friday.
He said: 'As long as a majority of the people of Northern Ireland wish the
present status to remain, that's the way it will be.'
Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said he hoped to set up a series
of meetings with Unionist leaders, probably lasting up to 12 months.
But Mr Robinson said the joint statement issued by the two prime ministers
was 'an endorsement of the six-point plan for a united Ireland laid out last
week by Dick Spring.
'Whoever it was aimed at, it was not aimed at Unionists because it is
adopting a nationalist agenda.'
However, ministers were heartened by the restrained reaction of Mr James
Molyneaux, leader of the official Ulster Unionist party (UUP), who has made
no public comment.
The British government believes that constitutional guarantees and changes
to parliamnetary procedures for Northern Ireland legislation may persuade Mr
Molyneaux to take part in the talks.
The government is moving to set up a Commons committee on Ulster, and may
also scrap the use of non-amendable orders in council for Northern Ireland
legislation.
However, other UUP leaders remained wary. Mr David Trimble, the party's home
affairs spokesman, said Mr Spring was guilty of 'self-deception.'
Mr John Major is expected to make a statement on the peace initiative in the
Commons today, probably as part of a wider report on the EC summit in
Brussels.
The prime minister is expected to distance the Anglo-Irish initiative from
the peace proposals produced by Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist
SDLP, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
IRA.
Mr Hume said in a series of interviews that the SDLP/Sinn Fein proposals
remained the best prospect for peace in Northern Ireland. He said it was
'difficult to accept' that the Hume-Adams proposals had been dismissed by
the British and Irish governments.
Mr Hume accused Mr Major of being unwilling to discuss the proposals.
However, he said he would drop the proposals if he was convinced that he had
become an obstacle to peace.
'If the prime minister tells me that he has a peace process with the Irish
government that is going to produce a total cessation of violence, and he
convinces me that my dialogue is stopping that, then obviously I am not
going to be an obstacle to that,' he said.
Downing Street said Mr Hume had not requested a meeting with Mr Major.
However, the prime minister is willing to meet party leaders, including Mr
Hume, at any time. The British government is determined not to be seen to be
talking to the IRA through Mr Hume.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Russian banks opt to invest overseas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN banks have more than Dollars 15bn dollars stashed away in accounts
in the west but have made hard currency loans worth less than half a billion
dollars to customers within Russia.
Thirteen banks, which account for 80 per cent of Russian hard currency
operations, had Dollars 10.03bn in correspondent and investment accounts in
western banks at January 1 this year, according to a western study. The same
banks had outstanding loans of less than Dollars 300m lent to customers
inside Russia. By this June, all Russian banks held about Dollars 15.5bn
abroad, according to central bank figures. Loans within Russia were worth
about 3 per cent of that sum. The figures compiled from official sources and
the banks are an index of the financial chaos within the Russian economy.
While the banks have large amounts of hard currency abroad, the government
is rescheduling debts owed to the west, seeking other forms of international
finance help it promote business investment. Many Russian companies with
export potential have money but do not trust the national currency or the
authorities enough to keep it at home in roubles. Despite Russia's hunger
for investment finance, banks avoid lending within the country - except to
clients which earn hard currency and are well-known to them  - due to a lack
of mechanisms to ensure repayment.
Mr Francis Gelibter, director of Eurosiris Russie, the St Petersburg-based
joint venture of Eurosiris, the Paris based consultancy, which conducted the
study said: 'If I were the manager of a Russian bank I would do the same
because there are few alternatives to placing the money abroad. Lending is
risky because you don't know if the person will disappear tomorrow or
whether new legislation will come along to ruin the project.'
The money in correspondent accounts partly services the needs of Russian
companies which trade with the west. But the report's authors say that with
exports of just Dollars 30bn a year, a lot of money is in western banks
simply because it is the safest place for it. If dollars are not lent to
customers inside Russia, they are automatically transferred to correspondent
accounts in the US for lending on capital markets there.
The state owned Veneshtorg Bank, the foreign trade bank, had Dollars 3.54bn
in correspondent and investment accounts at January 1 this year, with
Dollars 36.8m lent inside Russia. This is separate from illegal capital
flight.
According to Foreign Economic Relations Ministry figures quoted by the
report, Russia in 1992 lost Dollars 6.4bn through unfavourable barter deals
where Russian exporters underestimated the value of what they were bartering
to keep the difference abroad in undeclared accounts.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Pandora's box swings open
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was not much triumphalism at Friday's European Summit marking the
entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty. True, the British government gave
a strangled squawk of self-congratulation at the wonderful results of its
brilliance in having been ejected from the Exchange Rate Mechanism a year
ago. But most leaders adopted a more modest tone.
For the Community and the treaty are both seriously short of political
credibility. Maastricht was supposed to launch Europe on the road to
Economic and Monetary Union; but to the average voter, the EMU programme
must look not just irrelevant but perversely damaging in the worst recession
in recent memory. Worse, the Community, which has been sold primarily as a
source of economic prosperity, has appeared to offer no policy response to
this recession.
Unless growth returns and unemployment falls, governments are still
vulnerable to the tide of nationalism and anti-Europeanism which surged in
opposition to Maastricht. Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois
Mitterrand both remain fully committed to Maastricht. But German voters do
not care for the idea of a common European currency and a large proportion
of the Gaullists in the French governing majority are in reality hostile to
the treaty.
It is under pressure from these anti-European Gaullists that Mr Pierre de
Boissieu is being squeezed out of his job as Economic Director at the Quai
d'Orsay, essentially because he is identified as the man who made
Maastricht.
In short, governments are anxious to stay right away from the kind of
ideologically charged controversy about Europe which made the ratification
of Maastricht such a misery. They desperately need recovery and hope, growth
and jobs; they are waiting anxiously for Mr Jacques Delors' White Paper on
growth and competitiveness, the plat de resistance at the full summit in
December; and they would much rather avoid another upsetting debate about
federalism, supranationalism and the future shape of Europe.
Such a debate is inevitable however, because the Community is facing the
prospect of admitting a large number of new member states. Four west
European countries from EFTA are already negotiating and hope to join by the
end of next year; and a raft of other countries from central and eastern
Europe are anxious to join as soon as the Community will have them.
Expansion on such a scale cannot fail, in the most general terms, to change
the character of the enterprise: a Community of 25 member states, with their
divergences of character and interests, is obviously going to be radically
different from the existing Community of 12. Poland is more different, in
almost every way, from Holland or Belgium than they are from each other, and
these differences of history and geography are deep and permanent.
The central problem of such a large Community is constitutional. There ought
to be more majority voting, in order to keep open the possibility of
effective decision-making; but in that case more individual member states
could be outvoted. In a large Community, whole groups of states with similar
interests may be outvoted: the south, or the north, or the poor. In short,
the unavoidable question raised by such a large Community is the old
unsettled problem of federalism, or whatever you call it.
The debate now starting is not overtly between the nationalists and the
federalists, but between the big countries and the small. At present the big
countries have a smaller voting weight, in relation to population or GNP,
than the small. This gesture of political solidarity was part of the
original bargain between the six; but since all the EFTA candidates are
small and most of the eastern European candidates are also small, it is now
being challenged, more or less openly, by most of the big countries.
Unexpectedly, the first to make the challenge explicit has been Britain.
Last week Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, argued the number of votes
required to block a majority decision should be the same after enlargement
as before: the equivalent of two big countries plus one small. In theory,
such a move could make majority voting more difficult by raising the
proportion of votes required for a decision. But Mr Hurd's result could also
be achieved by leaving the decision-making threshold unchanged, but
increasing the voting weight of the large countries.
The German government appears divided on the issue, and thus paralysed. But
France and Spain want a revision of voting weights. Since such a revision
will anger their smaller partners and members of EFTA, they will be grateful
to Britain for opening the Pandora's Box.
The small countries thought they had won a reprieve on the voting weight
issue, at least until after the negotiations with the EFTA countries. But in
the big countries the penny has at last dropped: once the EFTA countries get
in on favourable terms, they will certainly not agree to sacrifice their
voting privilege; even if they did, their electorates would certainly vote
down such a treaty change in the inevitable referenda. A change in the
voting system must be now, or it will be never.
The voting issue is also being driven by talk about reforming the
Commission. There are now 17 Commissioners, which many think is too many;
most agree that 21 after enlargement would be far too many; yet no country
wants to give up its Commissioners. The reason is that the Commission takes
more and more of its decisions by simple majority vote; and most
Commissioners tend to vote by nationality, even though the Treaty forbids
it.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Monday Interview: Tackler who can fight dirty - Sir Peter
Levene, new chairman and chief executive of Canary Wharf, talks to Robert
Peston
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As a life-long supporter of Chelsea Football Club, Sir Peter Levene, the
prime minister's personal adviser on efficiency in government, has become
used to sharp reversals of fortune. Though he says that his patron, Mr John
Major, has lost his stomach for the fortnightly punishment at Stamford
Bridge, Chelsea's stadium, Sir Peter continues to occupy his season ticket
seat, week-in week-out, together with his three children.
Coping with Chelsea's vicissitudes is probably ideal training for his latest
job, starting today, as chairman and chief executive of Canary Wharf, owner
of the Pounds 2bn east London property development.
Though Canary Wharf was conceived in the mid-1980s as London's second
business centre after the City, when confidence in the future of the
Docklands development in east London was at a peak, its financial
difficulties led to the collapse of one of the world's most powerful
property empires, Mr Paul Reichmann's group of Olympia &amp; York companies.
They also meant colossal losses for 12 commercial banks which lent Mr
Reichmann Pounds 671m for the project.
Indeed, the failure to find many tenants for the 4.3m sq ft of new office
space - by next year it will be half let and the latest tenant, the Daily
Mirror, was lured by the offer of rent-free offices for five years - cast a
blight on the entire Docklands development.
But Sir Peter - son of a dealer in antique silver and who as an alderman of
the City of London is likely to be Lord Mayor around the year 2000 - is in
optimistic and combative mood: 'The reality is that it's a great
development. There is nowhere else in the UK where a big company can find
enough space to bring together all its head-office functions in one
high-quality building.'
Mr Reichmann originally tried to recruit Sir Peter before Canary Wharf went
into administration in 1992. With Canary Wharf out of administration last
week, Sir Peter was offered the job by the banks which lent Mr Reichmann
money and now own the properties.
Sir Peter says there is a vital difference between Mr Reichmann and himself:
'I fight dirtier.' His tough-tackling approach is evident in his role as Mr
Major's efficiency adviser and overseer of the efficiency unit, which he
intends to retain despite taking on the Canary Wharf job. Last week there
was controversy over reports that the unit plans to recommend that all state
pension recipients should be issued with plastic cards to allow their
identity to be checked by computer.
Although Sir Peter refused to comment on the reports, colleagues say he is
lobbying hard for the scheme, which he estimates could eliminate more than
Pounds 800m a year in social security fraud.
He will ruffle more feathers this week when Mr William Waldegrave, the
public services minister, announces the results of the efficiency unit's
most important project, the market-testing programme. This was a project
launched last November whose object was to put out to tender Pounds 1.5bn of
work done by government departments, from cleaning and secretarial services
to the collection of official statistics and naval surveillance operations
for Customs.
In the event, several hundred million pounds of work has been subjected to
the tendering process, about half being awarded to the private sector. Sir
Peter is thus braced for criticism that he is not introducing competition
fast enough.
Although he cannot comment until Mr Waldegrave has made his statement,
colleagues say the Pounds 1.5bn target was unrealistically high, given that
it was 60 times greater than the pilot programme. They add he believes that
success depends not on how much is awarded to the private sector, but on
whether the civil service has been made more efficient.
However, some private sector companies complain their bids have been
obstructed by conservative department heads, who actually choose between the
competing tenders, though the process is overseen by the efficiency unit.
Sir Peter is unmoved: 'I have had an equal number of complaints from civil
servants that we are making it too easy for the private sector. If both
sides are complaining, I reckon I must have got it about right.'
He has got used to measuring his success by the level of criticism he
receives - and the more the better. His first government appointment came in
1985, when he was picked to be chief of defence procurement by the then
defence secretary, Mr Michael Heseltine, who became a close friend. This
caused a furore as Sir Peter was chairman and managing director of a
fast-growing defence contractor, United Scientific Holdings, at the time.
Civil servants were outraged that Sir Peter was being paid Pounds 95,000 a
year, more than twice the rate of his predecessor.
He also earned the ire of defence companies by more than doubling the
proportion of contracts subject to competitive tendering and then making
payments to contractors conditional on the progress of projects. He says
these measures led to savings of about Pounds 800m. 'When I got to the MoD,
companies thought we were an easy touch. When I left, they regarded us as an
awkward customer.'
His 'most daunting challenge', he says, came when he left the Ministry of
Defence in 1991 and took over the chairmanship of the Docklands Light
Railway, the new railway through London's east end to Canary Wharf. 'The DLR
was so unreliable it had become a national joke,' he says.
Because he 'knew absolutely nothing about railways', he decided to treat the
DLR as if it were 'a high-tech computerised system with software which did
not work', analogous to some defence projects overseen by the MoD. He
recruited MoD colleagues and the trains now run smoothly.
He has reluctantly given up the DLR chairmanship now that he is at Canary
Wharf. Although adept at dodging conflicts of interest, he complains that
'some people actually thought that, as chairman of both, I would alter the
timetable and run more trains to Canary Wharf'.
He is also giving up his positions as deputy chairman and managing director
at the UK operations of Wasserstein Perella, the US investment bank, though
he will remain as a non-executive director.
Because he has never before worked in the property industry, he accepts that
people will question his suitability for the Canary Wharf job. But Sir Peter
believes his success at the DLR shows that direct experience of an industry
is not vital. He also points out that the bulk of his job will be selling
the attractions of the development to potential tenants. 'As chairman of
United Scientific my business was marketing,' he says.
His initial idea is to locate 'the best restaurant in London' at the top of
the Canary Wharf tower, the tallest building in the UK. 'It would be the
sort of place where the chairmen of big companies would go,' he says. 'Once
they have been down to the site, I am sure I can persuade them of the merits
of moving their companies to Canary Wharf.'
His confidence is such that he talks of developing the entire 90-acre site,
which would mean the construction of 13m sq ft of office space in total,
enough for 50,000 people.
Although he relishes the challenge at Canary Wharf, there was one job he
coveted more than any other and which has now probably slipped from his
grasp forever. In the autumn of 1991, he and his 'good friend' Lord
Weinstock, managing director of the General Electric Company, discussed a
plan which would have involved GEC taking a big stake in British Aerospace
and Sir Peter then joining the board of BAe, the UK's biggest defence
contractor. The plan foundered on BAe's hostility and Sir Peter was
disappointed, though GEC remains keen on BAe.
'I would have liked to play a part in it, because it was what I was trained
to do,' he says. 'On the other hand, the defence industry is pretty tough at
the moment, probably even tougher than the property industry.'

FT  01 NOV 93 / California dream put on hold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The depth of California's recession has taken most local forecasters by
surprise and remains under-reported on the east coast, which is two years
into an economic recovery. Californians are not exaggerating when they claim
to be still ensnared in the worst downturn since the Great Depression.
The figures are strikingly bad. With an unemployment rate of 9.4 per cent,
against 6.7 per cent in the US as a whole, the state faces a jobs challenge
of European rather than American dimensions. Manufacturing employment is
down 14 per cent from its peak in 1990 and is still falling. Retail sales
are down about 12 per cent in real terms, three times the fall in personal
incomes, suggesting a crushing of consumer confidence. In Los Angeles
county, which has suffered 70 per cent of the state's job losses, the
property market has suffered a London-style meltdown. A typical home in an
affluent area is selling for about Dollars 480,000 against Dollars 670,000
in 1990, and prices may go still lower. For the first time in memory,
workers are heading east for jobs.
'If you want a job this century, leave California,' warns Mr Larry Kimbell,
head of the business forecasting unit at the University of California at Los
Angeles. He does not expect the recession to bottom out until late next year
and predicts the state will not regain its pre-1990 growth trend until after
the turn of the century.
The outlook for Los Angeles is worse still, according to Mr Jack Kyser,
chief economist at the privately funded Economic Development Corporation,
based in Hollywood. In spite of an upturn in movie studios and signs of a
revival in tourism as memories of the LA riot fade, he does not expect
sustained job growth until 1995. In Palo Alto, a region much less affected
by defence cuts, Mr Steve Levy of the usually upbeat Centre for Continuing
Study of the Californian Economy is almost as pessimistic. Although activity
may have stopped declining, 'there is no sign of an upturn', he says.
The grim figures are provoking an intense debate within the state. One camp
sees the problems as essentially temporary: a reflection of the combined
impact of several short-term shocks. The most serious is obviously the 20
per cent decline in federal defence spending in California, which has led to
a drop in aerospace employment, for example, of about a third since 1990.
But this was exacerbated by the bursting of the real estate bubble, the
cessation of inward investment from Japan and the weakness of foreign trade:
California accounts for about a fifth of US exports.
The other, gloomier view is that the difficulties, while partly cyclical,
also reflect structural problems: a complacency that took root during the
long years of effortless prosperity. Mr Lew Coleman, vice-chairman of
BankAmerica in San Francisco, says about half the state's economic base (not
just defence-related industries) is restructuring in an effort to improve
productivity.
'This cycle is probably several years from being completed but it should
produce a more competitive state economy,' he says. The restructuring thesis
helps explain the puzzling short-term weakness of service industries:
instead of taking up the slack as in previous recessions, non-manufacturing
jobs contracted in both 1991 and 1992 and will probably fall again this
year.
The state government is wrestling with big increases in social spending that
partly reflect the short-term burden of rapid immigration. (California, with
12 per cent of the population, absorbs a third of legal immigrants to the US
and about 50 per cent of illegal immigrants.) But even allowing for this,
its performance until recently was poor: a steady increase in the tax and
regulatory burden co-existed with a deterioration in infrastructure,
educational standards and public safety. For business and individuals alike,
this has made California a 'bad buy'.
Some pundits are defiantly optimistic. Mr Joel Kotkin, a Los Angeles TV
reporter and author, claims the state is going through a healthy
Schumpeterian process of 'creative destruction'. He translates every
negative into a positive: cuts in defence jobs, for example, are good
because they increase the availability of skilled manpower for rapidly
growing small, high-technology companies; the fall in housing prices makes
Los Angeles more affordable for the young people still flocking to the
region. The public gloom reflects the influence of the industries that are
dying - and thus clamouring for state or federal assistance.
Mr Kotkin may overstate his case. But why be too gloomy about the long-term
prospects of a state that boasts both Silicon Valley and Hollywood, crucial
players in many industries of the future such as 'information
superhighways'? In general California is strong in precisely the sectors -
enter tainment, high-tech manufacturing, professional services and foreign
trade - that are likely to enjoy above-average growth in coming decades.
With the passage of a budget on time this year and enactment of important
tax reforms, there are signs that Sacramento, at last, is getting its act
together. Add to this the state's vast consumer market and its favourable
position on the Pacific Rim (and as a gateway to Latin America) and there is
surely reason to believe that the Californian dream is on hold rather than
cancelled.

ECONOMIC problems surrounding Belgium and France refuse to go away and could
prompt continued weakness of the respective currencies this week. Meanwhile,
many economists will be waiting for the latest employment data from the US,
writes Peter John.
Belgium's problems were highlighted on Friday by a mass trades union
demonstration to coincide with the EC summit in Brussels.
Workers protested at the government's plans to reduce wages and jobs and the
country's transport system was disrupted.
At the end of last week, some foreign exchange dealers said Belgian
companies were busy selling Belgian francs to ensure they were covered
against further falls in the currency.
Many financial markets are closed today for All Saints Day. Tomorrow France
and Germany will hold their twice-yearly conference on bilateral convergence
and any concrete statements on growth could give some help to the French
franc.
On Thursday, the Bank of France's weekly reserves statement is set to
attract attention. It will cover the period after the D-Mark slipped
following the Bundesbank's last interest rate cut. Economists have said the
Bank of France has been slow in rebuilding its reserves lost during this
summer's crisis over the European exchange rate mechanism and a short period
of D-Mark weakness against the franc might have given it a chance to redress
the balance.
On Friday, the US announces its employment figures for October and Midland
Global Markets forecasts a pick up of only 50,000 over the month compared
with 156,000 in September. However MMS International, the financial
information company believes the figure will rise by 165,000.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GAMMON CONSTRUCTION, the Hong Kong-based company jointly owned by Trafalgar
House Construction and Jardine Pacific, has won orders worth Pounds 370m
(HKDollars 4.2bn), including its first significant contract in Indonesia.
The largest orders are for two sub-contracts worth Pounds 120m on the
Western Harbour Crossing for Nishimatsu Construction Company. The main
contract involves the design and construction of a third immersed tube road
tunnel under Hong Kong Harbour to include northern and southern approaches.
The tunnel will provide a vital link between Hong Kong Island and West
Kowloon.
Gammon will construct all the land based works on Hong Kong Island - 3.5km
of pre-stressed elevated highway structures founded on barrettes and bored
piles, a 300m long cut and cover tunnel, to be formed by top down
construction between diaphragm walls, numerous linking ramps and an
underpass, extensive drainage and utilities.
In Indonesia, Gammon in joint operation with P T Total Bangun Persada will
build the Pounds 60m Landmark III and IV office towers at the Landmark
Centre in central Jakarta (pictured above).

FT  01 NOV 93 / UK Gilts: Bank report likely to prop prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS for inflation in the UK over the next few months will occupy the
minds of gilt specialists with the publication tomorrow of the Bank of
England's latest report on price pressures. This is expected to paint a
picture of inflationary forces throughout the economy being fairly weak and
give another push to the generally downward drift in gilt yields of the past
few weeks.
This trend received a jolt last week when gilt prices fell sharply on
Wednesday soon after a successful Pounds 3.5bn auction by the Bank of
five-year benchmark bonds. The decline in gilt prices, which stabilised by
the end of the week, was due mainly to a concentrated effort by hedge fund
managers in the US to sell European bonds including French and German
securities.
However, the Bank's quarterly inflation report tomorrow is likely to put a
floor under gilt prices by commenting on the generally favourable trends in
inflation of recent weeks. With the Bank's economics department trying to
set new standards in thinking of new ways to measure inflation, attention
has been focused particularly on its new definition of core inflation -
categorised as the year-on-year change in the retail prices index, excluding
both mortgage interest payments and indirect taxes covering VAT, excise
duties and local authority tax.
In the Bank's last inflation report in August, its economists were fairly
bullish about this core inflation figure. They reckoned this would stay at
about 3 per cent during the rest of this year and next year. This optimism
might have seemed somewhat misplaced in view of the larger than expected
September figures for the year-on-year change in the RPI and in RPI
excluding mortgage payments - the latter being the Treasury's official
measure of underlying inflation - which came out at 1.8 per cent and 3.3 per
cent respectively.
However, many gilt analysts go along with the Bank's general line on
inflation as expressed in the August report. They say the blip upwards in
the year-on-year figures for September was largely a result of changes in
retail prices a year ago and should not distract attention from the flat
picture for inflation over the past few months. According to economists at
Morgan Grenfell, the October figures for the RPI and the Treasury's measure
of underlying inflation - due to be released by the Central Statistical
Office next week - will be relatively low at a year-on-year 1.7 per cent and
3.2 per cent respectively.
The general absence of worries about price pressures in the economy was
behind the signs of latent demand for gilts in the financial markets towards
the end of last week. 'After the sell off in gilts in the middle of the week
it was noticeable that as soon as the yield difference between gilts and
German government bonds crept up to anything just over 100 basis points,
buyers for the UK securities entered the market on the grounds that the
instruments looked cheap,' said a bond specialist.
Over the week, the yield for the benchmark Treasury 9 per cent bond maturing
in 2008 crept up 13 basis points, being quoted on Friday night at 7.2 per
cent after 7.07 per cent the previous week. Its price on Friday was 116 1/4
, a fall on the week.
The yield increase for short-dated gilts was slightly higher for the week,
with some investors moving out of these instruments on Friday after comments
from Mr Eddie George, Bank governor, indicating that an early cut in
interest rates was unlikely.
In spite of these comments many traders expect Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, to bring down bank base rates from 6 per cent at around the time
of the Budget on November 30.

FT  01 NOV 93 / US Money and Credit: Data could bring back the bears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS EVIDENCE mounts that the US economy is gradually strengthening, bond
yields at the long end of the Treasury market are struggling to hold below 6
per cent.
Last week, the market absorbed a spate of bullish economic numbers
surprisingly well. Prices fell and yields rose, but not by much. The yield
on the 30-year bond ended the week at 5.965 per cent.
However, another round of data is due out this week that will, in all
likelihood, point to a continued acceleration in economic activity, and
analysts are not sure that the market will take much more without cracking.
That investors stood their ground so well last week was partly due to some
discounting by dealers who had sold bonds in anticipation of bad economic
news, and partly because of remarks by Ms Susan Phillips, Federal Reserve
governor.
The third-quarter gross domestic product report had been discounted by the
the market earlier in the week. The 2.8 per cent rise in GDP was roughly in
line with expectations, and at first glance there was little to concern the
market about the figures.
However, a closer look revealed a more disturbing fact: that if it had not
been for the impact of crop losses incurred during the summer's floods in
the Midwest, GDP would have grown by a much more robust 3.4 per cent between
July and September. Once the penny dropped, so did prices, pushing yields
back over 6 per cent.
The selling did not last long, because the decline in prices quickly
attracted buyers. The market was helped by comments from Ms Phillips, who
said that she doubted whether economic growth in the fourth quarter could
match the 2.8 per cent rate achieved in the third quarter.
Although there was nothing especially shocking in that statement, it was
enough to push prices into positive territory, and yields back below 6 per
cent.
The reaction to the Fed governor's remarks highlights the skittishness of
fixed-income investors. Ten days ago bond prices were sent into a temporary
tailspin by an innocuous prime rate cut by Morgan Guaranty.
A week later equally innocuous comments from a Fed official helped spark a
rally. This is not the behaviour of a market that knows where it's going.
With yields at historic lows, and the Fed more likely to make the next
interest rate move an upward one, investors are clearly worried that the
bond market may have reached its peak.
This week's data could prove a turning point for bonds. A raft of important
economic data is due for release, and if the figures are consistently on the
bullish side, the long end of the market could be in for a rough few days.
Today opens with the National Association of Purchasing Management's report
for October, which is expected to record signs of a recovery in nationwide
manufacturing activity. Tomorrow, September's leading economic indicators
are forecast to show an increase of 0.5 per cent, and September
single-family home sales to show a rise of about 4 per cent.
The pace picks up on Friday, when the all-important monthly jobs figures are
published. Analysts expect the national unemployment rate to stay unchanged
at 6.7 per cent, but are predicting a solid 150,000 increase in non-farm
payrolls.
If these forecast prove accurate, fixed-income investors will end the week
with little doubt in their minds that the economy has accelerated away from
the sluggish growth exhibited in the first half of the year. And given that
the recent discounting of good economic news has worked its way out through
the market, there is very little slack left in bond prices.
After last week's struggle to keep yields below 6 per cent, the market may
not have the strength to resist the bears this week.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Danish Bonds: Further rate reductions in Nordic region
promise large capital gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH yields in many core European bond markets approaching historic lows,
more investors are lured by the yield pick-ups that Nordic bonds offer.
Moreover, further rate cuts in coming months are expected to result in hefty
capital gains.
Denmark remains one of the region's favourites and is widely expected to
outperform several core markets in coming months.
The Danish central bank has taken advantage of the widening of the ERM's
fluctuation bands on August 2 to cut its interest rates independently of the
Bundesbank, and with inflation a mere 1.2 per cent and unemployment at 12.4
per cent, that trend is set likely to continue.
In the last 2 1/2 months, it cut its important 14-day certificate of deposit
rate six times from 11 per cent to 8 per cent.
The Danish krone has held up well in the process, a factor that is expected
to facilitate further rate cuts in the near future.
Mr Peter von Maydell, senior economist at IDEA, the market analysis group,
expects the central bank's 14-day CD to fall another 100 basis points by
year-end and said the next reduction could come towards the end of this
week. He said a  1/4 -point cut - rather than the recent 1/2 -point
reductions - was most likely.
'They will probably scale down the easing pace as we approach interest rate
levels of the time before the ERM break-up,' he said.
This is likely to keep Danish bonds well supported.
'We remain very positive for Denmark,' said Mr Rainer Back, bond market
analyst at DB Research, Deutsche Bank's research arm.
Mr Back expects the Danish 10-year yield spread over German government bonds
 -currently at 51 basis points - to narrow to around 20 basis points in the
next six months.
However, five- to seven-year bonds probably offered the best capital-gains
potential on continued interest rate cuts, Mr Back said. The Danish
five-year yield spread over Bunds currently stands at some 70 basis points.
Apart from its large Treasury market, Denmark has a liquid market for
mortgage bonds, which have longer maturities than government bonds and offer
a substantial yield pick-up.
The 6 per cent mortgage bond due 2026 yielded some 110 basis points over the
8 per cent government bond due 2003 on Friday.
Swedish 10-year bonds offer a larger yield pick-up over Germany - 163 basis
points on Friday - and the allure of capital gains on further easing.
However, analysts warn the long end remains vulnerable to bad news on the
public-sector deficit front and political uncertainty ahead of next year's
elections.
'With elections coming up, the government isn't going to show much fiscal
austerity,' said Mr von Maydell.
The public-sector deficit is expected to account for some 14 per cent of
gross domestic product this year and only slightly less next year.
However, investors may be able to realise large gains on the currency, which
depreciated sharply in recent months but has begun a slow recovery which is
expected to be supported by the country's improving export performance.
After hitting a SKr5.04 high against the D-Mark in late September, it traded
on Friday at SKr4.80.
'Even if this is just a dead cat bounce, the krona could well rise by about
10 per cent from its low to around 4.55,' Mr Back said.
Even higher-yielding bonds in Finland and Norway are expected to benefit
from the easing scenario, although the relative lack of liquidity in those
markets tends to deter heavy foreign investment.

FT  01 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Low interest rates could open up Swiss
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of Swiss interest rates remaining low for the next year could
open up the Swiss bond market to a much wider range of foreign borrowers.
The fall in interest rates and structural changes, including the abolition
of stamp tax and the easing of syndicate restrictions, have contributed to
the large increase in new issue volume in the Swiss foreign bond market this
year.
However, Swiss banks believe easier access for a broader spectrum of issuers
is needed to further enhance the market's liquidity and transparency.
In the last few years, the Swiss bond market has become as exclusive as St
Moritz because investors have restricted themselves to buying bonds issued
by borrowers with high-quality credit ratings or with strong name
recognition.
Syndicate managers say investors have adopted this strategy as a reaction to
their bad experiences with borrowers with low credit ratings in the
mid-1980s.
Last year, 55.50 per cent of foreign straight Swiss franc offerings were
issued by borrowers with a triple-A rating, up from just 21 per cent in
1989, according to data from Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC). From January to
October 4 this year, 49.1 per cent of issuers had a triple A-rating.
The fall in Swiss interest rates to their lowest levels for five years has
produced good profits for investors in Swiss bonds this year. 'Swiss bonds
carried coupons of 6 per cent to 7 per cent at the start of the year, now
the same debt has coupons of 4 per cent to 4 1/4 per cent,' says one
syndicate manager.
But investors will have difficulty in matching those profits next year if
the market consensus that Swiss interest rates are close to the bottom of
their cycle turns out to be correct.
Swiss National Bank (SNB) officials said last week that further falls in
Swiss interest rates could occur in the months ahead, but they warned that
the central bank would not risk reigniting inflationary pressures by easing
monetary policy.
Nevertheless, the SNB's expectation that the Swiss year-on-year inflation
rate will fall below 3 per cent in November, and fall to 2 per cent by May
of next year has reinforced the bond market's view that yields are unlikely
to rise again for at least another year.
One way for investors to enhance their returns in a stable to falling
interest rate environment would be to buy bonds issued by borrowers with an
inferior credit rating.
Syndicate managers say such borrowers would be prepared to pay a good margin
over the market yield to secure Swiss franc financing at low interest rates.
There are signs that investors are softening their stance as they search for
yield. Bond offerings for Pemex, Mexico's state-owned oil company, and for
the National Bank of Hungary, both of which have sub-investment grade
ratings, were well received by the market.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ANOTHER authoritative study on off-exchange derivatives was released last
week. Its primary finding, that no new regulation is needed for the
multi-faceted financial instruments, echoed the conclusions of a similar
study by derivatives dealers and issued last summer by the Group of 30, the
Washington-based think tank.
Issued barely a week after a Bundesbank warning that expanding use of
derivatives and their global linkages threaten the stability of world
financial markets, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission study was noted
for its endorsement of the status quo.
The CFTC regulates exchange-traded futures and options in the US. The
agency's responsibilities evolved with the rapid growth of financial
derivatives. Its budget, and its stature in Washington and on Wall Street
failed to follow apace.
The CFTC's summary of OTC derivatives regulation was not expected to be
controversial, given that any recommendations for regulatory restructuring
could have again pushed the agency into a fight for its regulatory life. It
undertook the study only at the behest of Congress. But the CFTC has made a
solid contribution to the derivatives debate.
It said current regulatory structures were adequate. But the agency reported
that its study was hampered by the lack of information on OTC markets - a
remarkable statement by a body backed by the US government. 'Data generally
are available only for broad categories of derivatives products and market
participants. The most extensive data pertain to interest rate and currency
swaps and to dealers and broad categories of end users,' the report said.
'Very little information exists on the extent of activity in OTC equity
options and swaps and commodity swaps or by non-depository financial
institutions such as pension funds and investment companies.'
Later, the agency revealed that the data it used for the most
broadly-reported vehicles swaps comes directly from the International Swaps
and Derivatives Association, whose membership reports swaps turnover
voluntarily and whose data lack independent confirmation.
The study bemoaned the difficulties posed by variations of regulatory
treatments across borders and across participants.
Finally, the CFTC said the recent rash of separately capitalised
subsidiaries created as swaps trading vehicles by non-bank securities
dealers lacked any regulatory oversight. In short, the study's findings fail
to back its conclusion.
The CFTC's fumbling attempts to get its arms around the OTC market
demonstrate that derivatives regulation is in sad need of realignment. For a
start, comprehensive and reliable data reporting is needed. Meanwhile, the
CFTC has deferred decision on one the US's most significant derivatives
issues in five decades until it receives political reinforcements.
The CFTC has jurisdiction over exchange-traded markets of the same
trillion-dollar size and steep growth curve as OTC derivatives. The on- and
off-exchange derivatives markets share many of the same participants and are
used largely for the same purpose-risk transfer.
Exchanges contend that because they have more onerous reporting requirements
and are more closely regulated, they lose competitive edge to their
off-exchange cousins.
Having watched the CFTC grant regulatory exemptions to a swathe of OTC
energy and financial derivatives this year, the world's two biggest futures
exchange are asking for similar treatment. If their petitions for regulatory
exemptions for their biggest players, professional traders, in the Chicago
Board of Trade's lexicon, are accepted it is hard to calculate the effect.
Recognising that the issue could attract the wrath of Congress and that its
is undermanned, the CFTC is stalling.
After declaring an unusually long comment period on the petitions in August,
the agency recently extended the comment deadline to December 15.
Reinforcements, in the form of long-awaited appointments of a CFTC chairman
and two of four commissioners, are expected within days.

AETNA, the US's largest public insurance company, continued the improvement
in insurance company earnings with third-quarter net income up to Dollars
226m or Dollars 2.03 a share from Dollars 174m or Dollars 1.59.
The company benefited from lower catastrophe losses compared with last year
when Hurricane Andrew swept the Florida coastline. Catastrophe losses fell
from Dollars 59m to Dollars 18m.
Aetna also benefited from the 1 percentage point rise in the US corporate
tax rate, which brought a net addition to earnings of Dollars 22m.
Mr Ronald Compton, chairman, said the biggest improvements were in the
property/casualty business, 'which benefited from reduced operating
expenses.

THE slowdown in the domestic market and the strength of the yen this year
dealt a blow to JVC, the maker of video cassette recorders and other
audio-visual products.
The Japanese company announced a pre-tax loss of Y9.9bn (Dollars 93.3m),
against a deficit of Y13.5bn a year earlier, on sales 1 per cent lower at
Y251.4bn and passed its interim dividend. Net loss was Y10.6bn against
Y15.9bn.
JVC is dependent on its audio-visual products for 79 per cent of its sales,
nearly half of which come from overseas markets where the yen's strength
cuts price competitiveness.
Video cassette sales in Japan have been on the decline, with shipments down
9 per cent this year according to industry estimates.
JVC expects losses to accumulate in the second half and predicts a pre-tax
loss of Y25bn and net loss of Y26.5bn for the full-year on sales of Y505bn.

FT  01 NOV 93 / International Company News: Hostile chorus to Volvo deal
reaches crescendo / A look at doubts over the Renault link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Volvo and Renault announced in Paris on September 6 their plan to merge
the Swedish manufacturer's car and truck operations with the state-owned
French automotive group, the reaction in Sweden was largely one of sober
acceptance.
The right-centre government of Prime Minister Mr Carl Bildt, the opposition
Social Democratic party, the trade unions and most business leaders gave the
deal the thumbs up, saying it was the best way to ensure the future of
vehicle making in Sweden in the face of tumbling demand in Europe and heavy
overcapacity in the industry.
A Stockholm investment banker summed up the feeling with the comment
'regrettable, but inevitable'. By the end of last week, however, the climate
had changed so much that the same banker believed real doubt had arisen over
whether the merger would be approved by Volvo's shareholders.
'Perhaps it is not so inevitable after all,' he remarked.
The opposition did not find its voice until early October. Then a rejection
of the deal by Aktiespararna, the Swedish small shareholders' association,
and a vehement denunciation by the head of Scania, Volvo's rival truck
maker, combined to unleash a hostile chorus that by the weekend had reached
a crescendo.
Backed by strong support from the media, the opposition camp now includes
former senior Volvo executives, some trade unionists, an array of academics
and - to date - two prominent institutional shareholders.
The new atmosphere was encapsulated at a packed seminar on the deal in
Stockholm on Friday at which Mr Lennart Jeansson, head of Volvo cars and
designated chief financial officer of the new Renault-Volvo, and Mr Jan
Engstrom, Volvo's present chief of finance, were forced on the defensive by
a panel of professors and a journalist, chaired by a sceptical Mr Assar
Lindbeck, Sweden's best known economist.
The opposition inevitably includes a strong nationalist element which
objects to Volvo, the symbol of Swedish industrial pride, being 'sold out'
to foreigners. But what has Volvo most worried are the substantive questions
being raised by shareholders about the details of the merger agreement.
'The industrial logic of the merger for Volvo still seems more positive than
negative,' said a shareholder fund manager.
'But we have lots of questions about the valuations in the deal, the issue
of the privatisation of Renault and the French government's intention to
hold a golden share after privatisation.'
Volvo's case is suffering from two important weaknesses. Volvo and Renault
have refused to break down the values placed on their respective assets, or
give detailed performance forecasts, leaving many Swedes suspicious that
Volvo, once again profitable, will in effect be milked by Renault which is
suffering falling profits. Although Volvo will have a 35 per cent share in
the merged company, its direct stake will be less than 18 per cent, and this
is seen as a structural flaw.
The second weakness is the lack of cast-iron guarantee that Renault will be
privatised as promised. There is a strong view in Sweden that continued
recession, especially in the car industry, threatens the privatisation
timetable and could strengthen protectionist forces, to the disadvantage of
Volvo's Swedish operations in decisions on rationalisation.
From a Volvo shareholder's viewpoint there is another factor. After the
merger, the Volvo parent will become, in effect, a diversified investment
company with interests mainly in vehicle making, food and drinks and
pharmaceuticals. As Professor Ingemar Stahl of Lund University remarked at
Friday's seminar, an investor could almost certainly get better returns by
investing separately in top car, food and pharmaceutical companies.
Apart from the substantive issues, a further difficulty for Volvo lies in
the structure of its ownership.
Most of Sweden's other best known companies fall within the influence of the
industrial empire of the Wallenberg family.
Heavily-weighted preference shares ensure that strategic decisions of the
type taken by the Volvo board are made by one or two shareholders.
Volvo, by contrast, is a very democratic group in which no single
shareholder has more than 10 per cent of the voting capital and more than 40
per cent is held by about 15 institutions. After Renault, which has 10 per
cent of the votes, the next largest single shareholder is the so-called
Fourth Fund state pension fund with 7.5 per cent.
At the same time, many influential figures sit on the board of more than one
of these institutions, reflecting the small-world nature of Sweden's
business community. This can work to Volvo's advantage through, for example,
the seat on the board of Trygg-Hansa SPP, the insurance group held by Mr
Soren Gyll, the Volvo chief executive. In another typical feature of Swedish
business life, the trade unions hold many positions in the institutions and
have, to date, mostly supported the merger.
However, double-jobbing at board level is working against Volvo where
opponents exert their influence more than once. Nor are personal animosities
absent.
Men such as Mr Lars-Erik Forsgardh, the head of Aktiespararna, have long
battled against the flamboyant, and sometimes erratic, leadership of Volvo
by Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar.
'A lot of scores are being settled,' said the Stockholm investment banker.

FT  01 NOV 93 / International Company News: Stronger yen hampers
shipbuilders - Heavy Industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S shipbuilders reported an increase in profits over the last three
years that ran against the tide of most companies' earnings, but their
results in the first half suggest that the yen's appreciation has left them
facing another period of restructuring.
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and the other leading heavy industrial companies
are reporting sales increases from ship and heavy equipment orders received
two or more years ago, but they are struggling against South Korean and
other international competitors.
MHI reported a 1.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y61bn (Dollars 575.5m)
on a 5 per cent fall in sales of Y1,056bn, though of more concern to the
company was an 8.7 per cent fall in orders received during the period from
April to September, compared to a year earlier.
Japanese shipbuilders attempted to reduce their dependence on the ship
market during the late 1980s, which had been an unreliable source of
earnings, but the recovery in ship demand in the late 1980s and the fall in
domestic industrial equipment orders has again increased that reliance.
In MHI's case, ship and steel structure sales rose from 10.9 per cent to
17.2 per cent of total sales over the past year. But orders for ships during
the half just ended fell 20.9 per cent on a year earlier, and the company's
recent experience in bidding for an order of seven LNG carriers for Qatar
highlights the extra burden of a strong yen.
MHI, Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding, and Kawasaki Heavy Industries won
a joint order for seven vessels from Qatar Liquefied Gas for the vessels,
which will be used to supply Chubu Electric Power, a electricity utility
based in central Japan.
But the bid price, reportedly Y26bn per vessel, is below the current
break-even cost of Y30bn for that type of carrier, according to Japanese
industry specialists, and the companies are facing a loss on the project if
the yen remains in the range of Y100-Y110 to the dollar.
Mr Matthew Ruddick, transport machinery specialist at James Capel Pacific,
said the heavy industrial companies have a relatively high export to sales
ratio, which makes them more vulnerable than many other industries to a
strengthening of the yen.
He said South Korean competitors, able to build a very large crude carrier
for Y9bn against the Y10bn in Japan, are winning orders at the Japanese
builders' expense, but the filling of the South Korean order books will
create demand for new vessels.
KHI reported a 24.8 cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y6.1bn, explaining that
the fall in interest rates over the past year had reduced its repayment
burden and improved its balance on financial items, compensating for an 8
per cent slide in operating profit during the period.
For the full year, KHI expects a 20.5 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to
Y18bn on a 0.5 per cent increase in sales to Y960bn. Sales rose 2.5 per cent
in the first half, due to ship and industrial machinery competitions, but
orders during the period were Y331.1bn, down from Y408.5bn a year earlier.
Kawasaki exports motorcycles, and the yen has slowed growth in this market,
which has been strong in east Asia during the last two years. The company is
planning to increase its overseas procurement of parts and materials by 30
per cent in the next year.
The rush of Japanese investment in east Asia is likely to mean weak orders
for plant and machinery in the domestic market. It could produce a rise in
export orders, though the companies' competitiveness will be hurt by the
strong yen.
They do not expect much help from defence orders, expected to remain
sluggish. Sumitomo Heavy Industries, which had a pre-tax loss of Y1bn,
compared with a profit of Y741m in the previous period, said orders in its
ship, steel structures and defence division were down 33 per cent, though
orders for environment-related and other general equipment rose 77.8 per
cent.

THE Australian government will raise ADollars 1.69bn (USDollars 1.1bn) from
the sale of a 19.9 per cent stake in Commonwealth Bank - the second tranche
of equity in the bank to be floated off by the authorities.
Mr Ralph Willis, the finance minister, announced at the weekend that the
issue would be priced at ADollars 9.60 a share for institutional buyers.
Private investors are entitled to a 25 cents a share discount - meaning that
they will pay ADollars 9.35.
The sale involves a total of 178.5m shares. About 65 per cent of these have
been reserved for private investors, who submitted over 191,000
applications, representing almost ADollars 1.1bn worth of shares.

INTERIM earnings at Japan's leading paper and pulp companies exemplified
problems facing the industry, as sluggish demand and high competition
depressed profit margins.
Nippon Paper Industries, Daishowa Paper and Honshu Paper were hit by lower
paper prices. Honshu managed to lift its profit figure due to a decline in
interest payment as interest rates have fallen.
The depressed business environment has accelerated restructuring of the
industry. Last April, Jujo Paper and Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp merged to create
Nippon Paper Industries, and Kanzaki Paper and Oji Paper merged to form New
Oji Paper last October.
Nippon Paper, the industry leader, said paper sales fell 8 per cent to
Y232.7bn (Dollars 2.2bn) while sales for pulp and chemicals declined 19 per
cent and building materials decreased 17 per cent. After-tax profits jumped
53 per cent to Y5.4bn thanks to profits from stock sales linked to the stock
market listing of a subsidiary.
Paper sales at Honshu fell 6.6 per cent to Y89.5bn, while Daishowa, led by
the Saito family, known for its extensive purchases of French impressionist
art during the late 1980s, posted a 7.5 per cent decline to Y135.7bn.
For the year to March, lower paper prices will continue to squeeze earnings.
Nippon Paper expects lower costs to lift operating profits, but a fall in
gains from securities holdings will depress non-consolidated pre-tax profits
by 25 per cent to 8.5bn on a 4 per cent fall in sales of Y642bn.
Daishowa posted Y10.8bn in unrealised losses on its securities portfolio at
the end of September. It sees a pre-tax loss of Y21.8bn on a 6.7 per cent
fall in sales to Y289bn. Honshu sees sales falling 4.4 per cent to Y372.6bn
but expects support from lower interest rates, and sees pre-tax profits
rising 8.1 per cent to Y6.6bn.

THE slowdown in the domestic market and the strength of the yen this year
dealt a blow to JVC, the maker of video cassette recorders and other
audio-visual products.
The Japanese company announced a pre-tax loss of Y9.9bn (Dollars 93.3m) on
sales 1 per cent lower at Y251.4bn and passed its interim dividend.
JVC is dependent on its audio-visual products, including blank cassette and
video tapes, for 79 per cent of its sales. Nearly half of the sales come
from overseas markets where the yen's strength reduces price
competitiveness.
This dependence has been costly for JVC, which rose to prominence as the
company that first commercialised the video cassette format used by most
consumers.
Video cassette sales in Japan have been on the decline, with shipments down
by 9 per cent this year according to industry estimates. Meanwhile, price
competition has become fierce.
The only bright spot has been in the US market where recent figures indicate
there has been a pick-up in demand for video products. JVC's entertainment
division increased sales by 27 per cent.
In order to cope with the difficult trading climate, JVC has set up a
special 'defensive' committee to oversee cost-cutting measures as well as an
'offensive' committee to strengthen product line-up and sales efforts.
JVC aims to reduce costs by Y20bn and restructure its operations. It is
transferring 400 employees from various departments to sales.
JVC expects losses to accumulate in the second half as economic conditions
in Japan remain sluggish.

FT  01 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Tough task for a master of low profile -
The new chairman of GPA who is not averse to taking risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DENNIS Stevenson, the new chairman of GPA, is not about to move into the
group's sumptuous London offices in Pall Mall. As a non-executive he does
not believe he should have an office at all.
Nor will he be jetting across the Atlantic or be photographed at charity
galas. His stark and somewhat puritanical view of management is in marked
contrast to his predecessor Mr Tony Ryan, and his glittering array of
non-executive directors, who included Lord Lawson and Sir John Harvey-Jones.
Whereas many of the old management were rarely out of the public gaze,
albeit not always of their own choosing, Mr Stevenson is the master of the
low profile.
'Our objective is to have a 'PC Plod style of management' getting on with
the business out of the limelight,' he said.
Friends of Mr Stevenson have been asking him why he decided to take on the
chairmanship of GPA, wondering whether it could become a recovery stock. As
far as Mr Stevenson is concerned it is far too early to start talking about
the potential long-term value of its as yet unlisted shares.
He was attracted to GPA because he sees it is a novel piece of financial
reconstruction of 'vital importants' to stabilise the company. Furthermore,
a restructured GPA could also help protect the airline industry and would be
able to pay back some of the loans made by the 139 banks which financed the
company through its massive expansion at the turn of the decade.
If that sounds a daunting task for a company with debts of Dollars 5.8bn
(Pounds 3.84bn) Mr Stevenson replies that people have GPA out of proportion.
'The only big thing is the noughts,' he says.
All he will be doing is managing a financial asset - it is sub-contracting
the leasing to the GE Capital subsidiary, GE Capital Aviation Services under
the terms of GPA's rescue deal with GE Electric of the US.
However, Mr Stevenson is the first to admit that up until a few months ago
he knew nothing about aircraft leasing, prompting some to wonder why GE
asked him to chair the new company in the first place.
The initial approach was made by Mr Ryan, who first got to know Mr Stevenson
while he was advising the Bank of Ireland, where Mr Ryan used to be a
non-executive. Six months ago Mr Ryan made an informal approach to Mr
Stevenson to parachute in as a trouble shooter in the role of chief
executive.
He declined. He had no problem in juggling several part-time jobs at once,
but he has always been very selective about what boards he chose to join.
Aparting from chairing his own consultancy group SRU, and the Tate Gallery,
Mr Stevenson currently has non-executive directorships with Pearson, which
owns the Financial Times, and J Rothschild and Assurance and Manpower
(formerly Blue Arrow). He also sits on the Takeover Panel.
According to GE it was this 'solid, impressive curriculum vitae' that made
Mr Stevenson so appealing as a prospective GPA chairman. Furthermore, Mr
Stevenson is not averse to taking risks. He took on Mr Tony Berry at Blue
Arrow in a highly personalised battle and won control of the board and
chaired the Intermediate Technology Development Group, a Third World charity
which by eschewing big development projects was never assured of success.
So last month, at 6am in the morning, Mr Gary Wendt, chief executive of GE
Capital, met Mr Stevenson and Mr Ryan in the United Airlines VIP lounge at
Heathrow Airport. It was at that meeting that Mr Stevenson was finally
persuaded to take on the chairmanship of GPA and to try and bring the
stability seen as essential to the long-term growth of the airline industry.
Mr Stevenson will be paid for one day's work every week and will have the
extra incentive of a success fee. While not disclosing his salary, he says
he will he charging considerably less than he charges at SRU, where he is
reputed to be one of the highest paid consultants.
He does not believe the downside is too onerous. If he makes a big mistake,
such as diversifying into shipping leasing, for example, and thereby
compounding GPA's problems Mr Stevenson feels he would deserve a loss of
reputation.
But since he was not responsible for the past mistakes, he is not fearful
for his reputation if GPA is eventually unable to meet its demanding debt
repayments.
Mr Stevenson would not have attempted the challenge without Mr Patrick
Blaney, the 39-year-old chief executive, who he believes was untainted by
GPA's past mistakes. He also made it a condition of him accepting the
chairmanship that Mr Michael Davies, a non-executive director, from British
Airways, also joined GPA's board. Mr Davies is an old Stevenson ally at Blue
Arrow where they combined to oust Mr Berry.
The company still faces a tough time if it is to cut borrowings to a
manageable level. Although it is deferring Dollars 750m of debt, this will
largely fall due in September 1996. In the year to March 1997 GPA must repay
or refinance debt of Dollars 2.36bn.
It will be no small achievement, irrespective of any upturn in the airline
market, if Mr Stevenson can steer GPA through the next four years.

FT  01 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Building societies 'more soundly' based
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING societies' pre-tax profits were significantly higher in the first
half of this year than for the comparable period of 1992, according to a
survey of societies' interim results.
While the profits were almost identical to those for the second half of
1992, the survey argues that they are now more soundly based.
That is because they do not rely on the opportunity that sterling's
departure from the European exchange rate mechanism gave societies for
improving their profits by widening their interest margins through reducing
mortgage rates more slowly than interest rates.
Mr Peter Welch of Multistrategies research, the report's author, argues that
the interim results should include a summary balance sheet in order to make
it easier to calculate a society's overall profitability.
Six of the 13 societies which publish interim results do so now, but it is
not required by the Stock Exchange. The survey is available from
Multistrategies, 2 Ridgmount Street, London WC1E 7AA, price Pounds 50.

FT  01 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Syntegra launch marks start of BT market
push
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecommunications is refashioning its image as a computer systems
designer and constructor in a move to capture a larger share of a market
currently worth Pounds 25bn annually.
It will today announce that its customer systems division will be renamed
Syntegra. The move marks the first part of the company to be rebranded to
broaden its appeal to a world market.
Syntegra will remain a wholly owned profit centre within BT.
It will be controlled by Mr Bill Halbert who has been managing director of
BT customer systems since 1990.
Last year the division turned over about Pounds 200m, one of only three
British companies among the top ten computing services groups in the UK.
It is said to be 'significantly' profitable, although its figures are not
broken out separately in BT's results.
It does 80 per cent of its business in the UK; one reason for the rebranding
is to improve its international appeal.
Mr Alfred Mockett, managing director of BT's business communications
division, said Syntegra would establish strategic relationships with
customers around the world providing both new revenues and stimulating use
of BT's international network services.

FT  01 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Rebel Ferranti shareholders to meet over 1p
takeover bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REBEL shareholders of Ferranti International, the defence electronics group,
are to meet to discuss ways of resisting a bid which offers them only 1p a
share.
Some shareholders have reacted angrily to the token offer by GEC which
promises them just Pounds 10m while at least Pounds 100m will go to the
banks.
They have commissioned Katz Associates, an investment consultancy, to see if
there are alternatives to the GEC bid.
It is expected that the complicated share structure of Ferranti and the need
for any bid to be accepted by 90 per cent of the voting shareholders will be
severe obstacles to the smooth take-up of GEC's offer.
Mr John Katz, who heads the consultancy and who recently fought a bid for
the Greycoat property group on behalf of unhappy shareholders there, said he
had received a number of phone calls since his name was first linked to the
Ferranti situation last week.
'The deal proposed looks like a quick safety net for the banks,' he said.
'I have written to Eugene Anderson (chairman of Ferranti who was taken on
three and a half years ago to save the company) and advised him that any
sale of the company for a token price will be opposed unless there is some
platform for shareholders to remain in to some extent and recover something
with time.'
Mr Katz said there was unlikely to be unequivocal opposition to a rescue
package of some sort as some 4,000 jobs were at risk if a saviour could not
be found.
Before the news of GEC's offer broke last week Ferranti's shares were valued
at 9 1/4 p.
By the close of trading on Friday they stood at 1 1/2 p but Ferranti's board
has defended the bid on the grounds that the company has no alternative.
A meeting of shareholders is expected to be held within the next two weeks.

FT  01 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Beverley dips Pounds 1m into red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BEVERLEY Group, the engineer, lapsed into the red in the six months to June
30 with pre-tax losses of Pounds 929,000, against profits of Pounds 56,000.
The loss reflected a fall in turnover to Pounds 6.46m, down from Pounds
9.68m.
Losses per share of 2.67p compared with earnings of 0.16p.
In an attempt to cut back on its debt, the Bristol-based group is selling
Gall Thomson, which makes marine safety breakaway couplings, to Sealand
Industries, a subsidiary of VSEL, for Pounds 3.5m.
The company said cash from the sale would be boosted by a Pounds 2.5
dividend from Gall Thomson's accumulated reserves.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Card wars set to enter a new battle phase / A look behind a
management change at Visa International
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Credit card adverts in the US are full of bemused consumers. In one, a man
stands immersed in a mound of rival plastic cards (he's lucky, he's picked
the best one out of the heap). In another, cards littering a lawn are sucked
up by a vacuum (only one is left at the end). The message in them all is the
same: in a market awash with credit and charge cards, how do consumers
choose - and which of the many issuers are going to come out on top?
The ripples from this US credit card war have spread outward in recent
months, in the process hastening a reshaping of the management which leads
Visa International, the world's pre-eminent payment organisation.
The US may no longer dominate the credit card world in the way it once did -
the US share of the world's credit card transaction volume fell below a half
at the beginning of the decade. But the US still accounted for around 47 per
cent of the Dollars 884bn (Pounds 585bn) charged to general purpose credit
cards last year, and the US banks remain the most powerful force in the Visa
organisation (Visa, like its rival Mastercard, is owned by the banks around
the world which issue its cards).
Also, industry executives know that what happens in the US, where the credit
card industry was born and matured first, will eventually be mirrored
elsewhere.
At the end of August Mr Robert Heller, head of Visa in the US, resigned
under a cloud as the payment organisation's US market share took a rare dip.
From a 45.4 per cent share of credit card volume in 1991, Visa slipped to
44.9 per cent in the first six months of this year: hardly dramatic, but
notable after the organisation's previous steady advance. Mastercard, on the
other hand, lifted its share by 1.5 percentage points to 27.6 per cent.
The reason: 'co-branded' cards launched by AT&amp;T and General Motors, which
give users discounts on those company's products, were issued under the
Mastercard umbrella. Co-branding has become the most effective weapon in the
battle to encourage consumers to use cards.
Last week Mr Charles Russell, the man who over the past 10 years has given
Visa International, the parent organisation, its clear lead in the plastic
card business, said he will retire next summer. He will yield the chief
executive's job earlier, in January, to Mr Edmund Jensen, an outsider who
joins Visa from west-coast based US Bancorp.
Mr Russell had said many times before that he planned to retire. In a 1988
interview, he said he would go after three years. In 1991, it was one more
year. Finally, it seems, the banks that sit on Visa's board decided to take
him at his word.
'It's time, after 10 years. Chuck has done a great job,' says Mr Jim Bailey,
head of Citibank's US retail banking operations. He adds, though, that it
was Mr Russell who approached the board over the timing of his retirement,
rather than the other way round.
Other banks in the US, while also paying tribute to Mr Russell's
achievements, murmur that Visa has become too bureaucratic. The organisation
wasn't being managed 'to the bottom line,' said one.
If it was time for Mr Russell to go, he at least had some influence over the
new management team. Mr Carl Pascarella, who now heads Visa in the US, was
Mr Russell's chosen successor to Mr Heller. And, according to reports from
some industry executives, Mr Russell also chose Mr Jensen as his own
successor.
Despite Visa's little wobble in the US, Mr Russell leaves it the world's
most powerful plastic card brand. From a 40 per cent share of worldwide
credit card business in 1980, Visa advanced to nearly 52 per cent last year,
with 304m cards in issue. 'What he did for Visa on a worldwide basis is
prodigious,' says Mr David Robertson, president of the Nilson Report, a
credit card industry newsletter.
It is the US, though, which still sets the pattern for the industry - and
there, the toughest battles in the credit card war have yet to be fought.
Despite lower interest rates, cuts in fees and the introduction of
incentives, credit cards remain one of the most profitable products for most
banks. Rock-bottom US interest rates make it possible for banks to prosper
even in such a competitive market - helping to bring more new issuers into
the business.
RepublicBank of New York, for instance, entered the market only at the start
of this year: its 13.9 per cent interest rate is at the bottom end of the
range for standard bank cards, yet is more than 10 percentage points over
current money market interest rates.
Interest margins like this have helped to support the many incentives which
card issuers now offer. RepublicBank gives holders a cash rebate of up to
Dollars 250 a year on their credit card purchases, a trend started in the
late 1980s by the Discover card, then owned by Sears but now part of the
independent Dean Witter Discover. That card's cash-back incentive has
attracted 38m cardholders since its launch in 1987, giving it more cards
even than American Express (though its share of transaction volume is far
smaller).
When US interest rates eventually turn up again, the rush to offer
incentives is likely to slow. 'Margins are still pretty good,' says Mr
Bailey of Citibank. '(But) in this immensely competitive market, we haven't
yet had to contend with rising interest rates.'
When that happens, the American consumer could really see war break out.

FT  01 NOV 93 / British Gas made plans to break up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Gas prepared plans to break the company up in the months before its
reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission last year.
With financial pressures mounting as a result of tightening regulation,
senior executives at the company commissioned studies into a range of
options including the sale of some businesses and the complete break-up of
the company.
The plans were dropped after several directors opposed them, including Lord
Walker, a non-executive director, who as Mr Peter Walker was the Secretary
of State for Energy responsible for privatising British Gas in 1986. As a
result, formal plans were never put to the board, although they circulated
among executives at the top of the company.
That the radical plans were drawn up is a sign of how far the company
believed it might have to go to respond to the pressure upon it from
consumers and Ofgas, the industry watchdog. They will strengthen the hand of
British Gas critics who argue it should be broken up to reduce its monopoly
power in the industry.
Disclosure of the plans comes at the end of the consultation period for the
MMC inquiry into the company. The Department of Trade and Industry is
expected to make a decision on the commission's proposals before the end of
the year.
In the course of the MMC investigation British Gas repeatedly insisted that
splitting the company into separate gas transportation and marketing
companies was unnecessary. It argued that an integrated company would be in
the best position to meet customers needs.
British Gas drew up the plans at a time when its financial position had
become increasingly stretched after Ofgas had tightened its price cap from
the retail prices index minus 2 per cent to RPI-5. The Office of Fair
Trading had insisted that the company give up half of its share of the
contract gas market and the DTI lowered the threshold at which competitors
could bid for customers.
By early 1992 it was clear these measures would have a severe impact on
Gas's profits and so the company started to consider radical measures to
ease its burdens, including breaking the company up.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Economics Notebook: Hungary builds capitalism without
capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Surprises have lurked behind every corner of eastern Europe's tortuous
transition from a planned to a market economy - many of them unpleasant.
Often, the first to encounter unexpected difficulties has been Hungary,
which has pioneered reform since the late 1960s. So the recent survey of
Hungary published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, and especially its focus on the critical role played by credit
markets, contains a broader message for the post-communist states.
The OECD found that Hungary's early, albeit hesitant start, did little to
ease the pain of reform. 'Despite Hungary's status as the most
Western-market oriented of the centrally planned economies, the post-1989
economic transition still came as an abrupt and wrenching shock.'
Hope for recovery has been vested in the privatisation process, but
dismantling the state economy is taking longer than expected. In Hungary's
case the OECD cites estimates that 18 per cent of state enterprise assets
were under private control by the end of 1992, well short of the
government's target of privatising half the state sector by 1994.
Privatisation of state assets is not the whole story. Start-ups and
greenfield investments have boosted the private sector to about 30 per cent
of GDP, but even that has been far from enough to offset the contraction of
state-owned industry and avert recession.
Up to now Hungary has relied the most on foreign investment to flesh out the
private sector, attracting more than Dollars 5.5bn (Pounds 3.64bn) since
1988, over half the total for central and eastern Europe. But foreign
investment alone cannot transform the economy.
Most Hungarian consumer goods companies attractive to multinationals have
been sold and foreign economic penetration has come close to its political
limits. Increasingly foreign investors are looking to Poland which has four
times the population of Hungary or the Czech Republic - and an economy
stimulated by the dynamism of home-grown Polish entrepreneurs.
The growing stress on home-grown capitalism means closer attention must be
paid to solving the dilemma of how to build capitalism without capital.
One recourse is to distribute ownership through voucher schemes like the
Czech Republic or Poland's investment fund -based mass privatisation
programme. Hungary is belatedly implementing a more modest 'small investor
share buying programme'. But its conversion to the virtues of mass
privatisation has been half-hearted. Distribution cannot in itself provide
enterprises with the capital injection most desperately need.
An obvious solution is to mobilise household savings which were negligible
under communism but have since surged. In Hungary the savings ratio rose to
15.8 per cent in 1991, dropping slightly to 13.2 per cent in 1992. But
higher savings alone cannot stimulate investment in the absence of
functioning banks and capital markets.
This was the conclusion of a recent World Bank internal aide-memoire which
stated that Hungary's financial sector was 'unable to finance the transition
to a market economy'. The OECD's survey was more circumspect, but the urgent
need for financial sector reform runs like a thread through the report.
The financial sector effectively means the banks. The OECD, for example,
dismissed the Budapest stock market as of 'minor importance', although this
year's boom in the Polish stock market indicates that equity markets do have
a future.
But the banks risk seizing up. In Hungary real lending rates remained above
10 per cent in 1991 and 1992. Despite growing liquidity, banks curtailed
their lending to the enterprise sector in 1992 while the spread between
their deposit and lending rates rose from about 4 per cent to a gaping 11
per cent.
Behind this phenomenon lies Hungary's status as the first east European
country to implement western-style bankruptcy, accounting and banking acts.
The new laws have forced many Hungarian companies and banks to face their
real, and previously hidden, financial plight. One in six registered
companies, producing about 14 per cent of GDP, have been affected by the
bankruptcy legislation, according to the OECD.
To finance provisions against non-performing loans and rebuild capital,
banks increased spreads. But high lending rates make default more likely as
only the most desperate enterprises apply for loans. This process led to a
'credit crunch' in Hungary last year.
Throughout the region government hunger for higher revenue is compounding
the difficulties of the banking system. Until 1991, taxation of banks' paper
profits was an important source of revenue, equivalent to about 2 per cent
of GDP in Hungary's case. Despite the current plight of financial
institutions, governments continue to drain their liquidity.
Recapitalisation of the banks would reduce spreads and help stimulate
lending to the corporate sector. But here again, the OECD says, budgetary
economy has conflicted with bank consolidation. Hungary's effort last year
to shore up balance sheets was conducted on the cheap.
Budapest, supported by the promise of a World Bank credit of Dollars
200m-Dollars 300m, is now planning another, more comprehensive attempt. But
the government has warned of a rise in the budget deficit to Ft350bn (Pounds
4.41bn)next year, around 9 per cent of GDP. This would exceed targets set by
the International Monetary Fund, so the temptation to cut corners on bank
consolidation remains.
Lest Hungary despair, however the OECD notes: 'The visible size of the
problems does not mean that the difficulties in Hungary are bigger than
elsewhere in central and eastern Europe; rather it may be a sign that things
are coming into the open earlier than elsewhere. This could mean that
solutions are found more quickly, as issues are recognised in public
discussion and measures are being debated and implemented.'
That may console Hungary. It is less heartening for its east European
neighbours.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Stanhope to seek new equity in refinancing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE board of Stanhope, the heavily-indebted commercial property developer,
said yesterday it was considering raising new equity in a refinancing.
The company is looking to raise Pounds 150m-Pounds 160m, and to restructure
its banking arrangements, but said plans were still in very early stages. No
proposals have yet been put to any of the 16 or so banks involved. Stanhope
last refinanced its bank debt in January this year. At Friday's closing
share price of 36p, it had a market capitalisation of just under Pounds 60m.
The likelihood of attracting investors was helped by Broadgate Properties,
50 per cent owned by Stanhope, last week selling the lease of One Exchange
Square, home of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, for
Pounds 170m. Stanhope also reports a 'significant increase' in letting
enquiries at both Broadgate and Ludgate, another of its developments.
Any restructuring is likely to involve Stanhope taking control of the other
half of Broadgate Properties, which was owned by Rosehaugh, now in
receivership.
Stanhope said the refinancing would take three or four months.
It incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 215m in the year to June 30, 1992.
Results for the year to June 30, 1993 are due in mid-November, but the
company said improvements in the market 'have come too late to be reflected
in these figures'.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Volvo investors wary of merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDER doubts in Sweden threaten the fate of the proposed landmark
merger between Renault, the state-owned French automotive company, and the
car and truck operations of Volvo. The Swedish group's institutional
shareholders have yet to decide whether to support the deal, which is due to
be determined this week.
The two companies, which have operated a strategic alliance for the past
three years, announced plans in September to combine to form Europe's
second-largest vehicle maker in the face of increasing international
competition and sharply falling car sales on their home continent.
Critics of the deal fear the structure of the merger, which will give Volvo
a 35 per cent share of the new Renault-Volvo company, amounts to a French
state takeover of the country's leading manufacturing outfit. There are
doubts over whether it will be approved at a special Volvo shareholders'
meeting in Gothenburg on November 9.
Most of a group of about 10 institutional shareholders who together control
about 40 per cent of the voting capital, but have yet to say how they will
vote, are due to announce their decisions this week.
A key indicator of the final outcome is expected on Wednesday when the
second largest single shareholder in Volvo, a state pension fund called the
Fourth Fund, makes its decision. Directors of the fund, which holds 7.5 per
cent of the votes after Renault's 10 per cent, are understood to be divided
on the merger and are seeking further information on the deal from Volvo.
Another state fund, the 92-94 Fund which holds 2.5 per cent of the votes,
has already said it will oppose the deal chiefly because of its concerns
over the lack of guarantees about the French government's promised
privatisation of Renault. At the weekend, the insurance group SPP, which has
4.5 per cent, said it would oppose the merger without further clarifications
on privatisation and the French state's intention to hold subsequently a
'golden share' in the merged company.
The other 'swing' shareholders include pension and investment funds of
Scandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Svenska Handelsbanken, the country's
leading banks, and the insurance groups Skandia and Trygg-Hansa. Volvo is
under pressure to delay the merger until after Renault has been sold off to
the private sector.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Business help sought in urban revival plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS executives in London, Birmingham and Manchester are to be asked to
help draw up plans for the regeneration of their cities as part of
government reforms on urban policy to be announced this week.
The initiative - City Pride - will bring together business, government,
local authorities and the voluntary sector in a new partnership for
restoring English cities. They will be asked to visualise the future for
their cities and set regeneration priorities for the allocation of the
government's Pounds 1.7bn urban budget.
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, will also set out plans to bring
together the government's inner-city regeneration programmes into a single
budget. The City Pride teams will be encouraged to bid for a share of the
funds, using the model developed for City Challenge.
The unified urban budget - promised in the Conservative election manifesto
to allow greater local autonomy in setting priorities - will not be
restricted to run-down inner-city areas. City Pride teams will consider all
aspects of regeneration, including work needed to develop the economies of
cities and regions.
The funds for the new unified urban budget will come from existing
programmes run mainly by the Environment Department and the Department of
Trade and Industry. Existing commitments to urban development corporations
and some 30 City Challenge schemes will be honoured. The funds promised to
the new Urban Regeneration Agency, to be chaired by Lord Walker, will also
be 'ring-fenced' within the overall budget.
London First, the private-sector body formed last year to promote strategic
thinking in the capital, is likely to play a leading role in drawing up City
Pride plans for London. It has already opened its doors to local authorities
after accusations that it was unrepresentative.
The announcement, expected on Thursday, will include details of the new
regional offices, also promised in the election manifesto, to co-ordinate
the work of Whitehall departments in the regions. The offices will give
businesses, local authorities and voluntary bodies a single point of access
to the Environment Department, the Department of Trade and Industry and the
Home Office. A senior civil servant will head each office as regional
director.
The creation of the regional offices has already been condemned by the
opposition as 'a further sinister act of centralisation'. Mr Jack Straw,
Labour's environment spokesman, described the regional directors as
'Whitehall commissars'.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Russian banks opt to invest overseas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN banks have more than Dollars 15bn stashed away in accounts in the
west but have made hard currency loans worth less than half a billion
dollars to customers within Russia.
Thirteen banks, which account for 80 per cent of Russian hard currency
operations, had Dollars 10.03bn in correspondent and investment accounts in
western banks at January 1 this year, according to a western study. The same
banks had outstanding loans of less than Dollars 300m lent to customers
inside Russia.
By this June, all Russian banks held about Dollars 15.5bn abroad, according
to central bank figures. Loans within Russia were worth about 3 per cent of
that sum.
The figures compiled from official sources and the banks are an index of the
financial chaos within the Russian economy.
While the banks have large amounts of hard currency abroad, the government
is rescheduling debts owed to the west, seeking other forms of international
finance to help it promote business investment.
Many Russian companies with export potential have money but do not trust the
national currency or the authorities enough to keep it at home in roubles.
Banks avoid lending within the country - except to clients which earn hard
currency and are well-known to them - because of to a lack of mechanisms to
ensure repayment.
Mr Francis Gelibter, director of Eurosiris Russie, the St Petersburg-based
joint venture of Eurosiris, the French consultancy, which conducted the
study said: 'If I were the manager of a Russian bank I would do the same
because there are few alternatives to placing the money abroad. Lending is
risky because you don't know if the person will disappear tomorrow or
whether new legislation will ruin the success of a project.'

FT  01 NOV 93 / De Benedetti lawyers attack magistrates' arrest order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LAWYERS for Mr Carlo De Bene-detti, the head of Olivetti, were seeking to
make arrangements yesterday for him to hand himself over to Rome magistrates
to answer corruption charges.
Mr De Benedetti was outside Italy when an arrest warrant was issued in Rome
on Saturday. His lawyers, who expressed 'amazement' at the warrant, said Mr
De Benedetti would 'simply follow his usual approach and present himself to
the judges to answer their questions'.
Lawyers were seeking to determine whether Mr De Benedetti would be obliged
to spend time in jail before being questioned. With a public holiday today,
they initially suggested that Mr De Benedetti should hand himself over on
Tuesday.
The arrest warrant for Mr De Benedetti has provoked consternation in Italy
among lawyers and businessmen as well in the media - not least in the daily
La Repubblica, which Mr De Benedetti also owns.
At Ivrea, the headquarters of Olivetti, the unions voiced concern over the
future of the telecommunications and office equipment group, which made
first-half losses of L168bn (Pounds 69.79m).
The magistrates' move against one of the most prominent figures in Italian
business also comes at a moment of increasing confusion as Italy's
discredited political parties disintegrate.
The charges against Mr De Benedetti relate to payments of L10bn made to
secure Ministry of Posts contracts for teleprinters between 1988-91. They
have already been investigated by Milan magistrates.
However, the investigations into the postal ministry have since become the
responsibility of Rome magistrates. They have hinted that they have acquired
new information suggesting payments to secure contracts went back to 1983.
More seriously for Mr De Benedetti, the Rome magistrates have altered the
nature of the charges. They are alleging that Mr De Benedetti was a willing
party to the payments and actively connived in them.
The essence of Mr De Benedetti's defence has been that he was forced to make
payments to ministry officials and their political masters. To demonstrate
that, he said that in 1987, when he refused to comply with demands for
money, Olivetti did only L23bn worth of business with the ministry. A year
later, when commissions had been arranged, orders jumped to L204bn.

FT  01 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reports that British Gas considered breaking itself up before it went to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission will surprise those who have heard the
company argue so vigorously against the idea. In part, its opposition
represented understandable negotiating tactics while the MMC was
deliberating. Yet the way in which the company has switched ground threatens
to undermine its negotiating position. British Gas has thought about
break-up, fought it tooth and nail, accepted it with alacrity when financial
inducements were offered and now seems prepared to drop the idea since it is
getting little support at the Department of Trade and Industry.
The DTI is a keen advocate of competition and wants to see it introduced as
quickly as possible. Yet at a time when VAT is being levied on domestic
fuel, passing the costs of introducing competition on to consumers would
hardly be an attractive political option. If the company's lobbying
credibility is dented, it risks being saddled with competition, falling
market share, a squeeze on profits and no regulatory relief. That would
leave the company no better off than it was before it asked for the MMC
reference.
Shareholders should also be nervous, since if the financial noose were to be
tightened much further, dividend prospects could start to look uncertain.
The consensus may be that appeals to Gas's flotation prospectus can carry
little weight now, but under those circumstances investors could justifiably
conclude that they were sold a pig in a poke.

   A series of economic statistics this week

<TEXT>
from purchasing managers' surveys to Friday's employment report - should
confirm that the US economic recovery has gathered pace in the second half
of the year. Growth forecasts for the period have increased to an annual
rate of 4 per cent, with the main impetus being provided by consumer
spending and housing activity. Quite why consumers are spending more freely
is something of a mystery, given that consumer confidence remains subdued
and earnings are not rising rapidly.
Whatever the cause, the surge in consumer spending may have an impact on
manufacturing as companies rebuild depleted stocks. That should be
sufficient to support growth into the early part of 1994. To maintain the
recovery beyond that will require an increase in employment which will only
come if companies believe that the improvement in demand is sustainable.
The economic upturn has not as yet disturbed the bond market, since
inflationary pressures remain subdued. Nor is the Federal Reserve likely to
tighten short-term interest rates until it is convinced that a strong and
sustainable recovery is in train. With funds flowing out of deposits, bond
yields and equity prices may be sustainable for the moment, even though the
gathering recovery brings the prospects of a Fed tightening nearer. While
attention is focused on the Federal Reserve, the first signs of an end to
the equity bull market will probably come from weakening bonds rather than
rising short-term rates.

asset value of Lloyd's trusts' bond and equity holdings will be easily
measured. But the real balance of risks and rewards lies with underwriting
exposures at Lloyd's. Profits and losses from underwriting can not be
quantified until the 1994 underwriting year closes, in three years' time
under Lloyd's accounting rules. Without a secondary market in syndicate
participations, these exposures can not be easily valued in the meantime.
Lloyd's trusts should thus perform like insurance companies, trading at a
premium or discount to the value of their underlying investment portfolio,
depending on the underwriting outlook. How investors are expected to judge
the climate at Lloyd's is a complicated issue. Composite insurers are
already vulnerable to hurricanes and earthquakes, but Lloyd's syndicates
carry a far higher gearing to such unpredictable catastrophes. Claims
arising in obscure US courtrooms can have equally damaging effects.
That argues for a strict disclosure regime to ensure equal access to
information. Individual names at Lloyd's receive quarterly reports,
including claims figures relating to the syndicates in which they
participate. Stock market investors have a right to expect equal treatment,
not to mention stock exchange announcements when the Lutine bell tolls.

FT  01 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Ofwat's water works
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Next Thursday is an important day for the UK water industry: Ofwat will
produce the methodology for calculating price caps up to the year 2000. The
market will probably focus closely on the rate of return that water
companies are allowed on new investment. The industry seems resigned to an
outcome towards the lower end of the 6.5 to 7.5 per cent range suggested by
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for British Gas's pipelines business.
Ofwat will probably also disclose its method for measuring the companies'
asset base. These are the main theoretical tools for setting price limits in
the second half of the decade.
The snag is that Ofwat may have to bridge a gap between theory and practice.
A lowish rate of return would leave companies such as South West and North
West with weakened balance sheets. Ofwat is therefore likely to leave open
the option of more relaxed price limits from some companies to keep interest
cover in shape. But it seems too much to hope that the regulator will say
how far it thinks each company's financial ratios might be stretched.
Without a steer on that point, judging the final outcome of the review will
still be a matter of guesswork.
Exactly how much capital expenditure will have to be financed through the
second half of the decade will also remain uncertain. The government's
missive on the subject last month left open the possibility of renegotiating
Europe's tougher water purity standards. That might cut Anglian's spending
plans by anything up to Pounds 600m over five years. But negotiating with
Britain's EC partners takes time. The chances are that the industry will be
back talking with the regulator even after a settlement has been reached on
the final price caps.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Focusing on grander horizons: Kodak's new chairman wants the
group to play a leading role in the information revolution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was one of those rare shifts of perspective that make the world suddenly
look a very different place.
It came courtesy of Mr George Fisher, one of America's most respected
managers, who caused some surprise last week by moving from the chairmanship
of high-flying electronics group Motorola to head Eastman Kodak, the
struggling photographic products giant which had ousted the previous
chairman, Mr Kay Whitmore, because of its lacklustre financial performance.
What, in addition to an extremely generous pay package, would prompt Mr
Fisher to exchange his comfortable job for such a bed of thorns and abandon
suburban Chicago for the stolid provincialism of Rochester, Kodak's home
town in rural upstate New York?
The 52-year-old Mr Fisher explained he had a vision of Kodak playing a
leading role in the 'information revolution' - shorthand for the convergence
of the communications, computer and information sectors into one giant
multi-media industry, tied together by their ability to transform data into
common, digital electronic form.
'I have lain awake for the past two nights thinking about the
possibilities,' he enthused, adding that while 90 per cent of his ideas
might not work, 10 per cent of them would be 'killers'.
On one level he was stating the obvious: Kodak, at heart a chemicals
company, knows its long-term prosperity depends on it mastering the
electronics revolution which is transforming photography, along with so many
other industries.
The company has, after all, poured vast sums of money into electronic
experiments over the past decade. And many of them have been failures - a
reminder that Mr Fisher's grand schemes may be devilishly hard to deliver.
The importance of his remarks was that he presented a snapshot of a bold,
aggressive and optimistic enterprise, riding the crest of a technological
wave - and the picture carried a degree of conviction, thanks to his
successful career so far on the cutting edge of the electronics industry.
That is a stark contrast to today's popular image of Kodak. For it is a
company, lacking any compelling vision, which has been defined for a decade
or more not so much by its possibilities as by its problems. Its stumbling
attempts to overcome them present a case study in the difficulties of
shaking up a rigid, corporate culture.
Ever since the 1970s, the company, which pioneered the mass-market
photography industry and remains the world's largest manufacturer of film,
has been haunted by two big threats.
One is electronics, which allows images to be created without the chemical
process which has characterised the photography industry since its birth -
the sensitivity to light of silver halide salts. Electronic cameras, ranging
from simple consumer camcorders to sophisticated still cameras, have been
nibbling away at the market for traditional film, although they do not yet
pose a serious threat to it and may not for many years. This is partly
because no-one has yet invented a cheap, high-quality, digital still camera
and partly because silver halide is still unrivalled as a medium for
capturing the sharpest, most subtle images.
The other threat to Kodak is more immediate. It faces increasing competition
in the film manufacturing business - the company's financial engine,
churning out a fabulous stream of cash flow - from manufacturers of rival
branded and own-label goods, sold at a discount to Kodak's product.
Its arch-rival is Japan's Fuji Photo Film, known for its bold colours and a
history of innovation, but others include Germany's Agfa and America's 3M.
The competition has been growing for several decades - a period when growth
in the western world's consumption of film has slowed from around 10 per
cent a year to a modest 4 per cent.
Despite years of competition, Kodak still commands well over half the global
film market and may even have been gaining share in some countries, as its
reputation for quality - its single most important asset - recovered from a
dip in the 1980s. It retains one of the world's most powerful brand names.
The trouble is that a combination of sluggish sales growth, loss of market
share and pressure on prices has held back its photography profits, while
the company has poured the cash from this business into lavish levels of
research, gold-plated capital investments and unsuccessful diversifications
which have failed to lift earnings.
To no avail it has also taken a succession of large charges against earnings
for restructurings over the past eight years and implemented two big changes
in management structure - the second to put right the flaws in the first.
'The frustration of many long-time shareholders is that the company seems to
have spent these vast sums of money. . .and there hasn't been an incremental
return on those investments,' says Mr Michael Ellmann, an analyst at brokers
Wertheim Schroder.
Indeed, Kodak's 1992 net income of Dollars 1.15bn (Pounds 821m), on sales of
some Dollars 20bn, was slightly lower than its income in 1982 and the
company is forecasting operating earnings this year no higher than last.
Many of the company's problems are personified in 61-year-old Mr Whitmore,
who became chairman in 1990. He is a cautious, kindly man who joined Kodak
as a film manufacturing engineer in 1957 and is steeped in the company's
paternalistic culture. Repeatedly prodded by shareholders and the board, he
started drawing up a plan of action this year to improve the company's
performance, including cuts in the research budget and the spinning off of
its bulk chemicals subsidiary as a separately quoted company.
But he seemed unwilling to take the tough action needed to boost earnings
from the current 5 per cent of sales to the board's 10 per cent target,
including severe job losses. And he appeared unable to articulate a clear
growth strategy.
Yet while Mr Whitmore has become the fall-guy, the roots of Kodak's problems
stretch back through at least two other chairmen - and arguably to the
origins of the company set up in Rochester in 1880 by George Eastman, a high
school drop-out.
Eastman, a marketing genius who sold the world's first simple camera under
the slogan 'you push the button, we do the rest,' built Kodak into the
dominant force in the industry, at one time commanding some 90 per cent of
the film market. He was also a pioneer in labour relations, lavishing
generous health care and retirement benefits on the workers of Rochester, a
city whose most striking landmark remains the solid, square tower of Kodak's
headquarters.
Kodak's extraordinary success, combined with the insularity of Rochester and
the company's dominance of the town, bred a mixture of complacency and
arrogance.
Kodak found Japanese rivals stealing a lead with easier to use cameras,
faster films, more efficient processing and marketing innovations such as
the disposable camera, which is thrown away after its pre-packed film is
processed.
Its arrogance was demonstrated most clearly in its reaction to Polaroid's
invention of the instant camera. Kodak first dismissed it as a fad, but
belatedly followed Polaroid's lead - only to be forced from the market by a
15-year patent infringement suit which cost it Dollars 925m in a 1991
settlement.
Even when Kodak began to realise its problems, its efforts to right matters
were often half-hearted, ill-focused, or just plain wrong.
In the film business, for example, it took an expensive gamble on disk
cameras - small cameras with film mounted on a disk - which it hailed in
1982 as the 'new engine which will drive amateur photography.' But consumers
favoured the simplified 35mm cameras pioneered by Japanese rivals, which
produced higher quality pictures. Kodak abandoned the disk five years ago.
It made an abortive foray into marketing Japanese-built camcorders and
squandered a lead over Xerox in photo copier design.
It diversified into a hodge-podge of businesses (many of them sold during
the past year), such as Atex, the newspaper copy processing system. The
spree culminated in 1988 with the Dollars 5.1bn purchase of Sterling Drug, a
pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter drugs company.
Kodak could advance a plausible rationale for a pharmaceuticals acquisition:
its chemicals expertise has given it a wealth of formulae which could be
useful to a drugs company. But it paid a fancy price for Sterling, a company
with a thin research pipeline which so far has failed to pay its way - while
landing Kodak with a vast debt burden.
However, the record is not universally dismal. In the electronics field,
Kodak and its Dutch partner Philips have scored a considerable coup with
their invention of the photo CD system, introduced last year. This involves
scanning ordinary silver halide photographs into digital form and then
storing them on discs, like compact records. Using a photo CD player, the
pictures can can then be displayed on television or computer screens.
But while increasingly popular with business users, this transitional
technology between the silver halide and digital worlds has failed to take
off in the important consumer market. 'It's not inexpensive, it tends to be
complicated for the average consumer and it's just not walking off the
shelves,' says Mr Eugene Fram, professor of marketing at the Rochester
Institute of Technology. In other words, it's not a profits blockbuster.
Kodak may have some significant digital inventions in the pipeline. One
rumour suggests it is near to unveiling a camera developed jointly with
computer company Apple. Yet some critics argue that the company has been
reluctant in the past to commit wholeheartedly to electronic photography,
for fear of the damage this could cause to the silver halide side.
To the extent that electronics needs a shot in the arm, it should get one
from Mr Fisher, whose whole career has been spent in this industry - first
at Bell Laboratories, the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph research centre,
and since 1976 at Motorola, where he has played a central role in turning
the company into a leading manufacturer of mobile telephones and pagers and
the world's fourth largest semi-conductor manufacturer.
But his most immediate problems will be more prosaic and unpleasant. Despite
little experience in corporate retrenchment, he needs to cut costs quickly -
possibly with job losses above the 10,000 reluctantly announced by Mr
Whitmore in August - to increase cash flow and reduce Kodak's debt burden.
He may also sell peripheral assets. He intends to keep the healthcare
division as one of two 'pillars' of Kodak, alongside imaging, having been
pleasantly surprised by an independent report on the business prepared for
him by an investment bank. But analysts think the barely profitable photo
copier business might go and also the household products subsidiary.
No less important for the long-term will be rebuilding the management team -
a task at which Mr Fisher is said to excel - and instilling in it a greater
degree of marketing expertise than Kodak has displayed recently.
As a cure for myopia, Mr Fisher might also consider moving the headquarters
from Rochester. As it is, his first comments have raised Kodak's sights from
the humdrum, but necessary, task of restructuring to far grander horizons of
technological triumph.
Visions, of course, are two-a-penny, and it will be no easy matter to turn
this champion of the first industrial revolution into a winner in the next.
But at least it's a start.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Leading Article: European union
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AS OF today, the Treaty of Maastricht is legally in force. Whether they like
it or not, and whether they know it or not, all nationals of the 12 member
states of the European Community woke up this morning as something which
last night they were not, namely citizens of the European Union (EU).
That may not make them feel any different. Its only direct practical effects
are to give them the right to petition the European parliament, on matters
of EC competence which directly concern them; the right to complain of EC
maladministration to an ombudsman appointed by the parliament; and, if they
are resident in a member state other than their own, the right to vote in
European elections (starting next year) and local elections (starting in
1995).
Yet the EU is more than the EC writ large. Besides the EC itself, it
includes two other 'pillars'. One is intended to provide it with a 'common
foreign and security policy', leading in time to a common defence policy,
perhaps even a common defence. The other institutionalises co-operation
between the member states on justice and home affairs.
Within the Union, the EC itself is significantly modified by the treaty  -
though the most spectacular changes, creating an economic and monetary union
(Emu), are supposed to take full effect only in five, or at the earliest
three, years' time. Events since the treaty was signed have made it doubtful
whether either this timetable, or the procedure envisaged, are realistic.
The European Monetary Institute, which will start work on January 1, should
see itself not as the police force of the treaty but as a useful forum for
rethinking both the path to Emu and how best to manage what may prove an
extended interim period.
Taken as a whole, the treaty was drafted too soon and too quickly to be an
adequate response to the collapse of communism. That has brought into being
a Europe radically different from the one in which and for which the EC was
built. The chance to extend western Europe's zone of prosperity and security
eastwards is far too valuable and the risk of contagious instability in
central Europe if the chance is missed far too great, for the EC to be able
to ignore it. Hence the historic decision, made in Copenhagen last June,
that 'the associated countries in central and eastern Europe that so desire
shall become members of the European Union'.
Strategic issues
But to meet the needs of a new and wider Europe the EC will have to adapt in
ways different from, and more radical than, the changes that come into force
today. The principle of the sacrosanct acquis communautaire - that new
members must adapt to arrangements previously agreed between existing
members, rather than vice versa - will simply not work when what is
envisaged is an expansion that will eventually double the number of member
states, bringing in new members with very different political and economic
traditions.
It is true that that expansion will take some time. But it would be folly to
imagine that the problems can be solved by dealing with them piecemeal, in a
succession of negotiations with small groups of applicant countries. On the
contrary, that procedure would virtually ensure that the strategic issues
were not confronted and that the end product was utterly incoherent and
unworkable.
As things stand, the EC is pursuing enlargement negotiations with four Efta
countries, and is due to hold an intergovernmental conference in 1996 to
revise the union treaty as far as seems desirable in the light of
experience. It might make more sense to bring the conference forward and
combine it with the enlargement talks, so that the parliaments and
electorates of all 16 countries could consider the results simultaneously.
On the day-to-day level, the immediate task for the 12 must now be to try to
operate the institutional machinery provided by the treaty and see how it
works. But that should be combined with serious thought at the strategic
level about the union of the future - a process which cannot be confined to
12 states or even 16. All the likely future members of the union must be
involved in it, which means that some sort of skeleton institutional
structure for it should be established as soon as possible.
It is clear that a union of the size and diversity envisaged cannot be
highly centralised. It should have a single, open market, but its member
states must be free to experiment with measures to alleviate their
employment problems and to decide, within limits, their own macro-economic
policies. For unless it can achieve sustained economic growth and unless it
can reduce unemployment well below its current levels in both eastern and
western Europe, the union is doomed to fail. It faces a formidable challenge
from the new and dynamic economies of east Asia. It has no hope of meeting
that challenge if it seeks to impose on all its members the social
regulations that the most prosperous still think they can afford.
Open relationships
Full economic and monetary union of such a large area could only come about
over several decades, if at all. Even then the national identities of the
member states and the desire of their peoples to retain control of their own
destinies, would have to be carefully entrenched and protected. They would
not tolerate any attempt to merge them into a single state, even a federal
one.
There could and should be no question of such a union fencing itself off
from the rest of the world with tariff or non-tariff barriers. On the
contrary, Europe can remain prosperous only if it maintains open
relationships with the rest of the world, particularly in trade and
investment. Indeed, the union should play a major role in securing global
economic order.
Yet to talk of 'playing a role' implies a capacity to take decisions and to
act on them; and a union of that size will not be able to avoid
responsibilities in the area of physical as well as economic security. So
although 'widening' may rightly be seen as the enemy of 'deepening', when
the latter means a highly intrusive central power, the same is not true when
'deepening' means strengthening the ability of the union to decide and to
act within the areas agreed.
In matters essential to its functioning and survival - notably internal and
external trade, free movement of capital and labour, but also the key areas
of foreign and security policy, including immigration, asylum, the fight
against transnational crime and at least some aspects of defence -
decision-making processes will need to be streamlined and sovereignty
pooled. The union will not be effective in a crisis if its every move has to
be unanimously approved in advance by the representatives of 20 or 30
separate bureaucracies. A central question will concern the necessary
increase in the voting weights to be exercised by the large countries within
the community.
It will obviously be a long time before even all the existing members, let
alone all the future ones, are ready to make the sacrifices of sovereignty
required for an effective union in this sense. Some, moreover, will be more
interested in participating in the economic and monetary aspects, while for
others the issues of physical security will be paramount. It is therefore
inescapable that those who are ready to act together in a particular area
should move ahead and do so, using or creating whatever institutions are
necessary. That is already happening with border control (the Schengen
treaty), with defence (the Western European Union), and with the management
of exchange rates. It would happen for Emu even if Maastricht were applied
to the letter, since not all member states would be ready for stage three at
the same time. 'Variable geometry' is not something to be ashamed of. It is
in fact the only way a viable European union can be built.

The professional advisers behind the rescue of Canary Wharf seem somehow to
have preserved their sense of humour during the last few months of
negotiations. But, as children, they were clearly all far too serious-minded
to watch cartoons.
The company that rises Phoenix-like in place of Olympia &amp; York to control
the Docklands development is called Sylvester Investments, apparently named
after the cartoon cat that pursued Tweety Pie, the canary.
Only problem is, in the cartoon Tweety Pie was never caught. Unlike the
bankers and other creditors to Canary Wharf. . .

Guess who's moving in next door to Lord Rothschild, Rupert Murdoch and John
Paul Getty 11 in a particularly salubrious corner of St James's, just off
London's Green Park? Popping round for a cup of sugar any moment now will be
Tiny Rowland's bete noire, Dieter Bock, the German financier, who last week
rechristened his Lonrho colleague as his 'dear disjointed chief executive'.
The building containing Bock's new flat was designed in 1960 by the high
priest of British modernism, Sir Denys Lasdun. Being something of a design
freak himself, Bock is in the process of gutting the apartment to return it
to its former glory.
While Observer is not party to the price at which Bock secured his new pad,
the asking price, for a 32-year-lease, was Pounds 1.8m, with service charges
in excess of an annual Pounds 25,000.
Apparently the basement car parking space costs another Pounds 5,500 a year
 -which seems a bit steep for someone whose favourite modes of transport are
supposed to be a 2CV and a bike.

It was, by all accounts, a very auspicious meeting, when Cedric Brown, chief
executive of British Gas, first sat down with his new regulator, Clare
Spottiswoode.
Spottiswoode, who takes over from Sir James McKinnon today, invited herself
round a few days ago for an hour's introductory chat. The pair hit it off so
well that she stayed for two and a half.
'It was very constructive and wide-ranging,' beams Brown. 'We talked about
issues spanning the whole breadth of the business in a way which we'd never
done before. It bodes well.'
Which marks something of a departure from the stormy encounters that
characterised British Gas's relationship with Sir James in the bad old days.
Even McKinnon has mellowed a touch. At his farewell party last week, he
spoke almost fondly of the people 'in that building down by the river' - not
that he could bring himself to mouth the name of the company inhabiting the
Thamesside headquarters.

The rest of Europe may fiddle, but the mighty Deutsche Bank seems to have
its eye on the main chance. Last week, Germany's leading commercial bank
completed probably the largest property deal in the British capital in more
than two years when it acquired, through its 60 per cent-owned subsidiary
DGI, the long leasehold of One Exchange Square.
So now that it has become landlord to the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, why not offer that other breed of Eurobankers a home as
well, seeing the EMI has been secured by Frankfurt?
After all, the idea that Europe's new central bank should be housed in the
cavernous IG Farben building was always faintly risible, given that the
simply vast edifice built for the pre-1945 chemical conglomerate has since
housed as many as 60,000 US soldiers.
As the Bundesbank has rented a number of floors in the landmark Messeturm
skyscraper, that too is ruled out if the new Eurocrats are to be spared
waspish words in the elevators.
But what about the so-called Trianon, the brand new building a D-Mark's
throw away from Deutsche Bank's twin towers? Ten floors higher, it was
originally supposed to be the new headquarters of BfG, but it was snapped up
by Deutsche when the former union bank fell on hard times. It is only two
thirds let, so EMI president designate Alexandre Lamfalussy might like to
turn up to the dedication bash this Thursday to have a look around.
Then again it is perhaps not a long-term solution. Intended to be redolent
of Marie-Antoinette's village in the grounds of Versailles, the name of the
building could prove something of an embarrassment, as EU enlargement
progresses. Not everyone will have forgotten the 1920 Trianon treaty
according to which two thirds of Hungary's territory was confiscated after
the first world war.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For all you folk soundly asleep at midnight last night, unmoved by the
passing of a momentous historic occasion, welcome to European Union.
'Nothing could better illustrate this stillborn treaty than its coming into
effect on the eve of the day of the dead'. One of many to remark on the
ennui with which the treaty's coming is greeted, French far-right
nationalist Jean-Marie Le Pen may have a point.
By contrast with the short history of the European endeavour, All Souls' Day
was first celebrated 995 years ago at the behest of Odilo, abbot of Cluny.
He had been struck by the tale of a pilgrim returning from Palestine who had
been wrecked on a rocky isle, home to a hermit. The pilgrim had promptly
been led to a fiery crevice, from which issued the groans of tormented
souls. The good abbot duly ordered that a day be set aside to commemorate
all those in purgatory.
How long, then, should Europe's politicians suffer before they are forgiven
for signing Maastricht?

FT  01 NOV 93 / A unified Budget is worth the bother
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Treasury is once more making threatening noises about tax
increases of up to Pounds 5bn per annum. But it is not clear how far these
are a response to a threatened overshoot of agreed spending limits for the
next financial year and how far they represent an independent wish to
tighten the fiscal stance. Only the first would be justified during a
fragile and modest recovery - and then as a holding operation until the
prime minister summons up the courage to confront his spending colleagues.
In any case, politicians and officials should resist the temptation to blame
all their troubles on the decision of the last chancellor, Norman Lamont, to
present a unified Budget covering both expenditure and taxation. Amazing
though it is to retell, British Budgets have up to now covered only the tax
side. The first unified Budget is due on November 30 and not before time.
The last chancellor's decision to introduce it was widely commended, but is
now the target of a hostile whispering campaign by grumblers who say that it
is not working and that it will not last.
Something is indeed wrong. But the mistake is that the change has not gone
far enough. For as Andrew Dilnot of the Institute for Fiscal Studies pointed
out at an early stage, the Budget is now unified only in name. Public
expenditure discussions are still taken in outline in July and in detail in
autumn, a process which is now giving the cabinet so much trouble. Tax
decisions are still made by the chancellor and the prime minister, after
just a prudential consultation with colleagues. The main difference is that
they have now to be made in a rush before the Christmas season, instead of
in March.
The way forward should surely be to make the Budget genuinely unified: that
is for the cabinet to discuss both spending and tax together at the same
time. This does not mean subscribing to the primitive notion of an exactly
balanced Budget or even a fixed borrowing requirement. The true housekeeping
point is that, whatever level of borrowing is prudent in a given economic
situation, extra spending on X still means less spending on Y or higher
taxes; and the more that the noses of people like Malcolm Rifkind, the
British Defence Secretary, can be rubbed into this logic the better.
The grumbles about a unified Budget are fourfold. First there is said to be
an undue strain on the Treasury in a short period in the autumn. The second
is that the gap between a late November Budget and the beginning of the
financial year in April is said to provide a heaven-sent opportunity for
parliamentary mischief-makers to try to overturn the chancellor's decisions.
The third is that a November Budget has to be decided on the basis of a
premature, and therefore unnecessarily bad, guess about economic and revenue
prospects, compared with an assessment made in March. There is apparently a
fourth objection: that the Conservatives are depriving themselves of the
opportunity of a spring election a few weeks after a tax-cutting March
Budget. This is not even good politics, overlooking as it does Abraham
Lincoln's saying about not being able to fool all of the people all the
time.
The answer to the first point about the overload on the Treasury is 'hard
luck'. The seasonal pressures are a hazard of the job, as similar pressures
are for farmers and fishermen. The second objection would amount to contempt
of parliament if it had more substance. Where quick implementation is
possible, as in the case of VAT and drink and tobacco duties, new rates can
come into effect the day after Budget Day, irrespective of when that day is.
The gap in implementing say, income tax decisions, is administrative and has
little to do with the financial year. Indeed, November announcements should
enable new income tax rates to come into force at the beginning of the
financial year in April instead of in high summer.
Thus we are left with the third difficulty, of guessing the fiscal outlook a
few months before the start of the financial year. On the Treasury's own
doctrines this should be a minor problem. For the official view - not mine -
is that tax rates should be set to bring the Budget back towards balance
over several years, accepting that progress will be slow in years of
recession or modest recovery and relatively fast when growth is more rapid.
If that is so, the chancellor should not be panicked into raising taxes
because recovery is slower than foreseen; nor should he become more relaxed
if economic prospects improve. In either case a departure from the target
balance would be a helpful stabiliser - and even economists who are
sceptical of such considerations are keen on stable tax rates, based on an
assessment covering a whole business cycle, for supply side reasons.
It seems that, whatever politicians and officials think they believe, the
ghost of Philip Snowden, the ultra-conservative Labour chancellor who tried
to balance the Budget in the 1931 depression and destroyed his party in the
process, still stalks the corridors. My own proposal, made in Economic
Viewpoint on October 21, is for announcing slow-motion revenue increasing
reforms, desirable in themselves, like phasing out mortgage interest relief,
but coupling them with offsetting tax-cutting proposals to be introduced if
the economic and fiscal position allows. This is hardly throwing caution to
the winds.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: The politics that does not deserve
space
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr P B MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a recent convert to the FT, I hope you will allow me to say how much
I disagree with the letter from Jack Straw (October 28).
In considering what to publish, newspapers must remember that readers' time
is limited, and hence what matters is the importance to them of politicians'
speeches compared with other matter competing for space. I recently co-wrote
a book on a major new piece of legislation, and for this purpose I was
obliged to read every debate in both Houses of Parliament (including
committees). Frankly, 95 per cent of what I had to read was drivel that did
not deserve to be printed, even in Hansard, let alone in newspapers. And Mr
Straw may care to note that most of the remaining 5 per cent was uttered in
the House of Lords. I prefer to read a newspaper which prints things of some
value.
Granted, actual decisions of government or parliament, and the occasional
policy announcement, are - or may be - news, and may be reported on that
basis. However, the puerile posturing of self-important, second-rate
intellects is not. Hence my preference for the FT.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: No benefit to housing market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr A M COLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You report, 'Heroic assumptions and political realities' (October 28),
that there will 'probably (be) new restrictions on benefit payments to cover
mortgage interest'.
The exact nature of these restrictions is not clear. Nevertheless, it has
been suggested in other media that the role which the state plays in
protecting mortgage borrowers from the consequences of unemployment might be
taken over by private insurers. There will be three major consequences of
any such change, their severity depending on the extent of the reduction in
state support:
(a) An increase in the number of repossessions. It is inconceivable that
private sector schemes could be as comprehensive as that currently offered
under the income support regulations. Any saving on expenditure on income
support would probably be more than absorbed by increased expenditure on the
provision of housing to the homeless.
(b) An increase in the cost of mortgage finance, reflecting both the
increased risk of lending on mortgages, and the cost of insurance premiums.
(c) Some potential purchasers, identified by private insurers as
particularly vulnerable to unemployment would find it very difficult to
enter the market because unemployment cover would not be available.
At a time when the government is seeking to extend still further the groups
of people able to become owner-occupiers through its rents to mortgages
scheme, it is entirely inconsistent to be cutting back on the support which
the state is able to offer if things go wrong. More generally, with the
housing market remaining in deep recession, changes of the type being
proposed will have the effect of putting back still further any meaningful
recovery in activity.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Slow recovery on the runway: High losses and liberalisation
are forcing airlines to restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some stark financial numbers will dominate today's annual gathering of the
world airline industry in Dallas, Texas.
Mr Pierre Jeanniot, the director-general of the International Air Transport
Association (Iata), will report to the organisation's 221 airline members
that they lost Dollars 11.5bn on international scheduled services alone
between 1990 and 1992: more than all the net profits made by the industry
since international airline services began just after the first world war.
The combined industry losses are even bigger if domestic services and other
activities are included, swelling the total to Dollars 15.9bn for the same
three-year period.
Although extensive cost cutting and restructuring, coupled with a slow but
steady recovery in air travel after the Gulf conflict in 1991, have started
improving the industry's overall outlook, Mr Jeanniot expects airlines to
report another big loss this year.
'It will be surprising if Iata members' losses in 1993 are less than half of
those in 1992,' he says. That would put 1993 airline losses on international
services at Dollars 2.4bn-Dollars 2.5bn after a record deficit of Dollars
4.8bn last year.
All this financial agony combined with increasing liberalisation has forced
the pace of profound structural change. Direct employment has fallen by some
80,000 people and about 1,000 aircraft deliveries were cancelled or deferred
last year as carriers continued to reduce costs by eliminating marginal
operations, increase sub-contracting and concentrate on their core airline
business, according to Iata's annual report.
They have also had to adapt to changing consumer demands fuelled by
increasing cost consciousness in all sectors of the economy. This has led to
an overall decrease in fares, (in real terms, the economy fare between New
York and London is now half what it was in 1950), a reduction in first-class
services, improved business-class services and growing demand for more
low-cost leisure travel seats.
Perhaps the most significant trend has been the scramble for mergers and
alliances, with airlines seeking to position themselves in an increasingly
global and deregulated market. The list of partnership agreements completed
or under negotiation keeps growing. Lufthansa of Germany last month forged a
strategic link with United Airlines of the US; negotiations between
Swissair, SAS, KLM and Austrian Airlines to combine their operations have
reached a critical stage; and British Airways has bought equity stakes in
USAir, Qantas and two smaller European regional airlines. These are just
some of the bigger deals.
The financial losses of airlines have also provoked 'unique' government
responses, says Iata. 'For the first time, governments on both sides of the
Atlantic have simultaneously recognised the threat to the long-term
viability of aviation as an integrated and global transport system,' Iata
notes in its annual report.
In the US, this has led to the establishment of a presidential commission to
recommend steps to help restore the profitability of US carriers. In Europe,
the EC has set up a committee of 'wise men' which is due to suggest measures
to support the recovery of the European airline industry by the end of the
year.
But these government initiatives have once again raised the threat of a
return to tighter regulations and protectionism. The concerns are
particularly acute in Europe, where many state-owned flag carriers have been
slower to restructure their activities and have been calling for more state
support.
In contrast,the first tentative signs of improvement are emerging in the US
industry, with several carriers, including American Airlines, the biggest US
carrier, reporting profits in the third quarter of this year.
Under pressure from some national flag carriers and their government owners
to reinstate some form of protection for European airlines, the European
Commission has stated that it will resist any attempt to curb liberalisation
in European air transport.
'What some of them are after apparently is a price cartel,' says Mr Karel
van Miert, the Belgian socialist who holds the EC's competition portfolio.
'That, we cannot and will not allow. We won't accept a fare cartel or a
capacity reduction cartel,' he adds, accusing some airlines of 'a certain
nostalgia' for pre-open skies days - the era of airline cartels.
Mr van Miert's warning followed a proposal by Belgium to reintroduce the
capacity-sharing the EC has outlawed as well as Community funding for
airlines in trouble to get round the tougher state aids regime the
Commission is now enforcing.
Belgium has so far received little support for its ideas, except from
France. But the financial plight of most European airlines makes it more
than likely that such proposals will keep resurfacing, bringing new
pressures on the Commission.
Mr van Miert, who, as transport commissioner, last year pushed through the
third phase of EC airline deregulation, is clearly not prepared to see
liberalisation rolled back. He also has the backing of air transport
liberals led by the UK and the Netherlands.
Echoing these views, Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, told the EC 'wise
men' that the European airline industry must be supported by policies which
enhance competition. He added that capacity should be limited by market
forces and not by voluntary agreement between airlines and that the
restructuring of the European industry should be allowed to continue to
enable airlines to improve their competitiveness. If airlines could not
manage this, they should 'go out of business', Sir Colin argued.
The Commission's analysis is that Europe's airlines have to reduce costs and
consolidate into stronger alliances capable of taking on US and Asian
carriers. Brussels is prepared to help, but only within the structure of
deregulation.
The EC has, for instance, started investigations into monopolies for ground
services, such as baggage handling and refuelling at airports in Spain,
Italy and Germany. Liberalisation in these areas would reduce airline costs.
So too would any success in the Commission and industry's campaign to unify
Europe's costly and fragmented air traffic control system.
On state aid, the EC has in the past two years approved recapitalisations
for Air France, Sabena, the Belgian airline, and Iberia of Spain. But
approval was tied to restructuring plans with the EC warning these airlines
they could not come back for more state aid in the future.
Air France, however, is again seeking fresh funds from its state shareholder
as part of a restructuring programme which has provoked fierce reaction from
its trade unions. Brussels will now also have to decide whether to let
through government cash injections for Aer Lingus, Olympic Airways of Greece
and probably TAP, the Portuguese airline.
But the rearguard action by some European flag carriers to win more state
support and re-introduce some of the old capacity and fares regulations is
unlikely to halt the trend towards more 'open skies'. 'I think we are now
too far down the road to reverse the process,' says Sir Colin.
For Iata, air traffic congestion at airports and in the air remains 'the
greatest long-term threat' to the industry. 'Lack of infrastructure could
limit both the size and scope of the future industry,' it says in its annual
report.
The scale of the infrastructure challenge is simply put. Last year, the
airlines carried more than 300m international scheduled passengers. Even
after scaling back earlier long-term air travel forecasts made before the
latest crisis, Iata still expects average annual growth of 6.6 per cent
between now and 1997. If this latest forecast proves correct, Iata estimates
that 114m more people will be flying in 1997 than did in 1992.
The implications are clear. Without adequate new airport and air traffic
control investments, the industry's wings will be clipped just as it starts
showing signs of financial recovery.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Facing the unpleasant auditing
decisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER DAVIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In response to my plea (Accountancy Column, August 19) for auditors not
to seek refuge in rule books, the chairman of the United States Financial
Accounting Standards Board is right to say that accounting standards and
professional judgment should be equal partners ('Balancing rules and
professional judgment', October 14).
My concern is that they could become very unequal. Mr Beresford identifies
correctly the tendency for business people and auditing firms to ask for
more accounting rules so as to avoid having to make difficult judgments
themselves. Major business decisions are inevitably influenced by accounting
standards and it is vital not to create an unnecessary accounting
straitjacket on company directors.
I agree with Mr Beresford that there is more to be done through accounting
standards to ensure comparability of accounts. His example of merger and
acquisition accounting - and how you account (or don't account) for goodwill
 -is a case in point in the UK.
But his other example of accounting for foreign currency hedges illustrates
my point. To achieve accounting certainty, the standard setters have
traditionally associated them with the balance sheet rather than with their
real purpose of protecting future cash flow, which requires more judgment.
It is that kind of conflict between accounting definition and commercial
reality which we need to avoid.
I repeat my request for business and the auditing profession to take more of
the unpleasant decisions for themselves. In the long run this will be good
for industry and good for the profession, and it will make life easier for
Mr Beresford and his fellow standard setters.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Government commitment on Bosnia still
strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DOUGLAS HOGG MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Edward Mortimer ('No news is good news', October 27) implies that,
because Bosnia and Iraq are now less in the headlines, the government's
concern, and Britain's efforts to promote peace and to relieve suffering,
have lessened. This is quite wrong. Notwithstanding a reduction in media
coverage, these issues and the plight of the civilian populations affected
remain very high on our agenda.
We are aware of the humanitarian crisis Bosnia faces as a result of the
continued fighting and winter conditions. All parties have been responsible
for actions which have disrupted the aid convoys. But all convoys in the
area covered by the 2,300 British UN forces get through, albeit sometimes
after delay. Our troops have escorted more than 1,500 convoys carrying
nearly 70,000 tonnes of supplies. The RAF has flown nearly 900 flights to
Sarajevo delivering more than 11,000 tonnes. We shall continue our aid
effort this winter.
There can be no question of using force to fight the aid through, as Mr
Mortimer suggests. This would inevitably draw the UN forces into the
conflict, threatening both their security and the humanitarian effort
itself. But the threat of air strikes agreed by Nato in August still stands:
the Serbs and others must be in no doubt about Nato's determination to
launch such strikes if they resume, for example, the strangulation of
Sarajevo.
It is true that the Bosnian Moslems' effective rejection in late September
of the peace package negotiated by Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenberg has dealt a
blow to the prospects for an early end to the fighting. But they are
continuing their efforts, which offer the only real hope of a lasting peace.
We do not suppose that reconvening the international conference - probably
in Geneva, not London - would, by itself, produce a solution. Any such
conference must be properly prepared, with movement beforehand by all
parties to the conflict. That is what the co-chairmen are pursuing.
As for Iraq, we have not relaxed our pressure. Nor will we do so until Iraq
complies fully with its obligations, under the Security Council's ceasefire
terms. We will do what we can to give political and material support to the
population in northern and southern Iraq while the regime continues its
repression. But recognition of an alternative provisional government is not
on the agenda. Indeed, the Iraqi opposition itself is committed, as we are,
to maintaining the unity of Iraq.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Arts: Circus fun and High Art / A look back at the life of
Federico Fellini
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I always direct the same film,' Federico Fellini once said, 'I can't
distinguish one from another.' But Italian cinema's greatest veteran, who
died yesterday aged 73, kept directing the same film only in the sense that
each great artist always remakes the same work. Genius cannot disguise its
signature. From Variety Lights to La Dolce Vita, from 8 1/2 to Ginger And
Fred, Fellini's films were like whirlwind variety shows that had strayed
into High Art. Jaunty music abounded; crowd scenes bristled with exotic or
outlandish characters; and pneumatic women were paraded like circus horses
whenever the director's whip cracked.
At centre-screen there was usually Fellini himself - or his favourite alter
ego, the actor Marcello Mastroianni. And to emphasise the monomaniac aspects
of the work, filled with surfeit and self-mythologising, the film titles
themselves often incorporate their maker's name: Fellini Roma, Fellini
Satyricon, Fellini Casanova.
There were occasional glimpses of a different kind of film-maker, especially
early in his career. Movies such as I Vitelloni and Il Bidone proved he
could subtly, comically inflect the Italian neo-realist tradition; while
sombre melodramas like La Strada and Le Notte Di Cabiria were modern
cinema's answer to operatic 'verismo'.
But the carnival Fellini is still the best-known. Appropriately, he was born
in Rimini, the Adriatic holiday town; as a teenager his first job was as
comic-strip artist for a Florence-based magazine - an experience which gave
him the background, later, for his first film as director, White Sheikh
(1952), gently debunking the world of comic-book heroes.
In Rome he played truant from university law courses to work as a crime
reporter for the newspaper Il Popolo di Roma; he then did a spell of
cartoon-work and storywriting for a satirical magazine, Marc'Aurelio. During
the 1940s he escaped military service when his medical records were
destroyed during a hospital bombing; he joined a theatre troupe as
set-designer and all-purpose factotum; wrote radio scripts and co-wrote film
scripts.
He even helped to open a shop: the Funny Face Store, a novelty portrait
studio for American GIs, specialising in instant caricatures and
voice-recordings. In 1944 a visitor to this shop, Roberto Rossellini, the
film-maker, made Fellini his first important movie offer. The 'documentary'
for which Rossellini was seeking a script collaborator finally became the
classic neo-realist film Rome Open City (1945).
Five years (and several Rossellini collaborations) later, Fellini began
directing his own films. His early movies were witty, protean variations on
neo-realism; often showcases for the impish pathos of the actress Giulietta
Masina, whom he had married in 1943. But with La Dolce Vita, in 1960,
Fellini's film direction broke definitively with neo-realism. This
extravagant tale of Roman high life is decked out with surreal symbols (a
flying statue of Christ, a beached sea-monster) and mischievously inflated
minor characters, notably Anita Ekberg's fulsomely-endowed,
fountain-splashing film star.
Marcello Mastroianni's bemused hero in the film - a Fellini surrogate,
adrift in wonderland - returned three years later for the master's
masterpiece. 8 1/2 (1963) is a fantasia on themes of autobiography. Though
its story has few literal convergences with Fellini's own life apart from
the hero's profession, that of film-maker, symbolically it skywrites all his
favourite obsessions: the diversity of womanhood; the artist as ringmaster
in his own circus; fear of failing creativity; the conspiracy of the
philistines. Fellini's two great stylistic trademarks, perpetual-motion
camera and a post-dubbed babble of voices, created a film whose garrulous
forward flow seemed to sweep up every object in its path, hurling them
briefly into the air, one by one, for inspection.
To the regret of many of his admirers, Fellini did not arrest his style at
this point of development. The black-and-white baroque of 8 1/2 turned into
the gaudy rococo of Juliet and the Spirits; rococo soon became a filmic
version of fairground kitsch in movies such as Fellini Casanova and The City
of Women.
But even in his fitful final decades Fellini made films or individual
sequences that still ran rings round most orthodox modern cinema.
Fellini Roma is an unclassifiable mixture of documentary, travelogue and
mickey-taking; its climax is a Papal fashion-show, with ecclesiastical
models parading on roller-skates. Fellini Satyricon gives a surreal modern
gloss to ancient myths. Amarcord is an album of childhood memories
punctuated with moments of dazzling make-believe - the cut-out ocean liner
riding a midnight polythene sea, for example. And Fellini Intervista is a
satire on film-making which joyously mixes the impertinent (Anita Ekberg in
an in-joke cameo) with the impossible (Red Indians attacking the Appian
Way).
Like Orson Welles, perhaps his only true soulmate in Western cinema, Fellini
believed that movies were a magician's medium where even the open
acknowledgment of trickery could be part of the charm. He also spent much of
his artistic life removing barricades between the arts. For him cinema was
not just cinema: it was theatre, vaudeville, opera, circus and street fair.
His aesthetic taste may sometimes have been questioned, but never the size
or grandeur of his aesthetic appetite.
At a time when Europe became concerned about US cultural imperialism,
especially through the cinema screen, Fellini stood out as a movie-maker who
thrived while owing nothing to Hollywood. He was, indeed, one of the very
few post-second world war European directors who was able to make films on
his own terms and achieve a wide degree of popularity on both sides of the
Atlantic.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Arts: Romeo and Juliet - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Royal Ballet paid fine tribute to the memory of Sir Kenneth MacMillan
during the past weekend, which marked the first anniversary of his death.
His Romeo and Juliet was given superb revival - the ballet and the company
looking fresh, vital - with three interpretations of exceptional interest.
Two of these - Irek Mukhamedov's Romeo and Stephen Jefferies' Tybalt on
Friday - are familiar, though none the less magnificent for that. The third
was the debut, at Saturday's matinee, of Sarah Wildor as Juliet. It was one
of those rare, rare occasions when a young artist seems to discover her own
powers, and we watch, fascinated, as a talent reveals itself, unerring,
beautiful, true.
We have seen Miss Wildor since she was a child at the Royal Ballet School -
most memorably as gentle Clara in Nutcracker. She is now a lovely young
woman, two years in the company, blonde head exquisitely placed on a long
neck, with delicately-boned physique. From her first entrance as Juliet
there was a sense of concentration about her playing, an artist securely
inside the character, and as the performance progressed - its development
sure, organic, inevitable - we saw how deeply this Juliet believed in her
role, and we believed with her. She managed, and with what subtlety, to
suggest the conflict in Juliet's temperament between girlishness and nascent
passion, matching the sensuality that Romeo awakens with a child-like
obstinacy. (Her flight to Friar Laurence was ecstatic, womanly; running from
her family in the third act, she showed us a Juliet still awkward,
impetuous). The third act rightly crowned her reading: every moment had
meaning, every least action spoke. And there were incidents to which she
gave entirely individual and thrilling identity - surest sign of great
things to come. Miss Wildor is a talent to watch, to treasure, to nurture.
Michael Nunn made his debut as Romeo to this Juliet. It was a sincere,
well-considered reading: the role does not offer him such challenges as did
Rudolf in Mayerling, which he so admirably assumed last year, but it was an
intelligent first sketch which he will develop. It was inevitably shadowed
by the interpretation Irek Mukhamedov had given the night before.
Mukhamedov's Romeo is a complete portrayal. The life of the character is
vivid and ablaze with feeling: how grand is Mukhamedov's daring as he tells
us of Romeo's infatuation for Rosaline before the Capulet ball - he looks
up, as if at a full moon, and rejoices in the night's romantic
possibilities. The thunderbolt of Juliet's presence, the sensual charge
Mukhamedov gives everything that follows, burns through the dancing. The
relationship with Tybalt is no less bold. I think Stephen Jefferies' is the
best Tybalt the Royal Ballet has shown us. There is menace, of course, but
Jefferies tells of the frustrations and innate fury of the man. As in
Giselle, where his Hilarion is the ideal match for Mukhamedov's peerless
Albrecht, these two artists respond thrillingly to each other: their duel
was ferocious, far more intense than mere stage sword-play.
Mukhamedov's Juliet was Viviana Durante, giving a clear, slightly
self-conscious reading, but one danced with lovely finesse. And, on a note
of regret, I must record that the present run of Romeo and Juliet will mark
the retirement of Leslie Edwards, the Escalus of the staging. On November 22
he will give his last performance as member of a company he joined in 1933.
His qualities - not least a blessed enthusiasm that meant no role has ever
become routine - have made him seem the very spirit of our national ballet,
for which he has also guided many choreographic talents.
His reward has been our unfailing admiration and affection.
'Romeo and Juliet' continues in repertory at Covent Garden until Nov 22

FT  01 NOV 93 / Arts: A great mansion revealed - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the greatest pleasures in life is looking at architecture with a good
guide or a learned friend. A good cicerone can be a writer, a historian or
an artist - or best of all a friend who is a mixture of all three. Sometimes
the ideal guide to a building or a place is a book that not only tells a
historical tale but nourishes the visual imagination as you read. One such
book has just been published and it has been, for the last few days, an
absorbing and enthralling companion. Spencer House: Chronicle of a Great
London Mansion by Joseph Friedman is published by Zwemmer, price Pounds
39.50.
Eighteenth-century Spencer House survived the wars and slumps that saw off
so many other aristocratic London palaces, but then, inevitably, declined
and was turned into offices. Its rescue, restoration and indeed resurrection
is the great achievement of the present Lord Rothschild and his companies
(RIT Capital Partners plc).
The realisation that this house on Green Park is immensely important was
only the first step in the tale of its redemption. The house's importance is
artistic, architectural and historical. It can be seen today as an excellent
exemplar of its period, not merely because it has been perfectly restored
but because the motives behind its rescue so clearly reflect the aesthetic
and intellectual reasons for its original creation.
Lord Rothschild was wise and generous enough to ensure that this
extraordinary effort was accomplished by a broadly based team. He saw
Spencer House as an opportunity to engage the very serious and impressive
range of talent that is available in England in the field of conservation
and historical refurbishment.
Those skills exist on two levels: first, at the level of historical research
 -often but not always accompanied by a degree of taste and aesthetic
judgment; and second, at the level of finely honed craftsmanship. Spencer
House today is a brilliant example of the skills of contemporary British
craftsmen and artists in paint, gilding, carving, sculpture and upholstery.
Last weekend there was a highly successful 'craftsman day' to show the
public how some of the fine results were achieved.
Joseph Friedman's chronicle is a rewarding account of the creation and
re-creation of the house.
He is right to emphasise the important transitional nature of the
architecture. Fascinatingly, the house was begun by one architect, John
Vardy, who died in 1765 and represented the English Palladian school of
classical architecture, and was completed by another, James Stuart
(1713-88), who was known as 'Athenian' Stuart and was the pioneer of the
Neo-Classical revival in England based on first Roman and then Greek
original sources. Friedman also points out the importance of symbolism,
allegory and metaphor in eighteenth century architecture - an area that
today needs exposition in a way that would have amazed our well-educated
eighteenth century forebears.
The story of the building of the house for the first Earl Spencer between
1756 and 1766 is colourfully told in this book - a clear picture unfolds of
the tastes and ambitions of the patron and of his Countess, the agreeable
and influential Georgiana. The selection of John Vardy as the architect was
partly because he came with the site that Spencer purchased in St James's. A
more interesting choice was that of Colonel George Gray as an adviser to the
21-year-old John Spencer. Little is know about Gray beyond the fact that he
was both a professional soldier and secretary and treasurer of the Society
of Dilettanti - a dining club for gentlemen who had accomplished the Grand
Tour. This group, when it was not engaged in serious drinking, had a
didactic purpose to rejuvenate English art and architecture by spreading
knowledge of classical archaeology.
Mr Friedman's research falls into two parts. First, he prepared an
impressive report on Spencer House before restoration started on site. This
helped to ensure a very high standard of accuracy throughout the project.
Second, the book is enriched, as the bibliography shows, by new material
including diaries and bills from various sources, which Mr Friedman
discovered while the restoration was under way.
To me the most fascinating part of the book is the section entitled 'A
Revolution in Taste', where the original classical sources are described and
illustrated with a rewarding thoroughness. Some of this may be speculative
but the publication of the illustrative sources for the Palm Room and the
Painted Room in particular seem to be exhaustive. The chapter on Athenian
Stuart's work on the first floor of Spencer House reveals both the author's
saturation in the source material and the controlled but rich nature of
Stuart's Neo-Classical style. There is nothing arid about the revival of the
classical past in this house and with Mr Friedman as your dragoman the lost
meaning of much of the decoration and the architecture comes intriguingly
back to life.
There is a great deal in this book about people and politics - indeed you
could simply read about the people and glance at the sumptuous pictures that
were specially commissioned from Mark Fiennes if the architectural detail
becomes overwhelming. But I suspect that you will agree that this is the
most enjoyable architectural book to be published for a long time - it is a
brilliant story, well told with a triumphantly happy ending.
Spencer House is available for private and corporate entertaining. It is
open on Sundays (except August and January). Booking enquiries: 071-499

FT  01 NOV 93 / Arts: Damnation of Faust - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RODERIC DUNNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Berlioz's The Damnation of Faust was premiered in Paris on a freezing
November afternoon in 1846, to a half-empty Opera-Comique. The concert was a
financial disaster. No such misfortune attended the admirable performance at
the weekend which concluded the fortnight-long Canterbury Festival.
To hear a revival of this luxuriant, semi-erotic French masterpiece in an
English cathedral seems as remarkable as it is welcome. The festival's theme
has focused on Faust this season to mark the quatercentenary of Christopher
Marlowe's death. As a climax, Berlioz's 'Dramatic Legend' could not have
been a better choice.
The widely-admired staging at the Royal Opera conducted by Sir Colin Davis
recently revived debate about the work's stage viability. Berlioz conceived
it as a series of audial tableaux, incorporating material dating back two
decades.
This was a performance to remember, in an acoustic distinctly favourable to
Berlioz's rich orchestral resonances. Much was owed to the direction of
Richard Cooke, former conductor of the LPO Chorus, well on top of the work's
large scale architecture and broad sweep: the pacing intelligent (if not
always quite thrusting enough), with attention to chorus leads, although
somewhat neglecting his soloists.
Key to the success was the splendidly disciplined Canterbury Philharmonic
Orchestra. One was constantly reminded that here was the home of the
distinctive Kent Opera. Rich-toned strings, meticulous tuning, with strong
legato and alertness to Berlioz's arching melodic lines; warm brass and
(apart from the odd passage) impeccable woodwind; plus two graceful,
sensitive solos on viola and cor anglais.
All four vocal soloists rose to the occasion. As Faust, Martyn Hill,
replacing the indisposed Neil Archer, surprised by the range of his
interpretation - a bit introverted at the start, uncertain of the odd top
note, yet growing into a difficult characterisation. As Faust's idealised
Gretchen (Margareta), Eleanor Bennett launched shakily, but warmed in the
duet and won hearts with her ensuing romance.
The cement to this performance was the singing of Mephistopheles by Brian
Bannatyne-Scott, a jovial demon whose malicious energies inspired some of
Berlioz's most witty and original vocal writing. This was a fine reading:
flexible and assured, with clear words and just the right amount of
controlled gesture. He was well supported by an attentive men's chorus,
largely abreast of the trickier passages. Upper voices were disappointing -
less honed and secure, and at worst, almost inaudible. But the freshness and
invention of Berlioz's kaleidoscopic score were amply displayed.

Victor Lewis-Smith is a card. His anarchic humour, slanderous, blasphemous,
scatological, used to pop up on the more broad-minded radio programmes, such
as Ned Sherrin's Loose Ends.
Somehow he has survived and tonight he gets his own TV series Inside Victor
Lewis-Smith (BBC2, 10.00). Invariably television tames the wildest spirits,
but Lewis-Smith has been over-dosing on outrage for so long he is probably
incurable.
The repeat of House of Cards (BBC1, 10.10) confirms how accurate Michael
Dobb's far-fetched saga of parliamentary intrigue and the overthrow of a PM
really was. Somehow the surreal goldfish bowl filming technique draws you
in. How they dared get so close to the truth in portraying the criminal
habits of some of the thinly disguised characters is breathtaking.
Anyone impressed that for the first time the Booker judges have awarded
their prize to a popular, funny, novel in Roddy Doyle's 'Paddy Clarke
Ha-Ha-Ha' but who still cannot be bothered to read the book can have it read
to them in Booker 1993 (BBC2, 12.00).

The Country Landowners' Association, mouthpiece for the landed gentry of
England and Wales, has elected a new president. Hugh Duberly, who spent his
youthful days in banking, still retains 'a liquid interest' in the City as
chairman of the Pavilion wine bar in Finsbury Circus, a popular watering
hole close to Liverpool Street station.
His work in City finance ended in 1975 when Mercantile Credit, the hire
purchase and leasing house for which he worked, was acquired by Barclays.
Duberly, now 51, returned to take over the 2,250-acre family estate at Great
Staughton in Cambridgeshire and began his climb up the CLA ladder.
As president of an organisation representing 50,000 landowners including the
Duchy of Cornwall, the Church Commissioners and a number of Oxbridge
colleges, Winchester-educated Duberly believes landlords and farmers should
be proud of their 'custodianship' of the land.
At a conference last week he quoted an earthy passage from Emile Zola's
novel La Terre to explain the lure of the countryside: 'Once the land gets
you by the short hair, the bitch won't let go.'

FT  01 NOV 93 / People: Nine month search puts Pow into Aquascutum
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Aquascutum, the upmarket clothing group famous as Baroness Thatcher's
favourite outfitter, has appointed James Pow as managing director and
charged him with both reorganising the company and repositioning the brand.
First priority is to bring the company's different divisions in Canada, the
US, Europe and the Far East together under one headquarters in London, and
centralise functions such as buying wherever possible.
That may sound ambitious, but Pow, 42, believes his experience fits him well
for the task. 'My background has been in fairly rapid reorganisations of
premium businesses,' he explains. Most recently, he was at Dunhill, where he
was managing director of Hackett, the menswear group it acquired in 1991
with a view to turning it into a global brand. Pow was responsible for
opening Hackett's flagship store at Sloane Square last year.
Before that he was international sales and marketing director at Mulberry,
the fashion designer.
His experience in promoting both those brands will equip him for what he
sees as his second important task at Aquascutum: repositioning a brand which
is losing its identity.
'We need to focus on what the consumer of the 1990s perceives the Aquascutum
brand to be,' he says. Even premium brands are not immune from change in
consumer attitudes from the high-spending culture of the 1980s towards
demanding value. 'Young people today identify with brands that deliver
quality and value for money.'
Pow plans a wide-ranging programme of market research to determine how
Aquascutum should be positioned for the 1990s. He is aware that he could
face resistance to change but says feedback to his ideas since he arrived at
the company last month has been 'very positive'.
Aquascutum will certainly be hoping it has the right man, after an executive
search which lasted some nine months. Pow succeeds James Stokes, who moved
up from deputy chairman and joint managing director to succeed Paul Bennett
when he retired as chairman in August.
Pow was educated at Broxburn Academy, West Lothian, before completing a
degree course in business studies, production and design at the Scottish
College of Textiles, Galashiels. In addition to his time at Dunhill and
Mulberry, he is a former assistant MD of Ballantyne Cashmere.

Kevin Walsh has been appointed head of North American operations at
Gartmore. Of the funds under Gartmore's management, 77 per cent are UK
pension funds, so the company has recognised its need to diversify into
other markets and has finally embarked on a project to attract North
American clients to its fold.
Walsh was previously managing director of SEI International Investment
Group, a US-based consultancy which, among other things, helps pension fund
clients pick fund managers and where he directed its product and marketing
effort. Before that, Walsh was a partner and senior account manager at
Brinson Partners, also a pension fund consultancy.
Banque Indosuez, Gartmore's parent is planning to place 25 per cent of its
shares on the London market.
In other moves, Vivian Bazalgette (above left) has been appointed md, and
Mike Bishop deputy chairman, of Gartmore Pension Fund Managers. Peter
Pearson Lund, formerly md, has been appointed chairman of Gartmore Fund
Managers; Lewis McNaught (above right), formerly deputy md, has been
promoted to md. Edwin Doeg and Charles Hoblyn have been made directors.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Management: Opportunity knocks - A two-year-old initiative
which aims to help women at work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ann Thomas is a deputy manager of one of the largest flagship stores of J.
Sainsbury, the British food retailer. But she only works on Sundays.
Five years ago, says Judith Evans, director of corporate personnel for the
group, a 10-hour working week in such a managerial job, where she is often
in sole charge of nearly 150 employees, would have been inconceivable.
The catalyst for changed thinking on how such a job could be made practical
was Opportunity 2000, the business-led initiative launched two years ago to
improve the position of women at work in the UK.
'Without Opportunity 2000 we would probably not have thought to ask Ann
Thomas if she wanted to come back to work immediately after having her third
child, and she probably would not have thought to ask us if she could,' says
Evans.
The campaign, she adds, provoked Sainsbury to question how obstacles could
be removed to assist women's progress.
Thomas may be exceptional at Sainsbury. But the personnel department and
line managers, mindful of the active interest of their chairman in the
initiative (he is a founder-member), are redoubling their efforts to promote
equality of opportunity among staff.
Opportunity 2000 - to which 216 British companies are now formally committed
 -was widely suspected of being a nine-day wonder. But the campaign's second
annual report - which is published today - may go some way to alter
perceptions by pinpointing initiatives and policies being developed in the
participating organisations. It discusses the ideas and approaches that have
worked, and those that have still to bear fruit.
Lady Howe, who chairs the campaign, says she believes there are signs of
Opportunity 2000 making a difference. But she says the campaign does not
promise overnight miracles. 'There is still a long way to go.'
Just how far was highlighted in a survey of 29,000 executives in 533
companies published last week by the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research and the London School of Economics. This showed that only 8
per cent of top executives in Britain are women and that the higher up the
corporate hierarchy you go the fewer women you find.
Paul Gregg and Stephen Machin, from the Institute, take issue with the claim
that women are increasing their share of the top executive jobs - defined as
everything between chief executive and middle management. They also found
that women are paid less than men even if they are working in the same job.
'There does appear to be a glass ceiling . . . and it does not appear to be
cracking,' they observe.
Opportunity 2000 campaigners stress that they are not just interested in
getting more women into the boardroom - although the report gives several
examples of 'firsts' such as the Bank of England appointing its first female
director. More generally, they are seeking to improve women's lot in the
workplace.
Progress here, though, is uneven. Childcare Vouchers is an organisation
which supplies companies with vouchers for eligible employees for the full
or part-time payment of their childcare costs. It claims that only a few of
the companies to sign up for Opportunity 2000 have introduced affordable and
practical ways of helping working women overcome the childcare hurdle.
The organisation has an axe to grind, but its criticism highlights the scale
of the task.
Many believe the government should provide more in the way of financial
incentives. At the moment, for example, tax relief is confined to workplace
nurseries which, for many women, is not an acceptable solution.
DayCare Trust, a national day care charity, also points out in a report
published today that fewer than four in every 100 trainees on
government-funded training schemes receive any help with childcare.
As the Opportunity 2000 report underlines, costs of implementing policies,
such as childcare, are a prime concern of employers (some of whom are
working with budgets as low as Pounds 1,000). Many companies are opting for
less expensive alternatives, such as job sharing and flexible working.
Under Opportunity 2000 there is no formal pathway to promoting equality.
Campaign companies set their own goals for increasing opportunities for
women in their workforce by 2000.
Those new to the idea need to start with basics - incorporating equal
opportunities into the business plan, for example, or investigating where
women are in the hierarchy and then seeking to diagnose the problems which
may hinder their upward mobility.
Others, however, are now in a position to measure year-on progress in areas
such as promotion, retention and returner rates. Marks and Spencer, the
retailer, is targeting areas such as its childcare and maternity
arrangements and its training programmes for investigation following its
monitoring exercises. Boots the Chemist has reported a rise in the number of
store staff returning after maternity leave.
Some companies have set clear targets - Iceland Frozen Foods aims to
increase the percentage of female retail managers from currently below 10
per cent now to 15 per cent in two years' time. Others, including Avon
Cosmetics, are investigating whether there are gender differences in pay and
conditions.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is 'profiling' jobs and individuals to ensure
that subjectivity is taken out of recruitment and selection decisions. HTV,
the television company, carried out a job evaluation in co-operation with
its five unions.
Many companies recognise the need to boost confidence among women. Fox's, a
biscuit-making subsidiary of Northern Foods, found that women were
particularly reticent about coming forward for management positions mainly
held by men.
As a result Fox's has run self-development programmes aimed at shop floor
and junior clerical roles.
'There will be no revolution overnight but we are making progress,' says
Philip Ward, group personnel executive at Northern Foods. In March 1991 only
3.7 per cent of employees at Northern Foods earning more than Pounds 30,000
a year were women. This has now gone up to 8.3 per cent.
'It would have happened without the campaign but Opportunity 2000 is another
important weapon in our armoury as we seek to talk both internally and
externally about these issues,' explains Ward.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Management: Make it dramatic for the shareholders - Henry
Wendt, chairman of SmithKline Beecham, offers advice on how to conduct an
annual meeting / Tips from the top
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HENRY WENDT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The statutory annual general meeting is something of a modern paradox. In
the case of large companies, institutional shareholders holding the majority
of shares seldom attend. Most chairmen are happy to see owners of 2 or 3 per
cent of their shares show up. Since most ballots are cast by post, it is
only in unusual cases that the vote is uncertain. Consequently, there is
rarely true drama or a big decision at the AGM. It shouldn't be any wonder
that many chairmen regard the occasion as a meaningless task to be dispensed
with quickly.
Yet in doing so they miss an opportunity to generate considerable goodwill
and understanding of the company. It is the one occasion during the year
when the board and the management are on full parade and available to all
shareholders for answers to direct and at times penetrating questions. The
attendees are mostly small shareholders who have a strong sense of identity
with the company and are predisposed to be friends. Their attitude is in
many ways governed by what they learn and even more to the point, how they
feel at the AGM.
With that purpose in mind, I believe it helps to think of the AGM as
theatre. Theatre is a form of communication in which complex and provocative
messages are put across to large audiences. Indeed, theatre works best when
there is genuine interaction between the cast and the audience.
Designing the AGM as theatre begins with deciding the messages to be
communicated. Usually, there is a mix of good and bad news. Naturally, the
weight of the mix determines the tone and character of the AGM; celebratory
or firmly resolute.
The next decision relates to the cast of characters. In most situations, the
chairman should resist the temptation to place himself in the starring role.
The AGM is an opportunity to display the strengths of the management and the
board. Opportunities to bring other executives centre stage will certainly
occur during the question-and-answer session, but openings should also be
sought during the formal presentations. The role of the chairman is always
to maintain firm control and leadership of the meeting, while also bringing
forth the personality, character and talents of other cast members. The
audience should leave impressed with the way the management and the board
complement each other and work as a team.
It is useful to consider the stage setting. Most annual meetings tend to be
rather dry affairs. They do not have to be that way. Both colour and sound
can be introduced at little expense, in ways that enhance the primary
messages. Music played at a low background level as the attendees take their
seats helps establish the mood. I often find visual aids to be more of a
distraction than a help, but used to display data they can also introduce
animation and colour. For emotional impact, nothing matches video on a large
screen.
A successful AGM requires an active and energetic question-and-answer
session. Since it is this part of the programme that many chairmen regard
with the most anxiety, it is central to the AGM paradox. Yet it is the
question-and-answer session that creates the lasting impression. A positive
impression is created as much by the way the company responds to the
question as it is by the answers themselves. I will always remember the
occasion when during a particularly long and tense question period a feisty
shareholder suggested that the personnel director get a haircut. The
question - and the somewhat embarrassed response - brought the house down
and changed the entire mood within the room.
The burden is always squarely on the chairman to conduct the question
session in an open, understanding manner. By using his prerogative to
restate and as appropriate, to reframe the question without distorting the
questioner's basic thrust, the chairman can establish the correct tone and
posture for the session.
The question-and-answer session of the AGM provides a unique opportunity to
create positive human chemistry with the company's natural ambassadors.
Next Monday: Sir Colin Marshall of British Airways on how to cope with a
busy business trip.

</HEADLINE>

Results due
SEVERAL of the UK's largest retailers will be reporting interim results this
week.
The UK's two most profitable retailers, Marks and Spencer and J Sainsbury,
report on Wednesday, and both are expected to show a healthy increase in
pre-tax profits. M and S is forecast to lift pre-tax profits from Pounds
257.1m last year to between Pounds 285m and Pounds 295m. But its shares have
already risen substantially in expectation of good figures and analysts say
any hint of weakness, especially on the food side, could be seized on by the
City as an excuse to sell.
Sainsbury is expected to see interim pre-tax profits increase from Pounds
391.1m to Pounds 435m. But analysts are more interested in what the company
might say about the changing face of the UK food market in the midst of
rumours that Sainsbury is about to launch a price war, and after the
admission by Tesco in September that it was investing some gross margin in
lower prices.
On Thursday it is the turn of Boots, which is likely to report increased
interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 185m last time to about Pounds 210m this
time, after exceptional items relating to the sale of French subsidiary
Sephora and the withdrawal of the Manoplax heart drug by Boots
Pharmaceuticals.
Discussion is again expected to centre on the performance of the Do It All
DIY chain and the future of the pharmaceuticals division, but analysts are
not expecting any significant news.
BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services group, is expected on
Wednesday to report an increase of about 25 per cent in pre-tax profits for
the first nine months of the year. Forecasts range from Pounds 1.31bn to
Pounds 1.38bn. Tobacco earnings will again feel the effects of the US
cigarette price war but the group should benefit from more favourable
exchange rates. Analysts expect further progress from Eagle Star, the
general insurance subsidiary, despite continuing losses on mortgage
insurance. Growth may be slower at Farmers Group, the US subsidiary.
British Petroleum, reporting third quarter results on Thursday, has enjoyed
a marked upgrading of its fortunes in recent weeks. Although oil prices have
fallen some Dollars 2 a barrel since the second quarter, UK petroleum
revenue tax has been cut to 50 per cent from 75 per cent and downstream
operations have turned in stronger performances. Profits of at least Pounds
175m (Pounds 117m) are expected net of stock gains of around Pounds 100m.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Economics: UK inflation again under scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin is produced tomorrow. Its inflation
report will be of particular interest following signs from official data
that price rises are gradually gathering pace.
But the Bank, which has taken a fairly relaxed view of inflationary
pressures in the economy over the past few months, is unlikely to alter
radically its stance in tomorrow's report.
Figures for narrow money come out on the same day. Economists believe the
year-on-year rate will rise again, to stay well above the government's 0-4
per cent monitoring range and lending weight to evidence that consumers are
the driving force behind the recovery.
This is a heavy week for German statistics with industrial production and
employment figures due towards the end of the week. Provisional figures for
industrial production in August showed a larger than expected rise of 2.1
per cent on the month, following July's 0.8 per cent fall. Many economists
expect to see a downwards revision to the August figure, and the median
forecast for September is a drop of 0.5 per cent on the month.
In the US, the focus will be on non-farm payrolls at the end of the week.
They should have increased by 160,000 according to the median forecast,
following September's 156,000 rise. In the third quarter, the average rise
was 117,000 per month, but all the gains occurred in the service sector.
Higher paying manufacturing jobs were lost at a rate of 26,000 per month and
are expected to suffer further.
The following are the rest of the week's economic highlights and events. The
figures in brackets are the median of economists' forecasts from MMS
International, the financial information company.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Peace initiative on Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE initiative launched by Mr Major and Mr Reynolds, Dublin has accepted
that an overall settlement would involve an end to its territorial claim on
the north and recognition of the unionist veto on change in the province,
Tim Coone writes.
The UK accepted an increase in cross-border co-operation and the possibility
of Sinn Fein entering talks if the IRA laid down its arms.
The six-point plan set out last week by Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign
minister, paved the way for the initiative. The six points were:
People in Ireland, north and south, without coercion and without violence,
should be free to determine their own future.
New structures should be developed for governing the province, for
north-south relationships and for UK-Irish relations.
No agreement can be reached on any change in the status of Northern Ireland
without the freely expressed consent of the majority of the people of
Northern Ireland.
Unionist consent will be required for any constitutional change in the
north.
The Irish constitution will be amended 'at the right time and in the right
circumstances' to reflect any agreed changes.
There will be a place at the negotiating table for the 'men of violence' if
they cease their violence.
The SDLP and Sinn Fein are concerned by Mr Spring's apparent acceptance of a
unionist veto - as opposed to a majority veto - over constitutional change
in Northern Ireland. On Irish radio yesterday, Mr Reynolds referred only to
majority consent.
The statement from the UK and the republic was unequivocal that there could
be 'no question of adopting or endorsing' the Hume-Adams initiative, which
envisages a simultaneous referendum north and south of the border on any
future changes to Northern Ireland's status, but recognises the principle of
majority consent in the north.
The last series of talks between the four main Ulster constitutional parties
broke up last November without agreement.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Leaders ready to pay political price of peace / A look at at
the realities prime ministers Major and Reynolds are prepared to accept
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEETING on Friday between Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds showed
that the London and Dublin governments are more determined than for many
years to achieve a political settlement for Northern Ireland. The most
recent in the latest spate of terrorist outrages just 24 hours later
underlines the depths of the morass from which they are seeking to lift the
province.
Both sides are aware that as long as the political vacuum remains then the
spiral of violence will continue, and quite possibly escalate. But after
more than 20 bloody years neither can be confident that the political
initiative on which they have embarked can avoid the roadblocks which have
halted so many of its precursors.
The lengthy communique released after the talks in Brussels renounced
terrorism, declared that there could be no place at the negotiating table
for those who used violence to further political aims, and underlined the
central role of the Ulster constitutional parties in any settlement.
This might seem to represent no more than a statement of the obvious, but
the very fact of its release sent an important message: that Mr Major and Mr
Reynolds were ready to expend political capital in a resumed effort at
permanent peace, and that in the process both were prepared to own up to
some obvious realities.
From Dublin the message was that it was now ready to remove what Mr Major
saw as two of the most foremost obstacles to peace. As part of an overall
settlement, Mr Reynolds would be ready to ask the voters of the republic to
remove from the Irish constitution its claim to jurisdiction over the north,
and the republic would recognise explicitly the veto over change in the
province exercised by supporters of the union.
For its part London would now state publicly what had always been obvious
but never admitted so explicitly by a British government: that if the IRA
ceased its military campaign a place would be found at the negotiating table
for Sinn Fein.
Behind the scenes Mr Major has also acknowledged that the quid pro quo for
changes in the republic's constitution would be a significant increase in
administrative co-operation between north and south.
Over the next few weeks the two governments will seek to build on that
agreement, starting at the meeting on Wednesday between Mr Dick Spring, the
Irish foreign minister, and Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland
secretary. Mr Major and Mr Reynolds will seek to strengthen it further at a
UK-Irish summit in Dublin within six weeks.
The aim is to create an atmosphere which will persuade the constitutional
parties - above all the unionists - to return to the negotiating table to
thrash out an internal political settlement.
Reassurance for the unionists ran right through the Major-Reynolds
statement: in the promise that there would be no secret deals; in the joint
disavowal of the initiative launched by Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, with
Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein; and in Dublin's implicit acknowledgement of the
unionist 'veto'.
In practice, the two governments are reversing the order of negotiations in
the three-strand peace process which stalled at the end of last year. Then
the priority was an agreement between the Northern Ireland parties before
moving on to the second and third strands - relations between north and
south in Ireland and an agreement between the republic and Britain on
Ulster's constitutional status. Now the aim is to secure a broad measure of
agreement on strands one and two as an umbrella for negotiations on strand
one.
But if the logic of a London-Dublin accord providing a catalyst for the
restart of talks between the parties in the province is obvious enough, its
chances of success are precarious.
The unionists, whose self-importance is bolstered by Mr Major's reliance on
their votes at Westminster, must be persuaded that the talks offer something
better than the status quo. Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster
Unionist party, is now the most important player in the game. Without a
positive response from him, the latest initiative will go nowhere.
Mr Hume, badly bruised by the rejection of his initiative, must also be
brought back within the inter-governmental process. He remains as convinced
as ever that a cessation of violence by the IRA is within reach if Mr Major
is prepared to listen carefully to the ideas to which Sinn Fein has put its
name. He has staked too much on his talks with Mr Adams to withdraw quietly
now.
Yet British officials were suggesting yesterday that the picture beneath the
surface was not as bleak as the familiarly unpromising rhetoric of Ulster
politicians may suggest.
Mr Molyneaux has remained silent. If he offered to return to the negotiating
table, both Mr Hume and the Rev Ian Paisley, the leader of the hardline
Democratic Unionist party, would find it hard not to join him. The good
intentions might this time offer at least a start on the road to an
agreement.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Steelworkers' scheme to end
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Iron and Steel Employees Readaptation Benefits Scheme, which has helped
about 118,000 former steelworkers with income support and benefits for
retraining, is to end, the government has announced.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, said in a Commons written answer that
the scheme had not been very effective in assisting redundant steelworkers
re-enter the labour market and had not proved good value for money.
The scheme was established in 1974 after the first oil price shock and
anticipated big plant closures in the late 1970s. Mr Sainsbury said further
large-scale restructuring was not expected in the industry.
A consultation paper is being issued, with comments invited by December 10.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Attack on teacher training plans
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS to base initial teacher training in schools rather than colleges
poses a threat to quality and could lead to political control over teacher
education, the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals said yesterday.
There was 'no logical argument' to support a fundamental shift towards
school-centred teacher training, Mr Kenneth Edwards, committee chairman,
said in a detailed response to the government.
A Teacher Training Agency, proposed as a funding council for teacher
education, would be 'another costly, politically appointed body' and a
'sinister precedent' for the future possible fragmentation of higher
education.
The proposed separation of education research from other university research
would also set a dangerous precedent.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Accuracy of trade figures queried
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEASURES to improve the European Community's new system of collecting trade
statistics are to be discussed next week by government officials from the
UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands, Peter Marsh writes.
Pressure for the meeting has come particularly from the UK, which is
concerned that the method of collecting data introduced at the beginning of
this year may be giving an inaccurate view of economic trends.
Even though data gathered so far this year about UK exports and imports
indicate Britain's trade gap may be worsening as the recovery picks up,
British officials are unsure about to what degree they can rely on the
statistics.
They are particularly worried that the problems may also be affecting the
collection of non-EC trade data and so distorting perceptions about the
whole-world trade deficit.
Last year the UK had a deficit on visible trade with the rest of the world
of Pounds 14bn, and the Treasury in its last published forecast in March
said this would rise to Pounds 21bn this year.
Officials from the UK's Central Statistical Office and the statistical
agencies of the other three nations will be discussing their experiences
with the new system and ways to improve it.
The new system, Intrastat, was introduced after the ending of trade barriers
between European Community countries meant Customs officials no longer
collected the data needed in compiling trade statistics.
A specific worry about the system - which is organised by Eurostat, the EC's
statistical agency - is that the companies sending in information about
their own imports and exports may be confusing goods bought and sold within
the EC with products traded outside it.

THE BRITISH and Irish governments yesterday stressed their determination not
to allow the Northern Ireland peace process to be derailed by Saturday's
mass shooting in County Londonderry.
Downing Street said Mr John Major, the prime minister, who has been kept
closely informed about the shootings, would not be diverted by the gunmen.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said terrorists had to be
prevented from dictating the political agenda in the province. He added:
'Last night's slaughter of the innocents puts more pressure on us to
accelerate our efforts to find a formula for the cessation of violence and
get the constitutional parties back around a negotiating table.
'One of our major problems is the lack of a political process and dialogue.
Consequently the men of violence are allowed to take centre stage, and that
has to be addressed immediately.'
The London-Dublin initiative was condemned by Mr Peter Robinson, deputy
leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, who said it was part of
the 'nationalist agenda'.
He said the initiative had 'raised the temperature' in the province. 'We are
only half a step away from Northern Ireland being out of control. If the
violence continues like this the ordinary man is going to take sides for
protection.'
However, there was widespread support for the governments' determination to
press ahead. Mr Kevin McNamara, Britain's shadow Northern Ireland secretary,
said the killings were 'absolutely horrendous'. It was 'urgent that full
attention should be paid to the Major-Reynolds initiative to find a solution
which will respect the integrity of both communities and to establish
institutions which can be useful both to the people of Northern Ireland and
to the people of Ireland'.
Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the nationalist SDLP, said the shootings
were 'another bloody milestone in the move towards peaceful resolution of
the problems here'.
Dr Robin Eames, the Anglican primate of all Ireland, said he did not believe
that the joint statement by Mr Reynolds and Mr Major had prompted the
killings. 'Obviously people's minds will centre on the reaction to the
recent inter-governmental announcement, but my experience is that these
terrorists, whoever they are, don't have to look for a reason,' he said.
'This is psychopathic blood-letting and their so-called banner of 'For God
and Ulster' on the one side and 'For a united Ireland' on the other are now
irrelevant to most people.'
Mr Martin McGuinness, vice-president of Sinn Fein, said the murders were a
brutal reminder of the conflict in Northern Ireland. He urged the
nationalist community to remain calm and vigilant.
Mr Philip McGarry, chairman of the Alliance party, said the shootings were
'a disgraceful landmark'. He called on people to support the security
forces.

TRAFALGAR Square in London yesterday witnessed a Northern Ireland peace
demonstration claimed by its organisers to be the first such event
sanctioned in the square by the Home Office for 25 years.
Mr Liam Cleere, organiser, said: 'If Israel and the Palestinians can settle
their differences; if South Africa can do it; if the Berlin Wall can come
down - then Northern Ireland can be sorted out as well.'
Mr Cleere, an Irish bricklayer living in Kilburn, north London, set up the
Rally for Peace Movement after the Warrington bomb blast which killed two
children in March. He claimed yesterday that the non-political,
non-sectarian movement had 5,000 members, almost all of them Irish people
living in Britain appalled by the violence in Ulster.
Yesterday's protest over the latest week of violence was no mass rally - the
Home Office gave permission only for Mr Cleere and five colleagues to hold
banners in the square.
The pro-Republican Irish Freedom Movement staged a demonstration a few yards
from the peace protesters demanding 'Irish freedom'. Troops Out
demonstrators used similar tactics to disrupt the movement's first rally for
peace, attended by 2,000, in Hyde Park about a month after the Warrington
bombing.
Yesterday Mr Cleere called for Catholic and Protestant paramilitaries to be
'man enough' to lay down their weapons and give the latest formal and
informal peace initiatives a chance to work.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Loyalists plot the demise of consensus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE loyalist paramilitary Ulster Defence Association announced seven months
ago that it was planning to intensify its murder campaign against Catholics
in Northern Ireland.
The UDA, banned in August last year, is a thinly disguised front for the
Ulster Freedom Fighters, which carried out the weekend atrocity in the
Rising Sun pub, Greysteel, County Londonderry.
In an interview with a Dublin newspaper earlier this year, one of the UDA's
six-man commanding council said: 'It's entirely a joke to say that someone
who is killed in the heart of a republican area is innocent.'
The UDA's aim, he said, was to defeat the 'pan-nationalist front' - a term
used by unionists for what they perceive as an emerging alliance between the
IRA, its political wing Sinn Fein, the Social Democratic and Labour Party
led by Mr John Hume, and the Dublin government - all aimed at the eventual
achievement of a united Ireland.
The UDA's main strength lies in Protestant working-class areas of Belfast
such as the Shankill and Newtownards Roads. The IRA's Shankill bomb a week
ago was aimed at the UDA headquarters.
The significance of the latest UFF atrocity is that it took place in
Londonderry, the political heartland of Mr Hume's SDLP, which over the past
decade has managed to avoid much of the political violence that has plagued
Belfast.
Mr Hume's lobbying in Brussels and the US has attracted large sums of EC
funds and US inward investment to the Londonderry area, to the benefit of
Protestants and Catholics alike, and to the point where business confidence
is buoyant.
The SDLP controls the Derry council, but has pioneered 'power-sharing',
giving a significant role to minority unionist parties, including the
hardline Democratic Unionists.
It is ominous that the UFF gunmen who carried out the slaughter in the
Rising Sun appeared to care little that both communities mixed there, and
that the victims were from both religions.
It was not the 'heart' of a republican area. Indeed, the attack appears to
be a deliberate attempt to drive a wedge between the two communities and to
break down the consensus politics pioneered by Mr Hume.
The effect will be to spread sectarian violence more widely through the
province, and to make the need for political initiatives all the more urgent
if the situation is to be kept from spiralling out of control.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Hume demands government response
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN HUME, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, said
yesterday that the UK government had a 'responsibility' to explore his joint
peace initiative with Mr Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the political
wing of the IRA.
He was on the counter-attack after the apparent rebuff to the initiative by
the British and Irish governments. 'I expect to be listened to,' he said.
'The proposals that I have put to the government are proposals that can lead
to a dialogue with all parties, including Sinn Fein, in a situation in which
there is no violence,' he said on London Weekend Television's Walden
programme.
He insisted that the joint Brussels statement by the two governments on
Friday was 'only an appeal to end the violence. I am taking direct action to
try and end it.'
Accused by the harshest of his unionist opponents of being a fellow
traveller of the IRA, Mr Hume is nonetheless a lifelong opponent of violence
and has himself been the target of nine IRA attacks over the past 20 years.
Inspired by figures such as Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, he began
his political career in the civil rights movement in Londonderry in the late
1960s. Unionist-inspired violence removed that movement from the streets,
and was then met by growing IRA violence. Mr Hume remained throughout a
constant advocate of constitutional and peaceful means to bring about
change.
A founding member of the SDLP in the early 1970s, he holds a conviction that
nationalism, whether Catholic or Protestant-orientated, will gradually
dissipate in the European union slowly being forged in Brussels.
Not one to be baulked by criticism of his ideas or his tactics, he recently
said: 'I am criticised for my approaches, but nobody else is putting any new
proposals on the table. I want to see an agreed Ireland, not a united
Ireland. I want a new Ireland in a new Europe.
'I am more confident now about the future than I have been for the past 20
years. In 10 to 20 years more there will be a whole new ball game.'
On the apparent rebuff of his initiative with Mr Adams, he argued that
several of the principles in the initiative had been incorporated into the
Dublin government's six-point proposals, and into the communique issued by
the two governments on Friday.
He said yesterday: 'I am awaiting clarification of their response, but part
of the process that has been proposed has already been proposed in (the
Hume-Adams) initiative.
'I believe there is a way of bringing that about now which does not threaten
the interests of any section of our people, that does not impose any
solutions and which does not give victory to any section of our people'.
The savage UFF attack in Londonderry on Saturday night, the first of its
kind there for many years and a clear intimidatory warning to Mr Hume,
underlines the extent to which unionist extremists oppose even the most
moderate nationalist viewpoint.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Government forced to extend rail franchises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government has bowed to pressure to extend the duration of franchises
for parts of the British Rail network, it emerged yesterday.
Bidders could be awarded franchises that last as long as 15 years, more than
twice the length of time previously expected, Mr John MacGregor, transport
secretary said.
The short anticipated duration of the franchises, which had previously been
expected to run for only five to seven years, has acted as a disincentive to
potential private bidders.
If a bidder is willing to put in sufficient capital investment, the
government would be prepared to to consider awarding franchises of '10 years
and beyond' and possibly up to 15 years, Mr MacGregor said on BBC
Television's On the Record.
Mr MacGregor said franchisees would not need large amounts of working
capital because they would have the revenues from their operations and, if
these were loss-making, a government subsidy.
The minister left open the possibility of further increases in the
government's subsidy to the railways. But he denied that it would rise to
Pounds 2bn in 1994-95 from Pounds 850m this year, as suggested by an
internal government report obtained by the BBC. He said that the figure of
Pounds 2bn was 'not necessarily true' and would certainly not apply to
1994-95, when the government expected the Gatwick Express to be the only
franchise operating under private ownership.
Mr John Prescott, the former shadow transport secretary who was switched to
the employment portfolio last month, said bigger subsidies would be needed
if BR's operations were to achieve the 8 per cent rate of return required by
the government. He said it was cynical of the government to cut subsidies
when BR was in public ownership but increase them to help it go private.
Asked about suggestions that the need to reduce government spending would
lead to delays in starting work on two projects - the high-speed rail link
to the Channel tunnel, and London Crossrail which will link Paddington and
Liverpool Street stations - Mr MacGregor said neither scheme was as far
advanced as the Jubilee Line extension to London's East End, which was given
the go-ahead on Friday.
'We can't tell what the final deadline date will be because there are so
many processes to go through,' he said.
Union Railways, the BR subsidiary charged with launching the high-speed link
from London to the the Channel tunnel at Folkestone, presented the results
of a six-month public consultation on the route to the government on Friday.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Consumers 'ignored' in energy policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENERGY policies have been politically inspired and dominated by producer
interests and short-termism, the Institute of Economic Affairs says in a
study today.
Professor Colin Robinson, professor of economics at the University of
Surrey, says in the study published by the free-market think tank that the
coal and nuclear industries in particular managed to win special treatment
from the state.
'The consumer voice, however, was not heard - or if heard was not heeded,'
says Prof Robinson.
His study also criticises the privatisation of gas and electricity as being
motivated by a desire to raise revenue rather than to introduce competition
into those industries. As a result, the privatised corporations retain huge
amounts of power.
Fuel bills at 12 government departments rose 4 per cent during the year in
spite of official encouragement for energy conservation.
The Cabinet Office's fuel bills rose 10 per cent, according to statistics
compiled by the Association for the Conservation of Energy from published
government sources.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Court action against fishing curb starts today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FISHERMEN today go to the High Court to try to overturn legislation that
will restrict from January the number of days they can spend at sea.
The National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, which represents 6,000
fishermen from all over the UK except Scotland, is applying for judicial
review of the restrictions, which they say could destroy their livelihoods.
The government is introducing the limits as part of its obligation under EC
fisheries policy to reduce the capacity of the UK fleet by 19 per cent by
the end of 1996 in order to halt overfishing. It is also running a Pounds
25m decommissioning programme and tightening up on licensing of vessels.
The limits on days at sea, which apply to trawlers over 10 metres long, will
initially restrict vessels to the number of days they spent at sea in 1991
and may later reduce the number further.
The measures, which have triggered blockades of ports around the country,
were condemned as 'unnecessarily draconian' by the Commons agriculture
committee in August.
Mr David Vaughan QC will argue for the federation in the High Court that the
restrictions breach EC law by placing a disproportionate burden of the cuts
on the fishermen's own incomes.
The fishermen say the government has not made an appropriate contribution to
controlling the fishing effort because it failed to decommission vessels
under the previous EC cuts programme between 1986 and 1991. Instead, the UK
fleet was allowed to expand.
The federation is also objecting to the blanket prohibition on all
fishermen, regardless of whether they catch species that are over-exploited,
such as cod or haddock, or species that are still plentiful.
It argues that the legislation is unfair because only one other EC state,
the Netherlands, operates such restrictions, and these apply only to
trawlers fishing for particular species such as plaice and sole.
The High Court hearing is expected to last several days, although the case
may be referred to the European Court. If that happens, the federation will
ask for the rules to be suspended until the European Court hearing, which
could involve a wait of a couple of years.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Ministers consider ending health pay review bodies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS have begun to question whether the National Health Service's pay
review bodies have a long-term future, arguing that hospital trusts should
increasingly make direct pay settlements with doctors, consultants and other
medical staff.
For nearly 30 years, pay review bodies and the Whitley Councils have advised
the government on pay and conditions for doctors and other health service
professionals.
But as hospitals and other NHS organisations gain financial independence
under the recent reforms, ministers are privately suggesting that the pay
review bodies have no long-term future.
Government officials have been careful not to press publicly for the
withering away of the pay bodies. The British Medical Association has said
that these institutions play a key role and would view any move to abolish
them 'with grave disquiet'. But, according to a health department official,
trusts need to look to the future, and change the manner in which they make
pay settlements. 'They need to use their freedom to decide on terms and
conditions for consultants,' he said.
Treasury officials have also raised doubts about the future use of national
pay norms for the health service. 'Trusts are being given the right to
operate in their own way,' said a Treasury official. 'With further
developments in the NHS of that kind, there is a possibility that the role
of the review bodies will change.' The government's imposition of a pay
freeze for the whole of the public sector in the next financial year has
already dealt a blow to the role of the pay review bodies. This year a pay
rise of 1.5 per cent is being imposed.
Moreover, hospitals are already setting their own terms for direct pay deals
with some staff. Last month, an internal government review issued to health
authorities said that nearly a fifth of NHS trusts have introduced some form
of local pay for small groups of workers such as cleaners and healthcare
assistants.
Opposing the move, the BMA said that pay review bodies are vital in the
health service where there are bigger constraints on industrial action than
on other areas of the public sector. It also opposes the move on the grounds
of expense. 'If you were to have pay negotiations in every trust, it would
be extremely time-consuming and expensive,' it said.
But, according to a recent report published by the Social Market Foundation,
an independent pressure group, the health service reforms should squeeze out
any room for statutory pay reviews.
'With trusts having the authority to set terms, it is difficult to
understand exactly what functions Whitley and the pay review bodies
perform,' said Mr Ron Beadle, a lecturer in Human Resource Management at
Newcastle upon Tyne University. 'So long as they persist, they provide a
defence for inertia.'

FT  01 NOV 93 / Top 1,000 groups 'have cut 1.5m jobs'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S 1,000 largest companies shed about 1.5m workers in the year to
March 1993 as costs were cut to cope with the recession, says a survey
conducted for Director magazine.
The survey, which also shows that average pre-tax profits fell over the same
period by nearly 8 per cent while sales rose by a little more than 4 per
cent, suggests that the total workforce employed by the top 1,000 companies
dropped from 8.6m people to just over 7m.
In the four previous years, staff numbers had remained reasonably steady,
dropping by only 300,000 from their peak in 1989.
The cuts in staffing were deepest - averaging nearly 8 per cent - within the
remnants of the state-owned sector, most notably in British Coal. The
average reduction in the private sector was less than 2 per cent while
foreign-owned businesses, on average, trimmed their UK numbers by 5 per
cent. The days of the giant centralised corporation are over, according to a
senior director in one of Britain's biggest companies, writes Richard
Donkin.
Mr Mike Bett, deputy chairman of British Telecommunications and incoming
president of the Institute of Personnel Management, says in the latest issue
of Personnel Management magazine that new technology will lead to more
companies decentralising their operations.
'For many years the average size of companies has been declining. The
current drive towards keeping to the core business will reduce the average
size of companies even further.'
The result, he says, will be more companies supplying services traditionally
carried out in-house.
He adds that this will have repercussions such as less commuting and greater
difficulty for unions in organising.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Small business finance is 'shaky'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL-COMPANY finances are built on 'shaky foundations', says a report
issued today which presents a worrying picture of the state of the
small-business sector, Emma Tucker writes.
The report, by the 3i/ Cranfield European Enterprise Centre, says that small
companies suffer from serious structural weaknesses which carry policy
implications for the government and banks.
By comparing the financial structure of small and large companies, the
report concludes that small companies have weak liquidity and a considerably
lower ratio of fixed assets, which makes it difficult for them to raise
finance from banks. Lower and more volatile profitability add to these
difficulties.
Small companies are too dependent on short-term finance, with 'cheap but
very risky' trade credit as their main source which contributes to poor
liquidity, it says.
This lack of security is reflected in high interest rates for small
companies. The authors urge the government to consider a direct subsidy to
the banks to compensate for risk.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Fear of redundancy rises steeply despite fall in jobless
total
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MORE THAN half of British workers fear that they could lose their jobs in
the next 12 months despite falling levels of unemployment, the latest MORI
monthly survey for the Financial Times has found.
Fear of redundancy and unemployment rose sharply over the past few weeks to
53 per cent of those in full-time or part-time work after falling to 43 per
cent in September, the survey indicates.
Anxiety about prospects has grown most among women, part-time workers and
the young.
Mr David Martin, editorial director of Industrial Relations Services, the
independent pay and conditions group that commissioned the series of monthly
surveys, said: 'Confidence is key to the strength of any economic recovery.
'Fear of job loss has grown dramatically, and those interviewed do not
believe that unemployment has peaked and that confidence in the pace of
recovery remains fragile.'
According to the series of surveys, which started in April, fear over the
possibility of redundancy had a first peak in July when 51 per cent of those
in work said they were either 'very concerned' or 'fairly concerned'.
In August 47 per cent were of the same opinion and in September the figure
was 43 per cent. This decline was in spite of the possibility of job losses
in the public sector because of an announcement by the government that any
pay increases must be funded by increased productivity.
October's level of anxiety among part-time workers contrasts with six months
ago. In April only a third of part-time workers expressed concern over
redundancy, but last month the figure was 45 per cent.
Mr Bob Worcester, MORI chairman, said people 'read that businessmen are more
bullish but then they look around among their friends and nothing has
changed. In addition, the government has talked on so many occasions about
green shoots that they have become cynical.'
MORI interviewed 930 adults aged 18 and over who work full-time or
part-time. Interviews were conducted face-to-face in the period October
21-25.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Funds seek to fend off tax squeeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the UK's largest pension-fund managers has written to its clients
urging them to lobby the government against any plans to tax dividend income
earned by pension schemes.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment Management, with Pounds 18bn in UK pension
fund assets under management and about 250 UK corporate pension-fund
clients, is urging its clients and the largest companies it invests in to
press the government not to tax pension schemes further.
'A chancellor short of revenue could be tempted to tax pension funds a
second time,' Mr Alan Rubenstein, director of BZW Investment Management said
in a letter sent late last week.
In the March Budget, Mr Norman Lamont, then chancellor, reduced to 20 per
cent from 25 per cent the amount of advance corporation tax paid on
dividends which pension schemes could reclaim from the Treasury.
The effect of the tax change has cut income for pension schemes by about
Pounds 600m a year, equivalent to a reduction of 6.25 per cent in the income
earned on UK corporate equities. The change has forced several companies,
including British Telecommunications, to make substantial increases to their
pension schemes or to end contributions holidays.
The change took the pensions industry and employers by surprise. The
National Association of Pension Funds, the trade association, has since been
seeking assurances that there will be no further taxes on pension schemes.
BZW Investment Management and several accountancy firms, including Price
Waterhouse, believe that Mr Clarke may abolish the tax refund which pension
schemes earn on ordinary UK share dividends.
Mr Rubenstein said he believed the chancellor would propose a two-stage
abolition, reducing the tax credit next year to 10 per cent from the present
20 per cent, following with a complete abolition the next year.
Mr Rubenstein said a cut to 10 per cent would deprive pension schemes of
Pounds 1.5bn in income, equal to a reduction in their dividend income on UK
shares of 12 per cent.
If investors decided to value share prices in line with the present dividend
yield on shares, it would wipe roughly 300 points off the FT-SE 100 stock
index, he added.
In his letter Mr Rubenstein points out: 'Many companies, perhaps yours
included, would then have to question their support for final salary pension
schemes and the open-ended commitment this entails.'

FT  01 NOV 93 / Clarke dismisses need for further interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE, the chancellor, said yesterday that he was not persuaded
of the need for another cut in interest rates.
He said in a television interview that he agreed with Mr Eddie George,
governor of the Bank of England, that current economic conditions 'have not
justified reducing interest rates any further'.
He said, however, that even though the UK was in a better position than any
other continental European country, its economic recovery was 'not strong
enough yet'. Bolstering the recovery had to be the government's aim for next
year.
Mr Clarke told the BBC's Breakfast with Frost programme: 'It surprised
everybody when we began to have recovery in the spring and summer of this
year. People say it has gone off a little bit. I do not think so.'
But he added that he did not try to talk up the recovery or sound as if all
economic problems were over 'because far too many people earning a living in
business still tell me it is very tough out there, and patchy'.
Mr Clarke said he would like to reduce the amount the government spends as a
proportion of gross domestic product to less than 40 per cent. The
proportion is now more than 45 per cent.
Mr Clarke said that - although he wanted a society with the entrepreneurial
verve of the US - he did not wish to see 'a society where we abandon the
European tradition of welfare, which is strongest in Britain'.
An article from the Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin, released ahead of
publication tomorrow, points out that low inflation rates have contributed
to the highest public sector deficit - adjusted for the effect of inflation
on outstanding debt - since the end of the second world war.
The article says that, in previous times of markedly high government
borrowing, the increase in net debt relative to nominal output was less
because high rates of inflation eroded its value.
Last year the net debt of the public sector and market holdings of the
national debt registered their sharpest rises for more than 20 years. In
relation to GDP, these measures increased by 5 and 6.2 percentage points
respectively to 32.9 per cent and 36 per cent.
Mr Clarke said in his BBC interview that the decision not to announce
compensation for the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel at the
time of the last Budget - a move he agreed with - had allowed the
government's opponents to make mayhem.
'If we had given the compensation package then, nobody would be talking
about it in November 1993,' he said.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Consumer industries lead output growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURING OUTPUT expanded faster in October than in the previous month,
and there was particularly buoyant growth in consumer industries.
The Purchasing Managers' Index, an early indicator of manufacturing output
trends based on a survey of purchasing managers, indicated an expansion of
manufacturing activity for the ninth consecutive month. The index - based on
a weighted average of five survey variables - rose from 51.7 per cent in
September to 53.6 per cent last month. The increase contradicted the latest
survey evidence from the Confederation of British Industry, which pointed to
a flattening of output and new orders.
The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, which carries out the
survey, said there was a substantial expansion of production and new orders,
with consumer industries showing the greatest growth in new orders. The
output index rose from 54.3 per cent in September to 57.9 per cent last
month. For new orders, the index rose from 50.9 per cent to 56.3 per cent.
Respondents said an improvement in domestic demand was the source for much
of the growth in new orders in October, although a slight overall increase
in overseas orders was also recorded after two months of falling exports and
export orders.
The increase in production many also have been linked to preparation for
Christmas. The index measuring stocks of finished goods registered little
overall change on the previous month as de-stocking was reported to have
been offset by Christmas stockbuilding.
Less encouraging was a fall in the employment index last month from 51.3 per
cent to 48.8 per cent. This followed three months of rising employment in
manufacturing. The north of England had the highest growth in new orders
during October although demand continued to grow strongly in the south-west,
the Midlands and Wales.
Mr Peter Thomson, director-general of the institute, said: 'This is good
news, particularly as it is founded on hard data, direct from the factory
gates - not conjecture. It shows clearly that fresh vigour continues to
return to UK manufacturing, as demonstrated by the marked upturn seen in
output and order books.'

FT  01 NOV 93 / Financing a cure for Japan's sick economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR YOH KUROSAWA, president of Industrial Bank of Japan, is unusually willing
to criticise Japan's policymakers. In an interview in yesterday's Observer
newspaper published in London, he attacked the government for failing to
take sufficient measures to boost Japan's ailing economy. He called for a
Y10,000bn to Y15,000bn (Pounds 62bn to Pounds 93bn) income tax cut - the
government is rumoured to be considering a Y5,000bn cut - and a further half
point reduction in the official discount rate.
But Mr Kurosawa's words, like the Japanese economy, are difficult to read.
While the IBJ president's policy prescriptions are bold, they do not step
too far outside the consensus: fiscal policy is still the preferred option
for reviving Japanese growth, both in Tokyo and among Japan-watchers in the
US Treasury. Yet, up to now, Japan's fiscal activism has not had much
success. Three fiscal packages over the past year have consumed Japan's
general government budget surplus, but they have not produced an economic
revival. The OECD forecasts that the Japanese economy will not grow at all
this year, industrial output and retail sales are still registering
year-on-year falls and broad money growth remains sluggish.
A year ago, the focus of policymakers was on the unhealthy state of Japan's
banking sector. Excessive lending to property companies by the banks and
their non-bank subsidiaries in the late 1980s, followed by the collapse of
the stock market and property prices, had left the banks with substantial
non-performing loans. Official government figures said the bad debts of the
leading 21 banks totalled Y12,300bn, slightly less than in the US when bad
debts reached their peak and much less than in the severely indebted
Scandinavia. But Tokyo bankers acknowledged that the truth was much worse:
counting in the debts of non-bank subsidiaries, and adjusting for Japan's
more restrictive bad debt definition, suggested a total three to four times
the official level.
Mr Kurosawa, in conversation a year ago, was deeply troubled by the likely
effect of these bad debts on bank lending. He handed over a copy of a speech
which he had given in the US at Cornell university the previous week. His
speech praised the idea of setting up an agency to purchase these bad debts
and called for public funds to speed its work. There was, it acknowledged,
opposition to the use of public funds. But Japan would not ignore the fact
that public money had been used successfully both in the US Savings and Loan
bail-out and in the UK in the early 1970s.
But, in the intervening week since his speech was delivered, Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa, the then prime minister, had been strongly criticised for
suggesting that public funds should be used. At the interview, Mr Kurosawa
was adamant that the loan buying agency should not receive public funds. Nor
has it. Not surprisingly, the results have been disappointing: between
February and the end of September, it purchased non-performing loans with a
face value of just Y1,050bn. Japan's banks, due to report healthy
half-yearly operating profits at the end of this month, are using these
profits slowly to write off their non-performing loans.
Now the Japanese economy is, in the words last week of Mr Toshihiko Fukui, a
Bank of Japan director, in 'a protracted and deep adjustment phase'. Survey
evidence suggests that, despite falling interest rates, Japan's banks remain
unusually unwilling to lend. Outstanding loans by the 11 top commercial
banks fell 0.5 per cent in the six months to the end of September, the first
half-yearly fall since the survey began 39 years ago.
Of course, the troubled state of many Japanese manufacturers is a second
reason why Japanese credit growth remains so slow. But, even if their demand
for credit revived, Japan's indebted banks are likely to remain unwilling to
lend for some time. Unless, that is, the Bank of Japan provides funds to
speed the liquidation of these bad debts. For, as Mr Kurosawa knows, tax
cuts alone will not do the trick.

Germany. Data supplied by Datastream and WEFA. Retail sales volume: data
from national government sources except Japan and Italy (value series
deflated by OECD using CPI). Refers to total retail sales except France and
Italy (major outlets only) and Japan (department stores only). Industrial
production: data from national government sources. Includes mining,
manufacturing, gas, electricity and water supply industries except Japan
(mining and manufacturing only) and UK (also includes construction
industries). Unemployment rate: OECD standardised rate which adjusts as far
as possible for the different definitions of unemployment used in official
sources. Vacancy rate indicator: relevant vacancy measure divided by total
civilian employment, expressed in index form. Derived from OECD series. US -
help-wanted advertising, Japan - new vacancies, Germany and France - all
jobs vacant, Italy - no data available, UK - unfilled vacancies. Composite
leading indicator: OECD data. Each is a combination of series, cyclical
fluctuations in which usually precede cyclical fluctuations in general

<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S foreign minister, Mr Guido di Tella, begins a three-day official
visit to Britain today, the second by an Argentine minister this year and an
indication of rapidly improving ties.
He will see Mr John Major, the prime minister, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary.
In September, Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, made the first official
trip to Britain by a minister since the 1982 Falklands war. Three British
cabinet ministers have visited Buenos Aires this year.
Relations began improving after President Carlos Menem took office in 1989
and adopted pro-western foreign policies and free market economics. However,
the unresolved dispute over the Falklands means that Mr Menem is unlikely to
be invited to London soon.
The two sides have agreed on other questions, principally fisheries. Mr Di
Tella will sign a new one-year fishing agreement.

PERUVIANS yesterday gave their approval to a new constitution but by a
smaller margin than the government had expected, according to projections by
Apoyo, the Lima-based polling organisation, as voting closed.
The projections indicated that 55.3 per cent had voted in favour of the
changes in the referendum - the first in the country's history - and 44.7
per cent against.
If confirmed, the result would open the way for President Alberto Fujimori
to seek re-election in 1995 as the new constitution provides for a serving
president to stand for an immediate second term.
The most enthusiastic support for the new constitution came in the capital,
Lima, which has around a third of the total population; many remote
provinces rejected it roundly. Official results are not due for several
days. The constitution would be the twelfth in Peru's republican history.
'Today marks the start of a new future for Peru, a future of modernity and
stability,' President Fujimori said as he cast his own vote. He called the
new constitution 'an enormously important political reform' and 'proof that
Peru is a real democracy'. Investment and jobs would swiftly follow, he
said.
The reforms define Peru as a social market economy. The new charter broadly
enshrines the liberal economic reforms decreed by Mr Fujimori's
administration, reducing the role of the state, outlawing monopolies and
introducing modern work practices.

FT  01 NOV 93 / British Steel in Indiana contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH STEEL has won its first overseas contract for a pioneering
technology that reduces the amount of coke needed in blast furnaces, writes
Andrew Baxter.
Bethlehem Steel, one of the largest US steelmakers, is to install a system
for injecting granular coal into the two blast furnaces at its Burns Harbor
plant in Indiana.
The technology has been in use at British Steel's Scunthorpe works for about
10 years. Cokemaking is a capital-intensive and environmentally sensitive
process, but granular injection reduces the amount of coke required for
iron-making by up to 40 per cent.
Simon Macawber, the Doncaster iron and steelmaking equipment supplier, will
make and install the equipment at Burns Harbor. British Steel will provide
training, operating and technical assistance in the early production phase
and will receive royalties.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Banking for the people down Mexico way: Democracy in the
planned Nafta bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS for a North American Development Bank, endorsed last week by the
Clinton Administration, will create an institution with 'the most
transparent and democratic structure in the history of development banking,'
according to Mr Raul Hinojosa, who helped draft the plan.
The bank, intended to ease US-Mexican problems stemming from the North
American Free Trade Agreement, seeks to 'avoid all the problems of the
marble palaces' which house other development banks by sharing building
space with the Inter-American Development Bank. To curb any expansive new
bureaucracy, it will also get technical aid from the IADB.
Nadbank will not only finance environmental and infrastructure projects but
also fund enterprises in communities hit hard by Nafta. The Clinton
Administration can argue that without Nafta, there will be no lending
institution to aid towns whose factories have moved to Mexico.
The blueprint for Nadbank gives labour, environmentalists, and church and
civic groups an unprecedented voice in the institution's affairs. Along with
business and government representatives, they will be appointed to serve on
the bank's advisory and review committee 'to provide input and guidelines at
all stages of the loan granting process.'
The US and Mexican governments each will appoint three representatives to
the bank's board. But they will also have to deal with an ombudsman,
appointed by the advisory committee, to provide independent inspection of
Nadbank's operations. Conservatives are likely to view with distaste adding
'another level of bureaucracy' to involve the bank's clients. Mr Hinojosa
acknowledges that democratisation may slow operations but 'it will be well
worth it, if it means providing more effective proposals from grassroots up
rather than top down.'
A visiting scholar this year at the IADB, Mr Hinojosa has worked on the
Nadbank blueprint for two years with two economics professors from the
University of California at Berkeley, Mr Sherman Robinson, now on the
Council of Economic Advisers, and Mr Albert Fishlow. All three toiled in the
Clinton campaign and transition team, determined to promote 'an alternative
vision of what Nafta should be about,' said Mr Hinojosa.
Like other development banks, Nadbank will undertake a leveraging of its
resources far beyond its paid-in capital - Dollars 225m each for Mexico and
the US. Callable capital - that which each country promises to provide on
demand - will be Dollars 2.55bn.
Up to Dollars 6.5bn in funding will also come from other US government
programmes such as the Small Business Administration and Farmers Home
Administration. Other funds will come from the World Bank (Dollars 1.8bn),
the Mexican government (Dollars 2.2bn) and the Inter-American Development
Bank (Dollars 200m). More will come from issuing bonds on the capital
market, so that total project financing with private leveraging is expected
to be Dollars 20bn or more.
The bank's initial priority will be financing environmental and development
projects along the border. But two other facilities will provide up to
Dollars 200m each to non-border communities in Mexico and the US.
Announcement of Nadbank was applauded by pro-Nafta environmental groups. Mr
Peter Berle, president of the National Audubon Society, said it would be
'more flexible and its mission broader in scope' than a border clean-up
fund, originally proposed by the Administration.
'With Nadbank not only will water infrastructure projects be funded but
important issues such as housing, displacement of agricultural workers and
general readjustment funding will now be addressed,' he said.
The Administration's endorsement of Nadbank was particularly a triumph for
California Congressman Esteban Torres, but it was a painful victory. He and
other Hispanic leaders had been pushing the concept for months as part of
the price for their support of Nafta. When the deal was done, he received a
visit from a large group of old friends in the labour movement, who
beseeched him not to endorse Nafta.
But Mr Torres also felt the pull of his Hispanic-based constituency, which
is torn over Nafta between job loss worries and a pride that Americans and
Mexicans have sat down to the bargaining table and cut a deal as equals.
'This new-found respect has got to help improve the image and prestige of
Hispanic Americans,' said Mr Raul Yzaguirre, president of the national
council of La Raza, the nation's largest Hispanic organisation and one of
the three Hispanic groups to endorse Nafta last week.
Mr Yzaguirre spoke of the pact's potential for turning his community's
liabilities into assets. 'For perhaps the first time in my lifetime, being
bilingual in Spanish and English will be an advantage, rather than a
disadvantage in the labour market and in the corporate boardroom.'
Nadbank was expected to bring a number of the 18-member Hispanic caucus to
the Nafta side in the House, but last week it was Mr Torres alone who
announced his support. The others could be holding out for more
Administration favours, as Nafta supporters say, or they may find that even
their dream development bank is not worth the risk of losing their union
friends.

<TEXT>
MR Frank Lemay, the US State Department official who warned the Bush
administration that Iraq was misusing US government-backed loans to fund its
nuclear weapons project, has died in Washington at the age of 36.
Mr Lemay, who succumbed to complications from Aids, last year testified
about the Iraqgate affair before the House Judiciary Committee. His
testimony spurred congressional calls for a special prosecutor for the
scandal.
Mr Lemay went before Congress after Democratic legislators revealed a 1989
memorandum of his in which he reported that funds from the Atlanta branch of
Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) were being diverted by Baghdad for
its war machine.
The Lemay memo said: 'If smoke indicates fire, we may be facing a four-alarm
blaze in the near future.' The memo was considered so sensitive that it was
stamped 'not for the system' when it reached aides to Mr James Baker, the
then secretary of state.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HAITI'S military leaders, who successfully defied international efforts to
have exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide reinstalled on Saturday, plan
to consolidate their rule by making Mr Aristide constitutionally redundant.
Parliamentarians and businessmen who supported the military which overthrew
Mr Aristide two years ago, say that by failing to return the president has
defaulted on a United Nations-brokered agreement which he signed in July.
Mr Aristide's opponents plan to replace him with a provisional president,
and then to call a presidential election. In Port-au-Prince, Haiti's
capital, armed men in plain clothes, widely held to be an unofficial arm of
the police, fired guns in the air on Saturday, celebrating the president's
failure to appear.
Mr Aristide's return has been frustrated by the military leaders' refusal to
step down in keeping with the July agreement. They also refused to provide
protection for parliamentarians supporting the president, thwarting attempts
to pass amnesty legislation which the military demanded.
The military's new ploy is likely to force the UN to take stronger action
than the embargo on oil and arms shipments implemented a fortnight ago to
force the military leaders to step aside. Mr Aristide, who says the UN
agreement is still valid, asked the UN last week to tighten the embargo.
The UN Security Council said on Saturday it was insisting on complete
compliance of the agreement for Mr Aristide's return to office, and
threatened to tighten sanctions. The Security Council condemned General
Raoul Cedras, Haiti's military leader, for violating the agreement.
Mr Robert Malval, the prime minister appointed by Mr Aristide, has backed
away from a declaration that he would resign if the president did not return
by Saturday. He now says he will stay in office to fight for Mr Aristide's
reinstatement.

<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S foreign minister, Mr Guido di Tella, begins a three-day official
visit to Britain today, the second by an Argentine minister this year and an
indication of rapidly improving ties.
He will see Mr John Major, the prime minister, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade
and industry secretary, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary. He will also
meet opposition politicians and business leaders.
In September, Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, made the first official
trip to Britain by a minister since the 1982 Falklands war. Three British
cabinet ministers have visited Buenos Aires this year.
Relations began improving after President Carlos Menem took office in 1989
and adopted pro-western foreign policies and free market economics. However,
the unresolved dispute over the Falklands means that Mr Menem is unlikely to
be invited to London soon.
Mr Di Tella is trying to win over the Falkland islanders by convincing them
that Argentina has changed for the better. He has met Falkland
representatives and broadcast to the islands via the BBC World Service. But
suspicious Falklanders reject his advances and Britain refuses to discuss
the islands' political future.
The two sides have agreed on other questions, principally fisheries, the
Falklands' main source of revenue. Mr Di Tella will sign a new one-year
fishing agreement.
However, Britain refuses to lift its arms embargo preventing Argentina from
replacing aircraft shot down in 1982.

A Venezuelan criminal court judge issued warrants at the weekend for the
arrest of 19 people, including executives of GTE and AT&amp;T in Venezuela, as
part of an investigation into a gas pipeline explosion outside Caracas that
killed about 50 people, writes Joseph Mann in Caracas.
The explosion on September 28 occurred allegedly when an excavating machine
digging a trench for fibre-optic cable struck an underground natural gas
pipeline. CANTV, the privatised telecommunications company run by a
consortium headed by GTE of the US, contracted AT&amp;T Andinos to lay the
fibre-optic cable.
AT&amp;T sub-contracted a Venezuelan company, Abengoa, to carry out the work.
The pipeline is operated by Corpoven, a subsidiary of the national oil
company PDVSA. No one has accepted responsibility.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of Jewish settlers set Arab homes alight, stoned Arab cars,
blocked roads and burnt tyres at the weekend in response to the murder of a
Jewish settler by Islamic militants on Friday. It was the worst violence in
the occupied territories since Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organisation signed their autonomy accord in September.
Spokesmen for the 130,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
declared 'a Jewish intifada' - an ongoing effort to disrupt Palestinian
daily life throughout the occupied territories.
At a meeting in Jerusalem, settlement leaders agreed to continue blocking
West Bank roads and disrupting Palestinian traffic. They also demanded an
apology from Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, over remarks in which he
implied a comparison between the opponents of the autonomy accords on both
sides - Hamas and the settlers. Mr Rabin had stressed the need to stand firm
against the 'enemies among the Palestinians . . . and the opponents among
the Jews'.
Mr Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the main opposition Likud party, called the
implied comparison 'scandalous' and urged Mr Rabin to resign if his
government could not properly protect the settlers. There were similar calls
at yesterday afternoon's funeral of Mr Haim Mizrahi, the settler who was
abducted and stabbed to death by Hamas militants.
Mourners carried signs saying 'Death to Hamas', condemned the government
over last week's release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, and called
for the scrapping of the autonomy programme.
Yesterday Israelis killed two Palestinians. A 21-year-old Palestinian was
shot dead by an Israeli in the Gaza Strip after the Palestinian stabbed him
in the hand and back. Soldiers shot dead a Palestinian labourer from Gaza
when he failed to stop at a roadblock.
On Friday, Palestinian gunmen shot dead a West Bank Palestinian land dealer
who was said to have been selling Arab land to Jewish settlers.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A TURNING point may be reached this week in a looming crisis over the
international inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities.
North Korea is under growing pressure to allow International Atomic Energy
Agency inspectors renewed access to its nuclear facilities at Yongbyon since
the agency's monitoring cameras are expected to run out of film soon.
Pyongyang recently broke off negotiations with the IAEA on the inspection
issue, claiming the agency was biased.
Mr Hans Blix, the IAEA director-general, is due to report on the North
Korean nuclear issue to the UN General Assembly today.
He is expected to say North Korea is hampering the agency's ability to
verify that Pyongyang is adhering to the nuclear safeguards accord, but to
stop short of declaring that the continuity of inspections has been broken.
The General Assembly is then expected to debate a resolution urging Pyonyang
to continue IAEA inspections.
This could eventually set the stage for the UN Security Council to consider
the question of imposing economic sanctions on North Korea for failing to
carry out its obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT).
But China has recently indicated that it would block a sanctions resolution,
while Russia and Japan are also believed to have reservations.
The US has been holding discussions with North Korean representatives at the
UN in New York since mid-October to persuade Pyongyang to allow resumption
of the routine IAEA inspections that began last year.
North Korea is seeking an end to the Team Spirit military exercise, which is
held annually each spring in South Korea by the US, in return for allowing
the entry of the IAEA inspection team, according to South Korean officials.
But the US wants North Korea to accept the IAEA inspectors and arrange a
meeting of presidential envoys with South Korea before the 1994 Team Spirit
manoeuvres are cancelled.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Airbus loses Dollars 590m Sri Lanka order
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Sri Lanka government is to cancel an order for five Airbus A340 long
range aircraft worth Dollars 590m (Pounds 391m) for its national airline
Airlanka.
The decision is a further blow to the European Airbus consortium which has
suffered more cancellations so far this year than new aircraft orders.
The current prolonged recession in the commercial airliner business has
prompted a call from Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus managing director, for a
reform of the consortium's structure to increase its overall
competitiveness. It won only 23 new orders during the first nine months of
this year, and has also faced heavy cancellations and order deferrals.
Mr Ranil Wickremasinghe, the Sri Lankan prime minister, said in a weekend
newspaper interview in Colombo that the government had informed the World
Bank of the decision to cancel the A340 orders.
The original purchase had been criticised by the bank and Sri Lankan
opposition leaders as extravagant. However, Mr Wickremasinghe said the
government was open to renegotiating a contract with Airbus 'if conditions
are acceptable'.
Airbus officials are understood to have met Mr Sepala Attygalle, Airlanka's
chairman, last week to discuss the possibility of a more favourable contract
for the airline.

<TEXT>
CHINA executed seven officials over the weekend, including the mayor of a
small town in southern Henan province, as a nationwide anti-corruption drive
gathered pace. Dozens of bureaucrats have been shot recently for crimes
ranging from bribe-taking to extortion and embezzlement.
People's Daily, the Communist party newspaper, hailed the executions as
'another achievement' for the party and the 'entire Chinese people'.
'To severely punish corrupt leading officials according to law is absolutely
necessary for ensuring the purity of our party and state power, maintaining
social stability and promoting the establishment of a socialist market
economy,' the paper said.
China launched its anti-corruption drive several months ago in the face of
widespread grumbling among citizens about official graft and bribe-taking.
The campaign has taken on some of the characteristics of a national crusade
led by a Communist party desperate to shore up its public support.
Members of the standing committee of China's parliament, the National
People's Congress, meeting at the weekend, charged that 'corruption had
reached an alarming rate in China, damaging the party style and harming the
image of the party and the government. It had also eroded social conduct'.
Mr Li Ligong, a standing committee member, urged that the anti-corruption
campaign should be carried out regularly and be institutionalised. 'The
masses should be fully mobilised to inform on offenders,' he declared.
According to China's prosecutor general, corruption is rife among Communist
party officials. He reported to parliament last week that in one out of 10
criminal cases investigated in the first nine months of this year, offenders
were party or government officials.
By September, 5,040 party and government officials, including 20 at
department or city level, and one at vice-ministerial level, were charged
with committing crimes such as embezzlement.

IRAN said yesterday that the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries
would have to re-examine its September output agreement and cut its ceiling
if oil prices did not recover, Reuter reports from Bahrain.
'If the price weakens further, there should be a new discussion on the
ceiling,' Mr Gholamreza Aqazadeh, oil minister, said in a statement.
'If this (current) ceiling does not lead to stronger prices, there should be
a revision.'
It was believed to be the first open statement from within Opec that the
agreement, which set a ceiling of 24.52m barrels per day for October to
March, might need revision.
Opec members have looked in dismay as the market has chipped tens of
millions of dollars off their collective daily revenue.
North Sea Brent prices fell below the Dollars 16 per barrel level on Friday.
The price for December delivery closed in London at Dollars 15.80.

relations over Macao contrast with friction over Hong Kong,
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON

<TEXT>
OFFICIAL visits are a time for gilding lilies, but the contrast between
Macao, the Portuguese colony which reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1999,
and Hong Kong could not have been greater.
At the weekend Chinese government officials were falling over themselves
with praise for Portugal and its President Mario Soares, who concluded a
three-day visit to the colony yesterday.
Mr Guo Dongpo, the head of China's Xinhua news agency, Beijing's de facto
representative in Macao, praised the good relations between the two
countries. His colleague Mr Guo Jiading, who leads the Sino-Portuguese Joint
Liaison Group overseeing the transition, said the two sides were in complete
agreement about matters relating to the transfer of the colony.
That cannot be said for Hong Kong, which an hour away by hydrofoil lies on
the western side of the Pearl River estuary. Talks between Britain and China
about Hong Kong's political development are mired. Over recent days British
officials have let it be known that, if there is no movement from China
towards a compromise, talks may break down as early as next month.
Portugal's position on its south China coast colony has always been
different from Britain's. While Britain took Hong Kong from China in 1842
following the first Opium War, Beijing has always tolerated Macao and has
always exercised much greater political influence over Macao.
Settled in 1557, the two islands and peninsula which constitute the colony
were accepted by the Ming and Qing emperors who, for reasons of trade,
allowed the settlement to flourish. So, too, have China's Communist rulers.
When the socialists took power in Portugal in 1974, it was the Chinese
government which had to persuade the Portuguese to stay. As with Mozambique
and East Timor, Portugal's new government wanted out - and quickly.
A secret deal between the two was concluded in Paris in 1979 whereby
Portugal agreed that Macao was sovereign Chinese territory and agreed to
administer it until China wanted it back. This agreement was revealed only
in 1987, when the two agreed that Macao would revert to China in 1999.
Over the weekend Mr Soares sought to bolster confidence in the colony,
saying that he had full confidence in Macao's future under Chinese rule.
Although the crowds flocked to see the Portuguese president, few among the
Chinese community will mourn the passing of Portuguese administration.
Earlier this year a Cantonese talkback radio show was summarily taken off
the air after many of the callers rang in to criticise the Portuguese
administration. Businessmen find the colonial government unnecessarily
bureaucratic. 'I try to have the least to do with the government as
possible,' said one, adding he preferred to cut deals with mainland
partners.
One of the few areas of conflict between China and Portugal is over the
issue of localisation of the civil service. Little has been done to date,
possibly reflecting the fact that the governorship of the colony and the top
posts in government are rewards given by Lisbon to loyal supporters at home.
China's involvement in Macao's economy is every bit as great as - possibly
greater than - its role in Hong Kong's economy. An attraction for many
mainland officials and businessmen is that Macao has no publicly quoted
corporate sector, relieving them of the irritant of disclosure.
According to one western banker in the colony, the mainland Chinese business
interest in Macao is dominant. 'They have a very solid presence in Macao and
a very influential one,' he said.
Bank of China is the largest bank, controlling about half the banking assets
in the colony. Xinhua, unlike its opposite number in Hong Kong, is highly
visible and active in business, especially trading and property development.
As in economy, so too in politics, where Beijing holds the whip hand.
Elections last year for 16 of the Macao Legislative Assembly's 26 seats saw
a virtual clean sweep for pro-Beijing politicians. There is little popular
agitation for greater democracy, as there is in Hong Kong.
Underlining Beijing's position in Macao is the power of the head of Xinhua.
Since the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s he has been de facto
governor of the colony. Last year his status was upgraded. Mr Guo Dongpo no
longer has to report to Beijing through the head of Xinhua in Hong Kong.

FT  01 NOV 93 / India furious at US remarks on Kashmir status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A DIPLOMATIC row has erupted between the US and India about an American
State Department official's remarks questioning the status of the troubled
northern Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir.
India has reacted angrily to the official's comment last week questioning
the validity of Kashmir's accession to India in 1947.
The row comes at a sensitive time with the siege of the Hazratbal mosque,
Kashmir's holiest shrine, entering its third week. Hundreds of Indian troops
surround the mosque, which was seized by separatist Moslem militants on
October 15.
Efforts to negotiate a settlement and secure the release of an estimated 100
to 150 pilgrims trapped inside the mosque have repeatedly foundered over the
militants' demands for safe passage. The Indian authorities want them to
surrender.
If part of the militants' plan was to focus international attention on their
fight to break away from India, they have succeeded. Pakistan, India's
hostile neighbour which claims Kashmir for itself, has protested about the
mosque siege. The issue was raised at last month's Commonwealth heads of
government meeting in Cyprus. Now the US official's comments have prolonged
the international debate.
The official - Miss Robin Raphael, an assistant secretary of state - said at
a press conference last Thursday: 'We view Kashmir as a disputed territory
and that means we do not recognise the Instrument of Accession as meaning
that Kashmir is for evermore an integral part of India. There were many
issues at play in that time frame as we all know.'
Miss Raphael was referring to the controversial way in which the last
Maharajah of Kashmir acceded to India.
Indian ministers at the weekend rejected Miss Raphael's remarks angrily. Mr
Dinesh Singh, the minister for external affairs, said no one had the right
to question the status of Kashmir as an integral part of India.
US officials insist there has been no change in American policy. They point
out that Washington has long regarded Kashmir as 'disputed territory'.
However, it does seem that Miss Raphael committed a gaffe in repeating
Washington's view in strong language at a sensitive time.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Crunch has come for S Africa's power-sharing constitution:
Proposals look more like majority rule than National party supporters could
have imagined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IF YOU'RE scared of majority rule, vote Yes'. That was the promise the
ruling National party in South Africa made to its white supporters during
last year's national referendum campaign: vote Yes for a constitution
entrenching minority rights and preventing majority domination; vote Yes,
and prevent majority rule.
Those who did, two-thirds of white voters, are in for a shock. The new
constitution negotiated by the National party and the African National
Congress, due to be finalised shortly, looks far more like a majority rule
constitution than any National party supporter could have imagined.
As promised, the constitution is based on multi-racial power-sharing in the
executive, in the legislature, and between central government and the
regions. But the share of power guaranteed to minorities is considerably
less secure than that originally demanded by the National party. This could
provoke a revolt among traditional party supporters and new recruits from
minority communities, who may see the deal as a sell-out to the ANC.
That deal - on the first post-apartheid constitution, likely to remain in
force until the end of the decade - is now all but done. Within a week, ANC
and National party negotiators expect to have finalised joint constitutional
proposals which go to a technical committee for drafting. They will then try
to sell that constitution to the right-wing Freedom Alliance, which so far
seems disposed to reject it.
It seems likely that parliament will endorse a new constitution within a
month to six weeks, in time for the first all-race elections on April 27.
That constitution will enshrine a multi-party government of national unity
for the first five years. But within that government, the power exerted by
the National party, standard-bearer of white and other minority interests,
seems likely to depend largely on the goodwill of the ANC and of Mr Nelson
Mandela, its leader.
Far from entrenching an effective minority veto over cabinet decisions on
fundamental matters - long the National party's bottom line - President F W
de Klerk appears willing to accept a voluntary arrangement, which would have
no constitutional force, under which Mr Mandela promises not to act on
crucial issues without Mr de Klerk's assent.
The National party would have one further mechanism for blocking majority
decisions in cabinet: where consensus could not be achieved informally
within an inner cabinet of the main leaders, a vote would be taken.
The exact percentage required to pass decisions in areas such as finance and
state security has yet to be agreed: but the ANC is insisting it be 60 per
cent, and National party negotiators say they may accept this. If they do,
the party alone could probably not block cabinet decisions. Its share of
cabinet seats would reflect the party's share of the national vote - current
opinion polls put NP support at 12 to 20 per cent.
Even voting with potential allies in the cabinet (each party with at least 5
per cent of the vote would have proportionate cabinet representation), Mr de
Klerk might not be guaranteed blocking power.
Government negotiators believe that the ANC and NP share common goals for
the government of national unity, including agreement on the need to restore
stability. Most of all, they believe assurances from ANC leaders including
Mr Mandela that the ANC does not think itself capable of governing alone. So
Mr de Klerk seems to be willing to abandon the rigid entrenchment of
minority power in cabinet, in favour of a primarily voluntary form of
power-sharing which he thinks will give him more influence in fact, if not
in law.
But if, after more than three years of constant negotiations, he and his
officials have lost their fear of the ANC (government and ANC negotiators
even shared bungalows at their recent bush summit, and relations are very
cordial) the same cannot be said of much of the white electorate. Nervous
whites wonder whether cosy unwritten agreements between Mr Mandela and Mr de
Klerk would survive a landslide ANC election victory, and they question
whether the spirit of national unity which inspires the current negotiations
will endure when the new government starts to take hard policy decisions.
NP officials say they will sell the constitution as a package which, taken
together, fulfils the referendum promise of protecting minority rights and
preventing majority abuse of power. They point to a bill of rights which
substantially protects individual economic and political rights against
state abuse; and substantial devolution of power to regional governments,
aimed at weakening central government and its ability to dominate.
But what Mr de Klerk has dubbed a 'federal' constitution in fact reserves
very strong powers for central government. True, substantial powers are
devolved to regional governments in areas such as education, policing,
health, housing, welfare, but central government reserves the right to
intervene in these areas to impose uniform national norms and standards, to
ensure proper regulation, to protect the national economy or national
security.
In short, the constitution authorises central government to intervene in
terms so vague as to undermine regional autonomy. And with regions barred
from imposing taxes without central government approval, it is hard to
accept Mr de Klerk's claim that the new state will be 'federal'.
In the end, the best way to protect minority rights may be, as government
negotiators claim, for whites to prove that they are indispensable to the
new government. Officials believe they can build more power this way than by
entrenching the minimum rights needed to survive.
But success will depend on the number of white, coloured (mixed-race) and
Indian voters willing to take the same gamble. If minority voters desert the
National party in droves, it will not have the electoral strength to claim
the role agreed with Mr Mandela. Indeed, with white support for the party at
an all-time low and attempts to muster black support going badly, there is
an outside possibility that the NP could come third in a national election,
behind the right-wing Freedom Alliance which includes the mainly Zulu
Inkatha Freedom party, the white supremacist Conservative party and the
nationalist Afrikaner Volksfront.
Still, it is hard to imagine the Freedom Alliance surviving tensions between
black conservatives and white racists long enough to fight an election
together. At the moment, the greater risk seems to be that the Freedom
Alliance could oppose elections altogether, and launch something to close to
a civil war. Alternatively, some members might choose to oppose the
constitution but fight the elections anyway.
The next few weeks are crucial as the intentions of the Freedom Alliance
become clear. At last, the crunch has come.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Kenya abolishes maize monopoly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KHARTOUM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Daniel arap Moi of Kenya at the weekend abolished the government's
maize import and marketing monopoly, a reform demanded by donors who meet
this month to hear Kenya's plea for restoration of international aid.
The liberalisation of the maize trade allows private traders to import the
staple crop and distribute it freely across the country.
The decision, resisted by the National Cereals and Produce Board, appears to
have been prompted as much by the need to placate donors as by a crop
failure this year. Mr Moi indicated that the government's foreign exchange
reserves were only enough to cover Kenya's immediate emergency food needs,
which he estimated at 200,000 tonnes. Long-term food stability would depend
on the efforts of Kenyans themselves.
US aid officials criticised Mr Moi's announcement for not including the
deregulation of price controls. Nevertheless, the deregulation of the maize
trade marks a victory for IMF and World Bank officials, who are currently in
Nairobi designing a new economic reform programme for Kenya's donors'
conference on November 22.
Previous attempts to reform the sector have been resisted by the NCPB, which
has a monopoly over maize trade.
Sudan's President Omar Hassan al-Bashir has sacked Mr Abdel-Rahim Hamdi as
finance minister, Reuter reports from Khartoum. He had been closely
associated with tough economic reforms welcomed by the IMF but unpopular
among Sudanese because of price rises.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Municipal Elections: Northern League set to take another
bastion - After decades of communist rule, Genoa is likely to fall to a
regional party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT USED to be said that the Genoese were reluctant to buy fridges because
they believed the light was still burning after the door had been closed.
They still have a reputation for being cautious and suspicious of change.
But this might be about to change. On November 21, the Genoese, along with
445 other municipalities, vote for a new mayor and council. And there are
signs of a growing disenchantment with the left-wing politicians who have
run the city throughout the post-war era.
Opinion polls suggest that Italy's sixth largest city could fall to the
Ligurian League, one of the regional political groups belonging to the
Northern League, a regional autonomy movement for Lombardy. Under the fiery
populist leadership of Mr Umberto Bossi, the Northern League has grown in
recent years from a relatively obscurity to a party that has 40 per cent of
the vote in the rich northern industrial belt. If it wins Genoa, it would be
the first proof that the league can appeal to voters outside its Lombardy
heartland.
The more garrulous league officials in Genoa read even more into the
prospect of victory. 'Winning Genoa gives a future Republic of the North its
outlet to the sea,' says Mr Bruno Ravera, one of the Ligurian League
founders.
Since the second world war, the administration of Genoa has been dominated
first by the Communist Party and latterly by its successor, the Party of the
Democratic Left (PDS). Grassroots support came from the trade unions, based
in the port, steelmaking and engineering.
The appeal of the left has waned with the collapse of the Berlin Wall and
the decline of Genoa's loss-making state-owned industries. Nine out of ten
industrial workers are in the public sector and the city's economy has been
undermined by recession and the drying up of state subsidies to the port and
industry.
Genoa's unemployment, at nearly 15 per cent, is double the average in
northern Italy and is worsening.
Despite a magnificent setting, hugging the curves of low mountains that drop
steeply to the sea, the city has an air of melancholy neglect. The
infrastructure has been punished by two consecutive years of heavy flooding.
The historic centre has been dubbed by some the Casbah because of the 20,000
immigrants living there. Most are North African and and many are illegal
immigrants. The area has been patrolled by 500 police on 24-hour duty since
riots last summer, the worst racial conflicts seen in Italy.
Last year's celebrations for the 500th anniversary of Columbus's discovery
of the New World occasioned an expensive renovation of the port and a brief
recovery of local pride. But funds have run out to finish the city's metro
rail network and it has emerged that the claimed '1.7m' visitors were
inflated by about 1m.
Symbolic of Genoa's plight is the elegant glass-structured Sheraton Hotel,
unopened because of lack of clientele.
As elsewhere in Italy, magistrates are investigating corruption in various
public works contracts. The previous city administration was dissolved in
May following accusations of corruption against Mr Claudio Burlando, the
mayor. Although it seems a zealous magistrate may have overstepped the mark
in having the mayor arrested, the accusations besmirched the previous
administration. As a result 'clean honest government' is on the lips of all
those in the electoral contest.
In an attempt to adopt new clothing, the left has formed a 'progressive
alliance'. The PDS has chosen to back an independent candidate for mayor, Mr
Adriano Sansa, a well known local judge, and has obtained the support of the
cross-party reformist grouping, Democratic Alliance, plus the Greens. Polls
give Mr Sansa 38 per cent of the vote.
But the league has crept up, pushing aside the Christian Democrats and their
allies, and now holds about 36 per cent of the vote. 'This is a contest
between the league and the PDS,' says Mr Enrico Serra, the 59-year-old
orthopaedic surgeon who hopes to be the league's first mayor. 'It's a vote
between the old and the new.'
Their platforms are remarkably similar: an emergency programme to deal with
flood damage; reorganising the city administration; improving the crumbling
infrastructure and renovation of the historic centre. But when it comes to
emphasis and style, the differences are marked.
The league wants to look in detail at the books of the previous
administration, believing there are L700bn (Pounds 290m) worth of
questionable operations. 'We want to provide a transparent administration,
that offers real services, and of course we will privatise as much as we
can,' says Mr Serra. The league will seek to prune the 16,000 workforce on
the city's payroll.
Mr Sansa puts the emphasis on a more efficient use of resources and seeking
new investment to create jobs. He wants tighter immigration policies but is
alarmed at the more extremist among the league who are demanding mass
expulsions.
Under new laws approved in March, mayors are directly elected and are able
then to control the formation of the councils. If no one obtains an outright
majority in the first round, there is a run-off. In Genoa a run-off is very
likely.
Although Mr Sansa is in the lead, it is not clear how he can boost his
support in the run-off without turning to the hardline marxists,
Reconstructed Communism. In Genoa, they hold 9 per cent of the vote. In
contrast the league will be looking in the second round to the centre,
especially the Christian Democrat vote.
Two factors may tip the scales in the league's favour. The Genoese blame
last month's flood disaster on the failures of the previous city council,
and the league is picking up protest votes among the self-employed and
shop-keepers who are furious over the government attempts to tighten up on
tax evasion.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Airlines may fly Dollars 2.5bn into the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRLINES ARE expected to lose a further Dollars 2.4bn-Dollars 2.5bn on
international scheduled services this year, after losing Dollars 11.5bn in
the three previous years, the International Air Transport Association warns
in its annual report today.
In spite of some tentative signs of improvement in recent months, the 221
members of Iata, the airline trade organisation, do not expect a rapid
turnaround in profitability. At best, the industry is expected to break even
next year, with the possibility of a reasonable profit in 1995 or 1996.
'Even then, we are not talking of healthy industry-wide profits of the order
of 5-6 per cent of turnover: the airline industry has never achieved this,'
said one London airline industry analyst.
The main cause for the heavy losses has continued to be overcapacity,
provoking fare wars undermining yields, says Mr Pierre Jeanniot, Iata's
director general.
But he notes some improvements this year, with airlines restructuring their
operations and with capacity coming more into line with passenger demand.
Iata also expects the trend towards more consolidation through mergers,
partnerships and commercial alliances to accelerate.
After increasing by 10.2 per cent last year compared with 1991, Iata expects
international passenger traffic to grow by an average of 6.6 per cent a year
between now and 1997.
Last year's increase reflects recovery from the dismal performance in 1991,
when passenger numbers declined for the first time as a result of recession
and the Gulf conflict.
The latest five-year passenger growth forecast is between one and two points
lower than forecasts made before the 1991 air transport crisis.
Traffic to and from western Europe - the largest international market - is
expected to grow by 5.9 per cent a year.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Yeltsin decree will allow foreigners to buy land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Yeltsin's decree permitting land to be freely bought and sold is
likely to unleash a revolution in the Russian countryside and lead to
substantial foreign investment.
However, ambiguities in the law and a rearguard action by officials hostile
to land privatisation could delay or even halt its intended effect, by
preserving the power of state and collective farms and preventing peasants
from selling their share of collective farms.
Mr Yuri Chernichenko, leader of the pro-market Peasants' Party, said the
decree would be meaningless unless the state pushed through collective farm
sales and supported the new individual farmers.
Earlier decrees have cut subsidies to state farms, stopped easy loans and
ordered an end to obligatory grain sales to the state - causing state farm
leaders to forecast a crisis unless they receive funding. The decree, by
allowing farm workers to sell and buy land, gives an incentive to create
private farms which could take over from the failing state enterprises.
The decree appears to allow foreigners to buy land through joint ventures.
Mr Mark Borghesani of US lawyers Baker MacKenzie, said: 'There is nothing in
the law to prevent a foreign company buying out its Russian partner after
the joint venture has acquired land. This could lead to transactions in
which the Russians would be nominal purchasers on behalf of the foreign
company.'
While the bulk of the decree was aimed at privatising land for agricultural
use, one section allows local authorities to change the use from
agricultural to commercial, Mr Borghesani said. 'There is now definitely a
growing demand for premises - including manufacturing bases on greenfield
sites. Leases are now being signed with the option to buy later - in
anticipation of the land law coming into force.'
However, the decree will also spark efforts to protect the present system.
The Agriculture Ministry, voice of the state farm sector, has criticised the
decree as ill-thought out and premature. Mr Valentin Denisov, a senior
ministry official, said: 'Without a precise mechanism to control the land
market and give permission to sell land, farm managers can do as they please
and that could breed chaos.'

FT  01 NOV 93 / Britain bans Polish carrier in flights row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday suspended flights by the Polish national carrier LOT to
the UK following the breakdown of talks over flight allocations between
British Airways and LOT, writes Paul Betts.
The UK Department of Transport said LOT's permit for air services to the UK
was not being renewed because the airline had refused to honour existing
agreements between the two countries.
But Mr Boguslaw Liberadzki, the Polish transport minister, said the talks
had broken down because BA was seeking to double the number of flights
between London and Warsaw at least for a trial period.
LOT believes an increase in BA flights to Warsaw would undermine its
European and transatlantic business because passengers might switch to the
cheaper route via London to the US and Canada.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Scuffles mark gathering of far-right party
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Scuffles between police and young militants marked a gathering of the
Republicans, a prominent far-right party, in Rastatt, south-west Germany
yesterday. The party, led by Mr Franz Schonhuber, a former Waffen SS
sergeant, presents a disconcerting threat to the political establishment in
next year's 'election marathon', when there will be 19 elections in Germany

FT  01 NOV 93 / The European Union slips quietly into life: The Maastricht
treaty, which takes effect today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 340m citizens of the European Community may hardly have noticed, but
despite the absence of fanfares, history will record that Monday, November
1, 1993, marked the entry into force of the Maastricht treaty and the birth
of the European Union.
Maastricht provides for small, but potentially significant changes in how
Europe does business. It will increase the powers of the European
parliament, and deepen collaboration between governments on drugs,
immigration and crime. It also lays the groundwork for greater co-operation
on foreign policy, and provides for a move to a single European currency by
1999 at the latest.
Some of these changes look incremental; others such as the move to European
economic and monetary union look doubtful, at least in the light of the
recent de facto suspension of the exchange rate mechanism.
Maastricht's proponents insist that the treaty is one of the most
misunderstood documents in modern times, perhaps because it is about as
readable as a London bus timetable. Yet the opaque, bureaucratic language
reflects the ambiguity inherent in a treaty which was a compromise between
federally minded states such as the Netherlands and Belgium and those who
jealously guard national sovereignty such as the UK and France.
The treaty contains suggestions for intensifying European co-operation on
education, health and culture; but it sets clear limits against centralising
tendencies in Brussels. The doctrine of subsidiarity - devolving power to
the lowest appropriate national and regional level - is a double insurance
for member states.
The hybrid nature of Maastricht also means that the European Community will
still exist beside the new European Union. Roughly speaking, Europeans
should speak of the Union when referring to the 'intergovernmental' pillars
of foreign policy and judicial co-operation; but they should retain the more
familiar 'EC' or 'Community' when referring to normal EC business under the
Treaty of Rome.
The obvious winner among institutions is the European Parliament. Under
Article 189b, it gains the right of 'co-decision' on legislation, to be
shared with the council of ministers. This does not extend to core areas
such as foreign policy, defence, judicial co-operation or economic policy,
rather to more mundane matters such as the internal market.
A senior Commission official predicts that the legislative struggle between
EC ministers and parliament could make decision-making more difficult in the
short-term. One analogy is the bargaining between House and Senate in the
US, with the Commission playing the broker.
Other important changes foreshadowed by the Maastricht treaty include:
More qualified majority voting in social policy legislation. Britain has a
treaty opt-out, but remains involved in discussions.
The right of EC citizens to vote or stand as a candidate in local and
European parliament elections.
Establishment of 'joint actions' in foreign and security policy, a code word
for less reactive diplomacy rather than the dispatch of combat troops.
Maastricht also provides for closer collaboration between the European Union
and the Western European Union, the military organisation based in Brussels.
The creation of a committee of the regions. This reflects the influence of
the German Lander who were anxious not be left out in the cold; but it could
again complicate decision-making if the new body gains stature.
The one institution which will be literally cut down to size is the European
Commission. Under Maastricht, the Commission should comprise the president
(Mr Jacques Delors) and one or two vice-presidents only, rather than the
current six 'veeps'.

FT  01 NOV 93 / Delors may not stand for Elysee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR JACQUES Delors, European Commission president, yesterday gave the
clearest hint to date that he might not stand in the 1995 French
presidential election.
Mr Delors, 68, said in an interview with the Journal du Dimanche that he had
no intention of quitting his job in Brussels before the end of his final
term in January 1995. 'I'm going to serve to the end,' he said.
Mr Delors' suggestion that he might bury ambitions to enter the Elysee
defies his continuing strong showing in French opinion polls. But it appears
driven by an unwillingness to risk splitting the French Socialist party
which has just rallied around Mr Michel Rocard, a certain candidate in the
spring 1995 election.
A second factor seems to be a desire to end his 10-year career as Commission
president on a high note after the traumatic but ultimately successful
ratification of the Maastricht treaty which enters into force today.
Mr Delors has told friends he accepts he has lost the battle for faster
European political and monetary integration; but he remains determined that
his forthcoming White Paper on competitiveness will prod leaders to tackle
mass unemployment and restore economic growth.
In the interview, Mr Delors spoke of a New Deal for Europe and expressed
satisfaction with the outcome of last Friday's special EC summit in
Brussels, whose most significant decision was to locate the European
Monetary Institute - forerunner of the future EC central bank  - in
Frankfurt.
EC leaders agreed to wider the scope of an Ecu8bn (Pounds 6.2bn) European
Investment Bank lending facility to include energy, environmental and inner
city projects rather than simply transport-related areas. This should speed
up disbursement of funds from the present level of Ecu3.3bn, an EC official
said.
The summit did not tackle the unemployment crisis, preferring to await the
presentation of the Delors White Paper at the regular summit at the end of
the Belgian presidency in December.
