FT  21 OCT 93 / Technology: Eyeing up the computer screen - Plans to link
the human nervous system to PCs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM FOREMSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Move your eyes across the computer screen and the cursor follows faithfully.
Choose a command by simply looking at the menu selection and blinking, and
the computer responds.
This might describe the most natural computer user interface of all,
allowing eye movement to control computers and thus going beyond the present
ubiquitous computer mouse and graphics icon systems which are based on
technologies first described in the mid-1960s.
If tiny BioControl Systems in California's Silicon Valley has its way,
people will soon control computers by moving their eyes and 'thinking'
commands.
BioControl says it has developed a technology that links the human nervous
system to a computer. Its BioMuse system can be programmed to interpret the
user's biosignals - tiny electrical signals produced by the human body's
nervous system.
These can then be used to control a computer or anything controlled by one.
Surgical equipment, for example, could be controlled by a surgeon's eye
movements, allowing for delicate work to be performed.
But what if the surgeon is distracted by something and looks elsewhere? Not
to worry, says Anthony Lloyd, executive vice-president of BioControl
Systems.
'The surgeon could simply clench his jaw. That would be the signal that
would disengage the system, allowing the surgeon to move his eyes without
danger of doing something unwanted.'
A lightweight headband is worn, much like a sweatband. This contains a row
of gel-based sensors which pick up and amplify signals from the nervous
system and send them through a wireless connection to the BioMuse box. The
BioMuse contains a powerful, eight-channel, digital signal processor which
interprets the biosignals and maps them to whatever result the application
requires.
In one demonstration, the BioMuse is programmed to interpret the biosignals
associated with moving the eyes to control a musical synthesiser. The user
produces musical sounds by closing and opening the eyes, and moving them
from side to side.
The BioMuse can also interpret brain wave activities and be programmed to
respond to different brain wave states, raising the intriguing possibility
that users could 'think' commands. This is the focus of a research project
at the University of Illinois which is using BioMuse technology to allow
users to try to produce words on a computer screen by simply thinking them.
BioMuse will also respond to muscle activity, allowing severely disabled
persons to control their wheelchairs or other equipment through tiny muscle
movements picked up by sensors mounted in a leg-band or arm-band.
With forearm-based sensors, the BioMuse system could allow hand gestures to
control a computer. This conjures up the intriguing possibility of
frustrated computer users telling their computers exactly what to do with a
simple hand gesture.
Twenty organisations, including the US navy, US medical research
laboratories and universities, have paid Dollars 10,000 (Pounds 7,142) for
research and development licences to use the BioMuse technology in various
applications. There is also considerable interest from European
organisations, some of which have bought licences. These include Volvo
Research in Sweden, Pigreco, an Italian animation company, and the
University of Barcelona.
'There is a huge number of potential applications for this technology,' says
Lloyd. 'The next step is reducing the BioMuse box to the size of a chip that
can be mass produced.'
Lloyd adds that a large Silicon Valley-based chip manufacturer is interested
in producing the BioMuse chip.
By shrinking the box's circuitry on to a chip, the BioMuse technology could
be made cheap enough for a wide number of mass market applications.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Technology: Japan keeps its shirts in shape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILL DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A shirt with a memory is the latest technological breakthrough to ease the
lives of Japan's hard-pressed salarymen.
Introduced earlier this year by two medium-sized textile groups, Tomiya
Apparel and Choya Corporation, memory shirts are designed to hold their
original pristine shape after washing, so doing away with the daily ironing.
While the rest of the clothing industry is in a downturn, memory shirts are
beating their sales targets in Tokyo department stores, the traditional
testing ground for generations of new technology products.
They are thought to be popular among salarymen who are forced to spend the
night in a city-centre hotel after long evenings at the office or drinking
beer with colleagues - both events which tend to create crumpled shirts.
The trick is a chemical which memorises structures and pulls back to its
original shape at room temperature. This means the memory shirts also shrink
less than their ordinary counterparts.
The chemical can either be baked onto the fabric - the Choya method uses a
technique developed by Nisshinbo Industries, a Japanese textiles group - or
sprayed on in gas suspension, the method used by Tomiya, based on a
technology developed by American Textile Processing.
So far the memory shirts have gone down well, despite the fact that they
cost around 20 per cent more than normal, forgetful shirts. Tomiya reports
that it had to boost its output by 30 per cent last month to cope with
demand.
Isetan, a leading Tokyo department store, has set aside a quarter of its
shirt sales space for memory shirts, which it sells for Y6,900 (Pounds 43)
in white - as favoured by most Tokyo office workers - or Y7,900 in patterned
designs.
They can be purchased more cheaply at supermarkets such as Ito-Yokado, which
was so impressed with its initial trials - at between Y3,900 and Y4,900 -
that it plans to stock them throughout its chain by mid-November.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Technology: Domain of the genes / A look at a breakthrough
in biotechnology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Roberts and Phillip Sharp helped take the nonsense out of gene
research - literally. Without their work, for which they have just jointly
been awarded the Nobel prize in medicine, much of today's biotechnological
developments would not have been possible.
The award highlighted the importance of biotechnology in medical research by
giving formal recognition to a discovery in gene structure that has yielded
new product developments in the biotechnology sector and promises to lead to
many more.
The achievement of British-born Roberts and Sharp, an American, was to
overturn the idea that genes were arranged on DNA strands in a continuous
chain. Instead, they found that genes have distinct 'domains' or gene
sequences, separated by what have been called nonsense DNA or introns.
They made the discovery simultaneously but independently in 1977 by using
electron microscopes. It is credited with speeding up the biotechnology
revolution and paving the way for gene therapy, a nascent field in which
genes are used as drugs.
Genes are arranged along strands of DNA, which contain the blueprints for
the creation of life. To reproduce itself, DNA unzips into RNA messenger
strands, carbon copies of the DNA. The RNA then invades protein molecules
and imprints them with the genetic codes for development.
The laureates' breakthrough showed that the messenger RNA edits out the
introns between the gene sequences to form a clear genetic code that can be
read by proteins, the building blocks of life.
The discovery was applied immediately to the fabrication of certain
hormones, for instance the human growth hormone used to treat dwarfism. 'It
became clear after this discovery that if you were going to express a gene
for a hormone, you'd first have to remove the nonsense sequences,' says
Sharp. The discovery also yielded clues for research into cancer and certain
hereditary diseases which occur from mistakes during the DNA copying and
editing process.
'After the study, scientists were able to study genes in the cancerous or
mutant state and compare it to the normal state,' says Roberts, a researcher
at New England Biolabs. 'Before the discovery, we did not know what the
normal state looked like.' Sharp and Roberts did their work in 1977, but
some of the possible applications of the discovery are only now being fully
explored.
'It's not just that we realised genes were divided into sequences,' says
Joseph Davie, vice-president of research at Biogen, the biotechnology group.
'We realised they had separate domains for a reason, which was that they had
different functions. One of the important things to come out of this is that
we realised we did not have to create copies of molecules just as they were
found in nature. We could split up their functions and re-arrange them to
create our own, new molecules by combining part of one gene and part of
another.'
This technology is still in its early stages, but some biotechnology groups
say they are having success. Seattle-based Immunex is developing a bone
marrow stimulant which brings two gene domains together in a single
molecule. And Biogen says it is also working with 'designer molecules' to
target cancer, inflammatory, immunological and cardiovascular diseases.
'One area we've had success in,' says Sharp, one of the founders of Biogen
and now a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 'is in
making new antibodies by combining mouse antibodies with human antibodies.
This allows some of the mouse antibodies to be used by humans.'
Since 1977, scientists have been advancing their knowledge of how genes
work. 'The reason it's taken so long since the original discovery for
companies to start getting into mixing is because first we had to know what
individual gene domains actually do,' says Davie. 'Now we can become more
sophisticated in mixing them up.'
New sophistication in gene splicing has improved research methods. 'The
'gene knockout' technique, by which you eliminate certain genes in mice, is
now used widely to create mutations which are then used in research,' says
Laurence Lasky, staff scientist at Genentech. 'That would not have been
possible without the Nobel work.'
The discovery was also fundamental to advances in the complex field of gene
therapy. 'Unless you understand how a gene is expressed, there is no hope
for gene therapy,' says Dr Sharp.
According to Hubert Shoemaker, chairman of Centocor, the work was also
important because it stressed that when the gene message gets re-processed,
it may get mixed up. 'We need to take into account the stability of the
genes we create in the field,' he explains.
Sharp and Roberts stress that their work was just one step in a revolution
of new ideas which have exploded over the last two decades.
Several important discoveries followed on the heels of the Nobel laureates'
initial work. After the notion of gene domains was established, for
instance, scientists began to consider the possibility of using RNA as an
enzyme.
'We began to see that RNA molecules have a function besides the transferring
of information,' says Shoemaker. 'They can also function as enzymes and we
may see a whole new series of drugs based on RNA as enzymes.'
Researchers also began to consider using adhesive RNA strands as inhibitors.
'We have now adopted the concept that there is a single domain on the gene
which is responsible for binding,' says Lasky. Normally, we think of
peptides and other substances as binders, but RNA portions may also be used.
If they bind to a specific site, the activity of that molecule may be
inhibited. This could be used as a drug for a number of diseases including
Aids.'
Another key development is the discovery that introns serve as moderators in
the expression of the gene sequence. 'By including introns in the expression
of a system, we can get a much more effective protein,' says Patricia
Tekamp-Olson, director of research at Chiron.
'It's very likely that they will be increasingly used as enhancers for
recombinant proteins. Another theory is that they may provide information
which makes the gene tissue specific. For instance, we may be able to use
introns to target specific tissues within the body while ignoring others.
That would be a key advance.'

FT  21 OCT 93 / People: Sir Simon retires; Hardie takes over
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The former gardening correspondent of Tatler magazine has retired. Better
known for the past 12 years as chairman of WH Smith, Sir Simon Hornby said
yesterday that he would be retiring from the helm of one of the UK's
best-known high street names, making way for Jeremy Hardie, deputy chairman
since September 1992.
Hornby's retirement at the age of 59 with effect from January 30 1994 will
coincide with other executive level changes at Smith's. Sir Malcolm Field
will become group chief executive; David Roberts will become managing
director responsible for distribution and group support services; and Peter
Troughton is to become managing director, UK retailing. He will be succeeded
as managing director, WH Smith retail, by Peter Bamford, currently president
and chief executive officer of Wee Three Record Shops, a US-based
subsidiary.
Hardie, 55, has been a director of John Swire and Sons since 1982. His
business career includes stints as chairman of the National Provident
Institution and of Alexanders Discount. He is a director of National
Mortgage Bank, William Cook and Murray Lawrence Holdings. He first joined
the board of WH Smith in 1988.
His background is solidly rooted in the academic life; following a B Phil in
Economics at Nuffield College, Oxford, he held a variety of academic posts,
was fellow and tutor in Economics at Keble College, Oxford, and has written
a number of books on economics.
Hardie was a member of the Mergers and Monopolies Commission between
1976-83, and the commission's deputy chairman during his last three years
there. He then took a stab at a political career, contesting Norwich South
for the SDP in 1983, and again for the SDP/Alliance in 1987, though without
success.
Hornby's links with WH Smith go back to 1958, when he first joined the
company. Despite giving up writing on gardening for the Tatler in 1987 - his
column lasted four years - he maintains strong interests in horticultural
affairs and is on the council of the Royal Horticultural Society.
Although retiring from Smith's, he is not relinquishing his interests in the
business world; he remains, for example, a non-executive director of
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times.

FT  21 OCT 93 / People: Lamb leaves RAM
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Lamb, a Latin American fund manager at Rothschild Asset Management,
is joining the flood of emerging market new recruits heading for Morgan
Grenfell.
However, Lamb, 36, is joining the fund management side of the business
rather than the brokerage operations. He will head a team of three covering
Latin America's emerging stock markets. Morgan Grenfell Asset Management Ltd
has about 100 fund managers worldwide with about Pounds 37bn of money under
management, out of which about Dollars 1bn is in the emerging markets
including about Dollars 200-300m in Latin American equities.
At RAM, Lamb was responsible for managing its Chile Fund and Five Arrows
Fund. MGAML says it is keen to strengthen its Latin American investment
team, and is also hoping to raise its profile in Latin America by managing
funds for local institutions and other investors.
Morgan Grenfell's Debt Arbitrage and Trading operations recently lured about
20 emerging markets equity traders, analysts and sales staff from James
Capel because it intends to complement its existing debt trading operations
by expanding in the emerging equity markets business.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising) Of soap and Scotch -
Guy de Jonquieres and Diane Summers ask if marketing skills are transferable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GU DE JONQUIERES and DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Crispin Davis last week resigned from United Distillers, Guinness'
spirits division, after only 15 months as managing director, his departure
was widely cited as proof of what most consumers already knew: that Scotch
whisky and soap suds do not go together.
Guinness says Davis left because of a personality clash. Competitors say the
hard-nosed marketing methods Davis learned in his previous career at Procter
&amp; Gamble, the world's biggest detergents manufacturer, did not fit a
business which lives by premium pricing and exclusive brand image.
Whatever finally triggered his resignation, it raises a broader question.
How easily can marketing skills be transferred between different businesses
at a time when they are more widely in demand than ever before?
As competition intensifies, companies in sectors as diverse as banking,
telecommunications, pharmaceuticals and public transport are finding -
sometimes for the first time - that learning to woo and win consumers is
essential for survival.
Peter Breen, managing partner of Heidrick &amp; Struggles, an international
executive search company, says marketing experience is now a pre-requisite
for most top-level management posts. 'Whatever the job title, marketing is a
common denominator,' he says.
Those who have taken their marketing expertise into new fields stress that
it is not a universal discipline which can be effortlessly transplanted.
Above all, it only delivers results when combined with a clear understanding
of what makes individual companies tick.
'There are certain fundamentals which can be transferred,' says John Robb,
chief executive of the pharmaceuticals group Wellcome, who cut his teeth in
consumer products marketing. 'But even if you are moving within the same
industry, you still have to learn about the company you're moving to. You
have to adjust to the new style.'
For outsiders that can be a stiff challenge. Mike Sommers, recently named
managing director of MGM Cinemas after three years as marketing director of
the TSB banking group, vividly recalls the shock of moving to retailing from
the consumer goods industry a decade ago.
'For the first month I would sit in meetings and not understand a word
anyone said. I felt like a kid who wants to play on a roundabout, and nobody
will slow down to let him on,' he says.
He and others argue that the transition can be particularly tough for
executives schooled in big consumer products manufacturers such as P&amp;G and
Mars. That may appear paradoxical, because such companies have been widely
regarded as marketing 'universities'.
However, sceptics say that their success has depended heavily on rigorous
adherence to doing the same things steadily better - an approach that can
breed inflexibility and make it hard for alumni to adapt to new corporate
cultures.
'There is a big dilemma when you take somebody who has worked in a company
with strong life-support systems and very clear rules for everything,' says
Sir James Blyth, chief executive of Boots, whose previous employers include
Mars, General Foods and Plessey.
When marketing executives from big consumer manufacturers switch
successfully to other companies, he says it is often because they got out
early or were naturally talented, rather than because of any particular
skills they brought with them.
Colin Fisher, managing director of SRU, a management consultancy with
clients including Unilever and Marks and Spencer, goes further. He says many
big consumer groups prosper mainly because they attract the brightest
graduates, not because their marketing methods are intrinsically superior.
'A lot of consumer products people emphasise the means rather than the
ends,' says Sommers. 'They forget it's all about consumers and become
obsessed with advertising and packaging. Moving to businesses which are
based on distribution or sell mainly to men can be a big wrench for them.'
But successful marketing is more than a set of techniques. It is a state of
mind which informs corporate priorities. Specialists say that the toughest
task of all is to instil it in businesses which have previously paid little
attention to customer service and consumer satisfaction.
Eurotunnel, for instance, has only just switched its attention from boring
holes in the ground to seeking passengers. It has recently recruited
executives from consumer companies including Lever Brothers and Heinz.
One of their first achievements has been to talk the board out of plans to
run an advertising campaign celebrating Eurotunnel's engineering
achievements, and to emphasise instead the services it offers.
Mercury Communications, part of Cable and Wireless, has also hired marketing
talent from the consumer products industry. Roy Doughty, director of
marketing, sales and customer service for One-2-One, Mercury's new mobile
telephone service, previously worked for Duracell, the battery maker.
'I believe we're launching a brand in the way a consumer products company
would do,' he says, although he admits that the technical complexity of
telecommunications systems means that much longer lead times are required.
Although Mercury Communications has been widely applauded for imaginative
advertising, some specialists say that marketing has yet to lay down deep
roots in its engineering-dominated culture. 'Mercury only looks good because
it is competing with BT, which doesn't even have a marketing director on its
board,' says one.
Kevin Gavaghan, former retailing executive responsible for launching
electronic banking services such as First Direct, Orchard and Vector at
Midland Bank, says that the first priority for people recruited to a company
to improve marketing is to ensure that they have support from the top.
'You have to be invited in by a sponsor who knows exactly what he is
buying,' he says. Gavaghan says he received such backing when he joined
Midland, but left because the bank's commitment to marketing dwindled after
a change of senior management.
But for Sir James Blyth, the golden rule for peripatetic marketing
executives is to be absolutely sure what they are letting themselves in for:
'If you have moved companies a couple of times, you learn to pick out those
areas where your experience is valuable. But you'd better listen very
carefully to people in your new company about exactly why it is different.'

FT  21 OCT 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Pirelli splits its
image in Europe - The Italian group is set to reposition itself in the
replacement tyre market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pirelli, the Italian tyres and cables group, has launched a new brand
strategy as part of an effort to increase its share of the European
replacement tyre market.
The move comes in the face of what Carlo Banchieri, deputy chairman of the
tyre operation's management board, calls the most difficult conditions in
his 30-year experience of the industry.
The key change for Pirelli is the introduction of what Banchieri describes
as 'second- and third-tier' brands to complement the main Pirelli brand.
These will be aimed at owners of Europe's population of cars older than
three years, looking for a cheaper deal.
The replacement sector is substantially larger than that for original
equipment tyres supplied to car and truck makers.
It is also the main source of profitability - or in some cases restricting
losses - for the industry at a time when Pirelli and other tyre makers are
being forced to digest sharp price cuts demanded by vehicle producers.
According to Banchieri, catering to the replacement market with subsidiary
brands will make it easier to retain the premium pricing and image of the
Pirelli brand name. Preserving that image has become increasingly difficult
in the replacement market.
Pirelli already owns and produces some secondary branded tyres, notably
Courier in the UK and Ceat in Italy, but they are mainly national brands.
The group's strategic sales and marketing focus have been overwhelmingly on
the Pirelli brand.
To compete in the cheaper replacement sectors, the company's practice has
been to keep in production some Pirelli-branded tyres launched as long as 10
years ago. These are likely already to have been superseded by technically
superior products, but they are relatively cheap to produce.
One problem with this approach is that the 'old' tyres have to be sold at a
discount to more recent offerings, and discounting is detrimental to
Pirelli's image. For this reason though the discounts have not been
sufficient to give what Banchieri regards as an adequate market share.
By developing a pan-European secondary brands strategy, Pirelli is doing no
more than recognising that European replacement tyre markets are starting to
move towards the North American pattern.
In the latter there is not only a profusion of tyre makers' second- or
third-tier brands such as Goodyear's Kelly Springfield; large retailing
groups and even the big oil companies sell vast quantities of tyres under
their own brand names.
For example, the world's single biggest retailer of tyres is superstore
chain Sears, Roebuck, which sells some 10m a year.
A lot of Pirelli tyres are sold through Sears, supplied by its US Armstrong
Tire subsidiary.
Far from pioneering second- or third-tier brands in Europe, Pirelli is to
some extent following the path already taken by rivals such as Michelin with
its Kleber brand and Continental with Uniroyal Semperit. More than 20 per
cent of Michelin's sales are of 'house' brands. Of German rival
Continental's 100-strong product range, only a little more than a half are
branded Continental.
Banchieri acknowledges that the initiative will probably be confined to the
cheaper end of the market. 'I cannot imagine a Porsche with second-level
tyres,' he says. But owners of, for example, five- or six-year-old BMWs are
targets.
Pirelli hopes to increase its share of the European replacement tyre market
to around 13 1/2 per cent, from just over 10 per cent.
Conversely, says Banchieri, it has been ready to cede some unprofitable
business in the original equipment sector. Banchieri says it is also likely
to settle at around 13.5 per cent, against 16 per cent a couple of years
ago.
Between clashes with former employer General Motors, Jose Ignacio Lopez de
Arriortua has just helped Pirelli most of the way there.
Unwilling to go along with price-cuts demanded by Volkswagen's mercurial and
flamboyant Spanish production and purchasing director, Pirelli has lost its
original equipment business with Volkswagen, although ironically it is still
supplying its Spanish subsidiary Seat. That means a further 0.3-0.4
percentage points loss of original equipment market share.
In another departure from past practice, Pirelli is to cut the time-scale
for introducing the complete size range for new generations of tyres from
two years to 3-4 months.
Traditionally, Pirelli and other manufacturers have synchronised the launch
of a tyre with the car for which it was developed, and only in the size
range applicable to that car. Other sizes would be phased in over two years.
'This was acceptable at a time when life cycles of the product were long -
maybe seven or eight years. But it was not best practice,' says Banchieri.
The Pirelli name will be applied only to state-of-the-art products. Existing
older ones will be phased out.
At least two new Pirelli branded tyres will be introduced each year for the
next few years.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Accountancy Column: Time is running out for improving
relations - Agreement is still far off in the merger talks between the
professional bodies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Time is running out for a secretive series of discussions between the
principal UK and Irish accountancy bodies. Regardless of the outcome, the
clock may also be ticking for the very future of these bodies themselves.
At several gatherings on the relatively neutral territory of KPMG Peat
Marwick's Salisbury Square offices in London, senior representatives of the
six leading professional bodies have been trying to find some common ground
over the last few months.
Top elected officials and secretariat staff have come together from the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of Scotland, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
Ireland, the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, the Chartered
Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa), and the Chartered
Institute of Management Accountants (Cima).
The chairman of this working party is David Bishop, a partner in the
management consultancy practice of KPMG, and the immediate past president of
the Certifieds. His specialism is change management. This job is probably
the hardest he has ever taken on.
It is an unusually powerful gathering. The names of the different
organisations are hard to squeeze into a single paragraph. Their combined
membership is about 200,000. And the amount of time and effort put in by
their senior figures to collaborate is probably unprecedented.
But it may all be wasted. Fundamental questions still divide many of those
assembled round the table. And they have just one more meeting next week
before producing in mid-November a final report from the incompatible
proposals in the draft discussion documents now circulating.
What is most remarkable to any outsider who cares to take an interest is
that there are so many professional accountancy bodies; and that there has
been no significant merger since 1957, when the Society of Incorporated
Accountants merged with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England
and Wales.
Since that time, there have certainly been some bloody attempts. All have
failed. The Scots spurned combination with the English institute in 1989,
partly from fear of being subsumed by a Sassanach body. Discussions between
the English and the certifieds in 1988 and Cipfa in 1990 also foundered.
Most painful was the 1970 attempt between the certifieds and the English
institute. Its failure led to the creation of the cumbersome Consultative
Committee of Accountancy Bodies (CCAB), nominally representing the six
organisations, but staffed and chaired by the English institute, which also
dominates CCAB's representation on international bodies.
Ever since a gulf has opened up, widened by new, alien forms of training -
such as masters of business administration - poaching recruits who would
have traditionally become accountants; and by growing competition between
the bodies in marketing their qualifications in this country and overseas.
As a result, it should come as no surprise that the original timetable, in
which the Bishop working party was to report back in July, has been delayed.
It has been only through careful diplomacy that all the participants have
remained around the table up till now. It would be nothing short of a
miracle if they emerged in agreement at the end of this month.
Two principal models are up for discussion. The first is rationalisation:
combining the different bodies while supposedly preserving their different
strengths. It is the approach favoured by the English institute, which
argues for fewer bodies in the public and members' interests. It is
apparently endorsed by Cima, but would probably require separate regional
bodies for Scotland and Ireland.
The second model is harmonisation: to increase co-operation while
maintaining separate identities. The Scots maintain their reservations about
being swallowed up and turned into a regional administrative body with
control in London. Their traditional ability to be flexible would be lost.
The other bodies also have serious doubts about how effective full-scale
merger would be in the short-term, and would prefer to move in that
direction more slowly. As a result, there is a complex array of intermediate
approaches, with closer involvement on issues such as training, ethics,
discipline and international affairs, while the governing bodies remain
separate or delegate some partial authority to an over-arching body.
But these debates have become a sideshow to what many see as the main
motivation behind the discussions: the destruction by the English institute
of the certifieds. There is growing disillusionment with the way the process
has been handled.
At its crudest, this is a class issue: the smooth old-school ties of the
chartered accountants who moved through university and
training-while-earning with accountancy firms, against the more aggressive,
opportunity-seeking bovver boys who often had to fight much harder to gain
chances to train.
It is reflected in a snobbishness in some quarters about the perceived need
to maintain the value of the chartered accountancy qualification. But that
attitude has also led to the complacency from which the English institute is
now suffering.
The certifieds have seen their reputation, student numbers and financial
strength grow in recent years, both in the UK and overseas. Travel to
eastern Europe, China and even some accountancy firms in Britain, and their
qualification has become the one of choice.
As their own enrollment has dropped off, the chartereds have jealously
fought back, though not entirely successfully. They began a programme of
training outside public practice, though just a few dozen have taken up the
idea. They have launched a foundation headed by a former ambassador to
provide assistance in eastern Europe. There is a review of training under
way, reflecting the need for far greater flexibility in both subject matter
and how training is structured.
The indications are that the English institute has no interest in merging
with the certifieds except on extremely dominant terms. What some believe it
wants to do is to take on the association, either by swallowing it entirely
or merging with other professional bodies so it can attempt to defeat it in
head-on competition.
Critics point to efforts at the CCAB by the English institute to steamroller
through rationalisation as a topic for discussion; and to conduct market
research on members of the bodies with questions deliberately phrased to
elicit responses suggesting rationalisation as the only answer.
There are certainly legitimate points for debate about the certifieds: the
nature of the exams, how they are marked, how often people are allowed to
re-take them and still qualify, and so on.
Equally, there are arguments about the sustainibility of the Scottish and
Irish bodies as separate entities, and about the nature of the qualification
at Cipfa, which focuses on a sector in flux. None of the bodies can claim
anything like perfection in the services they provide. Combining any of them
would require careful compromise.
There also is a more fundamental question about whether accountancy is truly
a cohesive profession with a core that can be accommodated in a single body
or set of exams.
But the arrogant atmosphere that many of the bodies seem to be detecting in
the current discussions is not conducive to constructive resolutions. A
change in this attitude is necessary if anything in the public and members'
interests is to emerge.

FT  21 OCT 93 / What if the Bank of England gains more autonomy?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANGES would have to be made to the top management structure of the Bank of
England if it gained more autonomy to ensure that its governor did not have
too much power over interest rate changes, a former senior bank official
said yesterday, Peter Norman writes.
Sir George Blunden, the deputy governor of the Bank between 1986 and 1990,
told the Commons Treasury and civil service committee that, if the Bank were
given more autonomy over interest rates, there would be a narrower range of
advice ahead of decisions to change monetary policy.
The governor of a more autonomous Bank would also have more power than his
counterparts in the US or Germany so that an extra check would have to be
introduced to limit the governor's power.
Sir George's testimony against greater independence for the Bank clearly
surprised the committee.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Arrogant Welsh agency is humbled: How the WDA's new chief
aims to restore the organisation's reputation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF ONE word sums up the ethos of the Welsh Development Agency in the past
few years, it is arrogance.
The tone was set by Dr Gwyn Jones, its chairman until July. In his last
annual report he did not even refer to the Commons public accounts committee
inquiry into the agency's 1991-92 accounts. The consequence of that inquiry
came this week when Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, apologised for what
the MPs had described as 'a catalogue of serious and inexcusable breaches of
expected standards of control and accountability'.
At the WDA, heads have rolled as the new chairman, Mr David Rowe-Beddoe,
sets about putting the house in order.
Dr Jones was only 39 and had run a Swansea software business when he was
appointed chairman in 1988 by Lord Walker, then Welsh secretary. A strong
personality, Dr Jones, who is now BBC governor for Wales, raised the profile
of the agency which helped to transform the image of Wales from a land of
steel mills and coal tips to one where high-technology companies flourish.
The agency is admired even by its critics for its success in attracting
inward investment, for land reclamation, and for its role in urban
regeneration. Mr Redwood told the Commons it was easy to look only at the
criticisms and to neglect the WDA's 'very real achievements'.
While Dr Jones played the role of travelling super-salesman, his dominating
influence inculcated a mentality within the WDA that this was a style to be
imitated. Some of the practices that occurred under Mr David Waterstone, who
was chief executive until 1990, and then under Mr Philip Head, who resigned
this week, might have attracted little attention in the private sector, but
were not acceptable in a government-funded agency accountable to parliament.
The practices included a loss of Pounds 1.4m on an unauthorised redundancy
scheme for 127 staff; a retirement package of Pounds 228,000 for an
international director, which was preceded by eight months of 'gardening
leave'; free private motoring for senior executives; an apparent attempt to
conceal a so-called Operation Wizard, in which large fees were paid to
consultants to consider partial privatisation; and the appointment of Mr
Neil Smith as marketing director. He was a fraudster whose bogus credentials
were not checked.
There were other matters which made the WDA look like 'a cosy club with jobs
for the boys'. Too many people were promoted because they were long-serving.
At a senior level, Dr Jones became a director of Tesco, while Mr David
Malpas, Tesco's managing director, sat on the WDA board. Although an
independent investigation into a land deal involving a Tesco subsidiary
found no conflict of interest, Dr Jones's directorship hardly looked
appropriate.
One of the recommendations made this week by the inquiry panel set up by Mr
Rowe-Beddoe, was that board members should discuss any invitations for
outside appointments.
Now some senior staff have paid the price. Mr Head has resigned. The
executive director in charge of managing the budget, Mr Michael Henry, has
been dismissed. Mr Ian Rooks, the executive director for marketing, has been
demoted. Another senior executive, Mr Alun Daniel, has been reprimanded.
Mr Rowe-Beddoe, an international businessman, has already impressed
observers. He seems to have been surprised by the WDA's combination of
arrogance on the one hand and cumbersome civil service attitudes on the
other. He is adopting all the 43 recommendations of his inquiry panel. In
addition, he is carrying out a thorough review of the management structure.
Meanwhile, the Welsh Office, which was castigated by the public accounts
committee for lack of supervision, is tightening its monitoring of the
non-departmental public bodies.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Banks warned on lending policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH STREET banks should be more open about their methods of deciding
whether to lend to small businesses, Mr Pen Kent, an associate director of
the Bank of England, said yesterday.
Mr Kent, the Bank director in charge of guiding relations between banks and
industry, also said banks could be moving lending managers too frequently
for them to build relationships with small companies.
Mr Kent said banks should question a number of their practices as part of an
effort to improve communication. He said small companies should also make
more effort to provide potential backers with financial information.
He described short-term bank loans and overdraft finance on which many small
companies have relied as often 'entirely inappropriate' and said this
encouraged the wrong sort of relationship between banks and companies.
Mr Kent said banks should question 'whether they could be more open in what
they are looking for when assessing proposals', and whether they could help
companies avoid refusal or withdrawal of credit facilities. He said that
financing options, rather than overdrafts, needed 'to be explored more
systematically'. Banks were becoming more aware that they should offer
finance 'packages' with different sorts of facilities.
Mr Kent's remarks follow criticism by some small business organisations that
banks' methods of deciding whether or not to offer loans and their terms are
not understood by many borrowers.
However, Mr Kent said he believed many banks were correctly starting to
place more emphasis on cashflow and the state of the on-going business in
lending decisions rather than relying on the value of the underlying asset.
He said that the difficulties between banks and small businesses were part
of a wider problem of 'a lack of information and inadequate communication'
between British companies and financial institutions.
It was particularly important that the recovery of small business activity
was not hindered by lack of funds.

DIRECT LINE, the telephone-based motor insurance subsidiary of Royal Bank of
Scotland, yesterday announced the creation of 400 jobs in Leeds within a
year through the opening of a fifth regional operations centre in December.
The company, which also offers household insurance, has been growing rapidly
since its launch in 1985. It has nearly doubled the number of its motor
insurance customers to 1.25m during the past year.
Direct Line said yesterday that it expected to recruit 400 people to service
customers in the Yorkshire area and the north-east. Moreover, the new Leeds
property has the capacity to hold 900 people.
The company, which is based in Croydon, Surrey, employs 1,900 in Croydon,
Glasgow, Manchester and Birmingham.
Mr Peter Wood, chief executive, said that the growth in customers in the
north meant that it now needed more than one regional office there. Jobs
would include telephone sales and claims-handling positions.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GROWTH in Welsh exports has slowed sharply, the latest quarterly survey
by the Wales Chamber of Commerce showed yesterday.
The number of manufacturers showing an increase in export sales dropped from
42 per cent in the previous quarter to 32 per cent, while the number seeing
a decline increased from 19 per cent to 27 per cent.
The service sector reported a similar reversal.
The first projects for a Pounds 350m a year programme to regenerate the
south Wales valleys were announced yesterday by Mr John Redwood, Welsh
secretary. It is the second five-year programme for the valleys. Spending on
the programme totalled Pounds 773m.

THE GOVERNMENT said yesterday that it would not relent over its refusal to
grant British citizenship to some 7,000 people from non-Chinese ethnic
minorities in Hong Kong in spite of the Lords defeat it suffered on the
issue in July.
Earl Ferrers, a Home Office minister, told peers the government had given
'very careful consideration' to the matter, but had no plans to introduce
fresh legislation.
Lord Bonham-Carter, the Liberal Democrat peer who spearheaded the earlier
defeat, said that he thought the government's response was 'deeply
unsatisfactory'.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Sellafield child cancer link found
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPREHENSIVE study by the Health and Safety Executive of leukaemia in
children whose fathers worked at the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant
in Cumbria has found a 'weak' historical link between radiation exposure and
cancer.
The HSE said the study 'did provide some weak support for the associations .
. . between pre-conception radiation dose to the fathers and the risk of
leukaemia in their children'.
The executive said the excess leukaemia cases were confined almost entirely
to the children of men who started work at Sellafield before 1965, when
workplace exposures were more than five times higher than today.
'There is no need for preventive action to protect the health of the
Sellafield workforce other than the measures in place,' said Mr Eddie
Varney, deputy chief inspector of nuclear installations.
The report was published yesterday, two weeks after the conclusion of a High
Court test case in which British Nuclear Fuels, Sellafield's operator, was
cleared of causing leukaemia in two children through their fathers'
radiation exposure. The judge said there was insufficient scientific
evidence for such a link.
Mr Martyn Day, the families' solicitor, said the report would provide 'very
strong grounds' for an appeal, which is under consideration. But he was
'concerned about the very negative interpretation which the HSE is putting
on its own findings'.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Lloyd's management buoyant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST NIGHT'S clear decision by Names was a vote of confidence in Lloyd's
management.
It represents a resounding success for the two men at the top - Mr David
Rowland, the market's chairman, and Mr Peter Middleton, its chief executive
 -both of whom were appointed from the outside.
Mr Middleton in particular was in ebullient mood after the results of the
ballot were announced, describing the result as the 'worst news for Lloyd's
competitors in two years'. He added: 'It is time to let loose some serious
commercial aggression.'
Mr Rowland, who looked relaxed and buoyant throughout yesterday afternoon's
two-hour meeting, clearly believes the tide has turned in Lloyd's favour
after three years of crisis: 'Back in January it seemed inconceivable we
could be in the position we are in today.'
Mr Rowland conceded that the string of difficulties faced by Lloyd's was
eroding the confidence not just of the Names who have supplied its capital,
but of insurance buyers and brokers who provide it with billions of pounds
of premium income.
But he stressed to Names yesterday the importance of moving quickly to
capitalise on investor interest in the market. 'In building businesses you
just have to take your chances when they come,' he said.
Mr Rowland has had a long association with the Lloyd's market, heading up
some of London's most successful insurance broking operations before
becoming chairman of Sedgwick in the late 1980s.
He has played a critical role in the market's evolution during the past 2
1/2 years. In 1991 he chaired a taskforce of market professionals whose
recommendations paved the way for a series of reforms and the transformation
of the market's capital base.
When he was elected chairman in January this year, Mr Rowland was able to
lend weight to the efforts of Mr Peter Middleton to introduce greater
professionalism and modernisation to the market.
The blunt and hard-headed Mr Middleton, a former monk and diplomat who was
appointed chief executive of Lloyd's in September last year, has begun to
change the culture at Lloyd's. He has started to transform it from a
sluggish bureaucracy into a more streamlined business designed to give
greater direction and coherence to the fragmented insurance agency
businesses which make up the market.
In April the two men drafted a business plan designed to cut costs and make
business processes at Lloyd's more efficient. They have now succeeded -
against what has seemed an impossible deadline - in introducing the new
corporate investment rules.
Judging by the interest claimed from leading merchant banks and securities
houses, they have also managed to assuage the doubts of potential investors.
All this has been accomplished against the background of escalating legal
actions by lossmaking Names, seeking compensation for losses incurred in
1988, 1989 and 1990, and periodic waves of adverse publicity - which, in Mr
Middleton's words, have put Lloyd's on the 'back foot'.
Mr Rowland admits there is still 'a long way to go'. Before the end of the
year Lloyd's is committed to offering its worst-hit Names an out-of-court
settlement to their legal actions, for which it has limited financial means.
The market faces massive technical difficulties in transferring billions of
pounds in old insurance liabilities into a new company.
It must also ensure that the current wall of capital seeking to enter the
market is not allowed to undermine discipline and lead to a resumption of
the intense rate competition on premiums, which eventually helped plunge the
market into losses.
But for the moment Mr Rowland and Mr Middleton appear to have rediscovered a
fragile commodity which many feared Lloyd's had lost for ever: confidence.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Rebel Names were resigned to defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISSIDENT Lloyd's Names reacted with resigned acceptance last night to their
heavy defeat in attempts to delay and oppose the introduction of corporate
capital into the insurance market.
They expressed only mild surprise at the results. They had been determined
to pursue their objections to the ballot box - in spite of knowing that they
would be defeated by the large number of proxies held by Mr David Rowland,
the chairman.
Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Names Action Group, which
opposed the Lloyd's resolutions, said: 'We got more votes than I expected. I
thought we had some kind of chance. But when we moved for the adjournment we
knew we were going to lose.
'The fundamental reason is that Names are terrified. For the moment all they
have to cling on to is a belief in Peter Middleton.'
Mr Christopher Stockwell, chairman of the Lloyd's Names associations'
working party, said: 'It was extremely predictable. We knew from our
predictions this would happen weeks ago. But we felt a very large number of
people wanted to put on record their feelings that the time was not
correct.'
The extraordinary general meeting attracted a relatively small number of
dissident Names, and Mr Rowland sometimes struggled to find speakers to
oppose his proposals and maintain a balanced debate.
Just half-a-dozen speakers raised critical points, although others could not
resist asking questions outside the remit of the meeting, including demands
to know when a settlement with lossmaking Names would be agreed and when
their allegations of fraud would be answered.
Mr Stockwell, opening the speeches from the floor after Mr Rowland's
introduction, said: 'Most (Names he represented) believe the society should
have reached a settlement of the disputes within it before it attempted to
decide whether or not the terms for the admission of corporate capital are
fair . . . We believe the council has got the cart before the horse.'
He stressed that most of those he spoke for approved of corporate capital.
However, he added it was 'the tactics, terms and timing that have been in
dispute'.
Ms Sally Knowle, another lossmaking Name, said: 'We won't go away. We will
fight for justice and for truth. If those jumping on to the corporate
capital bandwagon have to pay for the sins of the past, so be it.'
Mr Rowland told Names it would be 'a pointless disruption' to insist on an
adjournment to propose delaying the vote on introducing corporate capital.
He stressed that he commanded roughly 13,000 of the 19,000 proxy votes
allocated and was bound to win.
But the Names insisted - holding up discussion for about 30 minutes, before
contributing modestly to the debate on the seven motions proposed by Lloyd's
at which they were heavily defeated.
Mr Deeny said after the vote: 'What is being done today is bad for
individual Names. It is not in our best interests. I think it is very sad to
see Lloyd's going down the road of gigantism. The market isn't about size,
it's about profitability. They would do much better to turn people away.'
His objections during the debate had focused on the danger of introducing
excess capacity to the market, and not on issues of compensation for
lossmaking Names.
'There is a separate war on compensation,' he said. 'And that is a war we
are going to win.'
Mr John Rew, a leading dissident Name and co-editor of Chatset's league
tables of Lloyd's performance, said he voted to adjourn the motions, and
abstained in the motions on the introduction of corporate capital.
'I'm not terribly against corporate capital but it takes the pressure off
Lloyd's,' he said. 'I felt on balance that it's a pity that corporate
capital was brought through. It would do Lloyd's no harm to suspend a
decision on its introduction.'

FT  21 OCT 93 / Bankers seek a path through tricky woodlands issue: The
opposition and obstacles to privatisation of Forestry Commission property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TEAM from London merchant bankers Samuel Montagu has until the end of this
week to finish a crash course on one of the trickiest privatisation
questions in Britain and present its recommendations to the government.
The bankers have to advise a government review group about the commercial
feasibility of ways in which the woodlands owned by the Forestry Commission
might be privatised. It was given only six weeks to present its first
report.
The Montagu team is looking at Forest Enterprise, the commercial arm of the
commission. It owns about 2m acres of forest, ranging from big commercial
plantations of Sitka spruce in Scotland to historic woodlands such as the
New Forest.
Forest Enterprise harvests mature timber which it sells to the large paper
and board mills in which foreign companies have invested about Pounds 1bn in
the last decade. It also looks after woods where growing numbers of people
walk or ride mountain bikes. Its timber sales are about Pounds 75m a year.
Last spring the government asked a committee of civil servants from several
ministries to consider the future of Forest Enterprise as part of a review
of forestry policy. Samuel Montagu has been called in to look at the
commercial viability of three options:
Selling Forest Enterprise and all its properties to the private sector.
Finding other ways of bringing private-sector methods and private ownership
into the organisation. Leaving it as it is and continuing piecemeal sales of
woodland.
The privatisation of Forest Enterprise has long been desired by Tory
rightwingers, anxious to reduce the state's role. But it would bring in
little money for the Treasury (perhaps less than Pounds 1bn) and has few
supporters.
Important opponents are the wood processors, who range from the big
sawmillers to the Finnish-owned Caledonian Paper of Irvine, Ayrshire, which
daily turns 800-900 tonnes of fresh timber into paper.
Caledonian Paper has a 10-year contract until 1999 with Forest Enterprise to
supply 50 per cent of its timber. It says private-sector suppliers are small
and unreliable, and wants to be sure of a guaranteed supply when it decides
whether to double its capacity.
Perhaps more surprisingly, the private-sector timber growers who might be
expected to welcome the possibility of buying Forest Enterprise's woodlands
are also opposed. Their organisation, Timber Growers UK, says that to sell
Forest Enterprise now while the timber and land markets are depressed would
mean selling it too cheaply, and divert investment from planting.
Environmental organisations and walkers' groups such as the Ramblers
Association are critics of privatisation, fearing that it would reverse the
trend whereby forestry has become more sympathetic to environmental concerns
and threaten the public's 'right to roam'.
The Forestry Commission, a government department under the Scottish, Welsh
and agriculture ministries, does not wish to be privatised. Having only last
year split itself between Forest Enterprise and the regulatory Forest
Authority, it would like more time to make the new structure work.
Among the few strong advocates of privatisation are forestry investment
managers, such as Tilhill Economic Forestry, which manage other people's
woodland. They believe it is time the state withdrew from forestry and
stopped competing with their clients.
The Forestry Industry Committee of Great Britain represents the whole
industry, from wood processors to timber growers and professional bodies. It
opposes privatisation. 'Forest Enterprise is not in a fit state to
privatise,' says Mr Ronnie Williams, its chief executive.
He believes that with a government majority in the Commons of only 17,
outright privatisation is politically unfeasible. But he adds: 'We have to
accept that something's going to be done.'
FICGB's priority is to see Forest Enterprise run as if it were a
private-sector company. It says the organisation's woodlands should be
rationalised, with historic forests and nature reserves that would never be
suitable for private ownership going to a separate national organisation.
Whatever the Samuel Montagu team recommends, the real debate will take place
in government when it considers the review group's conclusions in the new
year. Ministers are divided. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, is thought to
oppose outright privatisation; Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, has long
advocated it; Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, is
sympathetic to the idea.
As one person close to the review says: 'If the Forest Enterprise were easy
to privatise it would have been done long ago.'

FT  21 OCT 93 / Starting gun is fired in the race to raise equity capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS OF last night's vote sounded like a shot from the starter's gun for
corporate financiers racing to raise equity capital for Lloyd's.
Sir Laurie Magnus, head of corporate finance at Samuel Montagu, breathed a
sigh of relief before settling down to apply the final touches to a
pathfinder prospectus for the Pounds 280m-Pounds 300m London Insurance
Market Investment Trust, whose release was planned for 7.30am today.
'If the vote had gone the wrong way I'd have been heading off for the
Antarctic,' said Sir Laurie. But the Lloyd's team at Samuel Montagu, and
James Capel, the other Hongkong and Shanghai Bank subsidiary involved in the
scheme, are keeping their champagne on ice until the trust is fully
underwritten early next month.
Sir Laurie is competing with other investment companies and trust schemes
for equity funds from both corporate and retail investors.
Already 16 merchant banks and securities houses have announced plans to
raise more than Pounds 1.1bn in capital and a number of other sizeable
initiatives are in the pipeline.
Four groups had issued pathfinder prospectuses, the documents used to market
shares, before yesterday's vote. BZW is linking with CLM Advisers, a
subsidiary of the Sedgwick group, to back a Pounds 200m investment trust,
CLM Insurance Fund. UBS has joined forces with Grimston Investments and
Conning &amp; Company to launch a Pounds 100m scheme, while Roberts &amp; Hiscox,
one of the most successful Lloyd's agents, has backing from Charterhouse
Tilney for a smaller Pounds 28.9m trust.
Allied Provincial Securities is backing Johnson Fry, the financial services
group, which aims to launch a scheme to specialise in the shares of other
Lloyd's investment trusts, an initiative underlining confidence in the
eventual birth of a new stock-market sector.
The biggest difficulty facing the new investors may be obtaining sufficient
space on the most successful Lloyd's syndicates, many of whom now have more
capital than they can use.
Sir Laurie, who has been working on the trust scheme for most of this year,
says he has legally binding commitments for Pounds 480m of capacity from 98
syndicates.

GPT, the UK-based telecommunications manufacturing joint venture between GEC
and Siemens, has won a contract worth about Pounds 10m to supply exchanges
to Southwestern Bell for its UK cable telephone network, Andrew Adonis
writes.
The order is for up to 10 System X digital telephone exchanges. Southwestern
Bell, the regional US operator, is building networks in seven urban areas,
including Liverpool, central Lancashire, Telford and Wigan, with Cox Cable
Communications.
Southwestern Bell is the third largest cable TV and telephone operator in
the UK, behind Nynex and Telewest. Its seven franchises cover about 1.2m
homes. Most cable operators are installing their own switching equipment.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Farmers are told they may face same fate as miners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FARMING industry stands 'on the edge of a precipice' and could face the
same fate as the miners if public pressure forces cuts in subsidies,
landowners and farmers were warned yesterday.
Subsidies to farmers amounted to more than Pounds 2bn a year and were set to
rise to Pounds 2.6bn by 1995, said Mr Peter Pemberton, partner in Bidwells,
the chartered surveyors and farm business consultants. He said that level
was unsustainable when the industry accounted for less than 2 per cent of
the working population,
Addressing a Country Landowners' Association conference in Elveden, Suffolk,
on the future of farming, Mr Pemberton said there would be 'a barrage of
criticism' when farmers received large compensation cheques this autumn for
cuts in price supports and for taking land out of production under Common
Agricultural Policy reforms.
'We are heavily subsidised, politically unimportant and, rightly or wrongly,
unpopular,' he said. 'It is important to understand what can happen when the
country's good will and the government's support is lost. We can go the same
way as the miners.'
Even if subsidies did not disappear, they might become conditional on
farmers protecting the countryside and allowing public access, he said.
Mr John Kerr, who owns a 1,700-acre farm in Suffolk, said farmers had to cut
all unnecessary costs to guarantee efficient production.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Burnham Beeches declared a nature reserve
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BURNHAM BEECHES, an ancient wood in Buckinghamshire which borders
Dorneywood, the traditional country home of the chancellor of the exchequer
 -and has inspired composers and poets - has been declared a national nature
reserve.
As well as soothing the pre-Budget nerves of chancellors, the wood inspired
parts of Mendelssohn's famous music for Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's
Dream and also Thomas Gray's Elegy.
Burnham Beeches is recorded in the Domesday Book. The woodland includes a
450-year-old pollarded beech tree. It is owned by the Corporation of London.
The Corporation of London has reintroduced traditional management techniques
during the past 10 years in an attempt to encourage rare flora and fauna.
The woodland pasture is grazed by traditional breeds such as Berkshire pigs,
British White cattle and Exmoor ponies.
The corporation's work was praised by English Nature, the government's
statutory adviser on nature conservation, which designated the wood a
national reserve.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Renovated fish market reopens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASSOCIATED British Ports will today officially open England's largest fresh
fish auction market after a Pounds 300,000 investment programme to bring it
up to new European Community standards, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes. The
government has met about 20 per cent of the cost.
The market - a 60,000 sq ft group of covered sheds - handles 50,000 tonnes
of fish a year. The development has given Hull an edge over Grimsby,
traditionally one of Britain's pre-eminent fishing ports, which lies across
the Humber on the south bank of the estuary.
Grimsby, which - like Hull - is owned by ABP, is having to spend more than
Pounds 8m to rebuild its fish auction sheds to meet the new standards.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Political Notebook: The real threat to Mr Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS Mr John Major's critics on the right of the Tory party who grab the
headlines. It is his once-natural but now disgruntled allies on the centre
and the left who will decide his future.
Conservative MPs have returned to Westminster in sullen rather than
rebellious mood. Renewed unease over the imposition of value added tax on
domestic fuel and coal industry closures and the risk of a Commons revolt
over rail privatisation provide a warning of further storms ahead.
For the time being though the prime minister's most vocal rightwing
opponents have taken their lead from Baroness Thatcher.
The 'One of Us' rhetoric of the party's Blackpool conference has persuaded
them that Mr Major is at least a partial prisoner of his predecessor's
ideology.
They agree with Lady Thatcher that to sink him now would merely hand the
game to the altogether less malleable Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor.
This conditional, and often disdainful, loyalty from the irreconcilables has
been strengthened by the mood of constituency activists. More than one rebel
MP has been told in no uncertain terms by his local association that further
disloyalty may result in de-selection.
Then there are the forthcoming elections to the party's backbench committees
at Westminster. Last year the rightwing swept the board, winning virtually
all the main posts on the 1922 Committee and the executive of the finance
committee.
Many of them subsequently defied the government over the Maastricht treaty
and have also campaigned vocifer-ously against tax increases.
The threat of a counter-coup from government loyalists in the annual
elections which follow next month's Queen's Speech has persuaded them of the
wisdom of a period of relative silence.
The expectation is that Mr Major will quietly discourage a left/right battle
for the committee jobs. In return the right will give tacit support to a
modest package of tax increases in the Budget next month.
So the prime minister, who resumed this week the 'back to basics' theme of
his party conference speech, believes he has bought himself a breathing
space.
There is a price. The most striking feature of the post-holiday gossip in
the lobbies and bars of Westminster this week has been the vehemence of the
attacks on Mr Major from the centre and the left of the party.
The rhetoric of the conference has left a sour taste in the mouths of those
on the Tory backbenches - and in his government - who have consistently
backed Mr Major's approach to Europe, the economy and the welfare state.
Mr Peter Lilley is a particular target. He is accused, even by one or two of
his cabinet colleagues, of exploiting the prime minister's weakness to evade
the rules of collective responsibility.
Friends of the social security secretary deny he is disloyal. Mr Major is
said to have congratulated him personally on his controversial conference
speech. They do not dispute though that as one of the so-called 'bastards'
in the cabinet he is vociferous in pressing a Thatcherite agenda.
The important point though is that Mr Major is being accused by his natural
supporters of abandoning friends in order to appease his enemies. If he has
become a prisoner of the right, why should the centre-left support him?
The question overstates the shift over the past few weeks. The rhetoric may
have a Thatcherite edge but the important people in Mr Major's government -
Mr Douglas Hurd, Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr Clarke - have not abandoned
their commitment to one-nation Toryism.
Perception, however, often counts as much as reality in politics. In the
rough months ahead a truce with his party's Thatcherite right will not be
enough to restore Mr Major's political authority.
To negotiate the inevitable political rows over rail and coal privatisation,
over the Conservative manifesto for the European elections and over higher
taxes, he will need enthusiastic support on the backbenches. For now he has
lost it.
The talk of a prime minister 'on probation' is being heard on the left as
well as the right.
Ministers have joined those who are ready to admit they would find it
difficult to support Mr Major if the government suffered a bad defeat in
next summer's European and local elections. They wince every time they hear
Lady Thatcher congratulate him on his rediscovery of her brand of
Conservatism.
Mr Major may need, for the time being, the quiescence of the Tory right. But
if he does not represent the silent majority on the Tory backbenches he does
not represent anyone. It was they, after all, who got rid of Lady Thatcher.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Engineering chief reopens attack on Treasury policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treasury was again attacked yesterday by Mr Neil Johnson,
director-general of the Engineering Employers Federation, for being
'isolated from the real world' and 'not too knowledgeable about wealth
creation'.
Speaking to a conference on manufacturing organised jointly by the
federation and the AEEU engineering and electrical union, he complained that
Britain continued to have 'an overwhelmingly anti-industrial culture'.
Mr Johnson, who is to leave the federation at the end of the year, first
attacked the Treasury last week.
Yesterday he said the lack of a 'national industrial strategy' was the
'missing link'. He added: 'Industry and government, with which I include the
opposition parties, must navigate by the same map, agree key strategic
goals, share mutual objectives.'
He argued that people were enjoying living standards higher than the country
had the capacity to support.
He also called on the chancellor to introduce a Budget for an investment-led
recovery, with a shift in resources from consumption through restrictions on
household demand and public spending until industrial capacity had been
rebuilt.
Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU, said the 'green shoots of recovery'
had been 'caught by an early frost'. He called for long-term, quality skills
training at all levels with all new manufacturing employees given training
to national vocational qualification level 2.
He said there should be worker representation for individual and collective
grievances to be embodied in law.
He said: 'The present position makes a mockery of the assertion of
individual rights at work.
'As long as we have the position where employee rights to representation and
union recognition can only be guaranteed by the exercise of industrial
muscle, you have the permanent seeds of industrial unrest and uncertainty.'
Mr Jordan added: 'British managers with British unionised workforces that
had the courage to take on the total package of new manufacturing techniques
are transforming their companies.'

FT  21 OCT 93 / Building societies end run of net outflows: Mortgages lead
lending growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MODEST net inflow of retail funds to building societies in September has
ended the run of net outflows suffered by them in the three previous months,
when savers withdrew money to spend on holidays, L-registration cars and BT3
 -the final sale of shares in British Telecom.
But the figures released yesterday by the Building Societies Association
also underlined the severity of the competition facing the societies for
savings and for mortgage lending.
New commitments from borrowers taking out mortgage loans with societies rose
slightly to Pounds 2.6bn in September from Pounds 2.4bn in August, but the
BSA said that societies were still losing market share to the banks, largely
because of the banks' fixed-rate mortgages.
This picture was confirmed by the statistics from the British Bankers'
Association, which showed banks' mortgage lending rising by Pounds 951m in
September, after an increase of Pounds 800m in August.
The net receipts to building societies of Pounds 124m in September compare
with net outflows from society savings accounts in August of Pounds 132m. In
the third quarter as a whole, there has been a net outflow of Pounds 69m.
The BSA said there was still very tough competition for savings, and
highlighted unit trusts in particular.
Mr Bob Pannell, an economist at the BSA, said that because there was not a
great demand for mortgages at present, building societies' main concern was
to maintain the existing pool of savings.
Though the figure for net new commitments was notably higher than the Pounds
1.8bn in September last year, the figures for 1992 were distorted by the
ending of the stamp duty holiday, which brought house purchases forward to
the summer.

FT  21 OCT 93 / 'Two-tier housing market' develops: Property market
'fragile'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 'TWO-TIER' housing market is developing in some areas of the UK, with
realistically priced properties selling quickly but a much larger number of
homes remaining unsold because buyers think they are overpriced.
This is one of the conclusions of the latest monthly survey by the Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors, published today, which confirms reports
that the recovery is under way in the housing market, but is fragile and
erratic.
Mr Peter Miller, the institution's residential property spokesman, said the
level of activity was healthier than at this time last year, when the market
was hit by the immediate aftermath of the UK's withdrawal from the European
exchange rate mechanism.
'But things are far from robust. There are plenty of potential buyers, but
too few vendors are able or willing to sell at the market price,' he added.
With would-be sellers holding back in the hope of getting a higher price
later, a two-tier market was developing.
'Fresh and realistically priced' homes were being sold within weeks, while a
much larger number of properties remained unsold. 'Their particulars gather
dust in estate agent windows because, in the eyes of the buyer, they are
overpriced,' the institution said.
In Leicester, Mr David Johnson of Spencers said an adequate supply of
well-priced, quality property coming on to the market remains 'a
difficulty', and there is still a significant gap between vendors'
expectations and purchasers' preparedness to meet them.
In Saffron Waldon, Essex, Mr Geoff White of Geoff White &amp; Partners said
there is still 'a good nucleus of serious buyers, but vendors appear to be
still waiting - what for?'
Mr Miller added the institution's weight to the construction industry's
pleas for the chancellor 'to keep his hands off housing' in next month's
Budget.
Reacting to speculation about plans to abolish interest tax relief on new
mortgages, he said a disincentive to move house would lead the market back
to stagnation.
The survey is based on reports from 88 estate agents.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Cash in circulation rises again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER SIGNS that consumers are the driving force behind the recovery were
contained in yesterday's money supply figures. They showed continued strong
growth by cash in circulation.
Last month, M0 - mainly notes and coins - grew by a seasonally adjusted 0.3
per cent on the previous month to give growth of 5.3 per cent in the year to
September, the strongest increase for more than three years.
Bank lending figures pointed to the underlying fragility of the recovery,
however, with growth in lending skewed strongly towards mortgages rather
than the corporate sector, which is still giving priority to debt repayment.
M0, or narrow money, which has tended to rise in line with retail sales
growth, has increased for four consecutive months and is now growing at its
fastest rate since July 1990. For seven out of the past eight months it has
been above the government's 0 per cent to 4 per cent monitoring range.
Broad money - M0 plus bank and building society deposits - also grew, by a
seasonally adjusted 0.2 per cent on the month and 3.9 per cent compared with
a year before. That compared with growth of 3.6 per cent in the year to
August.
Bank and building society lending - M4 lending - was up a seasonally
adjusted Pounds 2bn in September compared with a revised increase of Pounds
2.4bn in August.
A breakdown of the figures shows that growth in new lending occurred mainly
in the personal sector with strong demand for mortgages standing in contrast
to the company sector's determination to repay bank debts.
Figures from the British Bankers' Association emphasise this picture,
showing that lending by the nine main high street banks fell in September
with repayments by companies more than offsetting a Pounds 954m increase in
lending to individuals. Total lending by the big retail banks fell by a
seasonally adjusted Pounds 94m in September compared with an August rise of
Pounds 1.6bn and the recent average monthly rise of Pounds 1.1bn per month.
Lord Inchyra, director-general of the BBA, said: 'September's small fall
emphasises the weakness in the recovery of lending which the banks had been
experiencing over the last few months.'
Mortgage lending in September rose by Pounds 951m following a rise of Pounds
800m in August. This was the strongest rise for more than two years and
compares with a rise in mortgage lending of only Pounds 381m in September
last year.
There were large repayments by securities dealers, property companies and
construction companies. The only significant increases were in lending to
food, drink and tobacco companies.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Weaker exports threaten growth: Chambers concerned at pace
of upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor and ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC recovery is slow and hesitant and threatened by weakening export
demand, says a survey of the manufacturing and service sectors by the
British Chambers of Commerce.
The BCC said that its September poll of 7,873 companies employing 1.1m
people showed the rate of improvement in the economy was slackening. It
found that home orders increased slightly for both manufacturing and
services in the third quarter while the growth of export demand slowed
sharply.
The survey will add to the pressure on Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
not to tighten fiscal policy too rigorously in his Budget on November 30.
But despite the sense of gloom engendered by faltering exports, its news was
not all bad.
The BCC poll found that business confidence continued to climb in the three
months to the end of September, reaching its highest point since early 1989.
A growing number of service and manufacturing companies revised upwards
their plans to invest in plant, machinery and buildings.
For the first quarter since the start of the recession, the number of
companies saying that they had increased staff exceeded those reporting that
their labour forces had declined. Replies to the survey suggested that more
staff would be recruited in the current quarter, although at a very modest
rate. There was a slight increase in the number of companies reporting
difficulty recruiting staff with the necessary skills and professional
standards in the past quarter.
Mr Richard Brown, BCC deputy director-general, said the survey suggested
that the recovery was beginning to flatten out, and there were some
disturbing trends in some regions. 'If we are at the peak of the recovery,
that is a cause for concern,' he said.
The Scottish and Welsh economies lagged behind the rest of the UK while
manufacturers in Merseyside reported a fall in home sales. The Thames
Valley, after growing strongly for a year and a half, reported strong growth
in its manufacturing industry but declines elsewhere. Signs of a healthy
recovery in the south of England went into reverse.
Although London's manufacturing and service companies reported growing sales
and orders at home, manufacturing exports fell sharply.
Weakness in London's manufacturing exports have often preceded a national
downturn.
Recovery in the south-west is fragile, the Bristol Chamber of Commerce and
Initiative said yesterday in its quarterly survey of more than 300
companies, Roland Adburgham writes.
More companies reported improvements rather than deterioration in domestic
sales and orders, exports, turnover, profitability and investment. But the
chamber said the recovery appeared to be slowing, especially in
manufacturing.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Revenues hit by duty-free shopping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CROSS-CHANNEL shopping is costing the government Pounds 260m a year in lost
excise duty and value added tax on wines and spirits - five times the amount
forecast by the Treasury when the European single market was established in
January.
A survey by the Wine and Spirit Association suggests that every vehicle
making the cross-Channel trip returns to the UK with an average 27 bottles
of wine and two bottles of spirits.
Just over a quarter of visitors to the Continent do not buy any wines or
spirits. Of the rest, 93 per cent buy up to 10 bottles of spirits, and 64
per cent return with up to four cases of wine.
The association has presented its survey results to Sir John Cope,
paymaster-general, as part of its arguments against any tax increase on
drinks in the November Budget.
Mr Bernard Windsor, association chairman, said the Treasury had assured the
WSA that any Budget changes in excise duty would not be implemented until
January 1 next year to avoid pricing confusion in the pre-Christmas trading
period.
Mr Windsor said industry estimates suggested that the Treasury was also
losing Pounds 100m a year from personal imports of beer. 'The only solution
is to reduce the UK's level of excise on alcoholic beverages so
significantly that cross-border shopping is no longer viable.' The increase
in personal imports was hitting drinks retailers throughout the country, he
said.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Higher shop sales ease worry over recovery: Sales volumes
beat City expectations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORRIES about the pace of the recovery diminished yesterday after a
bigger-than-expected rise in retail sales volumes last month.
The second successive monthly increase in sales volumes countered recent
evidence that consumers are cutting back on spending as a result of concern
about possible tax increases in the Budget.
Volumes rose 0.5 per cent in September compared with the previous month,
after a revised 0.2 per cent monthly increase in August, according to the
Central Statistical Office. The City had expected a rise of 0.3 per cent for
the latest monthly period.
Shop sales in the third quarter of the year were 1 per cent higher than in
the previous quarter, after a 0.4 per cent increase between the first and
second quarters.
However, the pace of growth in the retail sector - which accounts for about
a quarter of the economy - has slipped from the January to March period
which saw a 1.7 per cent rise in sales on the previous three months.
In the latest three months, shop sales were 3.8 per cent higher than in the
corresponding period a year ago. The CSO's figures are adjusted both for
seasonal variations and inflation.
Shops selling household goods, and clothes and shoes, performed relatively
well in the third quarter, with sales volumes up 2 per cent and 1.2 per cent
respectively compared with the previous three months.
Stores offering food and non-edible products saw volumes rise 1.9 per cent
over the same period.
Shops selling just food did less well, experiencing a sales rise of 0.4 per
cent.
Based on non seasonally adjusted data, the average weekly value of retail
sales in September was Pounds 2.78bn, 6.5 per cent higher than 12 months
previously.
In a separate breakdown of sales trends, the British Retail Consortium, a
trade body, said chemists and beauty shops had seen strong growth in recent
months.
Retailers concentrating on carpets and furniture had had a 'difficult'
September.
The electrical and electronics sector experienced 'measurably better' sales
growth than in August, in spite of poor demand for kitchen equipment.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Smith accuses Clarke of delaying rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday demanded an immediate cut in
interest rates as he delivered a wide-ranging attack on the government's
economic strategy.
In a series of speeches, Mr Smith accused Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
of deliberately delaying a reduction in borrowing costs with the intention
of 'sweetening' tax increases in next month's Budget.
The Labour leader also sought to capitalise on renewed unrest on the
Conservative back benches about the imposition of value added tax on
domestic fuel.
Mr Smith called on Conservative MPs concerned about the tax to join with the
Opposition to overturn the measure during the passage of the Finance Bill
which will follow the Budget. He said the increase in VAT threatened
economic recovery. He added: 'It is imperilling consumer confidence because
people are now realising the tax increases which the Conservatives already
propose will cost the typical family Pounds 8.50 more a week.'
His message was echoed by Liberal Democrats, who said that the proposed
Pounds 1 per week on the state pension next April would be more than offset
by a Pounds 1.60 per week rise in heating bills for elderly people.
Later, Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, said Mr Smith ought
to admit that, if Labour had won last year's general election, 'they too
would have put VAT on heating'.
Speaking at a Manufacturing Matters conference in London, Mr Smith broadened
his attack on the government's economic policies by accusing it of ignoring
the need for an industrial strategy.
He told the conference that Britain had a Pounds 7bn trade deficit in
manufactured goods last year, the 11th consecutive year in which
manufactured imports had exceeded manufactured exports.
The deficit had weakened the economy, added to inflationary pressures and
forced unemployment up even higher, he said.
Mr Smith added: 'This deficit cannot be ignored. It is eating away at
British prosperity and the living standards of ordinary working people
throughout the country.'
Calling for an immediate reduction in interest rates, he said: 'The cut
should not be delayed until it is convenient for the govern-ment's news
management, but intro-duced now when industry and the wider economy so
clearly require.'
Lower borrowing costs should be accompanied by a phased release by local
authorities of the Pounds 5bn they had accumulated in capital receipts, he
said. The money should be used largely to finance new housing programmes.
Mr Smith said that a future Labour government would set up a defence
diversification agency to help defence companies move from production for
the battlefield to production for the high street.
It would also encourage the European Community to set up a 'recovery' fund
for infrastructure, training and environmental projects.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Howard accepts police proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS to reduce police paperwork could release the equivalent of 2,300
officers for more active duties, Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said
yesterday.
Mr Howard has accepted all 16 recommendations in a report on cutting police
administrative burdens prepared for the Home Office by PA Consulting Group.
Police service representatives welcomed Mr Howard's decision, but said
substantial additional funds would be needed to implement the proposals.
The report claims police paperwork after an arrest could be halved. It calls
for action in three areas: better liaison between police forces and the
Crown Prosecution Service; improved information technology; and better
management of paperwork.
Mr Howard said the recommendations were in keeping with the government's
proposals in its recent police white paper to introduce a more
management-based approach to policing. Nothing in them would detract from
suspects' rights.
Introducing the report's recommendations throughout England and Wales could
cost about Pounds 40m. The consultants concluded that the most significant
factor in reducing paperwork would be a rise in information technology
support.
Mr John Hoddinott, chief constable of Hampshire and chairman of the
Association of Chief Police Officers' crime committee, welcomed Mr Howard's
endorsement of the report. But he said police information technology budgets
were small and forces would be unable to finance the proposed changes from
their resources alone.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, yesterday called for an urgent inquiry
into a sharp fall in the number of criminal cases dealt with by crown courts
in the past year.
In the year to last August, 88,725 cases were dealt with by the crown court,
a 15 per cent drop on the figure for the year to August 1992 of 103,702.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Waldegrave kept in dark, Iraq arms inquiry told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDDLE EAST specialists at the Foreign Office failed to pass on vital
intelligence reports that would have enabled their minister to resist
pressure to allow Matrix Churchill machine-tool exports into Iraq.
As a result, Lord Justice Scott said yesterday, Mr William Waldegrave, then
Foreign Office minister, had gone to a crucial meeting 'armed with a bow and
arrow when he should have had a Kalashnikov'.
The arms-for-Iraq inquiry heard that the November 1989 meeting between Mr
Waldegrave, Mr Alan Clark, then defence minister, and Lord Trefgarne, trade
minister, was held at a time when ministries were at odds with each other
over exports to Baghdad.
Mr Stephen Lamport, the former assistant head of the Middle East department
at the Foreign Office and now deputy private secretary to the Prince of
Wales, acknowledged that his department had received intelligence reports
from GCHQ, the government communications centre, warning that Iraq's missile
programme was being equipped with British machine tools.
However, those warnings had not been used to brief Mr Waldegrave for the
meeting held to discuss Matrix Churchill's applications to export lathes to
Iraq. Instead Mr Waldegrave had gone to the meeting with a briefing paper
drawn up by a middle-ranking official who had joined the Middle East
department a few weeks earlier and had not initially had clearance to view
the GCHQ material.
As a result, the briefing by Mr Simon Sherrington, an assistant desk
officer, had been based upon new information from the Secret Intelligence
Service that contradicted the earlier warnings.
The SIS told Mr Sherrington it was 'inclined to believe' statements by Dr
Safa al Habobi, then Matrix chairman and now Iraq's oil minister, that the
factory he ran in Iraq was used solely for post-war reconstruction.
Mr Lamport said the intelligence report had 'pulled the rug' from under the
Foreign Office, which had wanted to reject the export application. He said
there had been no illusions about Iraq's procurement programme and its
efforts to involve British companies.
Lord Justice Scott suggested to Mr Lamport that in not giving his minister
the earlier warnings, Mr Waldegrave had been left without crucial
ammunition. Mr Lamport said that many conversations were taking place at the
time 'so ministers were not, in a sense, coming to it cold'.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Rail unions fear assault on pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAIL union leaders believe the government is preparing for anattack on the
pay and conditions of 125,000 railway workers after pushing through an
amendment in the rail privatisation bill during the Lords report stage
earlier this week.
Under the late change the unions fear British Rail is being given new legal
powers to assign employees to new subsidiaries and modify terms and
conditions of employment before privatisation.
The amendment replaces a previous clause in the measure that explicitly
affirmed that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)
regulations applied to any transfer of rail staff. The Tupe regulations
provide protection to workers in companies involved in changes of ownership.
Under the change, BR and the franchising director created by privatisation
will be empowered to assign railway workers to new subsidiaries and modify
their employment terms.
A government-funded compensation and arbitration scheme is to be introduced
for staff aggrieved by the changes.
Rail unions say the amendment is aimed at lowering earnings and other
employment benefits before the sale or franchising of parts of BR.
Ministers insist that the changes reinforce and do not weaken Tupe
protection for rail staff who do not work wholly for BR - such as those
employed on the Gatwick Express trains.
An urgent meeting is to be held with Mr John MacGregor, the transport
secretary, over the amendment. There has been no consultation with the
unions before the bill is debated for its third reading in the Commons next
Wednesday.
Aslef, the train drivers' union, yesterday threatened to hold a strike
ballot if it cannot receive guarantees over the future security of BR's
Pounds 8.2m pension fund after privatisation of the network starts next
spring.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Acas to charge for some services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACAS, the independent advisory conciliation and arbitration service,
announced yesterday it would charge clients from April next year for
conferences, seminars, self-help 'clinics' for small businesses and some of
its advisory publications.
However it said there were 'no plans to charge for any other Acas activity
as to do so would compromise Acas's impartial and independent approach'.
It added that the charges were to cover costs, not to make a profit.
Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, has powers under the Trade Union
Reform and Employment Rights Act that became law in the summer to instruct
Acas to charge for any of its collective conciliation, arbitration and
advisory activities although Acas has expressed strong opposition to this.
Yesterday Acas was also anxious to reassure unions and employers that the
alteration to its statutory terms of reference in the act, which dropped any
commitment to the encouragement of collective bargaining, did not mean the
organisation was abandoning one of its primary purposes.
In a leaflet promoting improvement in industrial relations, Acas says:
'Recent legislative changes to its terms of reference do not affect the
availability of Acas advice and conciliation on employment and workplace
issues, including collective bargaining and trade union recognition.'
Established in 1974, Acas is one of Britain's few remaining tripartite
bodies, which as well as government appointments has representatives from
the TUC and employer organisations.

FT  21 OCT 93 / NHS seeks Pounds 1m telecom savings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MULTI-million pound contract between Mercury Communications, the main
rival to British Telecommunications, and the National Health Service, could
save the NHS more than Pounds 1m a year on telecommunications costs.
The contract was billed by the NHS as the 'first step' in a rationalisation
of its Pounds 150m annual bill for linking its 22,000 sites.
About 10 per cent of the Pounds 150m already goes to Mercury for a large
part of the NHS's long-distance phone and fax traffic. The deal involves a
special tariff package for high usage, with the prospect of further savings
as it is extended to include more NHS sites.
Mercury now links about 350 of the NHS's 22,000 sites.
Mr Tom Sackville, junior health minister, said: 'We are pleased that
suppliers like Mercury recognise the NHS as a single major customer and
provide the sort of discounts that a large customer should expect.'
Mr Peter Bury, Mercury's National Customer Director, said: 'Genuine
partnership between government bodies and suppliers is becoming more
important as the public sector seeks to increase value for money.'
The deal underlines Mercury's growing role in the public sector. Earlier
this month the company, a subsidiary of the Cable &amp; Wireless group, won the
outsourcing contract for the government's long-distance telecommunications
network, serving about 250,000 civil servants in 550 sites.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Banham alleges Whitehall meddling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR JOHN BANHAM, chair-man of the Local Government Commission, yesterday
demanded government action against interference by civil servants in his
organisation's review of the structure of local government in England.
He said after giving evidence to the Commons environment committee that the
commission would be unable to complete its work on time 'unless we get
Whitehall off our backs'.
He added: 'The commission must be free to manage the process as we see fit.
To have continuous instructions which get cancelled - and artificial
deadlines - is simply trying to manage the process by remote control. We are
not going to have it.'
He stressed to the committee that he was not attacking government policy. He
complained that earlier this week he had received an instruction from the
Department of the Environment to halt work on Leicestershire,
Nottinghamshire, Hampshire, Cumbria and Lanca-shire, while a covering letter
from Mr David Curry, local government minister, told him to ignore those
instructions.
The department said later: 'When the commission is conducting its review, we
are 100 per cent hands-off.'
It denied that Mr Curry's letter had contradicted civil servants' advice,
which was that the reviews should be suspended 'and resumed when we are in a
position to issue revised guidance'.
Sir John also said that opinion polls had revealed that local people were
'rightly suspicious of reorganisation as time-consuming and costly'.
But in the Commons, Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, said he saw
'no need at all for this to cost very much'.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, said it would be 'outrageous'
if the cost of the reorganisation was paid for by a council tax surcharge,
as had been reported.
Mr Gummer retorted that Mr Straw's worries were 'entirely unjustified'.
However, Mr Gummer came under fire over the review from Conservative
backbenchers as well as from Labour, with one Tory saying the process was
'getting murkier by the moment'.
Sir John revealed later that the commission has decided to drop its original
proposals for Derbyshire, one of the first three counties to be reviewed.
Its proposal to convert the county into two unitary districts, one for the
city of Derby and another for the rest of the county, had 'plainly received
too much opposition and not enough positive support'.

motor-insurance customers to 1.25m during the past year. It employs 1,900
people in Croydon, Surrey, Glasgow, Manchester and Birmingham.
Mr Peter Wood, chief executive, said that the growth in customers in the

FT  21 OCT 93 / Lottery bill wins final approval
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Lottery Bill last night completed its passage through
parliament, clearing the way for the first Pounds 1m prize draw to take
place on schedule late next year or early 1995, David Owen writes.
The bill now goes for royal assent some three months later than the
government had originally hoped. Mr Iain Sproat, national heritage minister,
told MPs that in spite of this he was still hopeful that the first draw
would take place on time.
In last night's proceedings, MPs approved a Lords amendment enabling the
Tote to take part in the lottery.
Later Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, moved amendments aimed
at preventing funds from the lottery reaching terrorist organisations in
Northern Ireland. The amendments would close a loophole which might have
allowed money to be channelled through seemingly respectable organisations
to paramilitary groups, Mr Brooke said.

THE NEW Saab 900, one of more than 30 models making their UK debut, was
unveiled yesterday at the preview day for the London Motor Show at Earls
Court, where makers and dealers again clashed, John Griffiths writes.
Mr Alan Pulham, director of the National Franchised Dealers Association,
which has 6,000 members, claimed 'phantom' sales reported by some leading
carmakers were increasingly sending false signals to the government about
the strength of the recovery in the new-car market. He also called for
legislation to ban deeply discounted sales deals negotiated directly between
manufacturers and large fleet customers, claiming that this could cut list
prices of new cars by 5 per cent.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Tory MPs urge pension rise to cover fuel tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX TORY backbenchers yesterday signed a Commons motion calling for pensions
to be raised to cover the cost of value added tax when it is imposed on
domestic fuel.
The move will increase pressure on ministers to devise an effective
compensation package.
The motion - signed by MPs from across the political spectrum - expressed
concern that linking compensation to income-related benefits would not help
pensioners with incomes just above the qualifying limit.
It predicted that 'hundreds of thousands of pensioners' who missed out on
benefits would have real difficulty meeting the extra cost of fuel once VAT
was levied.
Early-day motions are not normally put to a Commons vote. But this
indication of the strength of backbench discontent will come as a blow to
government business managers struggling with a Commons majority of only 17.
The move came as pensioners staged a rally to protest against plans to
charge the full rate of VAT on fuel from 1995.
The six Tory signatories were Mr Andrew Bowden, MP for Brighton Kemptown, Mr
Peter Fry (Wellingborough), Mr William Powell (Corby), Mr Tim Rathbone
(Lewes), Mr Nicholas Winterton (Macclesfield) and Mr Geoffrey Dickens
(Littleborough &amp; Saddleworth).
Mr Powell said there were now enough Tory rebels to defeat the government on
the issue.
The government intends to outline what help it will give those hardest hit
next month, when it announces its plans on uprating benefits.
Ministers have said there will be additional compensation for poorer people
beyond the automatic impact of the price increase on the uprating formula.
But they have had great difficulty devising a package to help those who just
miss eligibility for income-related benefits without incurring unacceptable
costs.
This is seen as the key to making the new tax more generally acceptable.
Earlier this year, the government's social security advisory committee
estimated that compensating about 8m people for fuel bills carrying the full
rate of VAT would cost about Pounds 720m.
According to Labour, the cost for the average family of paying the tax at
17.5 per cent would be about Pounds 2 a week. An across-the-board Pounds 2 a
week increase in the basic pension would cost some Pounds 1bn.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Dealers warn over distorting effect of 'phantom' motor sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW CLASHES erupted on the eve of the London Motor Show yesterday between
carmakers and representatives of the UK's 6,000 franchised dealers.
Mr Alan Pulham, director of the National Franchised Dealers Association,
claimed that 'phantom' sales reported by some leading carmakers were
increasingly sending false signals to the government about the strength of
the recovery in the new-car market and risked bringing increased tax burdens
in next month's Budget.
Mr Pulham also called for legislation to ban deeply discounted sales deals
negotiated directly between manufacturers and large fleet customers,
claiming new car list prices could be cut by 5 per cent if such deals were
out-lawed.
There was evidence that a 'significant number' of fleets were being awarded
discounts of between 40 per cent and 45 per cent, far in excess of discounts
available to the manufacturers' own dealers, he said.
He added that the practice meant not only higher prices and but also sharply
increased depreciation for privately purchased cars.

GOVERNMENT proposals to reshape local government in a key area of Scotland
will increase operating costs, produce high transitional costs and add
Pounds 100 to the average D band council tax bill, the consultants Coopers &amp;
Lybrand estimate.
In July a government white paper proposed creating four unitary authorities
in Lothian and Borders regions, compared with the present two regions and
eight districts. But the study commissioned by the regions says that this
would cost Pounds 10.2m a year extra.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Shared rule urged for Ulster
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INSTITUTE for Public Policy Research (IPPR) has recommended that the UK
and the Republic of Ireland should share sovereignty over Northern Ireland
as a means of resolving the conflict there.
The left-of-centre think tank recommended in a report published yesterday
the drafting of a new constitution for the province and that the Royal
Ulster Constabulary should be replaced by a security force better
representing both communities.
The report recommended that both governments should recognise each other's
claim of sovereignty and make the province part of the national territory of
the UK and the republic.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Checks on Bank governor urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANGES would have to be made to the top management structure of the Bank of
England if it gained more autonomy to ensure that its governor did not have
too much power over interest rate changes, a former senior bank official
said yesterday, Peter Norman writes.
Sir George Blunden, the deputy governor of the Bank between 1986 and 1990,
told the House of Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee that, if the
Bank were given more autonomy over interest rates, there would be a narrower
range of advice ahead of decisions to change monetary policy.
The governor of a more autonomous Bank would also have more power than his
counterparts in the US or Germany so that an extra check would have to be
introduced to limit the Governor's power.
Sir George's testimony against greater independence for the Bank clearly
surprised the all-party committee of MPs.

FT  21 OCT 93 / HSE finds link in child cancers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPREHENSIVE study by the Health and Safety Executive of leukaemia in
children whose fathers worked at the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant
in Cumbria has found a 'weak' historical link between radiation exposure and
cancer.
The HSE said the study 'did provide some weak support for the associations .
. . between pre-conception radiation dose to the fathers and the risk of
leukaemia in their children'.
The executive said the excess leukaemia cases were confined almost entirely
to the children of men who started work at Sellafield before 1965, when
workplace exposures were more than five times higher than today.
'There is no need for preventive action to protect the health of the
Sellafield workforce other than the measures in place,' said Mr Eddie
Varney, deputy chief inspector of nuclear installations.
The report was published yesterday, two weeks after the conclusion of a High
Court test case in which British Nuclear Fuels, Sellafield's operator, was
cleared of causing leukaemia in two children through their fathers'
radiation exposure. The judge said there was insufficient scientific
evidence for such a link.
Mr Martyn Day, the families' solicitor, said the report would provide 'very
strong grounds' for an appeal which is under consideration. But he was
'concerned about the very negative interpretation which the HSE is putting
on its own findings'. BNF gave them an even more negative interpretation.
'The HSE study has produced yet further evidence that the association
between a father's radiation exposure and childhood leukaemia does not
work,' it said.
One of the many mysteries about the Sellafield leukaemia link is that the
excess cases are confined mainly to the children of workers who lived in the
village of Seascale.
The report said the Seascale effect could be due partly to 'population
mixing' - the idea that the risk of childhood leukaemia is increased by an
influx of people coming to live and work in an area previously isolated from
other parts of the country. The incomers carry viruses that may trigger
leukaemia.

FT  21 OCT 93 / World Bank set to publicise Nigeria finances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ADAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ABUJA, NIGERIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD BANK is to make public for the first time a detailed analysis of
Nigeria's government finances after the two-week visit of experts which
began on Tuesday.
But talks on the medium-term economic programme leading to possible debt
relief remain suspended until the government brings oil revenues and public
spending under control.
The team will present to Nigeria's interim government a post-mortem on the
eight-year structural adjustment programme (SAP) and a proposed strategy to
offset the fluctuating value of oil exports, which account for more than 80
per cent of its foreign exchange.
New rules at the bank will allow publication of these reports by December. A
1991 report by the World Bank's Nigeria office exposed the lack of
accountability in government finances but was not published.
The SAP stalled half-way to a liberalisation of trade and industry but
failed to boost non-oil exports, while the standard of living and the value
of the naira plunged and inflation reached 70 per cent due to diversion of
government oil revenue.
The 1993 budget sought to cut Nigeria's debt service, which is equivalent to
30 per cent of earnings, and to produce a budget deficit of around Dollars
1.4bn.
However, the drop in the oil price has worsened the balance of payments and
the budget deficit was estimated at Dollars 1.5bn by the end of June.
Arrears on payments to the Paris Club of creditors have risen to about
Dollars 4bn and negotiations in April with the International Monetary Fund
over a medium-term programme ended in failure.
Mr Ernest Shonekan, the head of the new interim government, has pledged a
new era of accountable government and a purge on corruption.
However, since he took office there has been no more disclosure of public
finances than under the former president, General Ibrahim Babangida, who
retired at the end of August.
Nigeria is no nearer to a deal with the official creditors than in January,
when Mr Shonekan led the military regime's bid to reschedule its Dollars
27bn external debt.

FT  21 OCT 93 / China stresses 'strong desire' for HK accord

<TEXT>
CHINA yesterday stated its strong desire to reach an agreement with Britain
on Hong Kong, as negotiators met in Beijing for the 14th round of talks on
the colony's political development.
Mr Lu Ping, director of Chinese government's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office, said in an interview with the Financial Times: 'We very much want to
have an agreement; it's good for Hong Kong as well as China and Britain.'
China recognised that both sides would need to make concessions to reach an
agreement. 'In diplomatic talks there should always be mutual compromise,'
he added.
British and Hong Kong officials would not comment on the latest round of
negotiations which are due to end today. But they have seen little evidence
of a change in the Chinese position indicating a desire to reach swift
agreement.
Mr Lu said wide differences remained on both main areas of dispute: the
so-called 'functional constituencies' which make up a part of Hong Kong's
60-strong Legislative Council, and an 'election committee' that will elect
10 members in 1995.
He attributed the lack of progress to a fundamental difference of approach.
Britain wished to secure agreement on the 'through train,' a guarantee China
would not dismantle pre-1997 political arrangements after its takeover in
that year, before agreeing to the details of the 1995 polls.
China, on the other hand, wanted to settle the details of the election
arrangements in 1994 and 1995 before agreeing to the 'through train.'
'The reason we agreed to hold talks is precisely because we want to have a
'through train',' Mr Lu said. 'We are fully for it but our desire is that we
must first talk about the train itself. If we do not agree on that, the
train cannot go through.'
Mr Lu said China planned no changes in Hong Kong's basic liberties, such as
freedom of the press, the rule of law and freedom of religious belief.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Query over Pakistan's quiet revolution: Architect of reform
hopes Bhutto will safeguard his work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FARHAN BOKHARI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEARDED men in traditional clothes and armed with sophisticated assault
rifles stood guard outside the parliament building in Islamabad this week,
to protect their powerful tribal leader who was about to take oath as a
member.
The guards were a stark reminder of the influence of tribal and feudal
values in Pakistani politics and the economy, but never before have those
values come under such intense pressure as in the past three months.
Because of an aggressive campaign of unpopular economic reforms which have
tried to clamp down on powerful interests, many Pakistanis are hoping a
turnaround will occur in their country's economic fate.
The architect of the reform programme has been Mr Moeen Qureshi, the former
prime minister, who stepped down on Tuesday after handing over power to Ms
Benazir Bhutto. For many Pakistanis looking at the future of their country,
the key test for the new government is the extent to which the reforms will
survive.
By any standard, Mr Qureshi's programme has been as unusual as his own
background. His three decades of work experience with the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank kept him away from his country as well as
its influences. When he was appointed Prime Minister in July he brought a
fresh insight to many of the chronic problems which previous governments
failed to resolve because of reluctance to confront powerful interests.
During his brief tenure, Mr Qureshi moved fast to introduce unpopular
measures such as taxing previously immune and politically powerful rich
landowners.
He also began a large-scale campaign to recover outstanding bank loans and
unpaid utility bills, changed the tax collection network to increase
government revenues and eliminated special government quotas which allowed
elected politicians to allot valuable government land at throwaway prices.
He also finalised a three-year tariff reform programme which aims to
eliminate at least some of the smuggling activities, estimated to be worth
at least Rupees 100bn (Pounds 2.1bn)a year.
As a result, for the first time in Pakistan's history, the new government is
left with virtually no patronage that could be used to attract new political
allies or tame critics.
'The most important reforms aim at good governance. I feel that this country
has been run previously by governments that have had almost feudal
characteristics. It's not the fault of any particular government, it's the
system that has evolved in that way, and public resources, public assets,
have been used a means of political patronage,' Mr Qureshi said in an
interview.
If 'we've got to build a healthy democratic system, then the people must
expect that their rulers are in fact their servants rather than their
authoritarian rulers,' he added.
Mr Qureshi remains hopeful that his programme will remain on course, largely
because both Ms Bhutto and Mr Nawaz Sharif - the two front-runners in the
electoral race - had assured him they agreed with the broad thrust of the
plans.
In addition, continuing with the reform programme would allow future
governments to benefit from larger revenues while laying the responsibility
for unpopular measures on Mr Qureshi's shoulders.
The reforms have also been acclaimed by the IMF and the World Bank. One sign
of that acknowledgment has been the recent approval of a Dollars 277m
(Pounds 183.4m) standby IMF loan.
Mr Qureshi is confident the new government can also get up to Dollars 1.2bn
in extra IMF funding over the next three years if a commitment is made to
keep the reforms on track.
Ms Bhutto's government has yet to come out clearly on its future economic
policies . Some officials are concerned over her statements on the campaign
trail that she would review the new agriculture taxes.
But it is not yet clear if such a policy reversal, which may well have been
part of the electoral rhetoric, could be made in face of criticism from
Pakistan's multilateral and bilateral aid donors.
Mr Qureshi hopes public opinion will play an important role in protecting
his initiatives.
'I don't think that some of our fundamental reforms, particularly in so far
as good governance is concerned, can fall apart, because they are really
based on awakening the conscience of the people,' Mr Qureshi declares.
'I believe that the Pakistani public is much more conscious and much more
sensitive now about the misuse of power and authority in government and
about its use for political purposes.'

FT  21 OCT 93 / India records sharp increase in exports
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S exports rose 24.3 per cent to Dollars 8.7bn in the five months to
August, raising hopes the country's wide-ranging economic liberalisation is
starting to produce results.
The sharp rise in the first five months of the 1993-94 financial year
contrasts with a sluggish 3.6 per cent rise in 1992-93, according to the
government's monthly economic report published yesterday.
The strong export performance is helping to push India's foreign exchange
reserves to record levels: at the end of September they stood at Dollars
7.6bn compared with just over Dollars 1bn in mid-1991 when the government of
Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, launched its restructuring
programme amid a balance of payments crisis.
The reserves are so high that India, which was bailed out in 1991 with loans
from the International Monetary Fund, has for the moment delayed entering
into a new medium-term IMF borrowing programme.
Weak imports are contributing to the reserve position. Imports in the first
five months of 1993-94 fell 3.7 per cent to Dollars 8.9bn, leaving a trade
deficit of just Dollars 255m, against Dollars 2.3bn for the same period last
year.
The decline in imports reflects continuing weak demand in heavy industry,
hit by a fall in sales to state-owned enterprises, which are suffering
because subsidies are being cut under the reform programme. Meanwhile, with
industrialists uncertain about the long-term effects of liberalisation,
private sector demand is showing little sign of recovering. Industrial
production in the first three months of the financial year rose 0.2 per
cent.
Economists puzzled by the apparent failure of export growth to generate more
overall industrial growth believe the reason may be that the industrial
production statistics exaggerate the importance of large companies in heavy
industry; much of the export growth has come from small companies in
industries such as garment-making, jewellery and engineering components.
Indian forces fired tear gas and swung truncheons yesterday to disperse
Moslem demonstrators supporting insurgents besieged inside Kashmir's holiest
Islamic shrine, AP reports from Srinagar.

Israel and Palestinian negotiators resumed detailed talks on implementing a
framework peace accord yesterday focusing on Israel's security demands and
Palestinian calls for release of up to 12,000 political prisoners, Julian
Ozanne writes.
Israel's state TV later said the Jewish state would free up to 2,000
Palestinian prisoners in two weeks, with preference given to sick, aged, or
especially young prisoners, and those who had served over two-thirds of
their sentences.
Earlier Mr Dennis Ross, US co-ordinator for Middle East peace talks arrived
in Jerusalem from Jordan for talks with Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime
minister and Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister.
Mr Ross is touring the region to help consolidate the accord, to prepare for
an early November visit by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, and
to try to broker progress on stalled talks between Israel and Syria. Before
leaving Amman he said the US could support secret talks between Jerusalem
and Damascus to break the deadlock.

A SHAREHOLDER of Nomura Securities yesterday filed a suit against its
executives for losses incurred in allegedly improper sales of its investment
products. Corporate executives are facing a rush of lawsuits after changes
to the Commercial Code eased costs for shareholder litigants.
Earlier, shareholders of Hazama construction company filed an action against
its executives for Y99m (Pounds 620,000). Executives at Janome, a sewing
machine maker, are also being sued.
Mr Nobuo Kameda is demanding that 58 Nomura directors, including former
executives, pay Y23.5bn in damages to the brokerage house. He claims they
are responsible for the brokerage's compensation to investors of losses from
US mortgage backed securities.
Nomura posted Y22.5bn in special losses due to compensation payments made to
investors claiming risks in buying the products were not properly explained
by Nomura sales staff. It is uncertain how far courts will back
shareholders.

THE Philippines government is determined to pursue privatisation plans for
Petron Corporation, the state-owned market leader in the petroleum refining
and marketing business, despite opposition from a number of Congress
members.
Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC), the state-owned energy group, has
issued invitations for tenders for 40 per cent of Petron, which is among the
most attractive assets the government has lined up for privatisation.
British Petroleum, Aramco of Saudi Arabia and Petronas have all shown an
interest.
Plans for privatisation date back to 1986 but little progress has been made
on most of the main items, although last year the auction of 67 per cent of
Philippine Airlines was successful.
Mr Romeo Bernardo, finance under-secretary, said this week that the deadline
for Petron bids has been set for December 15. The hurdle price for the
bidders will be determined and announced only on the day the bids are to be
opened.
PNOC is looking for a 'strategic partner' which, officials say, must be
capable of putting in 'added value' in Petron in the form of technical
expertise and access to petroleum supply.
Petron controls 40 per cent of the Philippine market for petroleum products,
with sales reaching Pesos 40.7bn (Pounds 974m) last year, which made it the
country's biggest corporation in terms of sales.
But Petron's profits last year of nearly Pesos 1.47bn and total assets of
some Pesos 15bn has led to strong criticism by some members of Congress who
feel the government must maintain its control of such a strategic industry.
PNOC has explained it would maintain holdings at 40 per cent, after a
planned 20 per cent public offering in early 1994.
This, PNOC officials said, should be enough to provide government with an
influencing presence in the industry.
Investors who qualify for the bidding will be required to submit technical
and financial proposals. They are also expected to commit themselves to a
long-term arrangement with the Philippine government on Petron.
Petron is one of several assets the government wants to privatise within the
next six months, an exercise expected to generate some Pesos 18bn. The
others include: Manila Hotel, National Steel and Philippine Shipyard and
Engineering Corporation (Philseco).
Plans are to sell off 30 per cent of Manila Hotel and 65 per cent of
National Steel.

COMMONWEALTH leaders today open what is widely regarded as one of the most
critical conferences in its modern history, if the association's survival is
to be assured.
The need for a renewed commitment to human rights and good governance will
be stressed by Chief Emeka Anyaoku in an address designed to give the
50-member organisation greater purpose and credibility.
The official agenda for the five-day session, attended by 36 heads of
government, covers global political and economic issues, including the Gatt
talks.
South Africa will continue to feature, with the Commonwealth planning a
substantial programme of assistance ahead of next April's scheduled
multi-party elections and to help monitor the poll itself.
Mr Thabo Mbeki, a senior member of the African National Congress executive,
is expected to attend as an accredited observer.
The delegates were also told last night that Ms Benazir Bhutto, Pakistan's
newly-elected prime minister, plans to attend the talks.
The opening has been overshadowed by the angry reaction of some Greek
Cypriots to Queen Elizabeth and what is seen as partisan British diplomatic
involvement in the dispute over the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north of the
island.
President Glafcos Clerides of Cyprus yesterday played down the protests. Mr
Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, held talks with Mr Clerides and Mr Rauf
Denktash, the Turkish-Cypriot leader,
British officials declined to elaborate on what they said were private
talks, only saying they had been useful. But Greek-Cypriot sensitivity was
illustrated when a press spokesman for the government stressed that the
meeting had been at Mr Hurd's initiative.

UNITED NATIONS secretary general Boutros Boutros Ghali said yesterday he had
achieved a breakthrough in revitalising the flagging peace process in
Mozambique, Reuter reports from Maputo.
Mr Boutros Ghali said at the end of a four-day visit that an accord had been
reached on the composition of a commission to supervise elections in October
next year.
The commission would have 10 members from the government, seven from Renamo
and three from other opposition parties. An independent chairman would be
chosen by the 20 commission members.
A draft electoral law will be approved by the cabinet before the end of this
month and by parliament before the end of November, Mr Boutros Ghali said.
He said disputes delaying demobilisation of the army, Renamo guerrillas and
para-military forces had also been resolved.
'A new calendar on the date of demobilisation will be approved before the
end of this week,' he said.
Mr Boutros Ghali said a compromise had also been reached on the composition
of three of the joint commissions dealing with aspects of the peace process.
The commission to oversee liaison between the government and
Renamo-controlled areas will be chaired jointly by the government and
Renamo, in rotation.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Israelis, Palestinians split on economic policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEEP divisions are emerging between Palestinians and Israelis over economic
policy, the lifting of the Arab economic boycott of Israel and the trade
regime which will exist between the two sides.
At the heart of the disagreement is an Israeli demand that the Palestinians
harmonise their tax and customs regime with the high levels in force in
Israel, which reflect Israel's protection policies and the government's need
to raise substantial revenues to meet its public expenditure.
Israel is hoping for the creation of a customs union which would develop
into an economic confederation between Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian
entity. The Palestinians firmly reject the idea of a customs union.
They also believe it is too early to call for the suspension of the Arab
boycott against Israel, which Jerusalem feels it should have in return for
taking a big step towards peace, and say a more comprehensive regional
agreement and details of the Palestinian interim period of self-government
must be finalised first.
The divisions were highlighted yesterday at a joint press conference by Mr
Samir Abdallah, director of the Palestinian delegation to the multilateral
talks on economic matters, and Mr Dan Proper, President of the Israeli
Manufacturers' Association.
The Palestinians feel that a customs union would drag them into
protectionism and excessive taxation, making goods too expensive for
Palestinians who have a per capita income less than 20 per cent of Israel's.
Mr Abdallah said the Palestinians wanted the terms of trade between the
occupied territories and Israel to be changed to free and open movement of
goods and people, and more competition. The Palestinians opposed a customs
union because of the different structure and priorities of the two
economies, and wanted to develop freely their external trade relations.
Israel, he added, would have to work hard to reduce its costs of production.
The Israelis have warned that unless there is a customs union Israel would
have to consider border controls to stop the movement and smuggling of cheap
goods from the Palestinian economy into Israel. 'If you create different
levels of customs and taxes you will be creating borders and controls where
the difference will have to be paid and where Israel would have to stop the
free flow of goods,' Mr Proper said.
One area affected by the dispute is agriculture. Mr Proper said a three-year
sliding scale of quantitative curbs on exports of Palestinian agricultural
produce into Israel would have to be brought in, especially in eggs and
poultry, livestock and some vegetables, to protect Israeli producers.
The European Community could help to provide open markets for Palestinian
agricultural products during the three-year period while protection was
phased out.
Mr Abdallah warned that Israeli curbs on Palestinian agricultural exports
would provoke reciprocal protection arrangements on industrial products. The
Palestinians had decided to introduce the Jordanian dinar as legal tender in
the Palestinian entity to insulate it against the depreciation of the
Israeli shekel and against Israeli inflation, currently 10 per cent.
They wanted to pursue a 'liberal' monetary account, similar to the Ecu, as a
way of issuing bonds to mobilise Palestinian financial resources, but
believed it was too early to re-introduce the Palestinian currency as a
means of exchange.
Mr Proper said that once economic issues were solved, a Middle East trading
bloc of 200m people lay ahead.

<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE education ministry went too far in exercising a controversial
legal right to censor school history textbooks, the Tokyo high court ruled
yesterday.
The court awarded Y300,000 (Pounds 1,866) compensation to a professor at the
former Tokyo University of Education, Mr Saburo Ienaga, who had challenged
government changes to parts of a history text he wrote 31 years ago.
His book, a New Japanese History, had offended the education ministry with
its blunt accounts of Japan's aggression in Asia. A series of legal battles
over the years by Mr Ienaga, 80, have become a symbol of Japan's
uncomfortable internal debate over its responsibilities in the second world
war.
His campaign has been given wider relevance by the recent apologies by Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa, the new prime minister, for Japan's war-time record. Mr
Hosokawa's apologies have drawn bitter criticism from the nationalist wing
of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party.
Mr Masatoshi Kawakami, the presiding high court judge, yesterday upheld the
ministry's right to censor history textbooks, but said it had acted
unreasonably in demanding that Mr Ienaga rewrite three out of eight passages
cited in the case. An account of the 1937 Nanking massacre was among the
passages that should not have been censored, he said. Mr Kawakami upheld the
education ministry's right to change five other passages, on the grounds
that it was 'not recommendable' for a textbook to contain negative judgments
about Japan 'when such negative judgments are not established'.
Japan's supreme court apparently put an end to Mr Ienaga's campaign only
last March, when it ruled that the education ministry had the right to ask
for changes or disqualify textbooks from school lists on 'reasonable
grounds'.
Yesterday's ruling showed 'some progress', said Mr Ienaga. However, he said
he would take the case, his third, on to the supreme court, Japan's top
legal authority.

FT  21 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Cairns group warns France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE will carry the blame if Gatt negotiations founder on its attempt to
revise Europe's farm trade agreement with the US, according to Senator Peter
Cook, Australia's trade minister and leader of the Cairns group of 14
food-exporting countries.
Mr Cook, together with Thai and Argentine ministers, had a meeting yesterday
with Mr Gerard Longuet, France's trade and industry minister, in an attempt
to put the Cairns group's views directly to Paris.
Later in Bonn, after talks with German ministers, the group's leaders said
they were depressed about the prospects for a Gatt deal. They said they
believed Germany was putting European unity, and relations with France in
particular, ahead of a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round.
In Paris, Mr Cook declined to comment on the possibility of Cairns countries
boycotting French produce if France was seen to have wrecked the Round. But
he warned that 'any further dilution' of the EC-US farm trade accord - the
so-called Blair House deal - 'would be unacceptable' to the group.
He said many in the group had 'only reluctantly' acquiesced in the Dunkel
draft, which called for a 24 per cent cut in the volume of subsidised farm
exports over six years, while Blair House had already watered this reduction
down to 21 per cent.
The Cairns group would only decide to accept Blair House as the basis for a
Gatt settlement when it had seen what offers the leading Gatt participants
had made to open their markets.
Dr Supachai Panitchpakdi, Thailand's deputy prime minister, stressed that
developing countries needed compensation in extra earnings from agriculture
if they were to open up their service sectors.

FT  21 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Phil Collins wins court case - European
court rules to prevent sales of bootleg recordings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHIL Collins, the British rock performer, yesterday won the backing of the
European Court of Justice in his attempt to prevent the sale in Germany of
unauthorised recordings of his music.
The court in Luxembourg held that the non-discrimination provisions of the
EC Treaty meant that Germany had to grant copyright protection to all
Community citizens and not just to its own nationals.
The case arose from an unauthorised recording of a Phil Collins concert in
California in 1983. The recording was made on a cassette tape recorder. It
was used to make bootleg vinyl records, cassette tapes and compact discs
which were sold through legitimate retail outlets in Germany.
Phil Collins asked a Munich court to allow him to take action against the
recording company, Imtrat Handelsgesellschaft. German copyright law would
have allowed a German performer to prevent the distribution of unauthorised
recordings.
The Munich court referred the case to the European Court for an adjudication
on whether EC law required the protection to be extended to other Community
nationals as well. The Luxembourg court held that it did.
Warner Germany, Phil Collins's record company, said yesterday's ruling
should result in revenues from pirate recordings in the country being halved
from their current level of DM200m. The company said DM85m of unauthorised
sales come from bootleg recordings made at live performances. The remainder
of the pirate market consists of unauthorised copies of legitimate albums,
as well as parallel imports.
Warner said it had decided not to put pressure on retailers to stop selling
the recordings until the European court ruling was announced. It said the
decision ended a period of uncertainty for German music outlets and it
expected that they would comply with it.
The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, which represents
record companies worldwide, said the Collins decision was a 'landmark
ruling'.
It added: 'This effectively closes a gap in EC legal protection. This gives
artists the right to say if and how their recordings are released.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Treuhand privatisation agency has secured one of the largest investments
in eastern Germany after an Anglo-American energy consortium accepted the
agency's final offer for the country's second largest brown coal field.
The commercial agreement, which entails an investment of DM670m (Pounds
272.3m) for Mitteldeutsche Braunkohle, or Mibrag, was signed between the
Treuhand and Britain's PowerGen, NRG of Minneapolis and Morrison-Knudsen of
Idaho earlier this week. The consortium is now poised to break into eastern
Germany's highly regulated energy industry after 18 months of negotiations.
'There are no hiccups left. We can now wrap up the contract,' said a
consortium negotiator. 'We have finally closed the commercial side of the
agreement for Mibrag,' said an official from Morrison-Knudsen.
The consortium, which expects to start mining operations in the Mibrag
lignite fields in January, reached agreement despite last minute concerns
from PowerGen about whether energy consumption levels in eastern Germany
would be sufficient to consume Mibrag's annual 15m-17m tonnes. At one stage,
there were fears that PowerGen would pull out of the deal completely even
though its two US partners, particularly NRG, were keen to conclude the
negotiations.
Last week, the Anglo-Americans acquired a 40 per cent stake in a power
generating plant at Schkopau, in Saxony-Anhalt which will be fuelled by
Mibrag.
The DM670m investments, which will be spread over several years, will be
targeted on one section of the giant Mibrag mining complex which the
consortium will own. A Treuhand officials said that under the terms of the
contract, the Anglo-Americans will initially guarantee 4,210 jobs. That
figure will be reduced to 2,700 by 1995 and will then stabilise at 2,300
employees the following year.
'We are not only pleased about the level of investments, and the structure
of employment,' said the official. 'But we are also getting a terrific
amount of management expertise in an industry which can, and will be, much
more competitive,' he added.
He conceded however that the kind of contracts agreed for Mibrag has set a
crucial precedent for the privatisation of Laubag, eastern Germany's other
brown coal fields in the state of Brandenburg. A consortium, led by
Rheinbraun, the brown coal subsidiary of RWE, Germany's largest utility
company, is negotiating to buy it from the Treuhand.

MR John Cahill, chairman of British Aerospace, will today meet
representatives of Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC) in an attempt to
restart stalled talks on a joint venture to build regional jet aircraft.
Mr Richard Needham, the UK trade minister, who is in Taiwan as part of an
east Asian tour will also discuss the venture with Mr Yang Shih-chien, the
vice-minister of economic affairs and the politician most closely associated
with the proposed deal. Mr Needham yesterday met Mr Hsu Li-Teh, the
vice-premier, who repeated his government's backing of the deal.
Failure of the venture would be a blow to Mr Cahill's plans to improve BAe's
performance. The company has not made a full-year pre-tax profit since 1990.
In addition, about 3,000 jobs in the UK would be put at risk.
Taiwan wants the joint venture as part of an industrial policy to bring the
island's industries into the civil aviation sector.
The previous round of talks broke up last month with both sides disagreeing
on the long-term strategy of the venture, called Avro.
Both TAC and the government's representatives this week repeated that
progress depended on a commitment that Avro would develop a new generation
of regional jets, called the RJ-X.
BAe says more research is needed to discover whether this Dollars 1.5bn
(Pounds 1bn) programme can be justified.

Gatt report
</HEADLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA's bold economic reform programme which started in 1991 has already
begun to pay off in improved competitiveness at home and abroad, but its
trade regime remains complex, distorted and difficult for traders to fathom,
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade says in a report published
yesterday
The Indian government is urged to pursue lower and more uniform tariffs,
scrap import licensing and tackle the 'still significant' anti-export bias
of trade policy.
The report says the 1991 reforms, in the wake of an economic crisis, reflect
'a paradigm shift away from economic intervention towards greater reliance
on the interplay of market forces' and mark a sharp departure from India's
previous almost closed trade regime.
Maximum tariffs have been sliced from 355 per cent to 85 per cent in 1993
and will be lowered to 50 per cent by 1997. However, the maximum tariff
continues to apply to about a quarter of tariff lines, with the result that
the average tariff has fallen less dramatically to 71 per cent from 125 per
cent in 1990-91.
Gatt says tariffs have become more dispersed and their structure remains
complicated and non-transparent. India has 'bound' (agreed not to raise)
fewer than 1 per cent of its tariffs under Gatt.
India's system of discretionary import licensing, which still affects over
one-third of tariff lines and almost all consumer goods, also comes in for
criticism from Gatt. The European Community has failed to include any
reductions in its high duties on fish imports in its latest market access
offer circulated this week to trading partners in the Uruguay Round of trade
liberalisation talks.
The omission, which on some estimates covers over half the EC's peak tariffs
(duties over 15 per cent), sits oddly with the EC's insistence that the
leading traders should slash most peak tariffs by half.
Embarrassed EC negotiators, said yesterday that Brussels was prepared to
negotiate lower tariffs against satisfactory access arrangements to foreign
fishing grounds where these did not already exist.

market

<TEXT>
JAPAN came under renewed pressure from the US yesterday to expand access for
foreign-made cars and car parts by setting targets that would serve as a
measure of progress in opening its markets.
In the first of a series of negotiations on the vehicle trade, the US
presented Japan with specific proposals. US and Japanese officials declined
to specify what these were, but there were suggestions the US proposals on
measurable targets would not be acceptable to the Japanese.
A senior Japanese official said the US plans 'go beyond the scope and
ability of the government' and called for 'excessive intervention by the
government in private business'. The Japanese government believed
quantitative targets ran counter to the principle of a free market and could
not promise that the targets would be met, the official said.
'In the end it is the consumer that makes the choice,' he said.
Japan proposed that objective criteria to assess progress in market access
could include marketing efforts by foreign parts suppliers, attempts made to
build up after-service networks and the overall competitiveness of the
industry. Foreign carmakers' product development efforts to meet Japanese
consumers' preferences and attempts to build up dealerships and sales could
also be assessed.
The calls on Japan to set quantifiable targets were not restricted to US
government officials. They were supported by representatives of the big
three US carmakers in Japan for the Tokyo motor show.
Mr Robert Lutz, president and chief operating officer of Chrysler, described
the Japanese market as having 'vestiges of a fortress mentality,' and
emphasised his support for 'firm targets to reduce the chronic bilateral
trade imbalance between the US and Japan, and to open up the Japanese market
once and for all'.
Mr Lutz pointed to restrictive regulations, a distribution system that
required the use of expensive middlemen, and high real estate prices as key
factors which had kept the Japanese market closed to foreign carmakers.
'We should not be presented with an obscene financial hurdle just to be able
to sell cars here,' Mr Lutz said.
Despite years of talking, the situation had not improved significantly for
foreign carmakers, which had only 2.2 per cent of the market, he noted.
Without improving the imbalance in cars and car parts, which accounted for
more than two-thirds of the US trade deficit with Japan, 'serious trade
frictions between the US and Japan are all but inevitable.'

FT  21 OCT 93 / US rethink on drugs
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration yesterday unveiled a new drug control policy that
it said would concentrate government efforts on reducing hard-core drug use,
instead of curbing casual use, writes George Graham in Washington.
Mr Lee Brown, director of the White House's office of national drug control
policy, said hard-core users not only accounted for most of the consumption
of such drugs as cocaine or heroine, but also caused most of the social
disruption and violence linked to drugs. The policy would also aim, Mr Brown
said, more at the treatment of drug use as a medical problem, and not just
on law enforcement.
The new policies have already come under fire from both sides of the debate.
Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, accused Mr Clinton of a 'tragic
abdication of leadership' and 'slipping inexorably into the old
permissiveness.'
But Mr Kevin Zeese of the Drug Policy Foundation, which advocates drugs
reform, complained the administration might talk about increasing emphasis
on treatment, but was still devoting most money to law enforcement.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Canadian poll puts helicopter deal at risk
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A UK-Italian consortium and Canadian defence chiefs are preparing a
last-ditch effort to dissuade leaders of Canada's Liberal party from
cancelling a CDollars 5.8bn (Pounds 2.85bn) helicopter order after next
Monday's general election.
The Liberals look almost certain to win the election. Mr Jean Chretien, the
Liberals' leader, has promised during the campaign that an incoming Liberal
government's first acts would include cancelling the order for the 50 EH-101
helicopters, which was placed in mid-1992 by the present Progressive
Conservative government.
The main contractors for the helicopter are EH Industries, a joint venture
between the UK's Westland Group and Agusta of Italy, and Paramax, a Canadian
company controlled by Unisys of the US. EH Industries will supply the basic
aircraft, while on-board systems will be provided by Paramax.
The Liberals and other opposition parties have attacked the helicopter order
as an extravagance at a time of austerity. They also question the need in
the post-Cold War era for an aircraft designed largely for anti-submarine
work.
The deal's supporters counter that the Canadian forces urgently need to
replace their ageing fleet of Sea King and Labrador helicopters. In
addition, the EH-101 order will bring substantial benefits to the Canadian
economy, including an estimated 13,000 jobs and sizeable export orders.
Contracts worth CDollars 225m have already been placed with 14 domestic
companies.
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, raised the helicopter order with Ms
Kim Campbell, Canada's prime minister, at the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo
in July. But Ms Campbell announced at the start of election campaign that
she would cut the order from 50 to 43 aircraft.
The UK is expected to renew its expressions of concern once the new
government takes office. However, the brunt of the post-election lobbying is
likely to fall on the shoulders of local contractors and the Canadian
defence department.
Senior military officers 'will want to make sure Mr Chretien does not make
any precipitous announcement before he has been briefed by the department,'
one source said. They are expected to try to persuade him to include the
helicopter deal in a wide-ranging defence policy review.

FT  21 OCT 93 / US defers prospect of Nato enlargement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TRAVEMUNDE, GERMANY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS for the enlargement of Nato yesterday receded when the US tabled a
'partnership for peace' proposal, which instead foresees a series of
agreements strengthening ties with eastern Europe.
The US proposal for individually negotiated defence agreements between Nato
and former members of the Warsaw Pact will be discussed by Nato defence
ministers in Travemunde, Germany, today.
It is seen as an attempt to take the steam out of discussions on a future
enlargement of the alliance to include some of its former enemies.
Nato fears that by inviting some countries to join, it would alienate Russia
and create divisions in eastern Europe.
A Nato summit, due to address the issue in January, is unlikely to make any
specific commitment on enlargement beyond stating that the alliance is not a
'closed shop', according to allied officials.
'At some stage, the enlargement of Nato is an option which cannot be ruled
out,' Mr Malcolm Rifkind, British defence secretary, said.
But he hinted that this would be a number of years away. In the meantime, it
was important to build 'substantive' military links.
The US proposal would mean each eligible country would negotiate a bilateral
agreement with Nato. This would not involve extending to eastern Europe Nato
allies' pledge to come to each other's defence. 'Nobody is talking about
security guarantees at the moment,' one official said.
The plan would include Russia but its relationship would be different from
countries such as the Czech Republic, Poland or Hungary.
Similar agreements would also be open to neutral or non-aligned countries,
such as Sweden and Austria. They would involve differing degrees of
co-operation, for instance in peace-keeping, military training and
assistance.
Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, who has actively promoted
discussion of Nato enlargement, made clear he was still pressing for an
eventual extension of membership. But he was not calling for eligible
countries to be identified or for a timetable for entry.
The US proposal is not seen as prejudicing the membership issue at a
subsequent stage or the idea of a possible intermediate affiliation status.
The US plan still has to be discussed with France, which is not represented
at the informal two-day meeting. France has also been anxious for Nato to
de-emphasise the enlargement issue.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Brazil scandal opens door to opportunity: The possible
spin-off from corruption allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS already being called 'Collor 2'. What began as wild allegations from a
former government official have ignited Brazil's biggest corruption scandal
since last year's resignation in disgrace of President Fernando Collor.
The scandal broke when the magazine Veja] published an interview with Mr
Jose Carlos dos Santos, until last year a senior official in the
government's budget department. Mr Santos claimed 29 politicians - including
four senators, three state governors and five former and acting government
ministers - were involved in the corruption scheme.
This allegedly channelled 'fees' from construction companies to scheme
members, many of whom sat on the congressional budget committee, in return
for their approving building projects in the annual budget.
The allegations were seized on by Brazil's press, which has adopted a
campaigning and moral tone since playing a leading role in Mr Collor's
downfall. In Braslia the ensuing furore led to two days of confusion in the
government.
A special parliamentary inquiry, which started work yesterday, has 45 days
to probe the claims. It can call any witnesses and gain access to private
bank accounts.
The problem of political corruption is deep-rooted in Brazil. Because the
party system is weak, individual politicians, often with strong links to
sectors such as the construction industry, are expected to spend, or promise
spending, in order to win election.
The country's legal system is also seen as too ineffective to pursue corrupt
individuals through the courts.
Congress has yet to show it can tackle its own weaknesses and admit any of
its members are corrupt.
The scandal has broken at a crucial time for Brazil, which started a
constitutional review two weeks ago. Political leaders say the inquiry can
run in parallel with the review, but several congressmen admit privately
that the review is threatened. 'With so many problems, I don't think
Congress will have the necessary will to proceed,' one said.
This raises a problem for the government, which hoped the review would allow
important economic changes to Brazil's 1988 nationalist constitution, with
its barriers to foreign investment in key sectors.
But it also presents an opportunity. According to government officials, one
constitutional weakness is that Congress has too much power and the
executive is often helpless to implement policy. With Congress weakened by
the corruption allegations, and worried about further tarnishing to its
public image, some analysts say the government can take the initiative.
Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, finance minister, is due to meet President
Itamar Franco today and seek permission to make use of this opportunity. Mr
Cardoso hopes to announce a new phase in the country's privatisation
programme, already delayed by several weeks, and combine it with a package
of fiscal measures.
He wants to try to eliminate this year's budget deficit of Dollars 6bn
(Pounds 3.9bn) and balance next year's budget, which otherwise could be
Dollars 25bn in deficit. A big budget deficit would prolong Brazil's
inflation agony; annualised price increases now run at nearly 2,000 per
cent.
Mr Cardoso is thought to be seeking a new upper tax bracket of 35 per cent,
a widening of the tax on financial transactions and quicker collection of
taxes on tobacco and alcohol.
This package is likely to raise only about Dollars 6bn in 1994 and business
groups in Brazil, as well as the country's foreign creditors, will be
looking for widespread spending cuts too. After listening to Mr Cardoso's
promises of firm action since he took office in June, the groups are
impatient for change.

FT  21 OCT 93 / US drug policy aims to reduce hard-core use
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration yesterday unveiled a new drug control policy that
it said would concentrate the government's efforts on reducing hard-core
drug use, instead of curbing casual use.
Mr Lee Brown, director of the White House's office of national drug control
policy, said hard-core users not only accounted for most of the consumption
of such drugs as cocaine or heroine, but also caused most of the social
disruption and violence linked to drugs. The policy would also aim, Mr Brown
said, more at the treatment of drug use as a medical problem, and not just
on law enforcement.
'We must be prepared to focus as never before on solutions to the problems
of heavy drug use from both the criminal justice and public health
perspectives,' he told the Senate judiciary committee yesterday in
presenting his new interim strategy.
Nevertheless, Mr Brown firmly rebuffed those who have called for the
legalisation of some drugs as a better way of tackling the drug problem.
'The administration is, without any reservation, opposed to the
legalisation, decriminalisation or medicalisation of illegal drugs,' he
said.
The new policies have already come under fire from both sides of the debate.
Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican, accused Mr Clinton of a 'tragic
abdication of leadership' and 'slipping inexorably into the old
permissiveness.'
But Mr Kevin Zeese of the Drug Policy Foundation, an institute advocating
drugs reform, complained that the administration might talk about increasing
the emphasis on treatment, but was still devoting most money to law
enforcement.
'This so-called strategy still gives law enforcement a two to one advantage
in funding. That is not change,' Mr Zeese said.
The US has spent Dollars 38.5bn on the 'war on drugs' over the past four
years but the drug use statistics suggest that this money has done little
either to control supplies of narcotics coming into the country or to curb
demand among drug users.
The administration has found it hard to persuade Congress to shift money
away from some older programmes and towards its new initiatives.
Mr Brown said the new programme would expand the US's capacity to treat drug
addicts and compel convicted criminals to complete treatments, with spending
concentrated on inner cities.
Efforts to deter first time drug use would target inner city youths,
children and pregnant women, and would include underage alcohol abuse as
part of the larger drug problem, Mr Brown said.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Christopher cautions EC over Gatt: Europe seen as greatest
obstacle to successful trade deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, reminded western Europe
yesterday that the US attaches as much importance to economic co-operation
as it does to improving the security partnership.
In a speech prior to leaving on a trip to Hungary, Russia, the Baltics and
three other former Soviet republics he identified the European Community
rather than Japan and Asia as presenting the greatest obstacle to a
successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations by the
December 15 deadline.
He acknowledged that none of the necessary trade-offs, especially in
agriculture, would be easy but added: 'To our friends in Europe, let me
restate that preserving common security across the Atlantic requires us to
focus not only on Nato' but on the trade round, where the global economic
consequences of failure would be 'very severe and dangerous'.
Mr Christopher, under attack at home for his stewardship of US foreign
policy in Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia, caused consternation in Europe at the
weekend when he said Washington had for too long been too 'Eurocentric' and
that western Europe should realise it was no longer 'the dominant area of
the world'.
While clearly nettled by recent European criticism, the secretary of state
may also have been sending a call to the EC that he expected support from
the continent to help sustain the US global role. At a dinner in Washington
on Tuesday night, Mr Egon Klepsch, president of the European Parliament,
agreed that Europe needed to demonstrate such support.
Mr Christopher also warned China that it might be difficult to justify
extension of most-favoured-nation trading status next summer unless Beijing
improved its human rights record, trade practices and co-operation on
nuclear non-proliferation.
Pressure from the US Congress was such, he said, that it was vital China
demonstrated such progress in the coming months rather than next spring, 'so
that there's not a huge build-up of pressure for us to lift the MFN'.
However, attempts by Congress to impose more immediate controls over foreign
policy appeared yesterday to be abating. The Senate easily defeated one
Republican amendment that would have prohibited US troops from serving under
the command of other nations in UN peacekeeping operations. It also appeared
that Senator Bob Dole's proposed limits on any military intervention in
Haiti was no longer a threat. The Republican leader, who has admitted that
if he were president he would oppose his own amendment, was trying yesterday
to modify his proposal.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Milosevic calls early poll in Serbia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Slobodan Milosevic last night dissolved Serbia's parliament and
called elections for December 19.
The move follows the collapse of the unofficial coalition between his ruling
Socialists and the ultranationalist Serbian Radical party of Mr Vojislav
Seselj.
Mr Milosevic has seized the initiative by calling elections three years
early and before facing an economic deluge brought on by two years of war
and 17 months of United Nations sanctions.
Nevertheless, he is confident that the Socialists will win a majority they
lost last month after falling out with Mr Seselj. Mr Milosevic will not be
up for election himself.
He needs to get rid of Mr Seselj, once his favourite 'opposition' politician
who also commands a fierce paramilitary unit, in order to clean out
nationalist extremists who would block a political compromise that might
permit the lifting of sanctions. The UN imposed sanctions on Serbia for its
role in the violent carve-up of Bosnia.
Inflation is running at 2,000 per cent a month, shops are empty and Serbia's
cities this winter are likely to be without heating or public transport.
However, Mr Milosevic appears to be counting for victory on the level of
fear and uncertainty among the increasingly discontented 9.8m population.
'He is staying a step ahead of the collapse of the government. He knows that
winter elections favour his governing party. They might not win in the
spring,' said a western diplomat.
Also, his pre-emptive strike exposes a quarrelsome and disorganised
democratic opposition which will be hard-pressed to mount a serious
challenge to the Socialists.
Mr Milosevic probably has a few tricks left up his sleeve to further
discredit Mr Seselj, who has been the victim of a smear campaign on
state-run television over the past month.
Speaking last night on Television Serbia, the president blamed unnamed
parties for 'blocking parliament' calling on Serbia's citizens to elect 'a
parliament which they could take pride in'.

</HEADLINE>

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl's controversial conservative candidate for the German
state presidency, Mr Steffen Heitmann, is a passionate believer that
Germany's 'special role' in the post-war world is finished.
'I believe the post-war era has come to an end,' he told the parliamentary
caucus of his Christian Democratic Union on Tuesday night. 'Germany had a
disastrous special role forced upon it after 1945. As far as I am concerned,
that time is past.'
Quite what he means by the phrase is unclear. Mr Heitmann won resounding
applause from his party colleagues in the Bundestag. Yet it arouses deep
foreboding in the world at large.
Chancellor Kohl and a clear majority of his CDU have closed ranks behind Mr
Heitmann, hitherto a rather retiring justice minister in Saxony, to insist
that he is the right man to take over the German presidency from Mr Richard
von Weizsacker, who steps down next year. Representatives of both the CDU
and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, nominated him last night.
At an extraordinary meeting of the parliamentary group this week, his
supporters booed and whistled at the respected president of the Bundestag,
Mrs Rita Sussmuth, when she questioned his conservative views on the role of
women in German society. It was clear that the widespread criticism of the
chancellor's choice, in the German media, from the opposition Social
Democrats, and from the minority Free Democratic party in the ruling
coalition, has caused the party to dig in for the defence.
Yet what is most remarkable about Mr Heitmann is his very unremarkableness.
As he says himself about his own role in East Germany before the revolution:
'I was never much of a hero.' He is rather quiet, rather grey, and rather
insecure. This was his biggest public appearance so far.
Most of his political views are unexceptionable, well within the mainstream
of good Christian Democratic thinking in Germany. But he lacks the
sophistication of a western politician to present it for public consumption.
Mr Heitmann had a tough childhood growing up in the ruins of Dresden after
the war. His father died in a Russian camp in 1945. His mother died of TB
when he was 12.
He clearly feels very strongly on issues like abortion. He has linked the
debate on liberalising abortion to the rise in youthful violence against
foreigners. The latter, he believes, is largely a reflection of broken
families and unloving parents. Those who would ease the abortion laws in
Germany reflect the same lack of love.
The election for the next state president is not until May. But all the main
political parties are now locked in to the struggle with party political
candidates. Mr Heitmann seems determined to stay the course.

<TEXT>
RUSSIA deployed troops yesterday to guard rail and sea links in Georgia, as
battered Georgian troops sought to take the offensive against rebel forces
of the deposed president, Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia.
The Russian foreign ministry in Moscow said troops were being assigned to
guard a strategic railway that runs from Georgia's Black Sea port of Poti to
neighbouring Azerbaijan and Armenia, in accordance with a request from Mr
Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader. Mr Shevardnadze had appealed on
Tuesday for military help from Russia and other ex-Soviet republics in the
Commonwealth of Independent States.
However, Russia made clear it would not get involved in the fighting. A
presidential spokesman in Moscow said Russia's intervention was a
peacekeeping action to protect transport and crucial supply lifelines and
did not constitute interference in Georgia's internal affairs. Moscow
expected units would also be sent by Azerbaijan and Armenia.
A senior Russian official in Tbilisi said 20 truck loads of Russian soldiers
had been sent to defend the railway from their base in Batumi, western
Georgia, and had now taken control of part of the line to Tbilisi. Mr
Gamsakhurdia's control over the railway has given him a partial stranglehold
on the capital, where officials said food rationing would have to begin
soon.
The Georgian rebels advanced in recent days to within 12km of Kutaisi, the
country's second city. Georgia's defence minister, General Georgy
Karkiashvili, is in the city to organise his troops.
In a possible revival of its fortunes, the Georgian government claimed its
forces yesterday had retaken the port of Poti and two other towns,
Lanchkhuti and Khoni, with hardly a shot fired. It also claimed to have
repulsed an armoured assault by rebels trying to break through to Kutaisi.
The loss of Kutaisi would be another serious blow to Mr Shevardnadze. The
former Soviet foreign minister last month suffered the loss of the
north-west province of Abkhazia to separatists.

Mr Andrei Makarov, a prominent lawyer who plans to run for parliament, said
he wanted to devote his time to politics. But friends say the real reason is
that he is pessimistic about the prospects for fighting corruption, and
believes there are too many high-placed officials having a vested interest

President Boris Yeltsin has signed a decree to force Russian enterprises to
settle debts incurred between themselves, it was announced yesterday, writes
Leyla Boulton from Moscow.
The decree provides for the issue of promissory notes which would enable
creditors to sell enterprises' debts to other companies if they remained
unpaid. The holders of such debts could then try to recover them by starting
bankruptcy proceedings against the indebted enterprise.
With inflation very high and enterprises prepared to deliver goods to each
other without payment, many have found it not only more profitable, but
possible, to drag out payment indefinitely.

French industrial production rose strongly in July and August, increasing by
1.3 per cent over June, according to figures from Insee, the national
statistics institute. Manufacturing output rose by 0.7 per cent during the
period, writes John Ridding in Paris.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, said the figures supported his
forecast that economic activity would stabilise in the current quarter and
return to growth in 1994.
Private sector economists and Insee, however, expressed caution. Insee
described the statistics as 'fragile', adding that data for the summer
period were less reliable than for other months. Industrial output in July
and August, lumped together because of the summer holidays, was still 2.9
per cent down on the same period last year.
Striking Air France workers were warned yesterday by Mr Bernard Bosson,
transport minister, that the government would use force 'if necessary' to
clear them from the runways at the two main Paris airports, writes Alice
Rawsthorn in Paris.
Both Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports were yesterday thrown into chaos
for the second successive day because of the strike by employees, who are
protesting against proposals to cut 4,000 jobs and to reduce overtime pay at
the loss-making national airline.

THE SWEDISH economy will shrink by 2.8 per cent this year, its worst
performance since the second world war, according to the government, writes
Christopher Brown-Humes from Stockholm. The forecast is much more
pessimistic than the one it gave in April predicting a 1.7 per cent decline.
However, it expects 1993 to be the low point, with GNP growth of 1.9 per
cent next year and 2.9 per cent in 1995.
No growth in private consumption is likely next year, and public consumption
is forecast to fall 1.3 per cent. Unemployment will rise to 8.4 per cent,
excluding those on training schemes, before falling to 7.9 per cent in 1995.
New measures to help achieve a targeted SKr81bn (Pounds 6.8bn) strengthening
of the budget over five years were also unveiled yesterday. They include
higher individual social security charges and reduced subsidies for
dentistry and medical prescriptions.

<TEXT>
THE head of President Boris Yeltsin's anti-corruption commission yesterday
said he was quitting and warned Russia's leaders not to miss a rare chance
to tackle corruption.
Mr Andrei Makarov, a prominent lawyer who plans to run for parliament, said
he wanted to devote his time to politics. The recent appointment of Mr
Andrei Kazannik as a new 'honest and competent' prosecutor-general after the
suppression of the parliamentary uprising had also removed the need for the
extraordinary commission, he said.
But friends say the real reason for his departure is that he is pessimistic
about the prospects for fighting corruption, and believes there are too many
high-placed officials having a vested interest in seeing his commission
disbanded.
The commission was set up this summer after Mr Alexander Rutskoi, then
vice-president, accused several ministers and close presidential aides of
corruption.
Mr Makarov rejected suggestions that his commission had settled political
scores for Mr Yeltsin, saying that it had been created because the former
prosecutor-general, Mr Valentin Stepankov, had been doing a one-sided job on
behalf of Mr Yeltsin's enemies.
The commission's work resulted in the sacking of Mr Victor Barannikov,
security minister, and of Mr Andrei Dunayev, first deputy interior minister.
Mr Barannikov was not among those accused by the vice-president, and he
later joined him in the White House as security minister of a parallel
government set up by parliament.
While clearing the names of Mr Vladimir Shumeiko and Mr Mikhail Poltoranin,
two close presidential aides accused by Mr Rutskoi, the commission also
accused the vice-president himself of being 'associated' with a Swiss bank
account.
Before he leaves his post, Mr Makarov will submit proposals for a strategy
to fight corruption relying heavily on economic reforms. Some are already
being pushed through, such as liberalising of foreign trade to reduce the
role of export licences and import subsidies, a serious source of graft.

<TEXT>
WEST GERMAN indicators suggest the economy is stabilising, the economics
ministry said yesterday, as the growth of money supply edged closer to the
Bundesbank's target range and money market interest rates fell slightly.
Both events indicated a more stable environment for the central bank to
continue its series of cautious reductions in short-term interest rates,
economists suggested.
Meanwhile, the ministry's monthly report pointed to a 'slightly less
pessimistic' assessment by businesses of the current situation, for the
first time in the past year. This coincided with a marginal improvement in
demand in the manufacturing sector, and a stabilisation in industry as a
whole.
However, economists suggested that today's meeting of the Bundesbank's
central council would not bring further cuts in the key discount rate,
presently at 6.25 per cent.
The M3 measure of money supply grew at a seasonally adjusted annualised rate
of 7 per cent last month, compared with 7.2 per cent in August and the
bank's upper target limit of 6.5 per cent. However, total money supply rose
moderately during the month after weakening in August, the bank added, and
bank lending had increased again after falling in the previous month.
The rate of capital formation - the transfer of funds into long-term
deposits, which are not included in the calculation of M3 - also slowed
markedly last month.
The Bundesbank yesterday resumed its fine-tuning of money market interest
rates with a reduction from 6.7 per cent to 6.67 per cent in its securities
repurchase rate, a move which had been widely discounted.
But, the latest ministry report warns that structural adjustment by German
companies is likely to mean that economic recovery will continue to be
extremely hesitant. It suggests that wage agreements reached so far in the
current pay round clearly reflect the precarious position. It also points to
a further deterioration in unemployment.
In east Germany, the monthly economic statistics continue to show big
variations, reflecting in part the sporadic nature of orders for exports
from former clients in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
Both imports and exports for Germany as a whole have shown a sharp decline
over the past year. In the first seven months of 1993, imports were down
17.2 per cent, and exports down 13.8 per cent.
Germany's visible trade balance for the period increased to DM25.3bn (Pounds
10.2bn), from DM14.6bn for the same period of 1992. Its deficit on the
invisible account rose from DM10.7bn to DM21.9bn.

Norway's main opposition Centre party yesterday tabled a motion in
parliament calling for withdrawal of the country's application for
membership of the European Community, writes Karen Fossli from Oslo.
The proposal, made at the start of a two-day debate on the King's speech,
initiated a stormy parliamentary session, with the Centre party promising to
flex its muscles at every opportunity to demonstrate new-found political
strength after overtaking the pro-EC Conservative party in the election.
Few political analysts believe the proposal will win majority backing of the
Storting when it is put to a vote tonight. Recent opinion polls on EC
membership show opposition running at an unprecedented 56-60 per cent
against the move. The governing Labour party is split on the issue but says
the electorate must be given the opportunity to vote on membership in a
referendum, probably by 1996, if the country is to have a strong negotiating
position with Brussels.

FRENCH industrial production rose strongly in July and August, increasing by
1.3 per cent over June, according to figures from Insee, the national
statistics institute. Manufacturing output rose by 0.7 per cent during the
period.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, said the figures were encouraging
and supported his forecasts of a stabilisation in economic activity in the
current quarter and a return to growth in 1994.
Private sector economists and Insee, however, expressed caution. Insee
described the statistics as 'fragile', adding that data for the summer
period were less reliable than for other months. Industrial output in July
and August, lumped together because of the summer holidays, was still 2.9
per cent down on the same period last year.
'The numbers are higher than expected,' said one Paris-based economist, who
had forecast a rise of 0.3 per cent in July-August. 'But there is a
relatively important margin of error. They signal a stabilisation of the
situation rather than a recovery from recession.' Several economists believe
France could suffer a 'double-dip' recession, with a contraction in the
fourth quarter after recovery in the third.
The government itself remains cautious about the performance of the economy.
Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, budget minister, said this week that gross domestic
product was likely to contract by 1 per cent this year, instead of the 0.8
per cent decline forecast last month at the launch of next year's budget. He
maintained the government's forecast of 1.4 per cent growth in GDP next
year.
French industrialists also expect recovery in 1994, but at a slower pace. A
forecast by the CNPF employers' organisation, based on a large-scale survey
of member companies estimates growth of 1 per cent in 1994. The
industrialists in the survey said they expected recovery would be slow and
difficult.
The CPNF said that a reduction in short-term interest rates to between 5 and
6 per cent, from their current level of about 7 per cent, was possible and
necessary for economic recovery next year.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Kohl learns to say Nein to EC partners: A unified Germany
wants more from Brussels in return for its role of paymaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOR more than five years, there was an unwritten rule in EC budget
negotiations: sit tight, if necessary through the night, and wait for
Chancellor Helmut Kohl to cough up the money.
These days, the EC can no longer count on Mr Kohl's grand coeur. Weighed
down by the costs of unification, Germany is less willing to play the role
of paymaster, less reticent about pushing its national interests, and more
unpredictable in its behaviour within the Community.
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, has sensed the mood
swing. He has given a spate of interviews and speeches in Germany, warning
Germans about the risks of becoming wrapped up in post-unification problems
and ignoring the wider interests of her European neighbours. German-watchers
in Brussels believe that German assertiveness within the EC is the
inevitable consequence of its new size and power. 'This will require
adjustments for everybody,' says one EC official, 'including France.'
Perhaps the most dramatic expression of the national interest was during the
collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism last August. Bundesbank and
finance ministry officials refused not only to succumb to French pressure to
force the D-Mark out of the ERM; they also struck a deal with the Dutch to
maintain the old 4.5 per cent fluctuation margin with the guilder. The rest
of the ERM currencies reverted to 30 per cent fluctuation margins.
Such assertiveness should not be interpreted as a shift in Germany's
European policy. Despite signs that German public opinion is more lukewarm
about the EC than for many years, Mr Kohl has refused to compromise on his
enthusiasm for the Maastricht treaty and the desirability of deeper European
integration.
On the other hand, Brussels officials have identified several issues which
reflect the Bonn government's recent willingness to say Nein to its EC
partners.
An insistence that German farmers be compensated for the revaluation of the
D-Mark as a result of the suspension of the ERM. Bonn wants full operation
of the so-called 'switchover' mechanism, even though the future costs to the
EC budget could be prohibitive.
A refusal to abide by EC limits on the amount of land which can be sown with
cereals in eastern Germany. Germany argues that Brussels miscalculated the
'base area' in 1992 by failing to include 180,000 ha devoted to maize.
An informal non-aggression pact with the US covering potential
telecommunications sanctions. Brussels argues that the pact challenged the
principle of a unified EC trade policy; German officials say the row has
been quietly buried.
German insistence that the Ekostahl steel plant in former East Germany
should be considered eligible for some state subsidies. Brussels officials
believe this stubbornness could wreck efforts to reach a deal to reconstruct
Europe's ailing steel industry.
A senior German official argues that Ekostahl is a test case. The EC should
show more flexibility, recognising that arrangements for reductions of steel
capacity in Italy and Spain are unlikely to be water-tight. The closure of
Ekostahl would invite an anti-EC backlash throughout the east, he says. The
EC is already planning to double its aid to east Germany next year from the
current annual figure of Ecu1bn (Pounds 770m). But some EC officials believe
that more needs to be done. One senior official notes that East Germany
failed to win the same generous 'derogations' on agriculture which were
accorded to Spain and Portugal during their entry negotiations. Yet as a
former Communist country, East Germany's problems of transition were
arguably more severe. 'Remember the second language was Russian, not
English,' he says.
One of the most sensitive questions regarding post-unification Germany is
its political weight within the EC. A recent paper by Mr Karl Lamers,
foreign affairs spokesman of the ruling Christian Democrat Union, advocated
strengthening the voting rights of the big powers in the EC.
Though the Lamers paper did not enjoy official status, it received support
in some parts of the Bonn bureaucracy. The proposition that a country with
80m people should have greater voting strength in an enlarged Community has
a certain logic, but it remains controversial for historical and political
reasons.
The signs are that Bonn has modified its position on institutional reform,
mainly because Mr Kohl has no desire to jeopardise the enlargement
negotiations with Finland, Norway, Sweden and Austria. At the same time,
countries such as France recognise that the pure application of demographics
would inevitably break voting parity with Germany.
However, its seems that Brussels and the member states will have to adjust
their policies to accommodate Germany. Hence the willingness of France and
the UK to cave in quietly to Mr Kohl's campaign to bring the European
Monetary Institute to Germany, most likely Frankfurt. 'It is the price for
Germany giving up the Deutschemark,' says one French official.
France is ready to support putting the European Monetary Institute, embryo
of the European central bank, in Germany, according to Mr Alain Juppe,
France's foreign minister, in an interview appearing in today's in the
Rheinischer Merkur newspaper, writes David Buchan in Paris.
However, France is not prepared to endorse siting the EMI specifically in
Frankfurt, as Chancellor Helmut Kohl insists should be decided at next
week's EC summit. France fears that choosing Frankfurt might whip up concern
in at home about German hegemony, but seems increasingly to accept that this
may be the only way of stirring German enthusiasm for eventual monetary
union. Lyons, France's official candidate, was yesterday still hopeful of
emerging as a compromise choice for the European bank.

THE IRISH government and the European Commission yesterday clashed over
regional aid, in what officials on both sides fear could be a widening row
spreading into next week's EC summit in Brussels.
Dublin fears it will not now get the IPounds 7.8bn (Pounds 7.5bn) in
structural aid it believes it was promised after negotiations in July, when
Ireland threatened to veto the EC's regional aid programme totalling
Ecu157bn (Pounds 122bn) for 1994-99.
The Irish foreign minister, Mr Dick Spring, flew to Brussels last night for
urgent talks about the issue.
Mr Spring's mission - he was meeting Commission president Jacques Delors and
other officials - was understood to have been given the go-ahead after
high-level contacts throughout yesterday between Dublin and EC officials.
Irish officials claim Mr Delors is going back on the pledge he gave to Mr
Spring in the early hours of July 20, when Dublin lifted its veto on the
regional aid programme.
But Mr Delors responded angrily yesterday, telling RTE, Irish Television: 'I
always have the custom of fulfilling my promises; this is a lie.'
The Commission meets in special session this morning to decide on a proposal
from Mr Bruce Millan, commissioner for regional policy, which would give
Ireland only between IPounds 7.1bn and IPounds 7.2bn.
A decision was delayed at yesterday's weekly meeting of the EC executive,
when Ireland's commissioner, Mr Padraig Flynn, invoked a rarely used
internal Commission regulation to demand a postponement. Mr Flynn said
yesterday that the lower payment was 'not in accordance with the agreement
between Ireland and the Commission'.
One Irish source described the dispute as 'the biggest political row in 20
years of (Irish) membership of the Community' and forecast an 'untidy' EC
summit next week.

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community leaders are likely to back Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy next
week as a compromise candidate to head the European Monetary Institute,
forerunner of a European central bank.
Mr Lamfalussy was nominated for the post by EC central bank governors
yesterday in a move which increases the likelihood of a deal at next week's
Brussels summit on the sensitive question of where to site the European
central bank. Frankfurt is the leading contender.
But his selection, if confirmed, may disappoint enthusiasts for European
monetary union who were looking for a political heavyweight to give added
impetus to the process of economic and monetary integration.
The EMI will prepare for full European economic and monetary union by 1999,
strengthening the co-ordination of EC members' monetary policies and
supervising all aspects of the development of a single currency.
Mr Lamfalussy, a Belgian, is currently general manager of the Bank for
International Settlements, which is owned by 33 central banks. He would hold
the office of EMI president for three years initially, beginning on January
1, 1994, when the next stage of Emu is due to start. He would not
necessarily become president of a European central bank.
The governors' recommendation was announced in a letter from Mr Wim
Duisenberg, head of the Dutch central bank and chairman of the EC central
bank governors' committee, to Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime
minister, who will chair next week's summit.
EC leaders will consider the Lamfalussy nomination along with bids for the
location of the EMI and the central bank, as well as lesser institutions.
EC finance ministers and the European parliament will be consulted on the
nomination before the summit, as required by the Maastricht treaty.

and coins; that EC rules prohibit British oak from being used for
Euro-furniture because it is too knotty; and that charity shops will not be
able to sell second-hand toys.
These findings appear in a new British Foreign Office study published today
which aims to lay to rest some of the wilder stories about Community-wide
legislation, particularly that involving the Single European Act. The
project is the inspiration of Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign
secretary, and a firm supporter of his country's EC membership.
Mr Hurd's pamphlet on 'Euro-myths and Euro-scares' is an attempt to better
inform a British public notoriously ambivalent about the Community.
However, it is also a counter-blast against British Euro-sceptics who
hijacked the recent conference of the ruling Conservative party. In a
self-penned introduction, Mr Hurd appeals for a British sense of fair play.
The Single Market obviously requires EC legislation, both to protect the
British business selling abroad and the British consumer buying goods from
elsewhere in the EC. 'But we need to strike the right balance,' he says.
The Foreign Office used Britain's popular press as the source for many of
the Euro-myths, but it also concedes that some of the fairy-tales are
grounded in fact. Hence, it is true that EC rules will restrict British wine
production, even though the UK is a minnow compared with France, Germany,
Italy, and Spain. EC rules say that countries producing more than 2.5m
litres of wine may not plant new vines.
It is also fact that carrots are listed as a fruit under a 1979 EC directive
on jam.
This was agreed so that the Portuguese could continue using carrots in the
production of jam.
Less black and white, perhaps, is the British view on the EC directive on
limiting the working week to 48 hours. Despite the support of 11 other EC
member states, Her Majesty's government position remains that the law is
'pointless, unwelcome and will be challenged in the European Court of
Justice' once it has been adopted.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Ireland and Brussels clash on aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Irish government and the European Commission yesterday clashed over
regional aid, in what officials on both sides fear could be a widening row
spreading into next week's EC summit in Brussels.
Dublin fears it will not now get the IPounds 7.8bn (Pounds 7.5bn) in
structural aid it believes it was promised after marathon negotiations in
Brussels in July, during which Ireland threatened to veto the EC's Ecu157bn
(Pounds 122bn) regional aid programme for 1994-1999.
Irish officials say Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, is going
back on the pledge he gave to Mr Dick Spring, Ireland's foreign minister, in
the early hours of July 20 when Dublin lifted its veto. Mr Delors responded
angrily yesterday, telling RTE, Irish Television: 'I always have the custom
of fulfilling my promises; this is a lie.'
The Commission meets in special session this morning to decide on a proposal
from Mr Bruce Millan, commissioner for regional policy, which would give
Ireland only around Irish IPounds 7.2bn.
A decision was delayed at yesterday's weekly meeting of the EC executive,
when Ireland's commissioner, Mr Padraig Flynn, invoked a rarely used
internal Commission regulation to demand a postponement.
Mr Flynn said yesterday that the lower payment was 'not in accordance with
the agreement between Ireland and the Commission'.
In the interim, the Irish prime minister, Mr Albert Reynolds, has had
several telephone conversations with Mr Delors, and Dublin was last night
considering sending a high-level delegation to Brussels.
One Irish source described the dispute as 'the biggest political row in 20
years of (Irish) membership of the Community' and forecast an 'untidy' EC
summit next week.
Ireland's share of the 1994-99 structural aid budget comes from the
Ecu96.3bn devoted to backward regions of the Community, whose per capita
income is below 75 per cent of the EC average.
The four poorest, or 'cohesion' countries - Ireland, Spain, Portugal and
Greece - will get Ecu70bn of this, plus an additional Ecu15.5bn from the
so-called Cohesion Fund, devoted to helping them catch up with the
Community's environment and transport infrastructure standards.
In the three long rounds of ministerial horse-trading in July, however, the
Commission pledged Ecu2bn more to so-called Objective 1 member states than
it has to give, senior Brussels officials confirmed yesterday.
As well as Ireland, Greece, Portugal and Italy are unhappy with their
allocations, while Germany and the UK, the EC's main paymasters, are certain
to insist the regional aid ceiling agreed at the 1992 Edinburgh summit is
not exceeded.
Under the 1989-93 structural aid budget, sparsely populated Ireland received
between two and two-and-a-half times more funding per head than its three
'cohesion' partners.
One senior Commission official said that even on the lowest figures now
cited, Ireland is still 'measurably in front of the other three.'
Mr Delors said, however, that what the Commission was discussing today was a
'minimum, indicative number', which could rise later.
The government of Mr Reynolds, however, now finds itself in a political
bind, having written IPounds 8bn in EC funding into its IPounds 20bn
national development plan for the next five years.
Mr Millan remarked yesterday: 'I daresay when you're talking about money,
lots of people get disappointed.'

FT  21 OCT 93 / SIB sets out plan to free up Pounds 84bn unit trust industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS FOR deregulating the Pounds 84bn unit trust industry were put
forward yesterday by the Securities and Investments Board, the chief
regulator for financial services, but the consultation paper does not
resolve the deep divisions in the industry about the future method of
pricing unit trusts.
Instead it says that 'dual pricing' should remain in place for the moment,
albeit in a slightly simplified form, while the debate about moving to a
system of single pricing must continue.
Responses to the consultation paper are due by the end of February next
year, and the SIB hopes to bring forward draft regulations on some aspects
of the changes in 1994.
In dual pricing, potential investors see both an 'offer' price, at which
they could buy units, and a lower 'bid' price at which they could sell. The
difference between the two figures reflects charges and costs.
Many in the industry favour a single pricing system which is easier for
investors to understand and which is commonly used outside the UK.
There are a number of options for single pricing, and no single option has
attracted overwhelming support among fund managers who favour the change.
Other suggestions in the paper include:
Liberalising the charging structures, so as to allow exit fees for all types
of fund, and performance-related fees for geared futures and options funds
only;
Replacing SIB's list of approved securities and derivatives markets for unit
trust purposes with a duty on managers to ensure that the markets, where
they invest, meet certain criteria. The change would allow unit trusts to
invest in a much wider range of emerging markets.
There was disappointment from some in the industry, notably Gartmore fund
managers, the fourth largest fund manager in the UK, that the lack of a
consensus had made it impossible to agree on single-pricing for unit trusts.
But the SIB's proposal that single pricing should be used for the open-ended
investment company (OEIC), which is common in other European Community
member states and which is to be introduced in the UK, will increase the
prospects that there will eventually be a move to single-pricing for unit
trusts as well.
In the meantime, the two systems would run parallel.
The Treasury is to publish a consultation paper by the end of the year about
the introduction of the OEIC in the UK.
Pressure for loosening the regulation of the industry seems to have come
mainly from the ready availability in the UK of offshore funds, which have
greater flexibility.
It is also in tune with the government's current drive towards deregulation.
The draft regulations to be issued by the SIB next year could also
incorporate likely changes to the EC directive on undertakings for
collective investment in transferable securities, which is being revised at
the present time.

FT  21 OCT 93 / 10,000 jobs may go as more pits face closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST half of the 30 surviving coal pits in Britain are expected to be
shut down following British Coal's decision yesterday to set in motion a
final round of closures before privatisation.
The disclosure of the move, expected to result in the loss of 10,000 jobs,
brought a scathing House of Commons attack from opposition parties but only
a muted protest from the Conservative backbench MPs who last year halted the
original closure programme.
The corporation's announcement of talks with unions on the future of its
collieries came as the government further angered opposition parties and
miners by saying it would repeal next month an 85-year-old act restricting
underground working hours.
However, Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, provided some comfort for the 20,000
remaining underground miners and managers by extending existing enhanced
redundancy terms, allowing payments of up to Pounds 37,000, until April 30.
British Coal said it would conduct talks under the Modified Colliery Review
Procedure, which can delay closure implementations for up to nine months.
Closures announced last year were ruled illegal by the High Court after
British Coal suspended the MCRP.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said that by April the
workforce would be 10,000 compared with 40,000 a year ago. But his charges
that the government had 'rigged the market' against coal and was seeking a
return to 19th century working practices failed to evoke more than an air of
disgruntled resignation among Tory MPs.
British Coal would not say yesterday which pits were earmarked for closure,
or how many were involved. However industry analysts expect at least half of
the remaining 30 mines to close. Twenty-one have been closed in the past
year.
Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, said the
government was hoping to close more pits 'by stealth' to avoid a repetition
of last October's outcry.
In the Commons, Mr Eggar said the government had approved a subsidy to
British Coal, the first under a white paper scheme announced last March, to
sell coal to Alcan, an aluminium producer, from its Ellington,
Northumberland, pit.
He also announced the appointment of former civil servant Dr Martin
Holdgate, to chair an energy advisory panel set up by the department of
trade and industry.
Mr Eggar said the repeal of the 1908 act restricting underground working to
7 1/2 hours a day would not endanger safety. He refused to offer any
guarantees on the future of the remaining pits.

FT  21 OCT 93 / Lloyd's Names vote to admit corporate capital: Market
expects more than Pounds 1bn in equity will be raised by a dozen new members
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S NAMES, the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported
underwriting, yesterday voted emphatically in favour of plans to admit
corporate investors, marking a fundamental change in the 300-year-old
insurance market.
The vote came at the end of a relatively peaceful two-hour meeting attended
by about 1,000 Names and will trigger moves by merchant banks and securities
houses to raise more than Pounds 1bn in equity capital for more than a dozen
new corporate Lloyd's members.
The decision came in the face of protests from loss-making Names who have
borne the brunt of the market's recent difficulties.
All seven Lloyd's proposals for the introduction of corporate capital were
endorsed by majorities of at least 20 to one. Only 591 of the more than
31,000 eligible to vote opposed Lloyd's main proposal.
Earlier Names rejected by two to one a proposal put forward by the
loss-makers to adjourn the meeting until January.
Mr David Rowland, chairman, said that the admission of new investors was a
'vital step' in restoring confidence at the market. He said that 'confidence
has been damaged most obviously' between Lloyd's and its Names.
In addition, 'for the first time in our history our client base has been
questioning our relationship, particularly in respect of our ongoing
financial strength'.
He warned that failure to have approved the motion would have led to
continued decline as 'others revel in the business which traditionally has
been ours'.
Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, said: 'This is the first bad day our
competitors have had for two years'. He said the proposals reflected
commercial realities.
Summing up before the vote, he reminded Names: 'The world does not owe us a
living.' He called the uncertainty over the market's sources an 'Achilles'
heel' and said Lloyd's could not afford to remain 'on the back foot'. It had
to become 'an aggressive commercial organisation whose sole aim was to
maximise profit'.
Calling for the meeting to be adjourned, Mr Christopher Stockwell, chairman
of the Lloyd's Names Associations Working Party, which represents 37 action
groups of loss-making Names, said that Lloyd's should place a limit on the
amount of corporate capital allowed into the market.
He accepted that Lloyd's had begun to manage its affairs more effectively,
but the changes had come too late for Names burned by losses in 1988, 1989
and 1990.
Lloyd's ought to negotiate a settlement to the legal disputes at the market
before introducing rule changes to allow corporate members. However, Mr
Stockwell accepted the unprecedented undertakings given by Mr Rowland and Mr
Middleton that a settlement would be offered to Names by the end of the
year.
'If a settlement is to be achieved it must result in those currently bust
becoming solvent . . . and must mean an end to Lloyd's attempting to sue
Names for what they do not have.
'In spite of all our experiences of broken promises we are going to trust
you again,' said Mr Stockwell. 'Fleeced sheep have only their shepherd to
turn to.'
The working party is also taking issue with proposals for new rules under
examination at Lloyd's since last week which would greatly reduce the voting
power of the smaller Names and those 'trapped' in the market by their
membership of syndicates with 'open years', whose accounts cannot be settled
because of uncertainty about future claims.

FT  21 OCT 93 / BAe's rival aircraft talks raise stakes with Taiwan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE is raising the stakes over its troubled efforts to form a
regional aircraft joint venture with Taiwan by conducting rival negotiations
with Indonesia.
BAe confirmed yesterday it was having 'an exploratory dialogue regarding
regional aircraft with Indonesia', adding that the confidential discussions
involved turboprop commuter aircraft as well as regional jets.
BAe has a strong relationship with Indonesia's state aircraft industry.
Indonesia bought Pounds 500m worth of BAe Hawk trainer-fighter aircraft this
year, the biggest military export order BAe has clinched outside Saudi
Arabia. There is also the possibility of Indonesia assembling Hawk aircraft
were it to acquire further military jets from BAe.
The disclosure is expected to strengthen BAe's hand in its complex and long
drawn out negotiations with Taiwan this week which appear on the verge of
collapse.
While still tentative, the Indonesian proposal would involve much broader
co-operation, including BAe's Jetstream turboprop operations based at
Prestwick, Scotland, as well as the RJ regional jet activities based at
Woodford, near Manchester.
BAe has been seeking to forge international partnerships for both its
regional jet and turboprop aircraft activities as an integral part of its
recovery strategy.
Both regional jets and turboprops have continued to lose money and BAe
announced last week it was cutting 630 jobs out of the 2,500 people employed
on the turboprop activities at Prestwick. The regional jet operations employ
about 3,000 in the UK.
BAe has been losing patience over what it sees as Taiwan's delaying tactics
on the proposed joint venture which involves only its regional jet
activities.
Mr John Cahill, BAe chairman, yesterday began talks in Taiwan to try to
salvage the deal. But the UK company is not prepared to let the year-long
negotiations with Taiwan drag on further and is expected to take a decision
at a board meeting on October 29.
Taiwan is seeking to scrap its original agreements with BAe and renegotiate
the entire deal. BAe is also resisting Taiwanese demands for transfers of
leading edge technologies and a commitment to invest in a Pounds 1bn
programme to develop a new regional jet aircraft.
By contrast to Taiwan's fledgling aerospace industry, Indonesia has built up
an indigenous aerospace sector through international collaboration.
It already manufactures a turboprop military transport aircraft with civil
applications, the CN-235, jointly with Casa of Spain, which has been
successfully exported to Saudi Arabia and South Korea. Its IPTN state-owned
aerospace company led by Mr Bacharrudin Habibie is also a subcontractor for
Boeing of the US and has co-operation deals with other US and European
aerospace groups.
BAe has already held talks with Casa over a possible partnership in the
turboprop commuter and regional aircraft business.

FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: Wolseley confounds forecasters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of Wolseley rose 18p to 692p yesterday as the rapidly
expanding UK building materials group again confounded forecasters with
higher than expected profits for the year to July 31.
Pre-tax profits rose by a third to Pounds 121.1m (Dollars 182m) from Pounds
91.3m. Analysts had expected between Pounds 110m and Pounds 115m.
Mr Jeremy Lancaster, chairman and managing director, said recession had
eased, particularly on the US east coast and the UK.
The figures included 'surprisingly encouraging first-time results' from
Enertech, the Swedish oil and gas burner manufacturer acquired for Pounds
45m in April, which made a trading contribution of Pounds 2.6m.
Other acquisitions made during the year contributed Pounds 1.1m. A currency
benefit added Pounds 5.5m, up from Pounds 0.7m.
The group also reduced costs, although Mr Lancaster gave no details. 'We
have run this business lean and mean for 30 years, and we just run it lean
and mean all the time,' he said.
Turnover increased by 27 per cent from Pounds 1.95bn to Pounds 2.5bn,
including Pounds 69.4m from acquisitions. Of the total, Pounds 1bn derived
from building distribution in Europe; Pounds 1.2bn from building
distribution in the US and Pounds 278.5m from European manufacturing and
other activities.
Mr Lancaster described UK recovery as 'patchy'.
Earnings per share rose from 26.27p to 33.6p. A final dividend of 9.75p
(against 9.45p) is proposed, taking the total for the year to 13.3p, from
12.55p.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EFFJOHN, the Helsinki-based passenger shipping group, staged a strong
recovery in the first eight months, as better results from its Baltic Sea
operations offset continued losses in its international cruise activities.
The group broke even after financial items, having posted a FM102m (Dollars
17.8m) loss for the same period in 1992. It still expects to make a loss for
the full year, but says the figure will be lower than last year's FM261m
deficit.
Effjohn's main unit, Silja Line, was able to strengthen its position on its
key Baltic routes with streamlining and a reduced challenge from its main
competitor.
Silja was able to increase passenger numbers by 27 per cent to 3.8m,
although the Finnish and Swedish economies remained weak. Operating profits
were up to FM146m from FM63m.
By contrast, the group's international activities, which include the
cross-Channel company, Sally UK, and cruise shipping operations in the US,
saw operating losses deepen to FM38m from FM25m.
Turnover was up 33 per cent at FM3.24bn.
The FM204m operating profit, which included a FM96m gain from vessel sales,
was wiped out by higher financial costs reflecting the group's extensive
investments in new tonnage.

processor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HUNGARY'S State Property Agency yesterday announced that it had placed 51
per cent of Pannonplast, the state-owned plastics processor, with UK and US
investors.
Details of the transaction were not disclosed by the privatisation agency,
but the purchasers are believed to include emerging markets funds.
The placement, arranged by Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment bank,
clears the way for another tranche to be offered to the public and floated
on the Budapest Stock Exchange next year.
Some of the shares will be offered on concessionary terms under the small
investor share-buying programme decided upon last week by the Hungarian
cabinet.
Pannonplast was among eight companies named as candidates for the first wave
of sales from next January under the new privatisation scheme.
Over five years, Hungary's conservative government intends to sell state
shareholdings worth Ft100bn (Dollars 1.03bn) in 70 companies on
concessionary terms to small investors in an effort to broaden share
ownership and privatisation.
Every adult Hungarian paying a Ft2,000 entrance fee will be entitled to a
Ft100,000 interest-free credit facility which can be used to subscribe to
the public offerings.
The Pannonplast announcement comes three years after the company's
privatisation was originally announced as part of Hungary's failed first
privatisation programme.
An IPO scheduled for July 1991 had to be postponed because of the rapid
deterioration of the economy following the collapse of the Comecon east
European trading bloc.
The SPA said that a subsequent restructuring had reduced debt levels and
improved operating profitability, allowing the current private placement.
A recent revival in the Budapest stock market has also improved the
investment environment.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Air France strikers bring Paris airports to standstill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STRIKING Air France workers brought chaos to the two main airports in Paris
yesterday, blocking runways and forcing flights to be cancelled for much of
the afternoon.
The protests are the most serious to be launched against the lossmaking
airline's recovery plan, which was announced last month. The plan involves
the loss of 4,000 jobs by the end of next year and the implementation of
economy measures, including reduced overtime pay.
Both Charles De Gaulle and Orly airports were paralysed by the protests,
although Orly was reopened in the afternoon after three hours. However,
Aeroports de Paris, the airport authority, said the situation remained very
difficult at Orly because of the backlog of disrupted flights, while Charles
De Gaulle remained closed.
Air France said it was unclear what the situation would be today. But he
said it was likely that flights serving destinations in Europe, Turkey and
Israel would be cancelled. Air France said that between five and 10
long-haul flights were expected to operate from Charles De Gaulle tomorrow.
Mr Bernard Attali, Air France chairman, condemned the protests, spearheaded
by two union federations, Force Ouvriere and the leftwing Confederation du
Travail. He said the cancelled flights yesterday would cost the airline
about FFr70m (Dollars 12.4m).
Mr Attali has argued that the recovery plan is the only way to ensure the
survival of Air France, which lost FFr3.8bn in the first half of the year.
He said the protests would not affect the implementation of the plan and
that involuntary redundancies would be kept to a minimum.
'One can understand the worries of our personnel, but nothing can excuse the
damage to the company,' Mr Attali said in a statement to employees. 'These
actions will weaken the company and deal it a serious blow at the worst
time.'

FT  20 OCT 93 / Bonn urged to reform jobs market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE chief economist of Germany's second biggest bank has called for a
removal of the obstacles burdening the German labour market.
Mr Klaus Friedrich, chief economist at Dresdner Bank, who was speaking in
Frankfurt on Monday night, said the labour market in Germany was so
encrusted with inflexibilities that it functioned as if it were not a market
at all.
He dismissed the tendency of German companies to put workers on to
'short-time' - whereby employees receive a government-subsidised wage even
though they are no longer working - as 'macro-economic nonsense'.
He reserved the same judgment for any deal between unions and employers
which provided job guarantees in return for low wage increases. The powerful
IG Metall union has suggested a moratorium on jobs in return for moderate
wage claims.
'The only thing that matters is to have healthily functioning companies,' Mr
Friedrich said. 'That means better deployment of capital, workers and
management.'
Such views, while undoubtedly shared by many senior German executives, are
rarely voiced by consensus-minded members of the German financial and
industrial establishment. They hint at pressures for Germany's
'social-market' economy to become less social and more market-oriented.
Mr Friedrich, whose forthright style reflects many years working as an
economist in the US before returning to take up his position at the Dresdner
Bank last year, praised the measures contained in economics minister Mr
Gunter Rexrodt's recently published paper on 'Securing the Future of
Germany's Economic Base', which calls for privatisation and increased labour
market flexibility as a cure for Germany's economic woes.
'The Rexrodt paper has its head and its heart in the right place,' said Mr
Friedrich. 'But the question is, does it have the muscle? Can it be
implemented in practice?'
Mr Friedrich said it was obvious what had to be done in economic terms. The
difficulties in implementing deregulation lay in the political arena, he
said. Radical measures would be especially difficult to implement in 1994,
an election year in Germany.

<TEXT>
LEADERS of Germany's ruling coalition yesterday agreed a compromise which
would provide guaranteed finance for German coal production up to the year
2000, but not beyond.
The deal depends, however, on agreement with the opposition Social Democrats
(SPD) on continued electricity production from nuclear power stations - in
order to cross-subsidise expensive coal-fired power production with cheaper
nuclear electricity.
The plan was immediately denounced by the SPD, which wants Germany to
abandon nuclear energy, as 'attempted blackmail' at the expense of
coalminers.
Protesting miners blocked the main road to the parliament quarter in Bonn
waving banners denouncing Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister
responsible for the energy industry, as a 'job killer'.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Probe of Italian party to go ahead: Judge overrules decision
to shelve inquiry into PDS finances
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Milan judiciary has decided to proceed with investigations into alleged
illicit financing of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left
(PDS).
The decisions follows a serious split in the ranks of Milan magistrates over
whether or not to shelve the investigations that involve Mr Marcello
Stefanini, the PDS treasurer, as well a former party official, Mr Primo
Greganti.
The Milan attorney-general last week decided to discontinue the inquiries.
He also took the unusual step of removing from the team of magistrates the
one person who had dissented and who was responsible for implicating Mr
Stefanini, a senator, in August.
However, his decision on the case had to be approved by a judge of first
instance who yesterday ruled that further inquiries were necessary before
the case could be closed.
This is the first time during the country's corruption scandals that genuine
doubt has been sown about the involvement of top officials receiving and
organising illicit contributions. The PDS has consistently denied the party
was involved in illegal practices, and the most it has conceded is failing
to declare to the tax authorities the full amount received on a property
transaction. Where individuals have been accused of corruption, the party
has always said this was an individual matter.
However, at least three businessmen have claimed they paid first Communist
party and then PDS officials on behalf of the party. The PDS-controlled
co-operative movement is also under investigation for helping to provide
under-the-counter financing.

Mr Alberto Predieri, liquidator of the Efim state industrial holding, has
requested Milan magistrates to investigate 41 executives linked to companies
within Efim, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The move was revealed by Mr
Predieri yesterday in evidence to a parliamentary committee. He gave few
details, saying the matters to be investigated related to the companies'
balance sheets.
Efim was placed in voluntary liquidation in July 1992 with outstanding debts
of L18,000bn (Dollars 11bn). The rescue operation has already cost the
Treasury some L10,000bn and the eventual cost is likely to be close to
L18,000bn.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (20): Meaningful expressions -
Financial Times writers Antonia Sharpe and Laurie Morse draw on the large
mass of literature to compile a glossary of words and terms used in the
derivatives industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GIVEN the rapid growth in the derivatives industry and the increasingly
exotic nature of the products which are being launched, it is hardly
surprising that newcomers to the industry are confused or misled by the
terminology. In addition, the vast difference between the perceived meaning
and the actual meaning of many of the terms poses serious problems for the
industry's regulators, lawyers and insurers.
In a recent paper, Mr Graham Cox, group economist at the Sun Life Assurance
Society, points out that very often the perceived meaning of a 'hedge fund'
is a fund with all risk eliminated by the use of hedging positions, whereas
the actual meaning is a portfolio of leveraged positions, normally including
derivatives.
Mr Cox notes that there have been attempts in the past to sort out more
effective and less misleading names for the various functions and products
in the derivatives industry, but with little success so far.
However, there are numerous dictionaries which give lucid explanations of
the jargon and many banks and securities houses which trade in derivatives
have published useful information packs detailing how the more complicated
products work.
Asset allocation: dividing investment funds among markets to achieve
diversification or maximum return.
As-you-like option (or chooser option or the call-or-put option) enables the
holder to convert from one style of option to a different style of option
over a preset period of time.
Average rate option (or Asian option): an option in which the settlement is
based on the difference between the given strike and the average prices of
the underlying stock or index on selected dates.
Barrier options: a family of path-dependent options whose pay-off pattern
and survival to the expiration date depend not only on the final price of
the underlying security but also on whether or not the underlying security
sells at or goes through a pre-determined barrier at any time during the
life of the option.
Various Barrier options include:
Down-and-out call/put: an option which expires worthless if the market price
of the underlying security drops below a pre-determined price.
Down-and-in call/put: an option which becomes effective if the market price
of the underlying security drops below a pre-determined price.
Up-and-out call/put: an option that expires worthless if the market price of
the underlying security rises above a pre-determined price.
Up-and-in call/put: an option that becomes effective if the market price of
the underlying security rises above a predetermined price.
Best-of-two option (or either-or option or alternative option): provides the
option holder with a payoff based on the independent performances of two
separate and distinct securities or indices.
Box options: a tax efficient method of using cash to generate capital gains,
while maintaining a conservative investment approach to funds management.
Instead of placing cash in a money market instrument and generating interest
income, equity options are purchased the payoffs of which create capital
gains that can be
offset against current capital
losses.
Call option: the right to buy a given stock, commodity, index, or futures
contract at a fixed price on or before a specified date.
Cap: contract between a borrower and a lender where the borrower is assured
that he will not have to pay more than some maximum interest rate on
borrowed funds.
Clearing house: an affiliate of a futures or options exchange which matches
and guarantees trades and holds performance bonds posted by dealers. Acts as
a counterparty to every trade, reducing credit risk.
Collar: a floating rate debt contract that establishes both a maximum and
minimum interest rate to be paid by the borrower.
Commodity Swap: a swap in which counterparties exchange cash flows based on
a commodity price on at least one side of the transaction.
Compound option: an option on an option. The holder has the right to
purchase another option on a pre-set date, at a pre-set premium.
Contango: a condition in a futures market where the more distant delivery
months trade at a premium to the near term delivery months.
Covered call: one of the most popular option strategies, using an existing
equity position. Calls are sold on the underlying security with strikes
which are higher than the market price. The strike price chosen limits the
profit a security holder can realise from the position and this strategy is
best used when the holder is fairly certain that there will be little
movement in the security's share price.
Currency swap: an exchange of equal initial principal amounts of two
currencies at the spot exchange rate. Over the term of the agreement, the
counterparties exchange fixed or floating rate interest payments in their
swapped currencies. At maturity, the principal amount is reswapped at a
predetermined exchange rate so the parties endup with their original
currencies.
Deferred strike or deferred start option (or forward start option): allows
the holder to defer the setting of the strike price until some future time,
up to an agreed deadline.
Derivative: a contract the value of which changes in concert with the price
movements in a related or underlying commodity or financial instrument. The
term covers standardised, exchange-traded futures and options, as well as
over-the-counter swaps, options, and other customised instruments.
Equity swap: a contract between two counterparties to exchange two different
cashflows over time. Over the life of the swap one party agrees to pay the
rate of return on an equity or the equity index while the other party agrees
to pay a floating or fixed rate of interest.
Exploding option (or one-touch option): a European-style call spread with an
early exercise price trigger.
Floor: an aspect of a floating rate debt contract that specifies a minimum
interest rate for a borrower.
Forward: an over-the-counter agreement for a buyer and seller to exchange a
particular good for a particular price at a specified future date.
Futures contract: an agreement between a buyer and seller to exchange a
particular good for a particular price at a future date as specified in a
contract common to all participants in a market on an organised futures
exchange. Collateral must be posted for performance bonds, and positions are
marked to market at least once a day.
Hedge: a transaction that reduces risk of an underlying security or
commodity position by making the appropriate offsetting derivative
transaction. Usually limits potential reward of the underlying position.
Hybrid security: a complex security consisting of virtually any combination
of two or more risk management building blocks - bond or note, forward,
future, or option.
Interest-rate swap: the exchange between counter-
parties of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt in a single currency.
Ladder option (or step-Lock option): provides the holder with a mechanism of
locking in gains on an underlying security during the life of the option,
before its expiry.
Lookback option: an option the payout of which is calculated using the
highest intrinsic value of the underlying security or index over the life of
the option. In the case of a Lookback call, the highest market price is used
whereas for a Lookback put,the lowest market price is used.
Outperformance option: a call option which allows an investor to capitalise
on diverging performances of two underlying securities, which can be
individual stocks, customised baskets of stocks or a specific index.
Put option: the right to sell a particular stock, bond, commodity or index
at a specified future date at a specified price.
Quanto option (or guaranteed exchange rate option or currency protected
option): an option in which foreign exchange risks in an underlying security
have been eliminated.
Risk reversal: this strategy combines the purchase of a put option with the
sale of a call option. The put option preserves the capital value of the
shareholding while the sale of a call option reduces or eliminates the cost
of this insurance, at the expense of giving up some of the upside potential
of the stock.
Swap: a contract to exchange a stream of periodic payments with a
counterparty. Swaps are available in and between all active financial
markets.
Swaption: an option to enter into a swap contract.
Texas hedge: a transaction that increases risk; two or more related
positions whose risk is additive, rather than offsetting.
Warrant: an option to purchase or sell an underlying instrument at a given
price and time or series of prices and times. A warrant differs from a put
or call option in that its is ordinarily issued for longer than a year.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (19): Unsung hero is unique - Profile:
London Clearing House
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TUCKED away in the back streets of the City of London is the unsung hero of
the capital's rapidly-growing derivatives industry, the London Clearing
House (LCH).
LCH, which was founded in 1888 to clear coffee and sugar trades, plays a
pivotal role in ensuring the financial integrity and the efficiency of four
of London's exchanges.
These are the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE), the London Commodity
Exchange (LCE), the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe)
and the London Metal Exchange (LME).
LCH meets its two main priorities through its primary role as the central
counterparty for trades executed on the four exchanges. Its ability to take
on counterparty risk provides a solid trading framework for its 171 members
because their counterparty risk is considerably reduced and market liquidity
is enhanced.
In addition, LCH's unique position as the only futures clearing house in the
world to clear several markets and different products through a centralised
and automated system has allowed members to make considerable savings in
their settlement costs.
'Members with positions on all four markets can cover all their liabilities
with one single payment,' says Mr David Hardy, LCH's managing director.
LCH controls the risk of being exposed to a potential default by a member in
two ways, through counterparty assessment and margining.
Applicants for LCH membership are vetted thoroughly before they become
members and LCH continuously reviews existing members to ensure they satisfy
the following criteria:
Relevant exchange membership;
Relevant authorisation under the Financial Services Act of 1986;
Banking arrangements for the immediate transfer of funds to LCH on demand;
Adequate resources to comply with day-to-day requirements of LCH membership;
Minimum financial resource requirements.
LCH monitors each member's risk exposure on all four exchanges and analyses
it in relation to their ability to cover their liabilities.
If the LCH believes that a member's business is out of line with its
resources - for example, it might have an unusually large position or a
concentration of its margin in a single contract - it will ask the member to
put up additional resources or ask it to restrict its business volume.
So far, LCH has managed to assess its counterparties with a high degree of
accuracy and in its 105-year history it has only had to expel one member, a
subsidiary of BCCI, in 1987.
The other way in which LCH dampens down its risk profile is by setting
margins which are calculated daily and whichmembers have to cover daily with
a deposit of funds or with collateral.
Margin, which is a measure of the risk of a member's positions, has two main
components: initial margin to provide cover for potential adverse movements
and variation margin to cover previous price movements.
Mr Hardy says that margins are essential so that markets can be seen to be
able to trade in times of extreme price volatility but at the same time
provide protection for members by not allowing their liabilities and
resources to get out of balance.
For example, during the Gulf War, margin rates were increased substantially
to reflect the big swings in the price of gas oil futures. LCH asked members
to improve their resources by way of bank guarantees. When prices stabilised
the bank guarantees were returned to the members.
'Margining can be seen as the barometer of the volatility in the market and
it serves to neutralise the risk,' says Mr Hardy.
He adds that LCH and its members are given additional protection by the
diverse nature of the markets and the products cleared by LCH.
'The risks will be different at any one time,' he says, noting that during
the stock market crashes of 1987 and 1989 there was hardy any reaction on
the other exchanges.
LCH regularly holds more than Pounds 1bn in cash in margin money which it
invests in overnight money markets. It pays members interest on their
margins - usually the bid rate on the London interbank rate (Libor) minus
1/4 - and very often members leave more money than they have to with LCH
because of the favourable interest rate.
Surplus interest income on the margins forms part of LCH's income. As well
as keeping transaction costs down, the interest income helps LCH achieve its
third priority, that is, making a sensible profit for its owners.
LCH is owned by six leading UK clearing banks: Barclays Bank, Lloyds Bank,
Midland Bank, National Westminster Bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland and
Standard Chartered Bank. These six banks provide the backing for LCH's
counterparty risk, which amounts to Pounds 150m.
Mr Hardy is confident that LCH's structure will enable it to continue to
clear the ever-increasing trading volumes generated by London's growing
derivatives industry.
By October 7, LCH had cleared 112.5m contracts, exceeding the total number
of trades cleared during the whole of last year. Total volume for this year
is expected to reach 155m contracts.
LCH has also taken steps to ensure that it can continue to provide an
uninterrupted clearing service for the exchanges if its systems fail or if
its building is out of action.
All its computers are now located in south London and there is a back-up
system in west London where it also has office space.
'LCH has a triangulated provision of service,' says Mr Hardy.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (17): A short cut to domination -
Profile: Swiss Bank Corporation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWISS BANK CORPORATION was not one of the first banks to enter the
derivatives market. But in only a few years it has become one of the
dominant forces in the market, with a derivatives capacity which covers the
three main product lines of interest rates, foreign exchange and equities,
and encompasses over-the-counter and exchange-traded business.
In a poll taken by Risk magazine in September, SBC was named as one of three
market leaders in the derivatives industry (the other two are Bankers Trust
and J P Morgan).
SBC took a short cut by buying a ready-made derivatives business, rather
than trying to grow its own from a relatively small, in-house capability, or
poaching teams from other firms. O'Connor Securities, a specialist options
trading firm based in Chicago, possessed not only expertise but also the
advanced technology required for such an operation.
The move was based on a strong strategic view taken at board level. In 1989,
SBC set down a long-term strategy, dubbed 'Vision 2000', which took the view
that 'the capital markets of the 90s would be driven by derivatives and risk
management products,' according to Mr Marcel Ospel, a member of the SBC
executive board. 'This led SBC to explore with O'Connor, already a leading
player in US derivative markets, the form a joint venture might take to
exploit the coming boom in derivatives business worldwide.'
A joint venture formed by SBC and O'Connor in 1990 was followed by a full
merger of the two businesses in 1992, when SBC bought O'Connor.
At the time of the joint venture, O'Connor was looking at three-or four
potential partners and SBC had been considering buying a US investment bank
to get into the US market, particularly on the corporate finance side.
But these two rather unlikely bedfellows - a US proprietary trading firm and
a Swiss bank - decided to brave the potential culture clash.
O'Connor was a 'blue jeans and T-shirts firm with a flat level structure',
said Ms Lesley Grant, a former O'Connor hand who now runs SBC's foreign
exchange risk management advisory service worldwide.
It had a very special niche - statistical arbitrage - which involves
investing heavily in systems to have better models and data which can
identify anomalies in the market. In particular, the ability to forecast
volatility accurately - a key element of pricing in the options market - was
a strength of O'Connor.
O'Connor had been very successful first in trading options on the Chicago
exchanges and then in the OTC market, but as the market became larger and
more competitive its lack of a strong capital base became a restraint. A
joint venture with First Chicago in foreign exchange options was dissolved
due to lack of commitment on both sides.
At the same time, SBC had started a critical examination of its whole
capital markets business in the wake of the 1987 crash - and had found a
number of weak points.
One of these was options. 'There was a clear gap that had to be filled,'
said Mr Simon Bunce, head of interest rate derivative sales.
While there were tales of ructions during the joint venture period, the
seams between SBC and O'Connor are no longer obvious.
Staff say the success of the merger is due to the fact that it was driven by
need on both sides, and there was little overlap. Although O'Connor staff
were afraid of losing their special culture, the handling of the merger by
senior staff on both sides helped. 'Of the 21 partners at O'Connor, all
became managing directors of SBC: no-one took early retirement and went to
partner heaven,' said Ms Grant.
SBC took the approach of integrating its newfound derivatives capacity with
other areas of business - probably more fraught with difficulty in the short
term, but more effective in the long term. To bring this about, there has
been a huge investment in education
'We pride ourselves on the quality of our derivatives education package
which is run from Chicago and networked throughout the world,' said Mr
Bunce. Unlike many other banks, SBC staff are sent on two- to three-week
courses, their mobile phones confiscated to sever contact.
The integration of cash and derivatives markets is most advanced in SBC's
foreign exchange business, probably its strongest platform.
SBC has trained its 170-strong foreign exchange sales team to price and
structure their own options so that they are now an integrated cash and
derivatives sales team.
Other elements of the O'Connor legacy can be found in use of specialist
analystic skills in areas such as risk management. Each book (foreign
exchange, interest rate and equities) has a global risk manager, who
measures the bank's exposure, and in each case that function is provided by
a former O'Connor partner.
There are still some areas of weakness.
Although O'Connor brought equity derivatives expertise to the table, SBC's
cash market business in equities has still not recovered from its disastrous
'big bang' takeover of UK stockbroker Savory, Milln.
However, the bank now has a three-quarters formed traditional research and
sales function with an industry thrust, in line with present trends.
'The O'Connor franchise in equity derivatives was already very strong,' said
Mr Steve Smith, head of equity derivative sales, and has allowed SBC to
develop innovative retail products, such as guaranteed return instruments,
high-yield unit trusts and warrant issues. One example is SBC's innovative
bond issues with 'knock-out' warrants for Benetton and Roche.
SBC also produced an options package to protect Hongkong Land against a rise
in the share price of Trafalgar House, when it took a 20 per cent stake in
the UK property company last year.
SBC's other main weakness is geographical. Unlike the US firms which are its
principal competitors, it cannot claim to have a truly global reach. Its
efforts to develop a strong base in the US are still at an early stage, and
are hampered by its inability to merge operations because of the US
Glass-Steagall law, which separates banking and securities business.
One of the stated aims of Vision 2000 was to be among the world's 10 most
profitable banks. Profitable, for banks, increasingly means return on
equity: SBC's return on equity is around 10 per cent, rather than the 20 per
cent returns shown by many US investment banks, which do not have the
overheads of a clearing bank business. However, the capital markets and
treasury division of SBC already makes a return on equity of more than 20
per cent.
Its newfound derivatives strength has given the bank greater leverage across
all its business areas. The last few years seem to have shown that the SBC
planners got it right: derivatives have become the key strategic market in
the 1990s and SBC is well positioned to take advantage of the growth of the
market.
'You can develop so much when you have a machine that works,' said Mr Bunce.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (18): Cutting costs of hamburgers -
Profile: MCDonald's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE world of derivatives, McDonald's Corporation is a typical user. It is a
large company, which, because a lot of its earnings and borrowings emanate
from overseas, faces currency and interest rate risks in many markets.
What makes McDonald's particularly interesting, however, is that there can
be few companies where the benefits of derivatives are so clearly apparent -
not just to the chief financial officer and corporate treasurer, but to the
thousands of people across the world who run restaurants under the famous
yellow arch. They, as much as anyone, have been able to enjoy the rewards of
derivatives.
Mr Carleton D Pearl, McDonald's treasurer, explains how its franchisees are
able to use derivative instruments to cut the cost of their borrowings.
'There are programmes run by our banks that finance the franchisee, which
include a cap in the cost of the loan. What is interesting about that is, if
you're a small- or medium-sized business owner, and you're trying to put a
cap on a prime rate loan in the US, you would have to figure out how many
options you would need to buy on an exchange. Now, how could they possibly
deal with that? What the banker can do, is make a loan at 150 basis points
over commercial paper, or a loan at 175 over commercial paper, and promise
you that you'll never have to pay more than 10 per cent.'
In other words, says Mr Pearl, 'derivatives can deliver value to small- and
medium-sized businesses by enabling them to manage risks that they're not
equipped to manage. Most people think derivatives are for large companies
with big staffs. Our banks have found a way to deliver these instruments so
that the small business owner can use them.'
Mr Pearl clearly likes to spread the derivatives gospel. He was one of the
co-authors of the Group of Thirty's report into derivatives published this
summer, a report that essentially gave the business a clean bill of health.
One point on which the G30 placed particular emphasis, was the notion of
accountability - the need for the financial officers at companies who use
derivatives to keep their senior managers and boards of directors fully
informed, both of their activities and the extent of their company's
exposures.
It is a message that Mr Pearl says McDonald's has always taken seriously.
'We have extensive discussions with the board of directors about these
instruments. It's been an ongoing dialogue. In the early days we reported on
each transaction we did. To this day, every time they meet we give them a
report on our derivatives portfolio marked to market. And for our own senior
management, we prepare a report which looks at not only the exposure on a
marked-to market basis, but which also provides an analysis of our potential
exposures.'
He has been McDonald's treasurer since 1988, but the company first began
using the products in the early 1980s. Back then, it was a natural
progression from the risk management techniques McDonald's was already
using, says Mr Pearl.
'We started doing parallel loans in the early 80s, and the next step from
parallel loans to swaps was relatively straightforward. If you have been
doing three-month foreign exchange contracts, the move out to five-year
forward contracts is one that carries somewhat of a different risk, but
you're moving along a spectrum, and thus not doing something totally new.'
Mr Pearl says the company embraced derivatives early on because they offered
a better, and often cheaper, way to control risk, and since the early days
it has not strayed that far from the plain vanilla derivatives products that
hedge interest rate and currency risk. A look at its derivatives portfolio
would show that the company is involved in almost 100 transactions, with 23
different counterparties in 12 currencies.
The chief motivation has always been saving money. 'It's critical to
understand this about what we do here - our job is to reduce all the costs
as much as possible, so we can deliver the best value hamburger to our
customers. Therefore, if we can reduce the cost of financings and land
acquisitions and construction, we can lower the cost of selling hamburgers
to our customers. That is our objective. We are not here to run another
business trading derivatives.'
The cost savings can come in a variety of ways, says Mr Pearl. 'For example,
if our cash flows and cash needs change, and our view of markets change, to
go out and call a bond issue, or buy it in the market and reissue
shorter-term or longer-term floating debt, can be a very expensive
proposition. However, doing it through derivatives is very much easier and
much less expensive.'
Derivatives also provide the company with more flexibility in its
financings. 'We did a Danish krona financing - fixed rate krona with US
dollar commercial paper. Therefore, we got Danish krona fixed-rate loans at
100 basis points below local financing sources. This, at a time when the
local bond market did not do fixed rate financing.' Mr Pearl also cites an
example of how the company used equity options to reduce the cost of a
Dollars 700m stock buy-back programme.
Occasionally, McDonald's employs more complex, hybrid forms of derivatives,
such as a few years ago when they issued inverse floating rate bonds with
coupons that, if interest rates went down, the rate went up. 'We swapped
those into commercial paper borrowings. It was pretty esoteric, but the
essence of the deal was that we created financing below the cost of our
commercial paper financing.'
McDonald's does not use derivatives in a speculative fashion, to earn a
profit from the products. 'I've often been asked about whether we make
money. Well, we don't keep track of it that way. We think of each financing,
and ask: does it make economic sense relative to the alternatives?'
The number of staff working with derivatives at McDonald's is small. Mr
Pearl has five with him - one director, two managers and two analysts - out
of a total of 30.
It was different in the early 1980s, when derivatives were still new, and
only a few corporations were using them. Mr Pearl can get nostalgic about
the early days. 'The economics used to be much better. We used to be able to
do some swaps that got us 100 basis points below libor. Sadly, those days
are gone forever.'

FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (15): Propelled into a new financial
age - Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S growing financial integration with the US is propelling it into the
age of derivatives.
On the Chicago Board of Trade, trading volume on listed options on Telefonos
de Mexico, Mexico's largest stock, runs to more than Dollars 30bn a year,
making it one of the most popular options on the exchange. Some 200 to 300
trades in Mexican warrants are executed every day in the over-the-counter
market in Luxembourg. The market in tailor-made derivatives on blue-chip
Mexican equities, debt instruments or the peso is thriving, and is even
larger than the listed warrant market in Luxembourg.
Such instruments have become highly popular with investors wishing to hedge
against falls in the stock market, rise in interest rates, or simply
leverage their exposure to Mexican assets. They have also proven profitable
for the investment banks that offer them, led by Merrill Lynch, Bear
Stearns, Banker's Trust, and Goldman Sachs.
The derivative business conducted in Mexico, though, has been limited,
mainly because of government regulation. Until recently the only types of
derivatives that could be offered in Mexico were coberturas, tesebonos, and
ajustabonos.
The cobertura is an over-the-counter exchange rate contract, in which the
investor pays a premium determined in the market for the right to receive at
some specified time in the future the observed peso/dollar devaluation over
the period of the cobertura. Tesebono is a treasury-bill that offers dollar
rate of return, protecting the investor against the devaluation. The
ajustabono offers a nominal rate of return plus the inflation rate over life
of the bill.
The cobertura has been popular with Mexicans keen to hedge or speculate
against exchange rate fluctuations, with daily volume over Dollars 1bn.
(Foreigners have had to pay withholding tax of 15 per cent, so they have
shied away from the market. However the withholding tax has just been
reduced to 4.9 per cent, and foreigners might now move into the market.)
But the cobertura, like the tesebono, is not a full currency hedge, since
investors are only paid in pesos. Were the peso to be made inconvertible,
investors would not be able to buy dollars at the official exchange rate.
However, with the offshore derivative business growing by leaps and bounds,
last year the Mexican government decided to stem the tide, and expand the
home-based derivative market. The Mexican Securities and Exchange Commission
allowed the stock market to offer listed warrants on blue-chip Mexican
stocks. The warrants started trading in October, and average volume has been
modest, at about Dollars 1m a day.
So far the warrant market has suffered from over-regulation, lack of
liquidity, and foreigners have preferred to keep on buying OTC offshore. It
can take several months to obtain permission to issue a warrant, a privilege
only granted to Mexican brokerages, which limits the overall liquidity of
the market. Mutual funds are still awaiting permission to buy the warrants.
Mexican brokerages are also unwilling to trade or comment on warrants issued
by their rivals. This has further prevented the market from reaching a
critical mass.
While the government's conservative attitude has been criticised by banks
keen to compete with the US in derivatives, it has won support outside
broker circles. 'There is a virtue in being cautious. It is much worse to go
when you are not ready, than to wait too long,' says Catherine Mansell, an
academic and author of the best-selling The new finance in Mexico.
Next year the Mexican authorities plan to open listed options market in
Mexico for equities. Some time after that, the stock market may offer listed
options on the peso, and interest rates, and future contracts on baskets of
stocks. No decision has yet been made about when to offer such products.
The success of such markets depends on liquidity, how the clearing system is
arranged, and restrictions on market makers, says Juan Jose Suarez, co-head
of derivative products at Banamex, Mexico's largest bank. But if regulation
is flexible enough, Mr Suarez expects considerable interest. 'It's difficult
to imagine the sort of volume traded on the Telmex option, but there should
be significant interest' he says.
Participants stress the synergy between different derivative markets,
suggesting that derivative instruments will take off when all are available,
and trading is liquid. 'It would be very helpful (for Mexican derivatives)
to develop a liquid and efficient futures market' says Trey Rhine, a
vice-president at Merrill Lynch, the market leader in Mexican derivatives. A
futures market would stimulate liquidity in the underlying market and other
derivatives, and help investors arbitrage price differences between assets
that offer the same return, ensuring a more efficient market.
Many foreigners will still prefer to trade outside Mexico, if only because
there are more comfortable dealing in dollar-denominated options, and in
their own time zone, says Jeremy Campbell-Lamerton, managing director of the
London branch of Inverlat. Since the price of an option includes the
implicit interest rates during the option's life span, investors will find
it cheaper to buy a dollar option than a peso option, if, as is now the
case, expected peso devaluation does not offset the peso/dollar interest
rate differential.
So far the signs from the authorities regarding regulation have been
conflicting. On the one hand, Mexico's finance ministry is itself one of the
world's largest users of options and futures, hedging against rises in US
interest rates and falls in oil prices. It presumably would want to
encourage the development of a domestic derivatives market to allow Mexican
companies and investors to follow a similarly prudent financial strategy.
In a possible sign of greater flexibility, the Securities and Exchange
Commission finally gave Banamex permission to sell in Mexico an equity-lined
note, which gives investors 70 per cent of the upside of the stock market,
and protects the principal. Previously such equity-derivative offerings,
done by Banamex or US houses such as Merrill Lynch, have had to be offered
offshore in Luxembourg.
However, the Central Bank remains worried about financial institutions'
ability to manage the risks involved with derivatives. This was highlighted
by last year's fiasco over ajustabonos (bonds that offer a real interest
rate, that are, in effect, a play on future inflation rates) in which
Mexican brokerages and banks lost at the very minimum hundreds of millions
of dollars.
But just as Mexico found in the early 1980s that it was impossible to
prevent capital outflows even with capital controls, Mexico is finding that
one way or another the derivative business has arrived. The question is
whether it will continue to flourish outside Mexico, or whether it will be
brought onshore.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (16): Limited scope for development -
Emerging Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE USE of derivatives for risk management purposes may seem pretty old hat
to the blue chip companies of the world's more developed countries, but for
companies in some of the emerging economies it is a skill still largely in
its infancy.
That is not for want of sufficiently volatile conditions. Companies in
developing countries are just as exposed as their western rivals - if not
more so - to the vicissitudes of modern life. As companies turn away from
their domestic markets and grow increasingly international, they often face
the problems of fluctuations in exchange rates, interest rates and commodity
prices.
A company in the developing world which borrows cheaply in dollars to
finance the construction of a new factory, for example, might suddenly find
itself paying more than it had bargained for if the domestic currency
suffers a sharp devaluation. Given the increasing integration of world
markets, fluctuations in the developed world are rapidly transmitted to the
developing economies.
Added to these external factors, some developing countries (for example
Brazil) suffer from very high inflation. Under such circumstances, companies
are often forced to consider a much shorter time-frame, focusing on daily or
monthly financial management rather than looking much further ahead.
'High inflation typically reduces the maturity range of available financial
instruments, which limits the ability of firms to deal with currency (or
interest rate) exposures beyond a short horizon,' says Mr Jack Glen, an
economist at the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in his recent
report on risk management in developing countries*.
For example, in Brazil (where the domestic capital markets are very
sophisticated, offering a broad range of different instruments for managing
a variety of risks) the very high inflation rate and economic uncertainty
'prevents the development of medium and long-term risk management
instruments', according to Mr Glen.
For the normal range of interest rate and foreign exchange risks encountered
by companies in developing countries, however, it is possible to use some of
the risk management techniques and instruments which have already been
developed and put to use in the world's more sophisticated financial
centres.
So far, the extent to which these risk management methods have been employed
in the emerging markets is quite limited. As Ms Elizabeth Morrissey,
managing partner of Kleiman International Consultants, the US-based
consultancy which monitors emerging markets, points out: 'Some of these
countries barely have domestic bond markets, let alone their own derivatives
markets.'
Instead, companies in developing economies would tend to turn to US banks or
the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the
World Bank, for assistance in managing their foreign exchange or interest
rate exposure. 'We are seeing the increasing use of risk management
instruments but it still tends to be done on a 'deal by deal' basis,' says
Ms Morrissey.
'Derivatives grew in the developed world so it's only natural they should
percolate to less sophisticated financial centres,' says Mr Mark Coombs, an
emerging market specialist at ANZ Grindlays Bank.
He points out that the use of derivatives in the emerging markets is
becoming more prevalent, with an increasing emphasis on structured deals
which are tailored to the needs of the individual company. 'The use of
derivatives is growing across the board in the emerging markets: what you
tend to see is either investor-driven deals, where the investor wants to
enhance his return through leveraging, or borrower-driven deals where the
borrower is trying to hedge a risk,' says Mr Coombs.
The IFC has assisted companies from a wide variety of developing countries -
ranging from Bolivia to Ghana - to set up currency and interest rate swaps
to manage their exposure.
To take one example, an Egyptian manufacturing concern which had secured
low-cost yen financing to purchase Japanese equipment, suddenly found itself
a victim of the appreciating yen. The company had mainly dollar revenues, so
the yen's appreciation in the latter half of the 1980s meant that its
financing costs soared. Each one yen decrease in the yen/dollar exchange
rate cost the company an additional Dollars 300,000 annually in interest
expenses.
The IFC points out that for nearly three years the company was forced to
accept the mismatch (of yen interest expenses and dollar revenues) because
the international swap markets were effectively closed to them. Eventually,
with the help of the IFC, the company entered into a currency swap that
exchanged a portion of its yen financing for dollar financing.
While the IFC was able to help in this instance, in many cases, companies in
developing countries are denied the sort of access to risk management tools
that western companies enjoy and employ.
Mr Glen highlights several reasons why the use of risk management
instruments may be restricted or limited, including credit considerations,
regulation and the size of the transactions.
'The derivatives products markets are credit sensitive and as most long-term
derivative securities involve credit risk, direct access generally is
limited to companies having at least investment grade credit ratings,' he
says in his report.
Creditworthiness is a significant factor in pricing and access for swaps,
making it difficult for developing country firms to have access to the
international swap market.
Without a track record or a credit rating, companies may not have access to
risk management instruments. In cases where they do have access, it may only
be to short-term instruments, or the conditions may stipulate the company
post collateral which could make the deal more expensive.
In some developing countries, domestic financial regulations which prevent
the use of risk management instruments - sometimes because the authorities
are concerned that the fine line between use for speculation and use for
hedging purposes might be blurred. In some cases it may simply prove too
costly to conduct the transaction, either because of the tax treatment or
because of the rather small size of the deal itself.
Given these limitations, it could be some time before the use of derivatives
is as widespread in the developing countries as in the western world.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (14): Focus on a dynamic present -
Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN AUGUST this year, the HKDollars 1.93bn (USDollars 247m) lifeboat loan,
which had saved Hong Kong's collapsed futures market in October 1987, was
repaid. The colony's derivatives markets were finally able to turn from a
chequered past and focus on an increasingly dynamic present.
Before the 1987 stock market crash, Hong Kong had operated the second most
active index futures contract in the world, but the period since then has
been one of only gradual recovery. Turnover dwindled sufficiently in 1990
that there were many calls for the closure of the entire Futures Exchange.
For the exchange's new management, the first push was to enforce reforms
which would prevent any possible repeat of 1987. The second was to encourage
nervous former participants to return to the futures market. It has
succeeded on both fronts.
The recent repayment of this fund has coincided with a growing international
investor focus on the Hong Kong stock market, and the result has been a
rapid growth in demand for derivative products.
In the past 18 months, most of the large US securities houses have either
opened up or upgraded Hong Kong offices, and one of their primary aims has
been to build up derivatives business, an area which had always been
peripheral.
A number of the US groups have purchased seats on the Futures Exchange, and
along with other leading European and Japanese brokerages, they have helped
to promote the market.
In the first six months of 1993, turnover in Hang Seng Index futures
increased by 151 per cent, compared with the first half of 1992. The strong
performance in the Hang Seng Index has been reflected in increased trading
in the Futures Exchange's latest derivative product, the Hang Seng Index
option, which was introduced in March and saw record trading in October.
The derivatives market has become dominated by the leading foreign
securities houses, which have the advantages of greater capital resources,
overseas expertise and global distribution. They are bringing in a global
client base for new investment products.
For example, Morgan Stanley claims to have accounted for between 30 per cent
and 50 per cent of daily turnover in the futures market in recent months,
while Swiss Bank has taken a substantial share of trading in the options
market.
The arrival of overseas brokerages has also resulted in a broadening of the
range of available products to include over-the-counter or listed covered
warrants and, recently, convertible loan stock.
The US securities houses were primarily responsible for introducing the
benefits of convertible bond/preference share issues to
conservatively-managed Hong Kong companies.
During 1993, Jardine Strategic Holdings, Dairy Farm, Wharf Holdings, Amoy
Properties, Sino Land, Guangdong Investment and Henderson China all used
convertible issues as a means of capitalising on the performance of Hong
Kong stock prices, and the present low interest rate environment.
These issues have raised a total of USDollars 929.5m (around HKDollars
7.25bn), which is marginally less than the total capital raised in the stock
market from the 18 rights issues announced during the first eight months of
the year.
Mr Han Ong, managing director of Warburg Asset Management Hong Kong, said:
'This change is inevitable, as the market matures and comes under the
international spotlight.'
When activity in the futures market peaked in 1987, index futures contracts
were regarded as the ultimate speculative tool for retail investors. Trading
had soared to 27,000 contracts a day, with an underlying contract value of
more than HKDollars 4.8bn (USDollars 615m).
During September this year the average daily turnover was only 9,093
contracts. However, this is around 10 times higher than the level when
Futures Exchange chief executive Mr Gary Knight joined in January 1991.
Mr Knight said: 'The futures market is now doing 150 per cent of the
underlying stock market turnover on a daily basis, and that is good by any
international standards.'
He attributes the growth in turnover to the performance of the underlying
stock market, the rapid expansion in the number of members of the futures
market, and the increase in sophistication of investors in Hong Kong.
'In 1990, a lot of people said the futures market shouldn't exist. It is now
accepted as a meaningful part of the financial scene,' said Mr Knight.
During 1992, there has been a substantial increase in the amount of mutual
fund money coming into the Hong Kong stock market from the US. Those fund
managers have demanded more sophisticated hedging tools, particularly
futures contracts and over-the-counter derivative products.
The stock exchange is in the final throes of introducing a computerised
trading system - automatically matching buyers with sellers - which is a
precursor to lifting prohibition on short-selling, and to the launching of
traded stock options on the Exchange. These are to be introduced in
mid-1994.
Derivatives have long been on the speculative periphery of Hong Kong
investment portfolios, but with the introduction of more sophisticated tools
and a more international market place, their association with the excesses
of 1987 has finally faded.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (13): JGB futures stir bad memories -
Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLOSED nature of Tokyo's financial markets was highlighted by the
controversial launch of Japanese government bond futures on the Singapore
International Monetary Exchange this month.
The launch of the JGB futures by Simex, which also runs the Nikkei futures
market, has bought back bad memories to Tokyo stock exchange officials, who
blamed the plunge in the stock market on excessive futures and options
transactions. Many in the financial markets point out that such
misconceptions stem from the heavy regulation over derivative products in
Japan, which has also kept the use of futures and options under-developed.
Simex launched the JGB contract after suggestions from the Managed Futures
Association in the US. Mr Ang Swee Tian, president of Simex, said: 'Earlier
in the year we indicated that we were studying the possibilities, and there
was no indication of concern then,' he says.
However, TSE officials have been angered by the launch of the cheaper
contract by Simex. 'We only got a fax in August from Simex notifying us of
the launch,' says the TSE. JGB futures are already traded in London and
Chicago, but this will be the first launch outside of Tokyo in the same time
zone.
Simex says the commission levels are around half of those in Tokyo. TSE
officials have tried to convince Simex to cancel the plan, without success.
'The launch will erode liquidity in Tokyo, hence distorting prices and the
efficiency of the market,' says a TSE spokesman. Officials at Liffe,
visiting Tokyo recently, have also denounced Simex as a 'free rider' copying
successful products on other exchanges.
Mr Ang contends that the move by Simex will not fragment the market, since
Tokyo's JGB futures market is already huge with widespread participation.
Volume on the Tokyo JGB futures is about six times that of Singapore.
Tokyo financial authorities have warned Japanese brokers and traders against
marketing, or using the Simex futures. However, this will not stop overseas
investors, including overseas affiliates of Japanese brokers, from trading.
Some traders point out that the move by Simex reflects growing demand from
non-TSE members who want to trade JGB futures without paying exorbitant TSE
membership fees.
However, a trader at a UK brokerage based in Tokyo says he will not use the
Simex market until its liquidity and pricing efficiency has improved. 'The
real test is going to come when the Tokyo futures market is locked due to a
large sized order,' he adds.
The small turnover is expected to keep large-lot players away, and concerns
over the open outcry system exists. Unlike the JGB futures traded in London,
the contracts are not compatible, with the size of each contract in
Singapore half the Y100m of the Tokyo contract, and positions are not
transferable.
One trader at a leading Japanese house, however, points out that trading on
Simex holds great potential. 'From the users point of view, competition
between exchanges isn't a bad thing. The TSE shouldn't involve market users
in its rows,' he says.
It is not the first time TSE officials have failed to persuade Simex to
change its stance on products linked to the Japanese market. The TSE tried
to convince Simex to implement trading restrictions on its Nikkei 225
futures contracts, following the crash in the Tokyo stock market.
Tokyo financial authorities blamed futures and options contracts for
volatility on the underlying stock market, and implemented a spate of
trading restrictions over the past two years. They also requested that Simex
introduce stricter rules to curb trading, but Simex failed to comply.
The result of tighter restrictions and higher trading costs on the Osaka
stock exchange, where the Nikkei futures are listed, resulted in a shift of
trading to Singapore. Japanese officials were angered by the plunge in
derivatives trading on the Osaka exchange last year, while activity jumped
on Simex.
In July, the TSE drafted a new set of restrictions for the stock index
futures market, including the introduction of a circuit breaker mechanism to
suspend transactions when prices swing wildly.
A separate group of Osaka and Tokyo stock exchange members has been working
on a new stock index for futures, and a new index was announced by the Nihon
Keizai Shimbun, which calculates the Nikkei 225 index, on October 8. The
Nikkei 300 is a capitalisation weighted average of 300 stocks, and a new
futures contract based on the index is expected to replace Osaka's Nikkei
225 futures, which is a simple price average of 225 stocks, and has been
criticised as being easily manipulated.
Meanwhile, although Japan's new coalition government is calling for less
regulation and freer markets, the ministry of finance is far from easing its
grip on new financial products, including new derivative instruments.
Earlier this year, the Committee to Make Tokyo Markets More Transparent and
International (CTTI), an industry body made up of Japanese and foreign
financial institutions, criticised the ministry's decision-making in
evaluating new financial products saying it was unclear and inconsistent.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (12): Temperature has cooled markedly
 -Regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EIGHTEEN months ago, the approach of regulators and legislators to the
over-the-counter derivatives market was, if not hostile, certainly
combative.
The blunt warning about derivatives sounded in January 1992 by the then
president of the Federal Reserve, Mr Gerald Corrigan, still rang loudly in
bankers' ears, and a small army of regulators from the US and overseas
(including the New York Federal Reserve and the Bank of England) were
studying the lightly regulated OTC business.
At the same time, lawmakers in the US were getting in on the act. Badly
burned by the multibillion dollar collapse of the US savings and loan
industry and by the meltdown in the junk bond market in the late 1980s, and
by the near-collapse of some of the country's biggest banks at the start of
the 1990s, Congress did not want to be caught asleep on its financial watch
again.
Eager to be fully informed of the growth of the over-the-counter derivatives
business and its potential impact upon public policy, various key finance
and banking committees originated their own inquiries, and several leading
members of Congress hinted at the possibility of legislation to control, if
not curb, the growth of derivatives.
At that time, the creators and users of derivatives were being put on the
defensive. Essentially, regulators and US legislators were asking them to
prove that the myriad of risks that banks and corporations take on when
using derivatives did not threaten the health of an increasingly
inter-connected global financial system.
Over the past 18 months, the banks and securities houses which create and
sell derivatives, with the help of the corporations and institutions which
use them, have helped answer some of the many questions surrounding the
business. The result: the temperature of the regulatory climate surrounding
the derivatives business, so hot 18 months ago, has cooled.
Mr Joe Bauman, head of business development for global derivatives at
Citibank in New York, and spokesman for the industry in his capacity as
chairman of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (Isda), says
regulators and legislators are definitely taking a more 'constructive and
understanding' approach to the business today. 'They have shown a
willingness to take a harder look, to get behind the generalities.'
Mr Bauman and other bankers point out that regulators were taking such an
interest in derivatives primarily because they did not understand the
complexities and intricacies of business. Having failed to track the early
development of derivatives, regulators were behind from the start, and
struggled to keep up with the hectic pace of innovation.
This is a point that the regulators have openly conceded. Last year the then
US Treasury secretary Mr Nicholas Brady referred to the 'wide knowledge gap
between regulators and regulated', echoing earlier comments from a senior
Bank of England figure who said the gap was 'too great for normal
communication'.
Since then, the knowledge-gap has narrowed. Not only have the regulators
started, and in many cases completed, their investigations of derivatives,
but banks have gone out of their way to educate regulators about the
business. When it comes to the question of whether new risks to banks and
the financial system are posed by the growth of derivatives, Isda's message
has always been that 'the risks are there already, and what needs to be
understood is the ways those risks are managed,' says Mr Bauman. With the
help of a series of derivatives seminars hosted by banks for government
officials, that message is now getting across.
In their mission to educate regulators, bankers have been helped by some of
the recent studies on derivatives published around the world. None has been
more helpful than this July's report from the Group of Thirty (G30).
Although many of its authors were prominent members of the international
banking community, and therefore deemed unlikely to criticise a business
that was generating billions of dollars of profits for the industry, the
G30's pronouncements were still eagerly awaited.
In the event, the study generally concurred with earlier reports by the Bank
of England and the BIS and gave the derivatives business a clean bill of
health, recommending only a series of management and operational reforms
banks should undertake to reduce risks. Bankers said they hoped the study
and its recommendations would become a blueprint for regulators.
The G30, however, steered clear of tackling the one issue that worries
regulators most - the possibility that something may go wrong in the
over-the-counter derivatives market that prompts a worldwide banking and
financial crisis.
That this threat still troubles regulators was evident in June when Mr
Alexandre Lamfalussy, general manager of the BIS, called for the drawing up
of common international standards on banks' disclosures of the risks on
their derivatives books. And it was also evident last month, when the
International Monetary Fund published its own study about derivatives and
warned that growth in derivatives trading may have created unknown risks for
banks.
Both Mr Lamfalussy and the IMF made the same point. The BIS chief said that
banks' participation in the derivatives markets had 'reduced the
transparency of their balance sheets', making it harder for regulators to
predict 'disturbances' that might pose 'systemic problems' in global
finance. The IMF said: 'Participation in derivatives markets can cause firms
to become connected through complicated transactions in ways that are not
easily understood.' This, the report concluded, made it 'extremely
difficult' for regulators to assess the risk of default in the system.
Regulatory scrutiny of the derivatives business is by no means over. Three
Washington-based bodies, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the General Accounting Office, are
all conducting studies into derivatives. And in September, the Comptroller
of the Currency, a key US bank regulator, announced it was establishing a
task force to monitor the market's evolution.
The GAO study, which was expected to be released this summer but which
probably will not be out until late this year or early 1993, is particularly
important because the GAO is the investigative body of Congress, and
Congress is where some of the tougher questions about derivatives are being
asked.
For now, Congressional interest in derivatives remains at an educational
level, with banks and end-users helping the legislators learn more about the
business. As Joe Bauman of the Isda says: 'We are finding that there is
still a fair amount of education to be done, because as a group they have
not been singularly looking at financial markets, and certainly not the
derivatives market.'
Bankers feel this educational process is paying off. Mr Doug Kidd, who is
responsible for government relations at Bankers Trust, says: 'Members of
Congress originally viewed derivatives as nothing more than new positioning
tools for financial institutions to make directional bets on markets. Now
that education generally is better, and end-users have participated in
seminars and talked about how they use derivatives, there's a new
appreciation among members of what derivatives are used for.'
Although they may now be better informed, legislators are still keen to
learn more about derivatives, and a series of committee hearings on the
business will be held this winter, including several by Mr Henry Gonzalez,
chairman of the senior Congressional banking committee and a regular thorn
in the side of US banks. With him, other legislators and many regulators
still on the derivatives trail, banks cannot relax.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (10): Europe waits for floodgates to
open - Futures Funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG performance by futures funds so far this year could help get the
nascent European market off the ground. According to industry estimates,
around Dollars 20bn is under management in futures funds in the US, but the
size of the market is much smaller in Europe - probably between Dollars
2-3bn. The European market also remains fragmented.
Most funds are registered in offshore financial centres, and pitched at high
net-worth individuals or small institutions in specific regions. Variations
and inconsistencies in the regulatory framework make it more convenient for
fund managers to register funds offshore, although most European futures
fund managers are based in London.
In the US, the strong regulatory environment and strict performance
reporting standards have helped futures funds to gain a respectability which
they have yet to acquire in Europe. For example, a number of US state
pension funds now publicly invest a portion of their portfolios in futures
funds.
Ms Nicola Meaden, managing director of TASS Management, which tracks futures
funds, says that there has been an increase in the number of funds launched
in Europe this year, but mainstream institutional interest has been slow to
develop. 'We are not seeing the floodgates open. In the short term,
institutions are finding it easier to tackle the hedge fund managers,' Ms
Meaden said. However, this year's strong performance may provide the
European futures fund business with some fresh impetus.
In the first eight months of this year, the average total return achieved by
futures fund managers was 17.45 per cent, according to the TASS index of
CTAs (commodity trading adviser - the industry term for the manager who
decides the investment strategy of a particular fund). The reason for this
strong performance is that 'we have had trending markets', according to Mr
Peter Swete, chairman of Sabre Fund Management, a futures fund specialist
which is now partly owned by Henderson.
Unlike most other investments, the performance of futures funds depends less
on whether markets are up or down, and more on the patterns of those
movements. Although the strategies of futures fund managers vary
considerably, what they have in common, apart from their use of derivatives,
is that they are based on data analysis and computer power.
Mr Swete, whose funds have risen 30 per cent over the past 12 months, says
that their strong performance has attracted new money, doubling the size of
funds under management for the same period. 'I think it has been a better
year generally in Europe, mainly because there has been better performance
after two or three grim years,' said Mr Mark Fox-Andrews at Mees-Pierson
Derivatives.
The increase in investor interest comes mainly from continental Europe, not
the UK, according to many industry specialists. One reason is that
'continental European banks are moving into the futures fund business,' Mr
Fox Andrews says.
A number of French banks, such as Indosuez, have been active in the market
for some time, but are now being joined by more Swiss, German and Dutch
banks. US banks are also becoming more active, though they tend to take a
slightly different approach. A number of them had lost traders from their
proprietary trading desks, who had decided to apply their skills by setting
up their own funds. Seeing an opportunity, several banks decided to take
advantage of this home-grown talent by setting up futures fund departments
staffed by former proprietary traders.
'Every major bank is now looking at this area,' according to one futures
fund manager, but many still have bad memories of being scalped by futures
brokers in the 1970s. This has also haunted the retail side of the industry
in the UK, which has not taken off in spite of the authorisation of futures
funds in the form of unit trusts.
Only a handful of futures and options funds (Fofs) and guaranteed futures
and options funds (GFofs) have been launched, partly because futures fund
managers are not able to pay themselves the high fees to which they are
accustomed.
'If you really want the top people you must pay them the top fees,' said one
fund manager. Standard performance fees on offshore futures funds are 15-20
per cent. However, management fees have fallen in recent years from around 4
per cent to 1-2 per cent.
There are plans to relax the rules on fees for UK-listed futures funds, but
so far retail investors have not appeared hugely enthusiastic. However, one
regulatory development which should help the UK futures fund business - or
at least prevent practitioners from moving offshore  - is the proposal by
the Securities and Futures Authority to recognise fund managers in the
sector as a separate category, defined as DFMs (derivative fund managers).
Because they do not hold any funds directly, they are to be allowed lower
capital requirements.
However, this is set to change when the EC Investment Services Directive
comes into force in 1996. At present, it is hard to predict the shape that
the futures fund industry will take over the next few years.
It is still highly entrepreneurial, one of very few areas of financial
services where it is possible to start from scratch, establish a track
record, and grow very rapidly.
Recent interest from banks suggests that the industry may become more
institutional in character. In addition, the growing use of derivatives and
of highly analytical computer trading techniques has blurred the lines
between different types of investment. In particular, it is increasingly
hard to draw a line between futures funds and hedge funds.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (11): Integration top of the agenda -
Technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF ANYONE needed reminding that players in the derivatives markets need to
do more work on integrating their front and back office technologies, this
summer's Group of Thirty report should have done the trick.
The G30 study looked into derivatives technology and systems, and singled
out integration as the most important issue facing the commercial and
investment banks which run big derivatives books and the large corporations
that use the products to manage the risks of their day-to-day businesses.
As the group's systems, operations and controls subcommittee said: 'Systems
that integrate the various tasks to be performed for derivatives are
complex. Because of the rapid development of the business, even the most
sophisticated dealers and users often rely on a variety of systems which may
be difficult to integrate in a satisfactory manner. While this situation is
inevitable in many organisations, it is not ideal and requires careful
monitoring . . .'
Integration matters most to derivatives dealers because without integrated
systems, they may not be able to properly measure, monitor and control the
various risks they carry on their books. The G30 is right to be concerned,
because by no means do all dealing firms in the business boast fully
integrated derivatives technology.
'Most banks have a patchwork quilt of systems,' says Mr Rod Beckstrom,
founder of California-based technology group C*ATS Software, who says that
only a handful of the biggest and most experienced derivatives players meet
the sort of standards outlined in the G30 report.
Mr Patrick Brazel, senior vice-president at UK-based derivatives technology
vendor SunGuard Capital Markets (previously Devon Systems), agrees: 'I don't
think the banks in general have cracked the problem of front to back office
integration.'
That the dealing community continues to struggle with integration is
primarily due to the frantic pace of product development in most front
offices. As one software supplier explains: 'New products are introduced to
the market when there's a need for a specific structured product, yet the
systems to support those products are developed entirely on an ad-hoc
basis.'
Consequently, back offices find themselves constantly playing a game of
technological catch-up with the front offices which keep coming up with a
supply of new products (or old products with new twists) tailor-made to
satisfy their clients' needs.
Building integrated systems, however, is not a simple task. Derivatives
technology, like derivatives themselves, has evolved in a random fashion.
Dealers have relied upon a variety of software and hardware, not all of it
compatible, to create, price and track derivatives instruments. Some of are
developed in-house, and some are bought from software vendors which
specialise in selling derivatives management systems. Many employ a
combination of the two.
When it comes to buying in the technology from outside (an option that more
and more dealers are taking as the number of derivative systems suppliers
rapidly grows), many firms purchase what are known as 'turnkey' systems,
which offer a complete off-the-shelf software package that aims to provide a
dealer with everything needed in the way of pricing, portfolio analysis and
risk management functions.
This is what the established derivatives technology suppliers - companies
such as SunGuard, C*ATS and Quotient - generally offer. Mr Beckstrom says
his firm sells software that 'allows treasurers to define and capture
complex derivatives, pull them in electronically and provide the tools to do
risk management analysis and reporting'.
Other products, known as 'toolkits', are more adaptable to technology which
provide the buyer with the flexibility to take their systems wherever they
wish in an open environment. They may not be ready to use as fast as the
turnkey systems, but they give the buyer more room to tailor the technology
to their own needs.
Mr Roger Lang, of US systems supplier Infinity International Financial
Technology, says that banks and other derivatives dealers need 'leverageable
tools and building blocks' to construct their own functions and support
their own models. When it comes to integration, 'we have to be able to allow
banks to determine their own fate,' he says.
A similar theme is sounded by Canadian consulting and software firm Glassco
Park, which sells software that can work inside other applications - in this
case, Microsoft Windows. Mr Robert Park, of Glassco Park, says that in the
past many derivatives dealers' systems 'were built around a database file
format appropriate only for accounting, which over the years has been
modified and remodified to try to accommodate new financial structures'.
In contrast, Glassco Park's approach is to build maths libraries to explain
the parts found in derivatives securities, and allow companies to construct
their systems around those libraries. The firm claims that is an affordable
and quick way to build integrated risk management systems, saving the time
and money involved in developing them from scratch.
While the buy-side has been investing heavily in derivatives technology, a
small but growing band of the corporations and investment institutions on
the sell-side have also been upgrading their systems.
This summer, Atlantic Portfolio Analytics and Management, a Dollars 3.7bn
fixed-income fund manager, bought a Cray supercomputer system to compute
complex arbitrages, swap options and hedges in a variety of cash and
derivatives markets. Although several securities firms, such as Prudential
Securities and Merrill Lynch, use supercomputers, APAM became the first
buy-side company to turn to supercomputing.
Also this summer, BP Finance, the banking and treasury subsidiary of the UK
oil group, began installing a real-time, deal-capture, position-keeping risk
management system from Wall Street Systems for its 200 foreign exchange and
derivatives traders in the US, UK and Australia.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (8): Quirky offshoots gain respect -
The growth of futures exchanges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWENTY years ago, futures exchanges were viewed as quirky offshoots of
larger markets. Although still treated with suspicion in some quarters,
futures exchanges have now positioned themselves at the heart of the world's
financial markets.
According to a recent report by the Group of Thirty, the Washington-based
think-tank, the notional amount of futures traded annually is now estimated
at Dollars 140,000bn.
The growth of futures markets has been fuelled by the increased
sophistication and internationalisation of financial markets, including the
proliferation of complex over-the-counter products which are then hedged
using exchange-traded products. In fact, the rapid development of financial
markets in the past 20 years could arguably not have been realised without
the growth of futures and options exchanges.
As barriers between markets have fallen, and international investors have
turned their attention to new markets, the establishment of futures
contracts has been an important factor in ensuring liquidity and hedging
opportunities. The new techniques developed in the derivatives markets have
had an impact on investment management, trading, technology, and risk
management. In spite of this success record, the exchanges themselves appear
less than confident.
In the US, the futures business is showing all the signs of a mature market
 -margins are shrinking, competition is intense, and market share is being
lost to younger European exchanges. But in Europe, too, in spite of annual
volume growth of 40 per cent for many exchanges, exchanges are aware of new
pressures. Mr Jorg Franke, chairman of the Deutsche Terminborse in
Frankfurt, believes that with more than 20 futures and commodities
exchanges, Europe has more exchanges than it needs.
Although new products are still being launched, the flow is easing, as the
pool of potential new products dries up. Without new contracts such as
Italian bond futures, it will be more difficult for European exchanges to
build volume. For all exchanges, the development in the past few years of an
increasingly active over-the-counter market in products such as swaps and
options, which can be used for some purposes instead of exchange-traded
products, is a cause for concern.
Mr Lynton Jones, chief executive of OM London, believes the OTC market will
continue to grow 'but some of their new products will be adapted for
exchanges'. The most successful such attempt so far is the Chicago Board
Options Exchange's FLEX options, which have exceeded Dollars 10bn in
underlying notional value in the first seven months of trading. FLEX Options
allow investors to use customised derivatives based on stock indices to
select various terms such as strike price and maturity.
Exchanges have also been trying to prepare themselves for a potentially more
difficult environment by creating cross-trading agreements, linkages and
even partnerships. One example is a grouping of smaller European exchanges,
known as First European Exchanges (Fex). The only linkage currently in place
is between OM London, the Swedish-owned electronic exchange, and the
European Options Exchange in Amsterdam. Under that agreement, EOE members
have OM screens on their desks in Amsterdam. However, OM members are linked
to the EOE only by telephone. Not surprisingly, the flow of business from
EOE members to OM has been the more significant.
Fex's other plans have already faltered. In July, Switzerland's Soffex was
forced to pull back from its linkage plans under pressure from Swiss banks
which want to get their own electronic stock trading system in place first.
Still in the early stages is a linkage of France's Matif and Germany's
Deutsche Terminborse, using DTB screens. As these exchanges command some of
the most actively traded contracts in Europe, this alliance could become a
powerful force.
The development of these linkages has fuelled discussion of technological
developments. Such linkages only really function efficiently for products
traded on a screen. Most large exchanges still trade using the traditional
open-outcry method, which involves grouping traders in a large pit.
Proponents of open-outcry trading claim that screen systems cannot cope with
heavy volume.
The success of the DTB has shown that screen trading does not necessarily
mean illiquid trading. Nevertheless, most traders familiar with both methods
prefer trading using the open-outcry method. Some, though, say that it is
only a matter of time before the technology of screen-trading is
sufficiently advanced to be able to simulate pit-trading.
Despite its shaky start, the most important development in exchange trading
so far this decade was the launch last year of Globex, the international
after-hours screen trading system jointly developed by Reuters and the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade. Volume on the
system jumped when France's Matif, the only exchange to join the system so
far, added its products earlier this year; but much of the volume was a
direct shift of business from the Matif's over-the-counter after-hours
market, which closed at the same time as Matif products moved on to Globex.
Globex has also been dogged by squabbles between the two exchanges, and
failure to reach agreement with other potential members of the system,
particularly Liffe.
Nevertheless, the description of the system at its launch by Mr Leo Melamed,
then head of Globex, as 'the dawn of a new era', could still prove true. The
Chicago exchanges point out that the system cannot be judged to have failed
until it has screens all over the world, as envisaged in their original
vision of a global trading village. 'How do you sell hot dogs in Japan when
you don't even have a hot dog stand there?' asks Mr Jack Sandner, head of
the CME. Globex has only recently received regulatory approval to install
screens in Asia, which is potentially the key time-zone for the after-hours
market, and is starting a marketing thrust in the region.
Nevertheless, the success of the system will also depend on attracting other
exchanges to list their products. The recent reopening of talks between
Liffe and Globex is clearly a hopeful sign, but the battle for a critical
mass of volume on the system has yet to be won.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (9): Swaps trade dodges issue - Now
that the debate for a multilateral swaps clearing house has died down, even
the most self-interested proponents recognise that the swaps trade, a highly
customised retail market, will not fit into a wholesale clearing mould.

<TEXT>
THE IDEA of a futures-style clearing house for over-the-counter derivatives
gained prominence early this year, in part because the US government had
just exempted swaps from US commodity regulations, increasing the uneasiness
politicians and bank regulators have about the Dollars 7,000bn market.
Advocates argued that a multilateral swaps clearing house would broaden
access to the burgeoning market, reduce credit risks, and produce reams of
data for regulatory scrutiny. The world's biggest futures exchanges, at
least one law firm, and several dealers rushed to research prototypes.
However, the handful of AAA-rated banks and dealers who conduct 80 per cent
of the world's swaps trade carefully sidestepped the clearing house debate,
knowing that without their participation, a swaps clearing house would not
succeed.
They value the competitive edge their credit ratings deliver, and are
satisfied with their own credit controls.
Now that the excitement has died down, even the most self-interested
proponents recognise that the swaps trade, a highly customised retail
market, will not fit into a wholesale clearing mould. Consensus is building
that what is needed instead is a series of third-party agents providing
services usually performed by a clearing house.
Dealers would continue bilateral netting, using standard master agreements
like those provided by ISDA, the International Swaps and Derivatives
Association, but trade matching confirmations, collateral handling, and
depository duties would be outsourced to others.
'There are credible substitutes provided by reputable institutions for
almost every individual function of a swaps clearing house,' Mr John
Davidson, senior vice-president of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's
clearing operations, told a banking group recently. 'As their functionality
improves, the incremental need for a clearing house diminishes.
The swaps industry perhaps has learned from the long, controversial, and
expensive attempts to develop clearing houses for over-the-counter foreign
exchange transactions. Several ventures, such as New York-based FxNet, has
bilaterally netted spot trades for years. However, multilateral clearing
remains elusive, and most efforts have avoided derivatives altogether.
Two competing groups, one on each side of the Atlantic, plan to offer
multilateral foreign exchange contract netting and global settlement
services next year, and intend to include forward contracts as well as spot
deals.
Multinet, backed primarily by First Chicago and Chase Manhattan, will use
the services of the Options Clearing Corp.
Multinet lost the backing of several top-rated banks when they realised the
venture, by enhancing credit quality, could strengthen their weaker rivals.
'We knew from the start this was a project subject to fractious
relationships,' says Mr Garrett Glass, a senior vice-president at First
National Bank of Chicago, and the chief architect of the six-year-long
project.
Echo, or the Exchange Clearing house, has much the same object as Multinet.
Based in London it has a dozen bank shareholders, and is being directed
primarily by Barclays. Its prolonged development has been due to
difficulties in guiding its charter through jealous waters, and to the fact
that starting any kind of clearing operation from scratch is extremely
expensive.
In the swaps market, the credit worries extend far beyond initial settlement
risk, with credit exposures extending over the term of the contract. Banks,
even more than regulators, are concerned about this exposure.
In addition to imposing strict credit quality standards and credit limits on
customers and counterparties, the swaps industry has begun to collect
collateral on all but the most standard transactions, and to mark positions
to market to assess risk ore accurately .
Both practices are the basis of the high credit quality awarded to
exchange-affiliated clearing houses.
Although the CME has considered developing a swaps clearing house, Mr
Davidson says that fundamentally, the existing system of counterparty credit
limits works. 'Banks and other financial intermediaries are good at applying
them, supervisors are good at reviewing them, and senior management
understands them. Rapidly untethering the swaps market from its current,
largely self-imposed limitations, may not have entirely desirable systemic
risk implications,' he says.
If the primary swaps dealers do begin to move toward an organised clearing
house, they will be driven by regulatory capital requirements. It is widely
assumed that a fully collateralised swaps clearing house would be exempted
from requirements to beef up capital to back up trades.
However, if this spring's Basle Committee proposal to recognise bilateral
close-out netting is approved, capital reserve requirements for swap-dealing
banks could be trimmed by more than half, according to Mr Ottho Heldring, a
vice-president at Chase Manhattan Bank. That, in turn, would widen the use
of standard netting agreements, and hasten the evolution of agents to
service settlement and collateral processing needs.
One such service is Bankers Trust's C-Trac+, which offers third-party
processing for all types of collateralised OTC transactions.
Capitalising on the bank's own derivatives processing capabilities, the
product tracks exposures, makes margin calls, and handles the pricing and
custody of the assets pledged as collateral.
Ms Eileen Bedell, managing director for Bankers, says the product is aimed
at derivative dealers that may not have fully developed back office
procedures, and find using the system less expensive than developing
in-house capabilities. She thinks that as the derivatives business becomes
more competitive, consolidating back-office functions will become more
popular.
'People will begin to realise that a swaps trading model is proprietary, but
margin tracking is not,' she says.
However, since most leading dealers have already invested in their own
processing functions, she says the new services can only compete by reducing
costs and increasing profitability.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (7): Hedge against stock swings -
Equity products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU peek into the portfolio of an equity fund manager nowadays, the
chances are that you might not find any shares. Instead, there could be a
whole load of bonds in the portfolio.
Before you sue the fund manager for misrepresentation, there is a good
reason for what appears to be a contradictory state of affairs.
The fund manager will be using the income from the bonds to buy equity
derivative products which should enable his fund to achieve higher returns
than other similar funds in the market place.
Equity derivatives have become an integral part of a fund manager's life as
the fund management industry becomes increasingly competitive. 'Fund
managers are doing everything possible to get the best performance,' says
the head of equity derivatives at a leading Japanese bank in London.
In addition, the use of equity derivatives is now spreading to all areas of
finance as a higher priority is given to managing risk as effectively as
possible.
Users of equity derivatives can be divided into three main categories:
insurance companies and investment fund companies which want to launch new
products to sell to their retail clients; pension funds which want to have
an exposure to a certain equity market without having to go out and buy
shares in that market; corporate treasurers who want tools to manage or
hedge different exposures on their balance sheets.
Most equity derivative products, which are traded over the counter (OTC) or
on futures and options exchanges, can be tailored to each client's specific
needs.
'Essentially, we use equity derivative products to solve any problems which
our client might have,' says one derivatives trader.
Some traders say that the drawback of these individual structured deals is
that they are not liquid and are difficult to get out of once you are in.
However, others say that these deals are essentially made up of a series of
building blocks which can be unwound at any time.
As a result of the customised nature of the market, most of the innovations
in equity derivatives products are born in the over-the-counter market which
can cater for individual needs. However, the exchanges are quick to catch on
to any new products.
Although products traded on the exchanges tend to be more standardised than
those in the OTC market, they are attractive to investors who are not
allowed to buy products which are not listed.
One important advantage of buying a listed product is that the exchange acts
as a central clearing house which helps to reduce a market participant's
credit exposure.
By contrast, participants in the OTC market may well trade directly with a
counterparty which has an inferior credit rating.
However, an increasing number of entities with triple-A ratings are starting
to provide derivative products in the OTC markets which should help to
reduce this credit risk concern.
There has been an enormous growth in volume in equity derivatives products
and investors can now have an exposure to all the leading stock markets in
the world without having to actually buy shares in those markets.
The next target will be emerging stock markets in Latin America and Asia as
soon as they are deemed to have sufficient liquidity to support a
derivatives market. Mexico, Hong Kong and Singapore are likely to be the
first to take this step.
The types of products on offer are also becoming increasingly exotic and
investors can now hedge themselves against virtually every movement in a
stock market.
'There are few limits left to what we can offer investors as long as they
pay to take the risk and the reward,' says a derivatives trader at a UK
securities house.
Retail investors are also creeping into what is still a largely
institutional domain since equity derivatives are being used to structure
OTC products which guarantee a specific return.
These 'guaranteed return' products are heavily marketed to retail investors
who have seen their income from cash deposits dwindle over the past year as
a result of the substantial drop in interest rates.
These kinds of products, which rely heavily on derivatives for their ability
to outperform the underlying equity market, are widespread in the United
States but are relatively new in Europe.
In the UK, the wider use of derivatives has been held up by legislative and
fiscal difficulties. However, now that these issues have been clarified
there has been a tremendous increase in OTC products which are sold to
retail investors.
Liffe, London's financial futures and options exchange, is relying on retail
investors as part of its ambitious plan to stimulate new interest in equity
options.
In the US and in the Netherlands, it is the retail investor, and not the
institutional client, who is responsible for about 70 per cent of trading
volume in these instruments.
In the UK, the situation is the reverse, with private investors estimated to
contribute less than 20 per cent of total equity and index option volume.
Liffe has therefore taken steps to make equity options more accessible to
the public. Prices of individual equity options are now available on the
BBC's teletext facility, Ceefax.
Retail investors were also given priority when Liffe conducted a review of
individual equity options. The exchange dropped four existing options and
introduced eight new ones, leaving 70 equity options which better reflect
the composition of retail and institutional portfolio holdings.
Liffe does not expect investors, large and small, to change their habits
overnight, but aims to double trading volume of equity options within two
years. Currently, just over 1m contracts are traded each quarter.
Trading in equity options reached a high of 3.1m contracts in the second
quarter of 1987, just before the global stock market crash which occurred
that October.
While a volume-based target is probably the most widely perceived measure of
success, Liffe believes that other goals are equally important.
These range from a substantial increase in the use of equity options by
institutional and private clients, to increased liquidity in individual
equity options.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (6): Cutting raw material risks -
Commodity products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of low commodity prices in recent years, a range of innovative
hedging arrangements offered by banks and brokers has appeared on the
market. Some bankers see the slight upturn in commodity prices in recent
months as an indication that a recovery has set in which could give a new
boost to commodity swaps and over-the-counter derivatives.
'If base metals prices bottom out and we see a turnaround, the growth in
that market could be huge as most consumers are currently not hedged,' said
Mr Per Sekse, vice-president for commodity derivatives at Chemical Bank in
London.
Credit Lyonnais, the French investment bank, is so confident of finding new
business in the commodity derivatives sector that it set up a new arm in
September, Credit Lyonnais Rouse Derivatives, to extend its involvement into
structured finance deals.
However, commodity prices have been depressed for several years and,
overall, have declined again this year. Goldman Sachs's commodity index,
which tracks the prices of a range of commodities from metals to energy and
agricultural products, showed a 4.4 per cent decline in the year to the
beginning of October.
Goldman is forecasting a modest upturn in prices over the next six months,
fuelled by supply-demand imbalances as low prices have not encouraged
investment in new capacity.
In a low price environment, commodity derivatives can allow a company to
lock in a price - either for its raw material or for its sales - and at
least meet its budget objectives when cashflow is stretched.
By using OTC products, companies can also hedge to position themselves
strategically in the market for a number of years ahead.
These derivatives are often also traded on futures exchanges, but banks can
cut individual deals in the OTC markets that extend years beyond the
timescale offered by the traditional exchanges.
The most sophisticated area of hedging in the OTC market is in the energy
sector where the exchanges do not always provide products that cover parts
of the refined oil barrel. For instance; although there is a thriving
futures market for crude oil in London and New York and gas oil in New York,
there is no exchange-traded futures contract for jet fuel.
Mr Sekse describes how a leading oil company recently bought an option on
the spread between jet fuel and gas oil. This covers the company's risk of
hedging its jet fuel sales to airlines by using gas oil futures. The prices
of jet fuel and gas oil are different, so the company runs a certain amount
of risk of those prices diverging: that risk can be limited by buying a
tailor-made option on the spread between the prices of the two fuels.
Mr Chris Mason, managing director at Credit Lyonnais Rouse Derivatives, says
airlines have increasingly been using swaptions in jet fuel as a way of
reducing their fuel costs. Some 18 to 20 per cent of an airline's running
costs are accounted for by the fuel bill and using fixed and floating rate
price swaps, CLRD can reduce that bill by 1 per cent.
Energy companies and airlines are more sophisticated users of these types of
hedging deals - more so than similar companies in other sectors. Many banks
and brokers are trying to move into a position where they can offer these
products to carmakers, for example, food companies and aluminium smelters.
'You are battling with an inherently bullish attitude among management,' Mr
Sekse says. 'They say the reason they are in the commodity business is so
that their share prices carry commodity price risk and they always believe
the price is going to go up again.' His challenge is to convince some
conservative company managers that 'not hedging is as risky as hedging'.
Mr Mason adds that for some mine operators, hedging could be the deciding
factor on whether or not they get bank financing for their start-up costs.
CLRD offers a rolling hedge for, say a copper mine, to lock in the price of
its output for five years making the project more viable.
CLRD will also finance the cost of holding metal stocks for an aluminium
company. The company can sell its entire stock to the broker and then buy it
back when it needs it - buying at a spot price which is cheaper than the
forward price. It helps the company to get the cost of carrying stock off
its balance sheet and the broker locks in a profit by selling the metal
forward which it shares with the metal producer.
Hedging is less familiar in the agricultural and soft commodities sector,
not least because the prices of many products are government-controlled.
Some consumers are using the OTC markets to hedge purchases of frozen orange
juice, but Mr Mason believes the food sector could offer enormous potential
for these hedging arrangements because it is largely untapped.
There is no regular deal flow for banks and brokers from this sector of the
market, but much marketing effort is being directed at this type of
business.
'It can take a lot of patience to convince producers of the need to hedge
soft commodities - often as long as six to nine months before they start
looking at a deal,' said Mr Sekse. The timing is also crucial since the
market could, in the meantime, have moved in the wrong direction and the
producer could be put off again.
In the agricultural sector, a number of banks and brokers are working on a
hedge for the green pound - the theoretical currency linked to the Ecu in
which EC farmers are paid subsidies. This is almost impossible to achieve,
but is in demand from food manufacturers.
The food companies are less interested in hedging since they tend to have
higher margins than companies in the energy sector and can more easily
absorb changes in prices of raw materials. But a number are beginning to
look at the possibility of locking in some prices.
The commodities sector offers wide potential for innovative deal-making and
growth in future is expected to come - at least initially - from the energy
business. Other sectors present a hard sell to the banks involved in the
business and a challenge to convince conservative companies to dip a toe in
the complex waters of derivatives.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (4): ERM crises quicken activity -
Currency Products
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE THE late 1980s, the trade in currency derivative products has been one
of the fastest growing sectors of the foreign exchange business. But
successive crises in the European exchange rate mechanism in the past year
have given this sector a stimulus that few dealers could have anticipated.
Until a few years ago, the personnel on a bank's derivatives desk were often
regarded as unusual figures - more akin to rocket scientists than currency
traders. In its infancy, the currency derivatives market was a supply-led
business, with banks spending huge sums on the research and development of
products which, they hoped, would allow customers to hedge risks.
The growing participation of institutional investors in currency dealing
over the past five years gave currency derivatives an initial boost.
Institutions such as pension funds and insurance funds have greatly
increased their purchase of overseas assets in recent years.
They have been keen to hedge the exposure of these assets - like bonds and
equities - to exchange rate moves. That is why they have purchased
derivative products which allow them to lock in to established exchange
rates.
But it was the recent crises in the ERM that led to an explosion of interest
in this area.
The departure of sterling and the Italian lira from the system in the autumn
of 1992 was followed by the momentous decision to widen the bands for most
ERM currencies to 15 per cent on August 2 of this year. With currencies
fluctuating over much wider areas, investors have rushed to hedge their
exposures.
'There has been a 5 to 10 per cent increase in the use of these products
over the past 12 months,' said Mr Patrick Allaway, managing director of
Global Foreign Exchange at Swiss Bank Corporation in London. 'Institutions
are facing volatility in European cross-rates for the first time, and that
is making derivative products much more attractive.'
One of the principal instruments that investors use is the forward contract,
which allows him or her to purchase or sell a currency at an exchange rate
that is set at a fixed date in the future.
The other popular alternative is the currency 'option'. This gives the
customer the opportunity to buy or sell a currency if it should 'strike' a
certain exchange rate. The contract is paid for by means of a premium which
is set by the bank.
The main customers for these instruments tend to be leading institutional
investors or multinationals with payments and receiveables in different
currencies. It is selective clientele - and that may be derivative products
are not cheap. There are two reasons for this:
The increase in exchange rate volatility in recent years has made it riskier
for banks to write options. In August 1992 and July 1993 - the height of the
ERM crises - premiums were selling at some three times above their normal
levels. The volatility has subsided, but premiums on European currency
options are still higher than normal.
Second, options can be expensive because they are often tailor-made for a
particular customer. Options can be bought on an exchange, but the most
attractive variants are over-the-counter options (OTCs) which a bank designs
for an institution's particular requirements.
According to Mr Allaway, the most attractive options today are 'basket'
options, which allow a currency to be hedged against a group of European
currencies. That option might be bought by a customer who is unsure what
specific trades he will be making in European currencies over a given period
of time.
Another popular variant is the 'down-and-out' option. This allows a customer
to let the option lapse if the exchange rate moves in a direction which is
favourable to him. The attraction of these options is their lower premium.
However, if these are tools increasingly used by the principal customers,
then they are also being provided by an ever smaller elite of commercial
banks.
The research and development investment required to be at the forefront of
the derivatives business is so great that only a handful of players can
afford it. Mr Allaway says that some 90 per cent of the turnover of the
business is controlled by just six banks with a strong presence in London -
and their market share is increasing.
Moreover, banks have to be very careful about participating in a business
where losses can - theoretically - be astronomical. In the ERM crisis of
September 1992, some French banks were thought to have been extremely badly
burned by the exposure of their derivatives teams to exchange rate
movements.
So, successful option teams need to have very clear management structures
around the business. They also have to provide sufficient capital to hedge
the 'underlying' moves that follow the writing of any options.
The banks are confident that they can manage this business. But governments
and central bankers are increasingly concerned about the possibilities of a
credit default in the derivatives sector that would destabilise markets.
Earlier this year the Bank for International Settlements said that it might
extend the amount of cash cover that commercial banks had to set against the
risks that were being taken in their derivatives operations.
There are also concerns that the growth of the derivatives market could
intensify the flows in spot foreign exchange markets in a way that would
also be destabilising.
At the moment, the options business accounts for around 3 per cent of total
turnover in foreign exchange. But some currency managers believe that this
is enough to impact some 10 per cent of the total flows in the spot market.
Some dealers believe that if options were to account for a 10 per cent share
of all turnover, these instruments would be generating around half of all
the flows in the market. There is a danger that this would create extreme
volatility at certain times, providing another headache for central bankers
who are trying to regulate the operations of foreign exchange dealers.

Legal Issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS DERIVATIVES trans-actions metamorphosed at a dizzying rate in the 1980s,
turning bonds and options into swaps and swaptions, strips and tigers, with
collars and floors, they mutated beyond traditional securities regulation,
and put themselves into a land of legal limbo.
Financial engineers driving quirky softwear on powerful Sun workstations
have not only left stodgy bond traders with their broker screens in the
dust, they have befuddled regulators unaccustomed to dealing with hybrid
financial instruments.
The fact that derivative deals represent thousands of billions of dollars in
capital and regularly cross political borders makes the legal wrangles, and
their accompanying risk, all the more onerous.
Recognising that banking and trading laws were written long before there
were over-the-counter derivatives, banks are working to seal the gaps left
where derivative transactions do not fit into old-fashioned legal
categories. The problems of defining what derivatives are, who is allowed to
trade them, and how to enforce standard agreements designed to reduce
transaction risks are all hot issues in banking.
The ubiquitous interest rate swaps, for example, risk being judged illegal
under the gambling laws of countries as diverse as France, Brazil, Canada
and Japan, and until recently, under the commodities regulations of the
United States. In some countries swaps risk has been classified as usurious,
and is illegal.
Mr Dan Cunningham, partner at the US law firm Cravath, Swaine and Moore and
counsel to the International Swap and Derivatives Association, says
tremendous progress has been made in these areas, and that clarifying
legislation is being sought in countries where the line of the law is
cloudy.
Changes in the legal environment have come in important areas. US commodity
regulators this year declared that swaps were exempt from futures
regulations, wiping away a huge legal uncertainty in the US. Australia is
considering similar legal adjustments.
In France, national financial authorities last September issued a circular
that defined who is allowed to use swaps, and under what conditions they can
trade. Local governments in France, for example, cannot speculate in
derivatives, but can use them to hedge.
However, those changes have occurred under conditions still in flux.
Uneasiness about the risks derivatives pose to the world banking system
prompted the US Congress to reserve final word on derivatives regulation,
and some legislators view the swaps exemption from commodity law as simply
an interim act on the way to more structured swaps regulation.
In another category of legal risk, derivatives dealers have become
increasingly more circumspect about who they take as a swaps counterparty,
not just from a credit standpoint, but from the view of legal eligibility.
Governments, particularly municipalities, can be attracted to derivatives
deals, but their qualification for a swaps marriage is not always clear.
The costs of consorting with an ineligible counterparty were driven home in
the UK in 1991, when the House of Lords ruled that the London Borough of
Hammersmith and Fulham, an active sterling interest rate swaps trader, did
not have the power to enter into derivative contracts.
The decision voided five years worth of contracts, and forced the local
authority and the involved financial institutions to take losses. The
decision also voided similar deals between more than 130 UK councils and 75
of the world's largest banks, stirring up legal appeals that are still in
the courts.
Now, rather than assume a counterparty is eligible under existing statutes,
banks and other dealers are demanding a definitive body of law.
In the US, lobbyists have persuaded about 25 states to enact laws defining
who can use derivatives. Lawyers say the process has been slower in other
countries, particularly in Germany.
Despite the huge amounts of money sloshing through the over-the-counter
markets, industry advocates say there have been remarkably few defaults. A
recent ISDA survey put cumulative losses at a mere Dollars 358m in the past
10 years, and half of those were attributed to the Hammersmith case.
The past cannot necessarily predict the future, however, and credit risk is
the predominant concern of every derivatives dealer and bank regulator.
Most swaps dealers use standard contracts to define their transactions, and
to reduce credit risks, many engage in bilateral netting agreements.
If the contract is terminated early, because of bankruptcy or liquidation,
the netting agreements allow payables and receivables to cancel each other
out, limiting the credit risk of the solvent counterparty to net exposures.
Enforcing netting is rife with potholes, however, and only slowly are
bankruptcy judges and others recognising them as valid.
Of all the industrialised countries, lawyers say France is the most
questionable jurisdiction for enforcing netting.
A 1989 ruling in the US allows netting between US-based counterparties, and
the practice is generally recognised in the UK.
The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision of the Bank for International
Settlements in April released a proposal to recognise bilateral close-out
netting as a means of reducing credit risk for the purpose of measuring bank
capital adequacy. It is now seeking international comments on the plan.
A controversial offshoot of the netting discussion is the idea of
multibranch netting. A financial institution with operations and assets
worldwide will choose a location, for tax or other purposes, in which to
register a swaps transaction.
If an institution finds itself in collapse, as happened in the case of the
Bank of Credit and Commerce International, world bank regulators may wrangle
over the proper way to deal with the remains, putting the integrity of the
netting agreements in jeopardy.
Mr Cunningham says the issues of enforcability of multibranch netting have
gained attention since the BCCI case. A derivatives report issued in July by
the Washington-based think-tank, the Group of Thirty, suggests a solution.
'Resolution will come only if and when it is clear that insolvency of a bank
with several branches in different countries will be handled as a single
proceeding and not as separate proceedings for the bank and each branch,' he
says.
This recommendation, and others like it, leans towards standard global
financial regulation, an evolution that legal demands of derivatives trading
may accelerate.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (3): New box of risk-management tricks
 -A look at the sell side: commercial and investment banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS ONE of the great paradoxes of the derivatives industry. Some leading
US commercial banks, battered in the 1980s by excessive concentrations of
lending to third world countries, the property sector and leveraged
buy-outs, have set themselves up in the 1990s as experts in risk management.
Is an industry which proved so lax in controlling its own risks - and which
has been bailed out only by the lowest US interest rates in memory - really
in a position to advise others on theirs?
The banks say they have emerged stronger and wiser from the experience of
the 1980s. 'Banks have learned as an industry that concentration is not a
good thing,' says Mr Peter Hancock, head of derivatives at J P Morgan, a
bank which came through the excesses of the 1980s better than most.
Bankers Trust remains the most extreme example of the phenomenon which has
turned banks from pools of risk themselves into providers of risk management
instruments. Stuck with third world debt and bridge loans which it was
unable to sell on through the securities markets, the US's seventh biggest
banking group (in terms of assets) slumped to a near-Dollars 1bn loss in
1989. Yet the experience coincided with an early move into derivative
markets which left Bankers Trust as the most profitable commercial bank in
the US last year, with a return on equity of 23 per cent.
Not surprisingly, derivatives and risk management are now virtually a
religion inside Bankers Trust. 'It's not a product - it's more a way of
life,' says Mr Brian Walsh, head of derivatives. The most obvious embodiment
of this: the bank's much-emulated method of allocating capital based on an
analysis of both credit and market risk through a unified model. Known as
'raroc' (for 'risk-adjusted return on capital'), this capital-allocation
model was adjusted a year ago to take more account of the liquidity risk
implicit in different types of asset, Mr Walsh says (the lower the
liquidity, the higher the capital charge applied internally.)
The re-emergence of risk-taking in commercial banks has been most pronounced
in the swaps markets. They may have retreated from commercial lending in the
1990s (in part because the strongest companies can raise money at better
rates direct from the capital markets), but this has not stopped banks
taking on new credit risks. As counterparties to swap transactions, most
banks have been adding off-balance sheet credit exposure to replace
shrinking on-balance sheet risks. Mr Hancock calls it 'the rebirth of bank
intermediation'. It has provided a route for banks to reinvent themselves as
credit institutions - and this time, they claim, the risks are being spread
more evenly through the system.
Bankers Trust, which invested earlier than most in the people and technology
needed to run a derivatives business, and J P Morgan, with its strong
balance sheet and good relationships with many big companies, have been the
most profitable 'money centre' banks in the US this year. Much of this is
due to derivatives, though neither bank reports profits from derivatives
separately.
To hear these banks talk, their new box of risk management tricks offers
almost limitless possibilities. Most big decisions taken by their corporate
customers - such as whether to build a new factory, or buy another company -
involve the taking of many different business and market risks. Through the
derivatives markets (whether currency, interest rate or commodity) those
risks can be split apart and managed separately. Mr Walsh points to one
example: the ability to lock into a fixed oil price for up to 10 years.
'That must have a profound effect on the way oil companies are run,' he
says.
If companies respond to these blandishments, then the most successful
intermediaries in the derivatives markets will be those best able to act as
the lightning conductors through which risk is transfered from one group to
another. The ability to price and hedge exposures - many of which, unlike
equities or fixed income securities, have no underlying cash market - will
also be an important determinant of future profits.
Risk-management skills learned in the equity, currency or fixed income
derivatives markets are already taking commercial banks into new areas.
Insurance could prove the next great opportunity. The risk transfer
mechanism in the insurance industry is dominated by a limited number of
large institutions, whether insurers or reinsurers. Much like the banking
industry, these institutions carry large exposures and are vulnerable to
unforeseen events: one big US hurricane, say, could wipe out a whole year's
property/casualty insurance profits in one go.
Through the same risk-transfer mechanism pioneered in other derivative
markets, both Bankers Trust and JP Morgan say they are already linking the
exposures in the insurance industry to the wider capital markets. According
to Mr Hancock: 'Just as derivatives have brought regional capital markets
together, it will help to connect that (insurance) market with others. It
leaves you with a bigger pool of risk takers to absorb the shocks.'
The effect on the giants of the insurance industry could be profound. 'It's
the last area in financial services to go through significant change,' says
Mr Walsh, though he hesitates to suggest that the capital markets will
eventually prove a better mechanism for transfering insurance risks than the
insurance companies.
It is not surprising, therefore, to see some big insurers moving into the
derivatives markets themselves.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (2): A two-pronged development - The
burgeoning market in interest-rate derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST rates are hitting rock bottom, the US government is serious about
trimming its deficit, and portfolio managers, stung by unthinkably low
returns, are baling out of the bond markets for more profitable venues.
Does this mean the burgeoning markets in interest-rate derivatives, one of
the more stunning financial phenomena of the eighties, are close to peaking?
No, say dealers. Fixed income derivatives, which are proliferating rapidly,
are thriving on the uncertainty created by a 300-basis-point drop in US
interest rates in a year, the volatility in European currency differentials
following the demise of the ERM, and a massive restructuring of corporate
debt.
Last year US corporate treasurers moved en masse to switch fixed-rate
obligations, which looked very attractive only a few months earlier, to
lower-cost floating rate debt. Even the US government, confident of its own
ability to keep inflation low, shifted its debt sales to shorter maturities.
The phenomenon is now hitting Europe as rates there fall.
To hear some bankers tell it, on a quiet day in London you can almost hear
the scurrying as corporate treasurers, locked into fixed-rate debt at 8 and
9 per cent, rush to swap into adjustable-rate deals, to take advantage of
falling interest rates. Reversing once-attractive fixed rate deals is
expensive, although they ultimately lower financing costs, and dealers have
become creative about embedding option-like features into the contracts to
bring down their cost.
'Interest rate derivatives are developing into a two-pronged market,' says
Mr Leon Tatevossian, vice-president for derivatives research at Salomon
Brothers. 'New products are evolving to meet ever more complicated risk
management needs, while the use of structured transactions by asset managers
to enhance portfolio yields is another big growth area.'
Once the province of US government securities dealers who used the Chicago
interest-rate futures and options pits to hedge their wholesale bond
purchases, the use of derivatives trickled down from banks to corporate
treasurers, then to asset managers, and now even to individuals seeking
higher yields by investing in derivative-driven mutual funds.
Derivatives dealers who once focused exclusively on designing vehicles for
customers who wanted to hedge liabilities are now reaching out to asset
managers who are beginning to use manufactured securities as investments.
Shrewd futures traders have been speculating in derivatives for years, but
for the portfolio manager who does not want to be exposed to daily market
moves, a tailored over-the-counter deal is more suitable than an exchange
trade.
Creating a healthy 'buy side' audience for structured debt will provide
balance to the derivatives industry, although some critics say asset
managers, by piling into the instruments in a frantic search for yield,
could get burned if there is an unexpected interest rate shock.
And the liability-management side of the derivative utility equation is
nowhere near being exhausted, in the US or elsewhere.
In the US, a new accounting regulation known as FAS 115 is likely to pull
conservative regional bankers, insurance companies, and other
capital-sensitive businesses who have resisted the trend, into the
derivatives fold.
The regulation, which becomes effective in January 1994, requires that
securities be classified as either 'held to maturity', 'available for sale',
or 'held for trading'. Securities in either of the two latter categories
must be regularly marked to market, a factor that makes them suddenly
vulnerable to even small fluctuations in long-term interest rates.
The new requirements are expected to throw many more securities into the
'available for sale' accounting bin, and while the marked-to market process
will not show through on income statements, it will affect equity and
capital requirements.
'A company that is capital-sensitive will have to keep a closer eye on what
is happening in the available-for-sale account. Its just one more risk
they'll have to manage,' says Marjorie Marker, a senior manager and
derivatives specialist for Arthur Andersen.
She believes derivatives will play a large part in helping these companies
mitigate this new market risk. However, conservative organisations, mainly
small banks, will simply move assets into shorter maturities, an action that
will trim the margins they now reap in the spread between borrowing customer
funds at 3 per cent interest and lending them to the government at 6 per
cent.
Far from stealing business from organised futures and options exchanges, the
evolution and diversification of interest-rate derivatives has fuelled
tremendous growth in exchange-traded products. Even the most exotic swaps
and structured notes designed for a single customer are eventually distilled
into a risk a dealer will hedge in a futures or options pit.
Sometimes, when the custom transactions are for long maturity periods or
require frequent rate adjustments, the over-the-counter deal will be hedged
and covered and re-hedged repeatedly on an exchange.
This helps explain why the total notional value of interest-rate swaps
outstanding at the end of 1992, at Dollars 3,800bn, as reported by the trade
group ISDA, was smaller than the same measure of current open positions in
US-exchange-traded interest-rate derivatives, and far smaller than the value
of exchange-traded government debt worldwide.
The exchanges are best described as wholesale debt-management markets, and
their growth rates expand in concert with custom-tailored derivatives.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange had a 14.2 per cent year-over-year growth
rate in interest-rate futures and options at the end of the third quarter,
while at the Chicago Board of Trade, interest-rate transactions grew by 17.8
per cent. That compares with ISDA estimates that over-the-counter interest
rate swaps, in all currencies, grew at a 19 per cent rate last year.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (1): Moving on to centre stage - The
development of derivatives business has become the most important strategic
goal of the 1990s for banks and securities houses with global ambitions.
Tracy Corrigan examines one of the most dynamic growth areas in financial
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY three years into the decade, the 1990s are already being dubbed the
decade of derivatives. Virtually all banks, securities houses and other
financial institutions with international ambitions have identified the
derivatives market as a crucial strategic area.
Non-financial companies are making increasing use of derivatives to hedge
their exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate fluctuations. Slower
off the mark, institutional investors are also starting to warm to
derivative instruments, which can be particularly useful for asset
allocation.
At the same time, the new emphasis on derivatives is having a strong impact
on other areas within the banking and securities business, fuelling, for
example, advances in technology, and causing banks to reassess their
attitudes to risk.
'The strategic question to ask about any bank right now is: have they
embraced derivatives? And if not, have they found anything else to embrace
instead?' says one analyst.
The market has already come through a period of rapid development. The
notional amount of futures contracts traded annually on the world 's
exchanges is around Dollars 140,000bn, while the notional amount of
over-the-counter swaps outstanding is about Dollars 4,500bn.
Futures and options listed on exchanges are standardised contracts, based on
an underlying market, which are traded on and cleared through an exchange.
Over-the-counter products, such as swaps and options, can be tailored to
suit a particular user's needs, and are bilateral agreements between two
separate counterparties.
There are now liquid futures contracts based on most of the world's large
stock and bond markets. In some cases, the futures markets are more actively
traded than the underlying instruments on which they are based.
New markets are still developing in Asia and Latin America, but in the US,
and to a lesser extent in Europe, futures exchanges are already highly
developed.
'The real emphasis has to be on organic growth,' said Mr Daniel Hodson,
chief executive of the London International Financial Futures Exchange, who
admits that after establishing a range of European products over the past 10
years the universe of potentially active new contracts has shrunk.
Futures exchanges are now trying to adapt products from the over-the-counter
market, so that they can offer standardised contracts which have some of the
flexibility of the OTC market.
For example, the Chicago Board Options Exchange's flex options, which allow
standard contracts to be adjusted to suit individual needs, are being
imitated by other US exchanges. The line between standardised contracts and
highly customised OTC products has become blurred.
'Some would say we compete (with the exchanges) but I see a complementary
relationship from which the financial markets benefit. Risks we take from
our clients often flow back to the exchanges,' says Mr Joseph Bauman, head
of business development, global derivatives, at Citibank, and chairman of
the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), the
over-the-counter market's trade association. Industry experts believe there
is room for further growth, especially in the less mature over-the-counter
market.
'If you look at the compound annual growth rates of notional principal
volume (in swaps) - 35 per cent per annum for the past three or four years -
it's hard to foresee this pace continuing forever, but growth rates will
stay high because the community of users continues to expand,' said Mr
Bauman of Citibank. Many market participants are confident because they
believe that, particularly outside the US, only a small portion of the
potential base of fund managers and corporate treasurers has so far been
tapped.
'It's like being a car manufacturer, at a time when only 5 per cent of the
population has learned to drive,' said one specialist. But there is no doubt
that the market is becoming increasingly competitive, and products which
were once at the cutting edge are now widely available, and at tighter
margins.
'The pace of innovation will remain high as dealers continue to devote a
large amount of resources to new products,' predicts Mr Patrick de
Saint-Aignan, chairman of Morgan Stanley SA in Paris, and a senior member of
the Group of Thirty committee which recently reported on the derivatives
market. 'This is an activity where the dealers have a solution-oriented
approach rather than trying to push standardised products.'
One reason for this is that banks can charge higher fees for innovative
products, particularly when they have stolen the march on their competitors
temporarily. 'The rate of growth is slowing but the base it is growing from
is getting bigger,' said Mr Malcolm Basing, president of SBC Canada and a
former chairman of ISDA.
However, he identifies a number of areas where growth potential remains
strong, such as commodity swaps and perhaps insurance or credit derivatives.
As well as fending off competitors, the derivatives industry has also come
under attack from regulators, who are concerned about the speed of the
market's growth and about potential systemic risk to the banking system.
However, a number of reports this year, for example from the Bank of
England, have adopted a more conciliatory tone. 'I would not characterise
what they (the regulators) have done as backing off. They have taken a major
look at derivative activities over the past year and there has been a
tempering of the rhetoric that characterised early 1992,' said Mr Bauman.
The Group of Thirty report on derivatives published earlier this year set
out detailed guidelines on how to manage the risks involved.
'We are still very much under a regulatory glare, but we have convinced them
it's a worthwhile business and that it can be managed effectively,' said Mr
Basing. 'We still have to convince them that it is possible for controls to
be put in place by smaller players down the line which may have fewer
resources.'
However, the much lamented regulatory scrutiny has undoubtedly had some
positive effects.
First of all, it has concentrated the attention of bankers at board level,
some of whom had risen through the ranks in a pre-derivatives era.
Second, the development of risk management techniques for derivatives has in
many cases been applied to other areas of banking. 'There has been a real
awakening to the need to manage risk throughout an institution,' said Mr
Paul Reyniers, the Coopers &amp; Lybrand partner in charge of global risk
management. 'If they (banks) can manage risk they have the key tool for
capital allocation.'
While the continued growth of the market seems certain, it is more difficult
to predict the technological changes which will accompany its development.
Although the technology of futures trading systems has already advanced
substantially, many traders say that no electronic system yet replicates
conditions in a trading pit.
However, many traders do believe that electronic trading of some sort will
be an increasingly inherent part of the derivatives market in years to come.
Globex, the 24-hour futures trading system jointly developed by Reuters the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade, is yet to
establish itself as a global network for trading outside normal exchange
hours. But if CME chairman Mr Jack Sandner's vision of 'a global trading
village' is eventually realised, it could prove a vehicle for a further net
increase in trading volume.

FT  20 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rank tumbles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A raft of bearish rumours on Rank Organisation sent the shares tumbling to
finish 25 down at 818p in busy turnover of 1.9m.
The first to hit the stock as trading started was a strong rumour that the
chief executive had sold shares this week in advance of a meeting with
analysts prior to the group going into closed period. However, the company
denied the story yesterday, saying the trade was a tax-related bed and
breakfast deal and unrelated to the company's performance.
The shares were further undermined by negative press comment over Rank's
debt, together with rumours of an impending disposal. The talk added to
nervous sentiment ahead of the analysts meeting a week on Friday, when Rank
will issue a trading statement.
Among oil issues, some US buying was reported in Shell Transport and BP,
with the former climbing 7 1/2 to 708p and BP 4 1/2 to 333 1/2 p.
Burmah Castrol eased a penny to 760p as BZW announced an auction of just
over 1m shares that it agreed to take on via the recent enhanced share
alternative.
Enterprise Oil shares continued to enjoy the benefits of several recent buy
notes and the stock price climbed 9 to 499p. Hardy Oil, which announced an
oil discovery in Pakistan, firmed 3 to 176p.
The market was twitchy over British Gas after a report by a group of
independent gas companies pointed to the effect of a monopoly keeping the
tariffs up. The stock lost 2 1/2 to 325 1/2 p.
One analyst also pointed to some rotational buying moving through the
sector.
Tobacco and financial services group BAT Industries came under pressure late
in the day after Philip Morris, its US rival, reported a 24.8 per cent
decline in third-quarter income to Dollars 971m. The company blamed lower
cigarette prices brought about by the current price war in the US market.
BAT weakened 10 to 479p in trade of 3.7m.
The long-awaited announcement of the appointment of executive directors at
international trading group Lonrho was well received by the market. Active
dealing brought turnover of 5.6m and the shares hardened 2 1/2 to 130 1/2 p.
Favourable comment on construction and engineering group Trafalgar House
helped to bring about a bounce in the shares and they moved forward 3 to
88p.
Disappointing figures from plastics and metal components group McKechnie
caused a slide in the shares. The 7 per cent increase in full-year figures
to Pounds 24.5m was at the bottom of market expectations and accompanied by
a cautious statement. At the day's worst the shares were down 19 at 426p.
However, discussions with analysts and general bargain hunting saw some of
the earlier gloom lifted and the stock closed a net 13 off at 432p.
The news that US group Morgan Guaranty Trust had lowered its prime lending
rate from 6 to 5.5 per cent, along with general profit-taking, led to a
sharp decline in several banking stocks.
The biggest fall was seen in Barclays, which lost 16 at 558p in trade of
3.3m. National Westminster slipped 10 to 559p.
Profits downgradings for HSBC from several brokers to take account of
Monday's Pounds 172m court judgment against its merchant banking subsidiary
Samuel Montagu left the shares 16 cheaper at 747p. SG Warburg was also said
to be cautious on the stock, while James Capel remains cool towards the
sector as a whole.
The recent profits downgrading from Strauss Turnbull for Abbey National
continued to exact a toll on the shares and they gave up 8 to 414p.
In a quiet property sector, Hammerson was the main focus of attention as it
announced the restructuring of its shares. The details were well received
and the ordinary stock advanced 14 to 413p and the 'A' shares 5 to 374p.
News that BT could generate revenue of around Pounds 2bn a year by the end
of the decade from video home entertainment services lifted the shares. The
fully-paid stock closed 5 firmer at 464p and the partly-paid 6 up at 215 1/2
p.
Profit-taking snipped Cable and Wireless back 22 to 952p, and Vodafone's
strong run also ran out of steam, the shares ending 11 down at 560 1/2 p.
Aero engine maker Rolls- Royce receded 4 1/2 to 147 1/2 p after securities
house BZW was said to have downgraded profits expectations. Volume at the
close was 4.6m.
Defence stocks remained under a cloud as worries that the government would
announce wide-ranging defence cuts in next month's Budget grew. Fears of
such a move were heightened by Monday's announcement that the government is
to sell two navy dockyards as part of a drive for defence savings.
Rumours that a bear story is stalking Pilkington moved through the market,
although many industry watchers seemed to be unaware of its nature. The
shares declined 4 to 138p in a volume of 3m.
Wolseley's results pleased the market and its shares forged ahead 18 to
692p. Bargain hunting pushed British Aerospace up 3 to 409p. But weakness
was seen in Vosper Thornycroft, which lost 6 to 681p, and Vickers, 3 off at
151p.
Among motor issues, Monday's visit to BBA Group by several analysts, which
was initially seen as positive, led to caution yesterday.
BZW was among securities houses that were cheered by the visit, but analysts
at the securities house yesterday shaved the 1994 profits estimate by Pounds
5m to Pounds 75m, though they left the current year forecast at Pounds 60m.
BZW cited continuing weakness in the European automotive sector for its
move. BBA dipped 5 to 153p.
Profit-taking clipped Airtours back by 5 to 450p. Thorn EMI remained
friendless, declining 6 to 908p. Executive buying was said to have lifted
Vardon, up 3 at 109p.
Reflection on moves by Euro Disney to reduce its labour force left the
shares under a cloud and 25 weaker at 595p.
Compass Group fell heavily for the second session running, ending 18 lower
at 552p. The company was said to be upbeat in the face of market talk of
margin pressures in the catering industry.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A sparkling debut from Virtuality, the specialist software producer, saw the
shares zoom to a premium of 119p over the listing price of 170p. The shares
closed at 289p with turnover reaching 5.7m, more than one third of
yesterday's placing.
Dealers said the shares, which went to around 80 institutions, moved to an
immediate subtantial premium before gathering momentum during the session.
They hit a bid high of 315p in the afternoon before coming back at the
close.
Virtuality's strong showing carries on the successful run of market debuts.
Last week, Parkdean Leisure went to a 6 per cent premium on its first day.
It closed a penny ahead yesterday at 133p, up 13 from its float price.

FT  20 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wall St helps drug shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Wall Street factor was one of the main forces fuelling a strong
performance in pharmaceutical issues yesterday as US investors boosted
confidence in the sector. In London, drugs stocks got off to a confident
start on the back of a good overnight performance in the US market. Positive
sentiment in the US was boosted by good results from American Home Products
and ripples from Merck, which had announced its results the previous day.
Currency considerations with the strength of the dollar also pulled in some
US buyers to the stocks.
SmithKline Beecham 'A' also had the boost of satisfactory results and moved
ahead 9 to 414p. Glaxo appreciated 13 1/2 to 694 1/2 p and Zeneca advanced
24 to 777p. One analyst put some of Zeneca's gain down to a shortage of
stock, however.
Wellcome, which continues to benefit from interest ahead of its New Orleans
conference later this week, gained 9 at 775p. Its results are due at the end
of next week.

FT  20 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOOTSIE futures suffered from directionless trading as dealers struggled to
find a clear lead on the outlook for interest rate cuts or the economic
recovery, writes Christine Buckley.
The December contract on the FT-SE 100 opened a little above the previous
night's close at 3,151, although it was fairly weak and could only muster a
short-lived rally. That was on the back of a little optimism that downbeat
CBI comments on the retail sector may force the chancellor of the
exchequer's arm on interest rates. The high point of the contract was 3,159
in early trading.
With no strong guidance, however, the general feeling remained mixed and the
contract began to drift downwards. Arbitrage positions were opened and the
sellers moved in. But the selling brought only a measured fall in the
contract, as most of it was done by independent traders and lacked the clout
of a withdrawal by institutions.
By mid-morning the contract touched the day's low of 3,138, although later
on the 3,145 mark proved a support level and December managed a moderate
climb-back by lunchtime.
Its close of 3,148 was a couple of points ahead of its fair value premium to
cash, which is about 15 points. At 7,813 contracts traded, the volume was in
line with recent levels.
Of the stock options, Land Securities was the busiest with 4,911 lots
traded.

FT  20 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-taking unsettles equity market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London equity market battled in vain against downward forces yesterday
and was finally forced to concede ground after the recent outstanding
performance which has seen share prices hitting new records for the past two
trading sessions.
Some senior market traders emphasised, however, that a modest decline in
prices yesterday was merely a period of consolidation before a further
strong upward move.
Others were at odds with the bullish view, and said the London market was
only one of a number of international markets, most notably Wall Street,
that had run too far too fast and that a substantial correction was on the
cards.
The bearish pressures affecting London included a handful of rather gloomy
surveys on retail sales and consumer confidence from influential sources
such as the Confederation of British Industry and Gallup, as well as a sharp
decline on the recently buoyant Hong Kong stock market.
The two surveys tended to increase worries around the market that the
recovery in the UK economy may be faltering, a view which began to gather
strength last week in the wake of a batch of economic data showing a decline
in manufacturing output and another rise in inflation.
There was very little pressure on share prices as the market opened with
traders tentatively moving quotations higher in response to yet another good
showing by Wall Street overnight.
The US market performed well on Monday, coming within 10 points or so of its
all-time record and was within an ace of bursting into uncharted territory
shortly after London closed yesterday.
The FT-SE 100 officially opened just over three points higher before running
into a flurry of pressure said to have been triggered by aggressive selling
of the Footsie future. The pressure in the futures market was thought by
dealers to have represented one of the leading UK securities houses
adjusting its market positions to accommodate a large trading programme
subsquently executed in the cash market. At its worst, the Footsie was down
almost 14 points and looking extremely ragged.
Once the futures selling was done, however, the market began to regain its
composure, to the extent that the Footsie moved briefly back into positive
territory at midday.
Sentiment began to falter again almost immediately, but there was very
little selling pressure evident. Prices went into a gentle decline which
left the FT-SE 100 Index down 8.0 at the close at 3,129.6. The FT-SE Mid 250
Index, meanwhile, put on a similarly resilient performance, closing only a
fraction off at 3,486.8.
Turnover in the market held up well, in spite of what was seen by some
dealers as signs that the market had run out of steam. Some 658.2m shares
were traded yesterday, just short of Monday's level, with non-Footsie stocks
accounting for more than 403m shares.
The value of customer business transacted on Monday was a creditable Pounds
1.33bn, indicating that the big domestic and overseas instititions have
continued to pump money into the market.
Drug stocks were the market's undoubted stars yesterday, closely followed by
the oil majors, with both sectors responding to the pound's weakness and the
consequent strengthening of the dollar.

FT  20 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Positive factors offset by
mild profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices ended a directionless session in negative territory
yesterday as continued profit-taking outweighed the positive impact of good
economic news and a late bond market rally, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 6.99 at 3,635.32. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 slipped 2.23 to 466.22, while the American SE composite finished
5.00 down at 476.10. The Nasdaq composite, which has been the year's
strongest performer, was especially hard hit by profit-taking, surrendering
14.20 at 768.71. NYSE volume amounted to 296m shares.
In recent weeks secondary and broader indices have outperformed the Dow as
investors searched for inexpensive stocks and shied away from the shares of
companies whose earnings are tied closely to economic cycles. This trend
pushed the S &amp; P 500, the Amex composite and the Nasdaq composite to record
highs, while the Dow stayed below its all-time peak.
In the last two days the trend has been reversed, with Dow stocks faring
well and secondary and other issues falling from their recent summits. This
partly explains why Dow and cyclical stocks were mostly firmer in early
trading yesterday, while shares of medium-sized and small companies and
growth-oriented technology firms languished.
By mid-afternoon, however, even prices of cyclical and blue chip stocks
began to lose ground. They ended the day rooted in negative territory, in
spite of some good economic news - housing starts rose strongly in September
 -and a recovery in bond prices that pushed bond yields lower.
Philip Morris fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 52 3/4 in volume of 4.3m shares
after reporting a 25 per cent drop in net income for the third quarter and
warning about further difficulties in the fourth quarter. Analysts
attributed some of the selling to profit-taking.
Citicorp rose more than Dollars 1 in early trading before easing to end just
Dollars  1/8 up at Dollars 35 3/4 , following news of a sharp improvement in
third-quarter earnings to 97 cents a share.
Brokerage and investment banking stocks continued to tumble on concern about
future profits. Merrill Lynch gave up Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 93 1/2 ,
Paine-Webber fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 30 3/8 and JP Morgan slipped Dollars
2 5/8 to Dollars 72.
A range of industrial shares helped to support the Dow: among them
Caterpillar advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 82 1/2 , Goodyear Tire &amp;
Rubber Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 45 5/8 and Sears Roebuck Dollars  1/2 to
Dollars 56 3/8 .
Canada
TORONTO closed lower in moderate trading, the market having receded from
record highs after 10 straight sessions of gains. The TSE 300 index shed
14.0 to 4,174.7 and falls led rises by 423 to 341 after volume of 51.6m
shares.

FT  20 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Brazil ends 3.1 per cent firmer as
Mexico retreats
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS THAT Congress would go ahead with Brazil's recently started charter
reform in spite of an inquiry into corruption allegations against dozens of
political leaders spurred the Sao Paulo stock market ahead by 3.1 per cent,
following a fall of some 9.5 per cent on Monday.
The Bovespa index closed at 17,665, up 529 points, in heavy trade.
Mexico retreated on profit-taking, having set record highs in three
consecutive sessions. The IPC index finished 30.98, or 1.56 per cent, down
at 1,960.63. Volume was a busy 101.75m shares.
Stocks have risen steadily over the past two weeks as investors have been
drawn to an undervalued equity market and as the Nafta no longer appeared to
be a paralysing force.

FT  20 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong pauses after
20.9 per cent surge
</HEADLINE>

SHARE prices remained almost flat after a volatile session dominated by
public fund and arbitrage buying and profit-taking by dealers, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 2.30 at 20,069.91 after a low of 20,042.40 in the
morning and a high of 20,204.02 in the afternoon session.
The index firmed immediately after the opening on public fund buying, and
declined thereafter before rising again on purchases by arbitrageurs. After
peaking in the afternoon, dealers, who built up long positions together with
buying by public funds, liquidated positions as other institutional
investors were reluctant to follow suit.
Volume was 208.7m shares, against 218m. Losers led gainers by 595 to 323,
with 244 issues unchanged, and the Topix index of all first section stocks
shed 4.23 to 1,644.46. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.71 to
1,280.94.
Traders said that while investors were unwilling to take short positions by
sell-ing stock, many were still reluctant to buy shares due to the prolonged
recovery of the economy.
Financials, telecommunications and non-life insurance stocks were the
leading losers of the day.
Profit-taking left Daiwa Securities down Y40 at Y1,400 after having been
recently bought on its upward revision of interim earnings. Other brokers
also weakened, with Nomura Securities receding Y40 to Y1,990 and Nikko
Securities Y10 to Y1,200.
The telecom sector, which had risen on the merger between Bell Atlantic and
Tele-Communications Inc in the US, lost ground. Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone declined Y16,000 to Y894,000 after three consecutive days of
gains, and DDI slipping Y50,000 to Y6.73m on the second section.
Other telecom linked issues were also easier, with Oki Electric, the day's
most active issue, down Y1 to Y562 and Fujitsu losing Y4 to Y863.
Entertainment related stocks retreated on reports that police were
investigating Heiwa, a pachinko (Japanese pinball) machine maker listed on
the second section, for illegally modifying its game machines. Heiwa fell
Y140 to Y4,100 and Sega Enterprises, which supplies electronic games to
Heiwa, lost Y30 to Y9,870. Konami, another video machine maker, declined
Y130 to Y3,870.
JR East linked stocks gained ground. Nippon Signal rose Y30 to Y1,510 and
Kyosan Electric, another railway signal maker, firmed Y10 to Y1,280.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 45.84 to 22,199.95 in volume of 17.5m
shares.
Roundup
MANY Pacific Rim markets took a pause after the record-breaking runs of
recent days.
HONG KONG gave up 1.9 per cent after the bull run that has seen a cumulative
rise since September 28 of 20.9 per cent. The Hang Seng index relinquished
169.72 to 8,861.41 in turnover that dipped to HKDollars 9.04bn from Monday's
record HKDollars 10.20bn.
Mr Michael Franklin of James Capel commented that the market had begun to
look vulnerable to a short-term consolidation when the index breached the
9,000 level. However, he believed that US and Japanese investors remained
enthusiastic and would continue to provide liquidity for a further advance.
MANILA declined for the first time in eight days, the composite index
shedding 28.96 to 2,158.99 as PLDT lost 30 pesos to 1,820 pesos.
TAIPEI fell 2.3 per cent in reaction to news that the Finance Ministry and
ruling party legislators had agreed to delay consideration of a stock
transaction tax cut until January. The weighted index ended 91.92 off at
3,970.18.
AUSTRALIA was dragged lower by industrial stocks and a weaker futures
market. The All Ordinaries index slipped 10.0 to 2,075.5.
SINGAPORE saw an end of the record-setting run of the previous six sessions
after heavy selling of Malaysian stocks traded over the counter. The Straits
Times Industrial index lost 7.88 at 2,108.26.
KUALA LUMPUR rebounded strongly during the afternoon as investors returned
to seek bargains after Monday's falls. The composite index closed 11.63
ahead at 926.16.
BOMBAY traded higher in a special trading session after the resolution of
the brokers' strike which had kept the market closed for the previous four
trading days. The BSE 30-share index added 9.37 at 2,720.29.
KARACHI rose sharply in response to Ms Benazir Bhutto's return as prime
minister, writes Farhan Bokhari.
The KSE-100 index advanced 16.58 to 1,450.33.
Ms Bhutto is expected to continue with a recent package of economic reforms
which was introduced by Mr Moeen Qureshi, the interim premier.

FT  20 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continental bourses
consolidate gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY of the continent's bourses took a breather yesterday from the bull run,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT took a pause from its record breaking ways with most analysts
commenting that the current rally still has a long way to go. Opinion
remained divided as to whether the Bundesbank would cut interest rates at
its regular council meeting tomorrow. Some commentators said yesterday that
they believed a cut would not happen until the release of M3 and inflation
data, due out over the next few days; and that November was the most
probable date for an announcement.
The DAX index moved from an intraday low of 2,021 to close down 6.56 at
2,026.76. Turnover was DM9.8bnbn, with institutional funds reported to have
stayed on the sidelines.
In a day bereft of corporate news BMW staged a turnaround with a gain of
DM12 to DM613: the stock has been lagging behind other motor sector shares.
In contrast Volkswagen shed DM7.00 to DM375.20 and Daimler DM6.50 to
DM740.00.
PARIS staged firm although turnover slipped back from the level seen at the
start of the week. The CAC-40 index added 2.33 to 2,147.32, after a day's
high of 2,150 and a low of 2,137. Turnover was estimated at FFr3.3bn after
Monday's FFr4.5bn.
EuroDisney shed a further FFr1.55 to FFr51.65 as selling appreciated after
its recent news of job cuts. James Capel in London commented that while the
redundancy scheme will have a one off negative impact on profits, the news
had already been largely discounted. 'The more pressing problem is its
future funding,' the brokers said.
Bouygues was down FFr4 at FFr708 ahead of reporting a first half profit of
FFr79m against FFr108m in the same year ago period after the close of
trading.
Elf Aquitaine regained FFr4.10 to FFr438.10 as it announced that it was
planning to restart production at its Nigerian facility.
AMSTERDAM remained in positive territory with the CBS Tendency index at one
point going reaching a new record high, before closing 0.4 higher at 132.5.
Akzo was one of the day's main losers, falling Fl 2.40 or Fl 184.40, as some
investors booked profits after reaching a new record high on Monday.
ZURICH encountered profit-taking after its run of seven consecutive record
highs, and the SMI index finished 2.9 lower at 2,660.7 as some of the early
losses were pared.
Nestle continued as the most activeley traded stock, adding SFR2 to
SFr1,174.
CS Holding, whose shares are viewed by some analysts as undervalued, rose
SFr15 to SFr3,365.
MILAN turned lower, the market held back by the burden of cash calls during
the current trading month, and the Comit index eased 0.94 to 588.94.
Fiat fell L145 or 3.6 per cent to L3,855: the shares had risen by 10 per
cent rise over the previous two sessions since its rights issue began.
Against the downward trend, the new Ferruzzi shares added L1,533 to L51,278
after their recent sharp falls. Montedison rose L11 to L837.30.
VIENNA was modestly firmer with some profit-taking in evidence. The ATX
index put on 0.67 points to 1,078.23 with Flughafen Wien down Sch13 at
Sch531.
COPENHAGEN put on another 0.23 in the KFX index to 100.79 but Sophus
Berendsen built on Monday's fall, off a further DKr2 to DKr474, following
the announcement that it was reducing its stake in Rentokil of the UK.
STOCKHOLM gave way to profit-taking which left the Affarsvarlden index 0.8
lower at 1,397.0.in heavy trading
The market had opened firm before a wave of selling in Astra and Ericsson
shares sent the market lower.
Ericsson B shares retreated SKr9 to SKr457 while Astra A shares slipped SKr2
to SKr180.
Interest rate sensitive banks and insurers put in a better performance. S-E
Banken A shares added SKr2 to SKr57.
BRUSSELS saw profit-taking which left the Bel-20 index 5.19 lower at
1,375.86 in turnover of BFr2.16bn. Analysts believe that talks on the social
pact, which are scheduled to begin in coming days are unlikely to have much
impact on the market. However, they added that foreigners were likely to to
be ready to pick up shares if Belgian investors became sellers due to fears
about the outcome of the talks.

FT  20 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Greek equities weather change of
government - The mood in post-election Athens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Athens stock market has weathered last week's change of government in
Greece with unexpected resilience.
The opposition socialists' victory in the October 10 general election
provoked a rush of gloomy economic predictions. Some appeared to be
confirmed when Mr Andreas Papandreou, the new prime minister, declared that
the planned sale of 49 per cent of OTE, the state telecommunications
monopoly, was being called off.
Cancellation will mean revenue losses amounting to more than Dr300bn
(Dollars 1.2bn), bringing the government's borrowing requirement for 1993 to
around 13 per cent of GDP, against a target of 10.8 per cent.
The sale of a 35 per cent stake in OTE to a foreign telecoms operator was
forecast to raise at least Dr220bn, while the flotation of another 14 per
cent on the bourse had been unofficially valued at Dr90bn.
Since plunging some 14 per cent after the election was announced, the index
has climbed back steadily, closing yesterday at 852.
Although the market has failed to match its midsummer peak, when it reached
955, it is still 28 per cent up from the start of the year.
Buying from abroad continues to drive equities, as local investors find
interest rates averaging close to 20 per cent on short-term Treasury bills a
more attractive prop-osition. Some European insti-tutional investors cashed
in their gains when the elec-tion was called, but US fund managers continued
buying.
Mr Dimitris Verroiopoulos, an analyst at Alpha Brokerage, said: 'Greek
equities are good value, with p/e ratios at 10 to 13 per cent, compared to
other emerging markets.'
The market's confidence is based on the assumption that the new government
will maintain its predecessor's commitment to reducing inflation and the
public sector deficit under the Maastricht requirements for European
economic union.
Analysts also seem convinced that the socialists will reverse their
privatisation policy, at least where partial flotations of state enterprises
are concerned, in order to raise funds for investment.
Mr John Markopoulos, chairman of Sigma Securities, said: 'Our perception is
that the government will soon be needing cash for OTE's modernisation
programme. The constraints on public spending will oblige them to turn to
the stock market, and we expect a minority stake in the company to be
floated next year.'
The optimistic mood is underpinned by anticipation of a flood of EC funding
for infrastructure projects, starting early in 1994. With EC inflows
expected to total between Ecu17bn and Ecu20bn over the next six years,
construction, cement and building equipment companies should benefit. Three
construction companies, likely candidates for contracts to be awarded under
the new EC funding package, are seeking listings next month. Aegek is to
raise Dr1.9bn, Proodeftiki Dr2.1bn and Themeliodomi Dr1.5bn through the
bourse.
Given these companies' prospects for growth, and the small size of the
issues, demand is expected to be lively. However, so long as interest rates
stay high, the outlook is less promising for bigger companies considering
large rights issues.
First-half profits were lower than forecast, even in the food sector where
the recession had previously made little impact on sales. In the banking
sector, where steady if unspectacular gains were recorded, caution prevails.
Commercial Bank, the second-largest state bank, covered a Dr45bn of a
planned Dr50bn rights issue launched last month, with many small
shareholders said to be reluctant to participate. Following the election,
Credit Bank, the country's largest private bank, decided to postpone a
Dr30bn rights issue which included a sizeable tranche offered to
institutions abroad.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Cash stays tight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIGHT conditions prevailed in the UK money markets yesterday forcing
overnight rates high and leading to significant late assistance by the Bank
of England, writes Peter John.
Dealers said the leading banks were once again unprepared to release
collateral in the form of bills. There was some suggestion that issuers of
short-term bills - mainly companies needing to borrow cash from commercial
banks - might be holding back in the belief that they will be able to borrow
money at lower rates soon. As a result, the commercial banks may not have
had enough bills to take up the offers of Bank of England help.
Belief that base rates are about to fall was also reflected in the
three-month interbank rate which eased slightly.
The daily liquidity shortage was exacerbated by a large round of late
assistance on Monday. That was repayable yesterday when the initial shortage
forecast of Pounds 1.25bn was later revised to Pounds 1.4bn.
Among the main factors affecting the position were the take-up of Treasury
Bills and paper maturing in official hands, which drained Pounds 889m, and
Exchequer transactions, which removed Pounds 295m. Partly offsetting these
was a fall in note circulation injecting Pounds 120m into the system.
The Bank of England provided Pounds 216m of early assistance via bills for
resale in equal amounts on November 9 and 10 at 5 29/32 per cent. It
provided Pounds 131m later, buying Pounds 121m of band one bank bills at the
established 5 7/8 per cent rate and Pounds 10m of bills for resale on
November 9 and 10 at 5 29/32 per cent, and a further Pounds 492m in the
afternoon.
It was not until after the official close that the shortage was finally
taken out with late assistance of Pounds 690m at the customary unspecified
rate.
December short sterling futures, which reflect the market's view of where
rates will be when the contract expires on December 15, remained steady at
94.61 ahead of the latest retail sales figures today. At that level, the
contract discounts a half-point base rate cut.
French short-term interest rate futures eased slightly shortly after the
official close. Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, the governor of the Bank of France,
said the country was still committed to a stable currency and rumours of a
move toward a shift in monetary policy were false. The December contract
rallied later to around 93.57.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Dollar recovers against DM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US dollar staged a come back from recent lows against the the D-Mark
yesterday while the German currency was weaker in Europe as technical
positions were adjusted, writes Peter John.
The dollar's revival began in New York on Monday, continued in the Far East
and endured through European trading hours yesterday. However, most dealers
were at a loss to find any substance behind the move. There was a general
acceptance that the dollar had reached a support level which prompted
investors to take their profits and buy back the US currency.
The correction began with the Japanese yen against which the dollar fell to
around Y105 a fortnight ago. On Monday it moved back to the mid-Y107 level
but was unable to break through Y107.50, seen as a significant chart level.
It slipped to Y107.05 to the yen from Y107.45 yesterday as the rally shifted
to Europe.
It rose to DM1.6440 at best against the D-Mark, just below the top of a
recent trading range which begins at DM1.5880. Mr Paul Chertkow, global
currency analyst at UBS, said: 'Once DM1.5940 was tested, the tenor of the
market changed. There is a feeling that the gloom has been overdone. The
fundamentals are pointing to a stronger dollar, particularly in the light of
speculation of lower rates in Europe.'
The dollar closed a pfennig higher in Europe against the German currency at
DM1.6370. It was also stronger against sterling for much of the day hitting
Dollars 1.4830 to the pound before rallying in the afternoon to close at
Dollars 1.4920, still up from Dollars 1.4980 previously.
Analysts will be scrutinising the UK retail sales figure for September this
morning as the market becomes increasingly obsessed with signals that UK
interest rates might soon fall.
The D-Mark had benefited from hedging against lower interest rates in
Belgium and France last week and slipped yesterday as dealers pocketed
profits from the sharp shifts in the European currencies.
The German Bundesbank will hold its weekly repurchase agreement today and
there is a feeling that the central bank could allow its variable lending
rate to slip by some 5 basis points to 6.65 per cent. While not significant
in itself a lower repo might pave the way for a cut in key rates depending
on M3 money supply data this week.
The D-Mark slipped to BFr21.82 from BFr21.88 against the Belgian franc ahead
of the release of details of Belgium's social pact on wages and jobs late
yesterday.
It was also weaker against the Italian lira. Dealers said that foreign
investors had been buying Italian equities without hedging against further
falls in the currency because the lira had reached a recent low and that had
helped the currency's recovery. The D-Mark fell to L973.80 from L975.80.
Against the French franc, the D-Mark slipped to FFr3.5320 from FFr3.5350.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium industry 'needs help'
to stem CIS flood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEVASTATING economic disruption to the aluminium market caused by the
collapse of the former Soviet Union may well be beyond the resources of the
world aluminium industry to handle.
This warning was given last night by Mr David Morton, chairman of Alcan
Aluminium of Canada, the second-biggest producer of the metal. 'Unless the
problem is tackled on a concerted and negotiated basis, the current
conditions are likely to persist and bring this industry to its knees,' he
said.
He pointed out that, following a surge in annual exports from the
Commonwealth of Independent States to about 1m tonnes - three to four times
what they were in 1990 - western stocks had grown to 2m tonnes and prices
had dropped by about half. Most of the world's aluminium smelters were
operating a below even their cash costs.
The western industry had already made production cuts of 1.4m tonnes a year
 -nearly 10 per cent of its capacity - yet stocks continued to accumulate at
the rate of 1.8m tonnes a year. 'Thus, against a background of slow growth
in demand, a correction to this surplus by western world producers would
require a further cut back of about 15 per cent to 20 per cent of its
production capacity - a staggering requirement.'
Speaking at the annual dinner of the UK Aluminium Federation in London, he
added: 'I believe it may require western governments to jointly pursue
negotiations with the CIS governments to establish some rules of transition
which will enable the CIS aluminium industry to be integrated into the world
industry on the same terms and conditions on which western producers now
operate'.
The European Commission's recent decision to impose restrictions on CIS
aluminium imports, was of little or no use, Mr Morton said. 'This merely
diverts the problem. When you are filling a bath, it does not matter from
which end you fill it. What matters is the level of the bathwater.'
He was speaking two days before multilateral talks are to begin in Moscow
about the issue of CIS aluminium exports - figures of 1.5m to 2m tonnes are
being mentioned for this year - and how the world industry might make
production adjustments to help absorb stocks.

The GOLD price recoiled from resistance just below Dollars 369 a troy ounce
yesterday afternoon. But after subsiding by nearly Dollars 5 it recovered to
close in London at Dollars 367, just 50 cents down on the day. Dealers
attributed the retreat to long-liquidation by US investment funds following
Monday's rally. PLATINUM ended within Dollars 1.25 of the day's high,
closing at Dollars 372 an ounce, after finding support below Dollars 370.
The London afternoon fix had been at Dollars 373.25 an ounce, up Dollars
6.30 from the same point on Monday, although dealers noted that there was
little physical business being done. At the London Metal Exchange the COPPER
market extended its decline, reaching 6-year lows before steadying a little
to close at Dollars 1,632.50 for three months metal, down Dollars 25 on the
day. The market remained bearish on fundamental and technical grounds,
dealers said, and the likelihood was that the price would head for Dollars
1,600 soon. The NICKEL market continued the retreat that has followed the
recent rally, the three months price closing another Dollars 95 down at
Dollars 4,570 a tonne. But it was still Dollars 440 above the recent 6 3/4
 year low.

<TEXT>
THE AUSTRALIAN government yesterday protested strongly against the US
authorities' decision to extend its 'export enhancement' subsidy programme
for barley to China, a key export market for Australian growers.
The barley programme has been set at 3.375m tonnes, allocated across 14
countries and regions, and will be effective until September next year. Two
of the countries - China, allocated 100,000 of malting barley, and Romania -
were not previously eligible for EEP subsidies on barley.
'The inclusion of China, Australia's most important market for malting
barley, is a particularly unhappy development,' said Mr Gareth Evans, the
Australian Foreign Affairs minister, and Mr Michael Lee, acting minister for
Primary Industries and Energy in a joint statement.
Australia shipped some 400,000 tonnes of malting barley to China in 1992-93,
about half its export total.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Crunch time in the world nuts
market - Shortages that are driving up almond, peanut and hazlenut prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN YOU buy your box of mixed nuts this Christmas, you could find it
contains an unusually large proportion of Brazil nuts. Look carefully - the
almonds, hazelnuts and even peanuts could be on the short side.
The reason is a rare coincidence of problems in the nut market that has
caused a near doubling in the prices of almonds and peanuts and a sharp,
though slightly less dramatic, rise in the cost of hazelnuts.
'In most years we'll get one of our markets thrust into turmoil because of
some supply side problem or a political problem,' says Mr Peter Morgan,
edible nut trader for London importers Barrow, Lane and Ballard. 'To have so
many of them up in arms is unusual.'
Mr Morgan's company handles about 40,000 tonnes of peanuts a year, buying
from around the world for customers mainly in the UK, the Netherlands,
Germany and Canada.
The price of American peanuts shot up from about Dollars 800 a tonne in the
early spring to a peak of Dollars 1,500 following this summer's drought,
which particularly affected growing regions in the south-western states of
Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia and Alabama.
Prices have settled back slightly to around Dollars 1,450 a tonne, but that
is still way out of proportion to the actual shortfall in US production of
about 15 per cent, says Mr Morgan.
The distortion arises from the US quota system, under which three-quarters
of the harvest are purchased from farmers at high support prices for the
domestic market. The remainder receives lower support prices and goes for
crushing or export.
The harvest is expected to be down about 300,000 tonnes on the usual level
at about 1.7m tonnes. But because farmers will sell for the domestic market
first, exports are likely to drop by some 60 per cent, Mr Morgan says.
Buyers are beginning to turn for peanuts to other countries, such as
Argentina and China, where supplies are available at prices about Dollars
200 and about Dollars 400 a tonne respectively less than those for US
produce.
Interestingly, given the existence of the North American Free Trade
Agreement, some Canadian buyers are switching from American to Chinese
peanuts, even though the latter are regarded as being of lower quality.
'This is the fifth year since 1980 when we've had a real or false alarm,'
says Mr Morgan. 'I'll have too many grey hairs if it goes on much longer.'
Peanuts are particularly important for snacks and cocktail 'eats', as well
as being ingredients in confectionery and peanut butter. Almonds and
hazelnuts are vital for the baking and confectionery industries, with
almonds particularly used by the huge marzipan market in Germany and the
Netherlands.
So all sectors of the nut-processing industry have been affected.
Almond prices have been pushed sky-high by problems with the crop in
California, the world's main growing region. Wind damage has caused a
shortfall of 50m lb from a normal crop of about 550m lb and sent prices
soaring from about Pounds 3,500 a tonne in early August to about Pounds
4,000 a tonne, twice the level a year ago, according to Mr Brian Newson, who
runs the nut operation for Combined Shipping and Trading, a London-based
commodities trading company.
'I think it's gone too high on the evidence of that news,' says Mr Newson.
'We're finding strong consumer resistance. These high levels have come as a
bolt from the blue.'
Hazelnut prices have been rising on expectations of a poor crop in Turkey,
which produces about 70 per cent of world supply, and in the main European
growing countries, Italy and Spain.
Harvesting starts this month and in September prices shot up from about
Pounds 1,800 a tonne to as much as Pounds 3,000 a tonne, before settling
back to about Pounds 2,300.
'It was a wild situation,' says Mr Newson. 'I can't remember prices
spiralling to that sort of level in such a short time.'
The irony is that Turkey is sitting on a buffer stock of about 130,000
tonnes, apparently waiting for higher prices. 'The European Community is
pressing them to release some of that crop to assist the market,' Mr Newson
says.
Among other nuts, cashew prices are beginning to rise because of fears of a
shortfall in the forthcoming Brazilian harvest, and macadamias, increasingly
popular as an exotic cocktail nut, have been driven up in the past six
months by crop problems. Brazils, on the other hand, remain relatively
cheap.
But the Christmas box of mixed nuts is unlikely to reflect these price
increases because processors tend to have forward cover until about January
or February, according to commodity experts.
That is when consumers could start to feel the crunch. 'It's very difficult
to get price increases pre-Christmas,' says Mr Yoav Gottesman, chief
executive of JLI Group, the UK food processing group. 'But most supermarkets
are aware that prices will have to move in January.
'The impact of the devaluation of the pound - because most nuts are traded
in dollars - and of the absolute price rises in dollars could mean a double
whammy.'

FT  20 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Poultry producers join Blair
House revisionists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN POULTRY producers are lining up behind French farmers' calls for
amendments to the Blair House agreement which they say inadvertently
penalises their business.
The Blair House agreement, which was agreed as part of Uruguay Round talks
on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, requires cuts in cereals
subsidies of 21 per cent over 6 years. It also means cuts in export refunds
awarded to European Community poultry producers when they export outside the
community.
Export refunds, which at present amount to some 15p a lb for fresh and
frozen chickens, are to compensate EC producers for the cost of buying grain
for feed at high prices. EC grain subsidies ensure that community prices are
higher than the world market.
'Poultry producers do not receive direct income or production support from
the government under the CAP, but we are having to pay prices way above the
world market for feedstuffs,' said Mr Peter Bradnock, director-general of
the British Poultry Meat Federation.
The withdrawal of export refunds would affect around 40 per cent of the EC's
480,000 tonnes of exports outside the community. It would make it extremely
difficult for producers to compete in many markets overseas since high feed
costs account for almost 60 per cent of their production costs.
Europe's main poultry producers in France, the UK and Italy have agreed to
lobby their national governments on the issue.
UK poultry producers are to meet Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister,
today to discuss the export business. 'We'd like a mechanism where we could
obtain supplies of feedstuffs at world prices for our export stock,' said Mr
Bradnock. The industry also wants the export refunds to be reduced more
gradually over the 6 year period.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Fine' deepens copper 'squeeze'
mystery - The aftermath of alleged London Metal Exchange manipulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EXTRAORDINARY coda to the 'squeeze' on the London Metal Exchange's copper
market has raised more questions rather than providing satisfactory answers.
The supply squeeze was maintained through June, July and August amid
widespread suggestions that the market was being manipulated to keep the
copper price up.
Last week, in an unprecedented move, Credit Lyonnaise Rouse, part of the
French banking group, apologised to the LME for its part in the squeeze and
said it had paid Pounds 100,000 towards the exchange's costs.
This is a large enough sum for traders refer to it as a 'fine'.
They are also pointing out that CLR's long list of blue chip clients
includes Sumitomo Corporation, for which CLR acts as clearing broker. At the
height of the squeeze traders suggested that Sumitomo was mainly responsible
and had options on most of the LME copper stocks. Mr Yasuo Hamanaka, the
senior Sumitomo manager responsible for copper trading, denied any
manipulation was going on and said the tightness was caused by complex
technical factors associated with a previous sharp fall in copper prices.
Both CLR and the LME have agreed to provide no further comment on or
illumination of this agreed statement. But the incident gives some clues
about how the exchange can head off what it calls 'undesirable' situations
in its metals markets and stop manipulation when necessary.
It paved the way in April 1991 with the introduction of its so-called 'large
postion reporting system' where traders are required to report to the LME
daily any futures and options positions, held for their own or named clients
accounts, that exceed certain limits.
These highly-confidential reports, seen by only very senior members of the
LME's secretariat, give advance warning of squeezes and attempts to
manipulate the market. Mr David King, LME chief executive, explained at the
time: 'The idea is to give the exchange a better understanding of what is
taking place in the market. It is in line with our statutory obligation to
maintain an orderly market and shows our determination to keep the market
orderly while sticking to our fundamental principal of not interfering with
free market forces.'
During the recent copper squeeze the LME board issued two public warnings
but to no avail. Then on September 8 the board decided to take action 'in
anticipation of the development of an undesireable situation in the copper
market,' and limited the daily backwardation (premium for immediate delivery
over forward prices) to Dollars 5 a tonne.
There have been previous squeezes in LME metals markets but never before has
the exchange felt it necessary publicly to reprimand or to seek apology from
any of the organisations involved.
CLR's apology illustrates an important point: while the LME does not have
the power to control the activities of some of the large organisations with
deep pockets that use its metals markets, that business eventually has to be
cleared with an exchange member - and the LME does have the right to force
an exchange member to toe the line.
This message will not have been lost on the LME's other 16 ring-dealing
members.
The question remains: what did CLR do to upset the LME so much?
In the agreed statement CLR apologised for its involvement 'in the
development of the situation in the copper market' and added, 'CLR accepts
that that situation could have been interpreted as involving an undue
influence over the market but CLR took no action because it was satisfied no
such undue influence was or would be exercised'.
So was it simply a simple case of human error, misunderstandings and crossed
wires? This is hard to believe because, although CLR became a ring-dealing
member of the LME as recently as January this year, the Rouse organisation
has a long history in commodity markets.
However, traders recall that during the squeeze CLR was giving the copper
market some liquidity by lending to the market and it maybe CLR believed
that was enough to prevent an 'undesirable' situation developing.
The LME executive undoubtedly spent some money investigating what it must
have first thought of as a nefarious scheme, but the Pounds 100,000 CLR is
contributing towards those costs is undoubtedly generous  - hence traders'
view that it was a fine. However, in view of the LME's determination firmly
to close the book on this issue, we will probably never know.
Mr King said yesterday: 'We worked in close consort with other regulators on
this and both they and we are satisfied with the outcome. The matter is now
closed.'

FT  20 OCT 93 / Recruitment: Behold, some good omens at last - Latest count
of executive job offers gives hope of return to sustained growth in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'BEHOLD there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand.' So
spake the prophet Elijah's omen-spotting servant on returning from the top
of Mount Carmel some 2,850 years ago - and since he'd been sent up there six
times previously only to see nothing, he no doubt spake with relief.
The Jobs column now knows how he must have been feeling, thanks to the
accompanying table which has appeared regularly in this corner of the FT for
a good 10 years. As always, it tracks changes in the United Kingdom market
for managers and higher-ranked specialist workers, as gauged by the MSL
International consultancy's three-monthly counts of executive-type jobs
advertised in national journals.
Before directing attention to the equivalent of Elijah's cloud - which, as
readers will recall, was a good omen - I'd better explain the table's
workings. The upper part focuses on the 12-monthly period which ends on
September 30, going back to 1988-89, and shows the number of job-openings
advertised in eight broad types of executive work. Each opening is counted
as one, no matter how many times the advertisement for it appears. The
catch-all 'Others' category, by the way, includes people such as buyers,
company legal staff, economists and assorted consultants.
The eight separate counts are followed by the 12-monthly total. Then come
the four quarterly tallies, covering all categories, of which the total is
composed. As the advertised demand ebbs and flows seasonally, the percentage
change after each three-monthly tally shows how it differs from the count
for the corresponding quarter of the year before.
Now, measured by the number of omens offered, the table is more generous
than the view from Mount Carmel that day nigh three millennia ago. Instead
of one good portent, there are two. They are the plus signs before the
latest percentage changes in both the 12-month total and the July-September
quarterly count.
But although doubly blest in that respect by comparison with Elijah's
servant, I doubt that his sense of relief could have been any greater than
mine is today. For whereas he vainly scaled the mountain's peak only six
times before spotting the cloud, I have returned to the jobs-market table no
fewer than 18 times without seeing a plus sign in either of the two
positions named.
The last time the most recent 12 months showed a rise in demand was in the
spring of 1989. And a full five years has gone by since a three-monthly
period produced an increase over the corresponding previous quarter, in
July-September 1988. During the interval, the UK advertised market has
plumbed the lowest depths recorded in the 34 years MSL has been keeping its
counts. Indeed, even in the recession of the early 1980s, the tally for a
12-monthly period to September 30 never fell below 17,886 - 13.2 per cent
more than the improved total of 15,521 just appeared.
So relief at seeing the two good omens is no occasion for joy unconfined.
For they might well betoken mere momentary upturn rather than sustained
recovery in the market as a whole. After all, of the eight categories in the
upper part of the table, six ended last month still in decline.
Nevertheless, while the fate of my previous fits of optimism these past five
years should perhaps have taught me better, my guess is that the growth will
spread. One reason is the two successive rises shown by the sales and
marketing category, which has consistently proved a lead indicator of UK
demand for executives in general. True, its first rebound in 1991-92 has as
yet been copied by only one other specialism, computing. But that may be
because recovery of the advertised part of the market has been delayed by a
special factor.
During the recession, huge numbers of able people made redundant through no
fault of their own have put themselves on the books of recruitment agencies
that keep registers of job-seekers in various fields, supplying lists of
candidates on request from employers. Some large groups avalanched with
speculative applications have apparently set up their own similar registers.
Hence, for as long as the data-bases can provide adequate candidates,
employers see less need to advertise their openings.
But the main reason for my expectation of a general return to growth is a
further omen which, since the three-monthly counts lump all types of
executive work together, isn't visible in the table. The third good sign is
that not only did the quarter just ended bring a jump of 36.8 per cent in
overall demand, but it saw all eight categories rise over their tallies for
July-September 1992.
Even so, I cannot foresee the advertised market ever returning to the
heights of the mid-1980s, when 12-monthly totals topped 40,000. And the
reason for that longer run pessimism lies in the demand for innovative
specialists represented by the research and development category.
A dozen years ago it rose steeply in advance of the boom for other types of
staff. But since its 12-monthly peak of 7,538 in 1983-84 it has plummeted to
a mere 1,248 jobs - only half the number offered in the depths of the
previous recession in 1980-81.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts stage rally in wake of auction
announcement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK GILTS rallied across the curve after the Bank of England announced it
would not hold a gilts auction in November because of the timing of the
November 30 budget.
This sparked a squeeze in the futures market, where the long gilt future on
Liffe hit a new contract high at 114.26. It ended at 114.25, up 0.21 point
on the day.
The Bank also announced the details of this month's auction of Pounds 3.5bn
6 per cent Treasury Stock due 1999, next year's new five-year benchmark.
While this is the largest auction amount to date, the news failed to dampen
prices in the intermediate maturities.
According to analysts at Merrill Lynch, 'the size of the issue will have
been influenced by the Bank's intention to create a liquid five-year
benchmark for 1994, as well as their willingness to take advantage of
speculation on rate cuts feeding short end demand.'
BELGIAN bond prices rallied late in the day on news of proposals for the
social pact agreement between the government, employers and unions.
The yield on 10-year bonds dropped from 7.12 per cent to 7.09 in late
trading. However, the proposal was only starting to emerge as the market
closed. Dealers said they had not had time to examine the details.
There were two key items, according to Mr John Hall, European economist at
Swiss Bank Corporation: a complete freeze in real wage costs from 1994 to
1996; abandonment of wage indexation; and cuts to public expenditure rather
than tax increases.
'What we need to see is the agreement of the unions on the whole accord,'
said Mr Hall, 'and there are a number of areas which still haven't been
clarified.' However, assuming agreement is reached, the market should rally
further.
GERMAN bund prices rallied slightly late in the day. Dealers said the
Bundesbank report's positive attitude on the trend for lowering inflation
had encouraged speculation that rates would ease.
AFTER posting early declines in the wake of a stronger-than-expected
September housing starts report, longer-dated US Treasury prices rallied to
stand slightly firmer late yesterday afternoon.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/16 at 105
25/32 , yielding 5.834 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was unchanged at 100 1/16 , to yield 3.824 per cent.
Prices eased at the long end in early trading after the commerce department
announced that housing starts rose 2.8 per cent in September to a 1.35m
annual rate. The data was stronger than analysts expected - the average of
forecasts was for an annual rate of 1.3m.
Although the data spurred some early selling, observers said it was mostly
confined to dealers and speculators taking profits after the market's recent
big rally. Consequently, prices were able to recover their lost ground, and
amid reports of new buying by municipal authorities, the long end inched
into positive territory around mid-afternoon.

FT  20 OCT 93 / International Bonds: World Bank pricing more generous than
expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank played safe with the launch of its first D-Mark global bond,
setting an indicated price range which was slightly more generous than the
market had expected.
The DM3bn offering of 10-year bonds will be priced today to yield between
six and eight basis points over the 6 per cent German government bond due
2003. Demand was such that the bonds are likely to be priced at the lower
end.
Even though the indicated range was only one basis point wider than most
expectations, it sent a clear signal to the market that the World Bank was
keen to attract top-quality German and international institutions.
In addition, the indicated range achieved the best pricing for a
supranational issuer in the D-Mark sector since the introduction of the
fixed re-offer price last year.
Joint lead managers Deutsche Bank and Salomon Brothers said the issue was
several times oversubscribed, though demand from within Germany was not that
strong. However, this had been expected because of the much higher yields
which are available in the domestic bond market.
According to initial estimates, around one-third of the bonds were placed in
east Asia, 25 per cent in the US and the remainder in Europe.
International demand was also strong for Credit Local's FFr7bn offering of
eight-year Eurobonds. Joint lead manager JP Morgan said around 75 per cent
of the bonds were placed outside France.
The bonds were priced to yield 21 basis points over the 9 1/2 per cent
French government OAT due 2001, at the low end of the indicated price range.
When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread remained intact.
This offering replaces Credit Local's planned French franc global bond
offering, the documentation for which would not have been ready for another
one or two months.
This delay meant that the offering could not be launched before late
November or early December, which traditionally is not the best time to
raise large amounts of money, especially under a new format.
Credit Local was not willing to wait until next year because of its large
borrowing requirement, so it opted to raise the funds through an issue of
Eurobonds. However, the French franc global bond offering remains open for
next year.
Ireland took advantage of arbitrage opportunities available in the
Euro-escudo market to raise cheap D-Marks. At the same time, it become the
first foreign sovereign issuer to tap the escudo sector of the international
bond market.
At the underwriting level, Ireland's Es15bn issue of five-year Eurobonds was
priced to yield around eight basis points below the 12 1/2 per cent
Portuguese government bond due January 1998.
Euro-escudo bonds yield less than Portuguese government bonds because they
are not subject to withholding tax. However, the yield differential has
narrowed considerably in recent months, on rumours, now confirmed, that
Portugal planned to abolish the tax on foreign holders of its bonds.
An official at Ireland's National Treasury Management Agency said the
proceeds of the issue were swapped into floating-rate D-Marks at a
substantial margin below the London interbank offered rate (Libor).
Ireland is believed to have achieved a margin of between 11 and 15 basis
points below Libor. The floating-rate D-Marks would replace more expensive
liabilities in that currency.
Lead manager Banco Portugues de Investimento said most of the bonds were
placed with non-resident investors.
IFC, the private sector arm of the World Bank, achieved its aggressive
dollar funding target of between 35 and 40 basis points below Libor by
swapping the proceeds of its Pta10bn offering of five-year bonds.

FT  20 OCT 93 / International Equity Issues: Euro-convertible debenture
planned by Bangkok Land
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANGKOK Land, Thailand's biggest property group, is planning to launch a
Dollars 600m Euro-convertible debenture.
Following the removal of a number of legal and fiscal obstacles last year,
there have been more than 20 Euro-convertible issues from Thailand, but the
Bangkok Land issue is the largest to date.
The company is to tender for a Dollars 1bn contract to build 20km of
inner-city overhead railway. Issue proceeds will be used to finance the
project.
The company said the issue, convertible into Bangkok Land equity, will go
ahead whether or not it wins the contract. The bonds will have a coupon of 4
per cent to 4.5 per cent and a maturity of 10 years.
Mr Anant Kanjanapas, chief executive, said the issue 'could boost the
credibility of Thailand among foreign investors'.
The Eurobond market has become a highly attractive method of financing for
Thai companies, since the cost of bank loans in Thailand is around 12 per
cent.
Last month, Bangkok Land successfully launched a Dollars 150m
Euro-convertible debenture lead-managed by Daiwa Securities. It also
announced a 1-for-10 issue of warrants to existing shareholders.
Tanayong, a rival property company run by Mr Anant's brother Mr Keree
Kanjanapas, has already announced a Dollars 150m Euro-convertible debenture
issue with a maturity of less than 10 years. Led by Swiss Bank Corp, it is
part of a Bt6bn fundraising exercise to cover urban rail projects.
Union Finance Asia and Phatra Thanakit, two local securities houses, will
co-lead an issue of Bt2.5bn of unsecured debentures with warrants and Bt750m
of new shares to support the issues.
Tanayong is already committed to investing some Dollars 1bn to construct an
urban railway for the Bangkok Metropolitan Authority.

THE Tokyo Stock Exchange expects to post its first profits in four years

Mr Minoru Nagaoka, exchange chairman, said the TSE could make a Y2.53bn
profit, compared with a loss of Y2.47bn for the corresponding six months a
year ago.
Despite the gloomy outlook for the Japanese economy, the exchange hopes to
post profits for the whole of this year, mostly from trimming its costs, the
TSE chairman said.
In contrast, the Osaka Securities Exchange has posted a loss for the
six-months ended September. It made a loss of Y41m following declining
turnover in cash and futures transactions, an official said.

A STRONG performance from the Western Areas mine helped lift profit after
tax and capital expenditure from the three gold mines in the Johannesburg
Consolidated Investment (JCI) group by 23.3 per cent to R72.5m (Dollars
21.7m) in the September quarter from R58.8m in the same period last year.
Western Areas increased net profit by 70 per cent to R37.7m from R22.2m.
Gold production rose for the fifth consecutive quarter, by 7.4 per cent to
4,104kg from 3,823kg, as both tonnes milled and grade increased. The average
gold price received rose by 7.6 per cent to R38,091 a kg from R35,403 a kg.
Unit working costs declined by 1.1 per cent to R29,511 a kg.
Randfontein produced 8,121kg of gold, up from 7,902kg, lifting net profits
by 8.3 per cent to R37.2m from R34.4m after capital expenditure of R20m.
The Joel mine recorded a loss of R2.5m compared with a R2.2m profit the
previous quarter. The strategy of maintaining a reduced stoping rate while
increasing development to build up a sound payable ore reserve is being
continued.
Lower volumes in the inland market and weaker prices contributed to a 35 per
cent decline in attributable profit to R112.4m at Randcoal, one of South
Africa's three main coal producers, in the year to September. Earnings per
share fell by 48 per cent to 87 cents following the issue of shares. The
dividend was cut by 25 per cent to 45 cents.

FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: Cheung Kong pays HKDollars 500m
for 15% of Allied Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong Holdings has acquired a 15 per cent stake in
Hong Kong-listed Allied Group, one month after a government inspector issued
a report listing numerous allegations of corporate misfeasance by Allied's
former management.
The investigation into five companies associated with Allied was launched in
August 1992, and has had a drastic impact on their share prices. Cheung Kong
has paid around HKDollars 500m (USDollars 64.7m) for its stake in the parent
company, which analysts believe has an asset value more than double that
figure.
Cheung Kong is now the second largest shareholder in Allied Group, which
controls two other listed companies with interests in manufacturing and
property development.
The largest shareholder, Mr Lee Ming-tee, holds a 29.9 per cent stake and
there is speculation that he may sell, which would give control of the group
to Cheung Kong.
Following the recommendations in the government investigation, it is
possible that legal action may be taken against the former management of
Allied. Stock market regulators are also examining possible breaches of
securities regulations.
This has created substantial pressure for Mr Lee to withdraw from the group,
and he recently resigned as chairman.
Minority shareholders have yet to receive any direct benefit from the
government's move to clean up the company, which has so far had to make
provisions of HKDollars 43m as a result of the investigation.
If Cheung Kong were to take control of Allied, however, it would be seen as
arguably the most positive outcome of the 13-month, HKDollars 46m inquiry.
The investigation will have shaken out a management which appears to have
refused to play by the rules of a more tightly regulated stock market, and
it will have replaced them with one of Hong Kong's most renowned
deal-makers.

FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: Indonesian property company to
go public
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CIPUTRA Development, a leading Indonesian property company, yesterday
announced plans to go public next month. The company expect to raise Dollars
120m in a public offering which would value it at about Dollars 500m.
Brokers say the company has a 14 per cent share in Jakarta's fast-growing
residential property market, and has a 'landbank' in Java of 8.8m sq metres
with a value of Rp1,474bn (Dollars 695m).
The company was established in 1981 by Mr Ciputra and is currently 98 per
cent owned by his family, a shareholding which will be reduced to about 75
per cent after the public offering.
Mr Ciputra is also a leading shareholder in the Jaya Group and Metropolitan
Group, which account for a further 41 per cent of the Jakarta residential
property market. Estate agents estimate an annual demand for 100,000 new
houses in Jakarta and 600,000 houses in all of Indonesia. Annual
construction in Jakarta currently averages about 50,000 houses.
Since 1984, Ciputra Development has been developing a 455 hectare
residential site close to Jakarta's international airport. The company is
beginning construction of a 500 hectare 'satellite city' at Tangerang, west
Jakarta, and a 1,000 hectare residential and golf course development in
Surubaya, an industrial city in West Java with a population of 2.6m.
The company is also entering the retail property sector, having just
completed a 50,000 sq metre shopping mall and a 338-room hotel complex in
Jakarta.
Brokers say funds raised at flotation will be used to finance current
development projects. The company also plans to increase its landbank to 12m
sq m by the end of 1996. It forecasts a gross profit of Rp88bn on revenue of
Rp242bn this year, rising to a profit of Rp161bn on revenue of Rp503bn in
1994.

FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: Kaufhof takes specialty message
to New York - The efforts of a German retailer to launchan ADR programme in
the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RARELY does a chief executive of a large German company take the trouble to
fly to North America to present his company to US investors; even more
rarely, amid Germany's deep recession, does that chief executive have an
optimistic message to communicate.
Today, when Mr Jens Odewald, chief executive of Kaufhof Holding, launches a
series of presentations to investment institutions in New York and Boston,
he will have done both.
He will tell the institutions that group turnover for the current year is
set to rise by more than 10 per cent from the DM20.46bn (Dollars 12.58bn)
made last year. He has already predicted a substantial rise in earnings for
the group after net profits of DM222.4m last year.
The presentations will coincide with the launch of Kaufhof's sponsored
American Depositary Receipt (ADR) programme for its shares. The retailer
will become one of the handful of German companies to set up such a
programme.
The move falls short of the commitment to the US investment community shown
by Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial company, which early this
month obtained a full listing for its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
Kaufhof is majority-owned by the privately-owned Swiss-based Metro Group,
and the interests of institutional shareholders will always be secondary to
those of Mr Otto Beisheim, proprietor of the DM60bn-plus Metro empire.
However, the timing of Kaufhof's ADR programme seems designed to prompt
investors to draw parallels with Daimler-Benz - and Kaufhof will emerge
favourably from the comparison, even if for accounting reasons they will not
be comparing like with like.
When Daimler-Benz came to New York it announced a loss of DM949bn for the
first six months of the year (under US accounting rules). The Cologne-based
Kaufhof group is one of a small group of large German companies which will
be able to increase earnings (under German accounting rules) and turnover in
1993, the nadir of the worst recession in Germany since the second world
war. Among fellow members of the DAX index of 30 leading shares, only a few
banks and construction companies will be able to match this performance.
The recession has hit consumer spending hard and Mr Odewald expects the
German retail sector to shrink by a real 1 to 2 per cent this year.
The group's performance has less to do with market conditions than with the
strategy that the 53-year old Mr Odewald has pursued since he took over as
chief executive in 1985.
Under Mr Odewald, Kaufhof has diversified away from department store
business, which has been at the heart of the group since it was founded 115
years ago. The focus of the expansion has been specialty retailing. 'There
is no growth to be had out of department stores,' Mr Odewald said in an
interview last week. 'Specialty stores on the other hand are increasing
sales by 10 to 13 per cent a year.
'The merchandise is the same as in a department store, but the business is
far more profitable. Your costs are lower because you tend to be in a
suburban area rather than the city centre, and the concentration on one
market niche gives the consumer a clear answer as to why he or she should go
shopping in this store rather than anywhere else.'
The group began its move into the specialty sector in 1985 with the
acquisition of a stake in Saturn-Elektro, a consumer electronics store based
in Cologne. Following a mixture of acquisition and organic growth, sales in
this segment have risen from DM270m in 1987 to an expected DM4bn to DM4.5bn
this year.
Other specialty activities include Reno, a low-price shoe-retailing chain,
and Vobis Microcomputer, Europe's largest retailer of IBM-compatible
personal computers. Kaufhof bought 50 per cent of Vobis in 1989, taking its
holding to 65 per cent at the beginning of this year. Within three years,
sales have grown from DM300m to DM1.5bn in 1992 and a projected DM1.8bn to
DM1.9bn for the current year.
A further market segment is tourism: last year Kaufhof bought a majority
stake in Kuoni, the Swiss tourism company. Sales in this area have grown
from DM200m in 1975 to some DM6bn this year.
Specialty retailing last year accounted for 28 per cent of group sales and
44 per cent of profits, while department stores generated 48 per cent of
sales and 47 per cent of profit.
Mr Odewald will today tell investors that specialty retailing has the
potential to increase to between 35 per cent and 40 per cent of the business
portfolio by 1997.
He is confident that the group will maintain its resilience to the difficult
consumer spending environment of the current decade. 'Specialty retailing is
the runner of the 1990s,' he believes.
Investors appear to share that optimism. The shares have climbed by more
than 35 per cent since the beginning of the year, and at DM568 yesterday are
7 per cent higher than when Kaufhof announced its ADR plans earlier this
month.

SHARES in Polaroid, the US photography group, fell sharply yesterday after
it posted a 10 per cent downturn in third-quarter earnings.
For the three months to end-September, net earnings were Dollars 24.9m, or
53 cents a share, against Dollars 27. m, or 59 cents, in the corresponding
period of 1992. Profits fell in spite of a 4 per cent increase in revenues
to Dollars 533.9m.
On Wall Street, the stock closed at Dollars 32 5/8 , down Dollars 1 1/2 on
the day.
The Massachusetts-based company attributed its lacklustre performance to
currency fluctuations and the cost of launching its Captiva instant camera
system.

SOUTHWEST Airlines, virtually the only US airline to be thriving in the
industry's gloomy climate, yesterday reported further strong growth with a
63 per cent increase in net income, to Dollars 43.9m for the third quarter.
However, the company appeared to sound a cautionary note for the fourth
quarter's earnings, saying it was too soon to predict how they would compare
with the comparable period's 'truly outstanding' result. The share price
dipped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 34 as investors took profits.
The latest results were achieved through a 61 per cent increase in operating
income, to Dollars 86.8m, which in turn were produced by a 23 per cent rise
in the number of passengers carried. Earnings per share were up from 19
cents to 31 cents.
Southwest Airlines, based in Dallas, Texas, has built up market share by
offering no-frills services at much lower fares than the bigger airlines.
Last month it expanded into the east coast market by opening routes from
Baltimore to Chicago and Cleveland.
Mr Herbert Kelleher, chairman, president and chief executive officer, said
the quarter to September was the eighth consecutive one in which earnings
growth had exceeded 60 per cent.
He said load factors in October had so far been higher than in the
corresponding period last year.

MONSANTO, the big US chemicals company, unveiled stronger than expected
third quarter net income of Dollars 95m, or 78 cents a share, up from
Dollars 54m, or 45 cents a year earlier.
Last year's results included gains of Dollars 8m, or 6 cents, from
discontinued operations. Sales slid to Dollars 1.85bn from Dollars 1.88bn.
Monsanto said operating income from its Searle pharmaceutical subsidiary has
started to turn around thanks to sales growth from new products. Operating
income from its chemical group improved to Dollars 77m from Dollars 34m,
reflecting higher demand for nylon fibers and continuing cost reduction
measures.

NWA, parent of Northwest Airlines, the fourth-largest US carrier, reported
net profits of Dollars 112.3m for the third quarter, compared with net
losses of Dollars 19.7m for the same quarter last year.
The company said the results showed action taken to restructure the troubled
airline over the last year had begun to take effect.
Earlier this year, the heavily indebted company narrowly escaped filing for
bankruptcy by securing wage and benefit concessions from labour unions and
agreeing a restructuring of its bank loans.
The company's shares are privately held following a 1989 leveraged buy-out
led by Mr Alfred Checchi and Mr Gary Wilson, now joint chairmen.
Mr John Dasburg, president and chief executive officer, said the third
quarter was the strongest period of the year for airlines.
Last year's figure had been unusually depressed by a fares war initiated by
a competitor, so an improvement had been expected.
However, Mr Dasburg said the substantial improvement demonstrated progress
in positioning Northwest for long-term profitability.
'We still have much work ahead of us, but we are pleased with our results in
the third quarter and grateful to the people of Northwest for their diligent
efforts to restore Northwest to profitability,' he said.
Traffic for the quarter decreased 9.1 per cent to 15.94bn passenger miles
from 17.54bn the previous year, but profits improved because loss-making
domestic routes were cut and costs came down.
Mr Dasburg said the wage and benefit reductions agreed by employees had
contributed Dollars 40m to third quarter profits.
Turnover rose by 5.9 per cent to Dollars 2.393bn and operating profits rose
to Dollars 270.1m from Dollars 61m. LTV, the third biggest US steel producer
which in June emerged from seven years of bankruptcy protection, turned in
third-quarter profit of Dollars 400,000, against Dollars 632.4m a year
earlier, agencies report from New York.
Revenues rose to Dollars 1.05bn from Dollars 944.2m.
Net earnings for the nine months totalled Dollars 4.07bn, against Dollars
727m, with revenues rising to Dollars 3.04bn from Dollars 2.88bn.

SANTOS, the Adelaide-based gas exploration and production company, yesterday
announced that it was accepting the takeover offer by Boral for Sagasco, in
respect of its 19.9 per cent interest in the target company, writes Nikki
Tait in Sydney.
Santos was a previous bidder for Sagasco but ran into opposition from the
Australian Trade Practices Commission. Litigation between Santos and the TPC
ensued.
While this was still under way, Boral, the building materials group, put in
an offer. Last week, with the support of the South Australia government
which holds a controlling stake in Sagasco, Boral gained control of its
target.

FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: Interacting with the full
Spectrum - Former Apple head John Sculley's surprise move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Sculley's move from Apple Computer to Spectrum Information
Technologies has perplexed many observers. Why should a man who could have
his pick of jobs in the emerging world of digital interactive media, choose
Spectrum, a Dollars 100m revenue company that has lost money for the past
five years?
'I looked at a whole bunch of opportunities over the past few months,
everything from running major corporations to various derivative businesses
in interactive television,' Mr Sculley says.
'But I had little interest in running a major corporation. I have already
done that a couple of times' - at PepsiCo and Apple. 'My real interest,
having been bitten by the bug of Silicon Valley, was in doing something very
entrepreneurial, where I had a chance for significant wealth creation.'
He was drawn to Spectrum by its patented technology that enables wireless
data communication, via cellular networks, linking portable computers and
personal digital assistants, such as Newton, his pet project at Apple.
He describes excitedly the first time he saw Spectrum's cellular modem
technology operating, four weeks ago in his new Connecticut home; sending
messages, via a cellular telephone from his Apple Newton to a fax machine.
'Suddenly I realised all the things that we talked about with Newton, about
mobile communications, but had not been able to deliver at the product
launch in August, were now possible.'
But Mr Sculley claims 'zero credit' for discovering Spectrum. 'I stumbled on
to it. I'm almost embarrassed to explain,' he says. 'Mr Peter Caserta
(Spectrum chief executive before Sculley's appointment on Monday) had been
trying to get in touch with me for months.' The Spectrum executive finally
prevailed upon his next door neighbour, a former PepsiCo employee who knew
Mr Sculley, to place a call.
Mr Sculley reluctantly agreed to meet with Mr Caserta as a favour to his
friend. A one-hour meeting turned into a five-hour session, Mr Sculley
recalls, 'and the more I heard, the more interested I became.' But still he
had no thoughts of joining Spectrum, nor did the company have any ambitions
to hire one of the best-known executives in the industry.
Only after Mr Sculley resigned from Apple, last Wednesday, did he begin
negotiations about joining Spectrum. He set about a thorough examination of
its business, hired a team of engineers to assess its technology and
attorneys to examine its patent claims, worked out an employment contract
and finally, on Sunday night, signed an agreement to join Spectrum as
chairman and chief executive.
Mr Sculley has acquired rights to take a significant equity stake in
Spectrum, through stock options, but declined to give details.
Both Mr Sculley and Mr Caserta, now vice-chairman of Spectrum, talked on
Monday of building Spectrum into a company with the clout of Intel and
Microsoft, two of the most powerful companies in the computer industry.
Both are reluctant to discuss Spectrum's past business dealings, but Mr
Sculley sees Spectrum as a 'gem of a company'.
If so, say other computer industry executives, it is a diamond in the rough,
lacking the polish that might be expected of a company with which Mr Sculley
would associate himself.
In May, Spectrum announced a technology licensing agreement with AT&amp;T and
claimed that it would make 'hundreds of millions of dollars' from the deal.
Its stock soared Dollars 9 to Dollars 13 1/8 in a few days. But when AT&amp;T
said it expected to pay Spectrum only 'a few million dollars over three or
four years,' the stock plummeted to Dollars 4. Shareholder lawsuits are
pending.
This and other controversies surrounding technology licensing agreements,
Spectrum's acquisition last year of a chain of computer stores and disputes
over its patent claims have earned it a mixed reputation. Spectrum has lost
money for the past five years. On Monday, however, its shares leaped from
Dollars 7 5/8 to Dollars 11 1/8 on news of Mr Sculley's arrival.
But none of this seems to worry Mr Sculley. 'I've satisfied myself that I'm
comfortable attaching my reputation to this,' he says. 'The draw for me is a
chance to be able to help a company, much as I did when I went to Apple 10
years ago,' he says.
'The model I was looking for, my ideal, was to do something like Barry
Diller did with QVC, the television shopping channel, a year ago. He found a
small company that nobody had noticed. When he joined up he got an equity
position in the company and a lot of people started looking at it and saw
its potential.'
'The world will have to decide whether Spectrum is equivalent to that. But
Spectrum has a lot of things that were on my list of criteria.'
In particular, Mr Sculley says he was looking for a company that could
profit from the convergence of computer, communications and consumer
electronics technologies. 'I felt that if I could get a company that was
small but had cash on its balance sheet - Spectrum has Dollars 20m  - we
could begin to move into acquisitions, alliances and relationships. I know
most of the heads of the major telecommunications companies around the world
and can open doors for Spectrum.'
After his first day at the helm, Mr Sculley had set priorities: improving
relations with licensors of Spectrum's technology and planning new
licensees. 'I haven't been this excited since I joined Apple 10 years ago,'
he says.

FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: More job cuts at Pfizer,
Cyanamid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PFIZER and American Cyanamid, two of the biggest US drugs companies,
announced substantial staff cuts yesterday. The moves came as pricing
pressures and the threat of pending US healthcare reform continue to force
the industry to retrench.
Yesterday announcements follow last week's news from Eli Lilly that it would
cut about 4,000 jobs. Other big drugs companies, including Merck and Johnson
&amp; Johnson, have also announced job cuts.
Pfizer, considered one of the fastest-growing pharmaceuticals companies,
took an after-tax charge of Dollars 525m, or Dollars 1.63 a share, against
third-quarter earnings to cover its restructuring and streamlining moves.
These include the cutting of about 3,000 jobs. Ultimately, Pfizer expects to
reduce its staff by about 4,000, or 10 per cent.
Mr William Steere, Pfizer chairman and chief executive, said the company
needed to improve its operating efficiency in the face of fast-changing
market conditions.
'We believe that the prospect of US healthcare reform will further
accelerate changes already occurring in our industry,' he said.
The company is also writing off some assets and consolidating its
manufacturing, distribution and administrative operations. It expects the
restructuring to yield annual savings of at least Dollars 130m.
Including the restructuring charge, Pfizer posted a third-quarter net loss
of Dollars 214.2m, or 65 cents, compared with net income of Dollars 297.5m,
or 88 cents. Stripping out one-time charges, it had net income of Dollars
311m, or 98 cents, in the latest quarter. Sales rose 2 per cent to Dollars
1.87bn from Dollars 1.83bn.
For the nine months, net income was Dollars 368.6m, or Dollars 1.15, on
sales of Dollars 5.49bn, against earnings of Dollars 532.1m, or Dollars
1.58, on sales of Dollars 5.28bn. Excluding restructuring charges, Pfizer
earned Dollars 895m, or Dollars 2.78, in the 1993 period. Excluding charges
for accounting changes in the 1992 period, it earned Dollars 814.7m, or
Dollars 2.42.
American Cyanamid will take a pre-tax charge of between Dollars 150m and
Dollars 200m against fourth-quarter earnings to cover restructuring moves.
These include cutting about 2,500 jobs, or 9 per cent of its worldwide
workforce, in the next three years. Most of the cuts will come from medical
business.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TIME Warner, the largest US entertainment group, yesterday posted an 8 per
cent improvement in underlying earnings for the third quarter. It attributed
the advance partly to the popularity of Warner Brothers' summer movies.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation climbed to
Dollars 726m, on revenues of Dollars 3.7bn, against earnings of Dollars 675m
and revenues of Dollars 3.5bn in the third quarter of 1992.
However, the operating results exclude the effect of Time Warner's heavy
debt burden and high non-cash amortisation charges associated with the
formation of the group in 1989.
With these factors included, the group remained in the red, though its net
loss narrowed to Dollars 136m, or 36 cents, against Dollars 152, or 41
cents, in the 1992 quarter.
The improvement partly reflects the benefits of the group's redemption of
some preferred stock in February, and the exchange for other preferred
shares for debt in April.
On the operating level, four of the group's five divisions reported record
earnings.
The film business turned in record earnings of Dollars 204m, against Dollars
185m a year ago, with the division's 1992 results restated to reflect Time
Warner Entertainment's purchase last month of the remaining 50 per cent of
Six Flags theme parks.
Warner Brothers led the film industry in US box office receipts this summer,
with The Fugitive, starring Harrison Ford, generating Dollars 172m in ticket
sales. The music division also had its best quarter, with Dollars 428m in
earnings. US sales of recorded music and worldwide sales of music publishing
rights were higher.

groups
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE US drugs industry's fortunes appeared varied during the third quarter as
leading pharmaceutical groups yesterday unveiled mixed earnings.
Upjohn's operating income of 86 cents a share was higher than the 79 cents
most analysts had predicted. However, restructuring charges of Dollars 183m
in the quarter pushed it into the red with a net deficit of Dollars 30m, or
19 cents. A year earlier it earned Dollars 131m, or 73 cents, including
one-time charges of Dollars 15m.
It is cutting about 1,500 jobs worldwide, eliminating or reducing
manufacturing capacity, and writing-down certain intangible assets as well
as increasing its liability reserves. Upjohn expects its restructuring moves
to save at least Dollars 150m annually.
Excluding one-time items, net income rose 5 per cent in the quarter. Sales
edged 1 per cent higher to Dollars 900m.
Eli Lilly also posted better-than-expected third-quarter earnings of Dollars
294.4m, or Dollars 1, above the slender 96 cents Wall Street had expected.
The previous year, it lost Dollars 268.5m, or 91 cents, including a pre-tax
restructuring and other charges of Dollars 519.6m.
Lilly blamed pricing pressure for the slim improvement in sales of Dollars
1.53bn from Dollars 1.48bn.
Warner-Lambert, on the other hand, disappointed Wall Street with a 5 per
cent fall in third-quarter net earnings to Dollars 155.9m, or Dollars 1.16 a
share, against Dollars 164.6m, or Dollars 1.22, a year earlier. Its shares
fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 69 3/4 .
Warner-Lambert's sales rose to Dollars 1.49bn in the quarter from Dollars
1.44bn. The company blamed previously-disclosed regulatory issues involving
its manufacturing operations, and broader-based industry pressures, for its
earnings decline.
Warner-Lambert has run into trouble with the Food and Drug Administration
over record keeping and other violations at its manufacturing plants,
especially in Puerto Rico. Manufacturing difficulties have cost it about
Dollars 150m in lost sales this year.
Mr Arvind Desai, an analyst at Mehta &amp; Isaly in New York, said the poor
results also reflected intensifying generic competition for the company's
Lopid cholesterol-reducing agent.

HONEYWELL, the US controls group, yesterday reported net income of Dollars

writes Martin Dickson.
Sales totalled Dollars 1.45bn, down from Dollars 1.55bn. Operating profits,
excluding special charges, came through at Dollars 151.7m, down from Dollars
164.2m, and were adversely affected by European currency fluctuations and a

Mr Michael Bonsignore, chairman, noted that 25 per cent of the company's

UNISYS, the US computer and electronics group, lifted earnings in its third
quarter in spite of a decline in revenues blamed on currency exchange rates
and weak sales in Europe and Japan.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 84.1m, or 29 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 68.3m, or 23 cents last time.
Excluding the positive effects of tax items in each year, earnings per share
in the quarter were 20 cents, against 17 cents a year ago. Revenue dipped to
Dollars 1.81bn from Dollars 2.07bn in the third quarter last year.
For the nine-month period, net income was Dollars 447.7m, or Dollars 1.83,
including a net gain of Dollars 203.8m, or 83 cents per share. Last year net
income was Dollars 222m, or 79 cents, including Dollars 27m, or 16 cents,
from tax benefits. Revenue was Dollars 5.64bn, compared with Dollars 6.17bn.

FALLING credit costs and a one-off tax benefit pushed earnings at Chemical
Banking Corporation ahead to Dollars 502m, or Dollars 1.84 a share, in the
third quarter, compared with Dollars 381m in the previous three months.
Chemical also announced the appointment of a new president, Mr Edward
Miller, who will take over when Mr Walter Shipley becomes chairman at the
end of the year.
Mr Miller, 52, was one of three candidates who had been in contention for
the job, which arises because of the retirement of chairman Mr John
McGillicuddy, 62.
Leaving aside the tax benefit, which added Dollars 140m more than had been
anticipated to earnings, and a Dollars 115m pre-tax charge (Dollars 67m
after tax) to reflect costs associated with the merger with Manufacturers
Hanover, Chemical's net earnings for the period would have been Dollars
429m, or Dollars 1.55 a share.
Third-quarter figures at Wells Fargo reflected the benefit of improvements
in credit quality, as net income rose to Dollars 165m, or Dollars 2.74, from
Dollars 24m, or 21 cents, a year ago.
The loan-loss provision, at Dollars 120m, was down from Dollars 140m in the
preceding three months and Dollars 400m in the third quarter of 1992.

<TEXT>
UNISYS, the US computer and electronics group, lifted earnings in its third
quarter in spite of a decline in revenues blamed on currency exchange rates
and weak sales in Europe and Japan.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 84.1m, or 29 cents a share, compared
with Dollars 68.3m, or 23 cents, in the same period last year.
Excluding the positive effects of tax items in each year, earnings per share
in the quarter were 20 cents, against 17 cents a year ago.
Revenue dipped to Dollars 1.81bn from Dollars 2.07bn in the third quarter
last year. About 35 per cent of the decline was due to the impact of
negative currency translation, the company said.
Mr James Unruh, chairman and chief executive, said cost reductions in the
last two years had produced continued improvement during an extended period
of global economic weakness.
'We are confident that investments being made in new services and products,
together with the new organisation structure announced in August will, over
time, result in the generation of profitable revenue growth,' he said.
'Deterioration in our European business accelerated in the quarter, and
Japan continues to be weak, offsetting growth in other parts of our
business,' said Mr Unruh.
He said the company would 'continue to reduce costs during this period of
economic weakness'.
For the nine-month period, net income was Dollars 447.7m, or Dollars 1.83,
including a net gain of Dollars 203.8m, or 83 cents a share, from one-time
items in the first quarter. Last year net income was Dollars 222m, or 79
cents, including Dollars 27m, or 16 cents, from tax benefits. Revenue was
Dollars 5.64bn, compared with Dollars 6.17bn.

Chemical Bank result

<TEXT>
FALLING credit costs and a one-off tax benefit pushed post-tax earnings at
Chemical Banking Corporation ahead to Dollars 502m, or Dollars 1.84 a share,
in the third quarter, compared with Dollars 381m in the previous three
months.
Chemical also announced the appointment of a new president, Mr Edward
Miller, who will take over when Mr Walter Shipley becomes chairman at the
end of the year.
Mr Miller, 52, was one of three candidates who had been in contention for
the job, which arises because of the retirement of chairman Mr John
McGillicuddy, 62.
Leaving aside the tax benefit, which added Dollars 140m more than had been
anticipated to earnings, and a Dollars 115m pre-tax charge (Dollars 67m
after tax) to reflect costs associated with the merger with Manufacturers
Hanover, Chemical's net earnings for the period would have been Dollars
429m, or Dollars 1.55 a share.
Mr McGillicuddy said the quarter had seen strong increases in revenues in
many of the bank's businesses. Due to improvements in credit quality,
non-performing assets at the end of September had fallen to Dollars 4.1bn,
from Dollars 6.6bn a year before.
The loan-loss provision during the period fell to Dollars 298m, from Dollars
330m a year before.
Third-quarter figures at Wells Fargo also reflected the benefit of
improvements in credit quality, as net income rose to Dollars 165m, or
Dollars 2.74, from Dollars 24m, or 21 cents, a year ago.
The loan-loss provision, at Dollars 120m, was down from Dollars 140m in the
preceding three months and Dollars 400m in the third quarter of 1992.

WARNER-Lambert, the US pharmaceuticals company, disappointed Wall Street
with a 5 per cent fall in third-quarter net earnings to Dollars 155.9m or
Dollars 1.16 a share, against Dollars 164.6m or Dollars 1.22 a year earlier.
Its shares fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 69 3/4 .
Upjohn, another big drugs group, posted a third-quarter loss and is cutting
1,500 jobs.
Warner-Lambert's sales rose to Dollars 1.49bn in the quarter from Dollars
1.44bn. The company blamed previously disclosed regulatory issues involving
its manufacturing operations and broader-based industry pressures for its
earnings decline.
Warner-Lambert has run into trouble with the Food and Drug Administration
over record keeping and other violations at its manufacturing plants,
especially in Puerto Rico. Manufacturing difficulties have cost it about
Dollars 150m in lost sales this year.
Mr Arvind Desai, an analyst at Mehta &amp; Isaly in New York, said the poor
results also reflected intensifying generic competition for the company's
Lopid cholesterol-reducing agent.
The company predicted flat earnings for the whole of 1993 of about Dollars
4.78 a share.
Upjohn suffered a third quarter deficit of Dollars 30m, or 19 cents,
including restructuring charges of Dollars 183m. A year earlier it earned
Dollars 131m, or 73 cents, including one-time charges of Dollars 15m.
It is cutting about 1,500 jobs worldwide, eliminating or reducing
manufacturing capacity and writing-down certain intangible assets as well as
increasing its liability reserves.
Excluding one-time items, net income rose 5 per cent in the quarter. Sales
edged 1 per cent higher to Dollars 900m.

third term

<TEXT>
CITICORP, the largest US banking group, yesterday reported an 18 per cent
rise in third-quarter earnings compared with the previous three months. The
result reflects improvements in the credit quality of its loan portfolio.
While pointing to a further improvement in the bank's capital and reserves,
Mr John Reed, chairman, added: 'The best news in our results was in credit
costs, which are declining more rapidly than we had expected, and in the
improvement in the quality of our portfolios.'
During the three months, net income rose to Dollars 528m, or 97 cents a
share, from Dollars 446m, or 82 cents, in the previous three months and
Dollars 116m or 17 cents in the third quarter of 1992.
Commercial credit costs in the third quarter were Dollars 233m, down from
Dollars 297m in the second three months of the year, while credit costs on
consumer lending were Dollars 665m, down from Dollars 708m.
Trading income, which in previous quarters had provided the fastest-growing
source of revenues, amounted to Dollars 478m, down from Dollars 572m in the
previous three months but ahead of the Dollars 451m of the 1992 third
quarter.
Income from foreign exchange trading fell by nearly a third, to Dollars 245m
from Dollars 352m, while securities trading revenues rose marginally to
Dollars 233m.
Through retained earnings and the sale of new preference shares, Citicorp
lifted its key tier one risk-adjusted capital ratio to 6 per cent at the end
of September, from 4.3 a year before. This was still below the 7 per cent to
8 per cent targeted by the bank in the medium term.
BancOne, one of the fastest growing super-regional banks, reported net
income of Dollars 284.9m, or 82 cents a share, in the third quarter, up
slightly from Dollars 281.9m in the previous three months and Dollars
245.7m, or 70 cents, in the third quarter of 1992.

FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc takes centre stage
 -A look at the French chemical group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE privatisation of Banque Nationale de Paris, successfully launched on the
Paris stock market on Monday, will be a hard act to follow. The challenge
will fall to Rhone-Poulenc, France's flagship chemicals group, chosen by the
French government as the next public-sector company to take its place on the
auction block.
Several factors suggest a repeat performance when the chemicals group is
sold within the next few weeks. Rhone-Poulenc has been partially privatised.
A sale of 10 per cent of the company's shares in January reduced the
government's direct holding in the chemicals group to 43 per cent, with
Credit Lyonnais, the state-controlled bank, and AGF, the state-controlled
insurance group, holding 8.2 per cent and 7.7 per cent respectively.
The reduction in the state's stake has given Rhone-Poulenc experience of
share issues and makes the sale a relatively small operation. The
government's remaining shares are valued at about FFr15bn (Dollars 2.7bn),
compared with the FFr28bn raised by BNP and the FFr50bn which would flow
from the sale of the government's 50 per cent stake in Elf-Aquitaine, the
oil, chemicals and pharmaceuticals group which is next on the government's
privatisation list.
For the first time, the government will use a book-building technique to
ascertain the value of the shares. However, the precedent of BNP which was
cheaper than expected, and the need for the government to maintain momentum
in its plans to privatise 21 groups, suggests that they are unlikely to be
expensive.
As with BNP, the price asked of a group of stable core shareholders -
expected to hold between 25 per cent and 35 per cent of Rhone-Poulenc after
privatisation - is expected to be higher than for individual investors. But
this is not expected to pose difficulties, and the formation of such a group
appears nearly complete. Credit Lyonnais and AGF are expected to be joined
by Axa, the insurance group, and BNP, in which Rhone-Poulenc took a 1 per
cent stake at the time of its privatisation.
The Dassault and Merieux families will become core shareholders following a
share issue which will give Rhone-Poulenc complete ownership of Institute
Merieux, the vaccines group.
If the technical aspects of the issue and the probability of an attractive
price support the prediction of a smooth privatisation, however, the company
faces a series of challenges at the operating level. First-half profits,
announced last month, showed a fall of 11 per cent to FFr1.37bn. Mr Jean
Rene Fourtou, the group's chairman, expects full-year profits to decline and
does not expect a significant recovery next year.
The reasons are to be found in the company's operating environment.
Healthcare remains the group's most important business. SG Warburg, brokers,
expects the division to generate operating profits this year of FFr6bn,
compared with FFr6.4bn for the group. But the healthcare operations, which
include the majority-owned subsidiary Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, have been hit by
healthcare reforms in Germany, Italy and the UK. Sales for the subsidiary
could fall during the third quarter compared with the same period last year.
For the year they will continue to rise.
Analysts expect RPR's underlying sales growth to be about 7 per cent this
year, while earnings per share will grow by about 15 per cent as interest
payments fall and cost-cutting improves margins.
In the longer term, reforms in France, which accounts for 25 per cent of the
group's healthcare sales, are inevitable, admits the company. However, it
insists any changes will be less severe than elsewhere on the continent.
The agrochemicals sector is troubled. Rhone-Poulenc's activities, which
generated sales in 1992 of FFr10.3bn, are expected to report falls in
turnover and trading profits this year. Its most important markets, France
and Germany, dropped 25 per cent this year following the reforms of the EC's
Common Agricultural Policy. The group is launching two products in the next
two years which should lift sales but incur additional marketing costs.
Meanwhile, Rhone-Poulenc's more traditional chemicals activities have been
hit by a downturn in Germany and France which was more serious and prolonged
than expected by the management.
Analysts believe fibres and polymers may break even this year on a turnover
of about FFr10.5bn. The organic and inorganic intermediates division is
expected to tumble into loss on turnover of FFr13.4bn and speciality
chemicals, heavily weighted towards the US and UK, should make a small
profit of FFr600m on turnover of FFr12.3bn.
However, the worst seems to be over. In chemicals, prices appear to have
stopped falling. Even the price of phenol, which has suffered from
over-supply and a sharp fall in demand, is stabilising. In the fibres
division, which saw profits fall to FFr36m in the first half from FFr418m,
benefits of restructuring - such as July's joint venture with Snia of Italy
 -should help curb costs and improve margins.
Broader reorganisation within Rhone-Poulenc is likely to be one of the most
important factors in a return to profit growth. The sale of assets, such as
the group's shares in Roussel-Uclaf for about FFr4.5bn in June, are helping
to reduce the group's debt from about FFr25bn. It seems possible that the
company's target debt/equity ratio of 50 per cent by the end of 1994 could
be achieved by the end of this year. About 10 non-core businesses remain in
Rhone-Poulenc and some could be spun off or sold.
The benefits of reorganisation should bring more fundamental advantages. Mr
Fourtou's strategy since taking over has been to transform Rhone-Poulenc
from a production-oriented company to one focused on marketing and
innovation. More than 80 of the group's businesses have been sold as part of
the the shift in strategy. Annual R&amp;D expenditure has increased to FFr6.5bn
from about FFr3bn in 1986.
The benefits of this shift in focus and restructuring, have been masked by
the depressed state of many of its markets. The group should find itself in
a relatively strong position when European economies, France and Germany in
particular, start to revive. The group has important launches in drugs,
agrochemicals and specialty chemicals, whose success will be critical for
the company's future.
Profitability should be assisted by privatisation. Mr Fourtou has argued
that the sale of the government's stake will make it easier to raise new
capital, strengthening the balance sheet and reducing the cost of debt. The
company does not anticipate a new share issue immediately, relying on
continued restructuring to reduce borrowings. But the more impressive the
privatisation act, the greater the attractions of a return to the market.

FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: Bouygues falls 27% in first half
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BOUYGUES, the French company which is the world's largest construction
group, yesterday warned of a fall in net profits for 1993. This came as it
announced a 27 per cent reduction in net profits to FFr79m (Dollars 14.1m)
in the first half of the year from FFr108m in the same period last year.
The group, whose founder, Mr Francis Bouygues, died earlier this year, said
it hoped to be able to maintain the same overall level of activity in 1993
as in 1992, but was concerned that the downturn in its property division
would depress profits.
Bouygues, which like other construction companies has been badly affected by
the decline in European building activity, suffered a slight fall in
turnover to FFr29.3bn in the first half of this year from FFr30bn at the
same stage last year. Its core public works division saw sales stabilise at
FFr11.8bn.
Property was one of the worst affected areas of activity during the first
half as the group was hit by the problems of the residential and commercial
markets in France and other countries.
The group expects these difficulties to continue in the second half with
property turnover falling to FFr3.8bn in 1993 against FFr5.5bn in 1992.
Road construction was another problematic area in the first half. Sales in
this division rose slightly to FFr9.8bn from FFr9.4bn.
However, Colas, the group's road construction subsidiary, recently reported
an unexpectedly heavy interim loss. Bouygues anticipates a slight
improvement from this division in the second half with full-year sales
rising to FFr22bn from FFr21.3bn.
Bouygues was bruised by a fall in interim profits at TF1, the flagship
French television station in which it is a 25 per cent shareholder. This was
due to the general pressures on the French media and a reduction in
exceptional profits from property sales.
The group said that, at the end of September, its orders for public works
were stable against the same period of the previous year, with off-shore
orders showing a slight improvement. Bouygues forecast an overall reduction
in sales of 5 per cent to FFr59.3bn from FFr62.7bn for the full financial
year.

FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: Corrigan takes full-time post at
Goldman Sachs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Gerald Corrigan, one of the leading figures in international finance
before he stepped down as head of the New York Federal Reserve Bank in
summer, is to take on a full-time position with Goldman Sachs, the
investment bank, next year.
However, Mr Corrigan, 52, will not become a partner of the firm, renowned as
one of the most profitable, and secretive, on Wall Street. Nor will he have
any direct management responsibility.
The bulk of his income will take the form of what he termed a 'plain
vanilla' salary, rather than the profit shares which have made Goldman
partners among the highest-paid in the industry.
The former New York Fed chief, who began his career as an economist there 25
years ago, will take charge of one-off projects at Goldman. He will also
deal with the banks' clients and take responsibility for some transactions.
He and Mr Stephen Friedman, Goldman chairman, denied this would give him
only a peripheral role at the bank. They said the position had been
specially designed to give Mr Corrigan flexibility, rather than tie him down
to one role.
One of Mr Corrigan's first assignments was likely to be a review of all the
risks being incurred by Goldman Sachs in its business, including market and
operational risks, said Mr Friedman. Explaining the need for a full review,
he said: 'We should not just close the stable door after the horse has
bolted.'
Mr Corrigan caused a stir throughout the banking industry at the start of
last year when he questioned whether banks had sufficient control over the
risks they were running in the derivatives markets.
Yesterday, he said the furore stirred up by his speech had a positive
effect. 'There is no question in my mind that it has helped to stimulate a
more aggressive approach to risk management systems and better management
information. I haven't regretted making that speech - even if it made me a
dartboard target in some trading rooms.'
Because of his former role as a bank supervisor, Mr Corrigan said he had
decided not to take a position at a commercial bank.
He will not advise Goldman on its trading activities, or on any bank-related
transactions, until after next summer, when he will have been out of the
Federal Reserve system for a year.
The move into the private sector may mark a significant change for the
former central banker, but it is unlikely to stop him making more
provocative statements. 'Clearly, it's the other side of the street,' he
said. 'But I don't intend to become a wall flower on broad issues of public
interest and concern.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COST CUTTING and increased turnover enabled S Jerome &amp; Sons (Holdings), the
West Yorkshire-based spinner and weaver, to return pre-tax profits of Pounds
25,000 for the six months to June 30, against losses of Pounds 9,000.
The company is returning to the dividend list with a 0.2p interim, its first
payment since 1991.
The comparative figure included Pounds 153,000 profits from its electronics
business sold last year. Turnover was Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 21.5m). Turnover
for continuing activities was Pounds 10.8m with pre-tax losses of Pounds
162,000.
Earnings per share came out at 0.2p (losses 0.08p).
The company said that it had received a claim from the purchase of its
electronics company but it was impossible at present to assess the extent of
any liability.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
KENWOOD Appliances, the Hampshire-based household appliance manufacturer,
has paid Pounds 4.33m cash for Precision Engineering (Reading).
The purchase includes Waymaster, Precision's operating subsidiary, and
Precision Reinforced Fibres, an associated company.
In addition to the purchase price, dividends totalling Pounds 370,000 were
paid to the vendors prior to completion. The acquisition will be funded by
additional borrowings.
Waymaster is a manufacturer of water filters and is also an established
brand in kitchen scales. The company currently supplies filter cartridges to
Kenwood.
For the year to end-December 1992 Waymaster returned profits before
exceptionals of Pounds 417,000 on sales of Pounds 8.8m.
The acquisition should give a small lift to Kenwood's net earnings in the
current year. Mr Tim Parker, chief executive, said: 'Waymaster brings
important strategic benefits and significant opportunities for increased
manufacturing efficiency.'

FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: EIT matches benchmark with 7% net assets
rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EDINBURGH Investment Trust yesterday announced a 3.5 per cent increase in
its interim dividend from 2.85p to 2.95p.
Net asset value at the end of September was 322.5p, against 300.8p six
months earlier, a rise of 7.2 per cent, compared with an advance of 7 per
cent in the FT-A All-Share Index.
EIT, the second largest investment trust in the UK, said the increased
dividend reflected income from its large gilts portfolio.
In addition there was strong dividend growth from its equity holdings,
helped by the accelerated payment of UK dividends by many companies for tax
reasons.
Net revenue for the six months to September 30 was Pounds 17m (Pounds 13.4m)
for earnings per share up 26 per cent to 5.77p (4.57p).
However, Dunedin Fund Managers, the trust's manager, said the rate of
increase was unlikely to be sustained over the full year, although earnings
were expected to be ahead of last year's total of 9.25p.
EIT had 88.3 per cent of its equity holdings invested in the UK at the end
of the half year, compared with 88.8 per cent six months earlier.
Over the half year it cut its exposure to US stocks from 5.2 per cent to 4
per cent, believing the recovery in US corporate profits was still
uncertain.
The funds were reinvested in Japan and the rest of the Pacific Rim.
At the end of the six months EIT had 2.9 per cent (2.7 per cent) of its
equity portfolio in continental Europe, 3.5 per cent (2.5 per cent) in Japan
and 1.3 per cent (0.8 per cent) in the rest of the Pacific basin.
Gross revenue rose to Pounds 30.5m (Pounds 24.8m), helped by investment
income ahead at Pounds 29.7m (Pounds 20.9m). That was partly offset by a
fall in interest on deposits to Pounds 503,000 (Pounds 3.7m).

FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: McKechnie improves to Pounds 24.5m - Cost
controls and introduction of new products behind advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTRODUCTION of new products and tight cost controls helped McKechnie,
the international plastics and metal components group, increase pre-tax
profits by 7 per cent to Pounds 24.5m in the year to July 31.
The Midlands-based group said that the growth, achieved on turnover ahead 10
per cent to Pounds 314.4m, came from focused management rather than
improving economic conditions.
Mr Michael Ost, chief executive, said: 'Current trading is showing only
patchy improvement and we believe it will be the second half of our
financial year before any significant upturn in economic activity can be
expected.'
Profits before interest increased from Pounds 23.3m to Pounds 25.2m,
although operating profits in the key plastics business fell from Pounds
8.5m to Pounds 5.9m. The decline, more than offset by improvements in
consumer and specialist products, was blamed on a Pounds 224,000 loss on US
operations compared with a Pounds 2.2m profit last time.
Mr Ost said the poor performance in the US was due mainly to restructuring
costs and weak volume sales.
Management restructuring in the US, costing Pounds 1.1m, was included in
'net one-time costs' which totalled Pounds 2.3m. These included Pounds 1.6m
on redundancies and a Pounds 700,000 loss on foreign exchange transactions.
Gearing increased from 2 per cent to 8.4 per cent following the Pounds 47.3m
acquisition of Savage Group, the UK manufacturer of home improvement
products.
Savage contributed Pounds 1.2m to pre-interest profits in the 10 weeks
following its acquisition.
McKechnie also purchased Accord Industries, the New Zealand machine
retailer, for Pounds 1.3m and, since the year-end, Phipps International, the
Australian architectural hardware manufacturer, for Pounds 5m.
Mr Ost said the acquisitions in Australasia reflected the group's
determination to exploit markets in the Pacific Rim, where pre-interest
profits increased 46 per cent to Pounds 7.3m.
Although borrowings increased to cover these acquisitions, gearing was low
enough to enable the group to consider further purchases, he added. 'We're
in a position to make both large and small buys.'
Earnings per share advanced from 19.7p to 21.4p. An unchanged final dividend
of 9.75p maintains the total at 14.75p.
COMMENT
By focusing on its core activities McKechnie has managed to come through the
UK recession, but adverse trading conditions - especially in plastics -
means it is still having to squeeze margins and costs. It is looking at new
acquisitions in Europe but is unlikely to proceed before the end of 1994.
Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 31m next year put the shares, down 13p at
432p, on a multiple of 17.7. Although the strong balance sheet and low
gearing makes them a safe investment, the company's strategy envisages only
slow organic growth rather than a swift upturn in profitability.

FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Govett Oriental assets up 30%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STRONG performance of Far Eastern stock markets helped Govett Oriental
Investment Trust to increase net assets per share by 30 per cent over the
six months to September 30.
At 341.01p per share the net asset value was 83 per cent higher than the
186.3p of a year earlier.
The result makes it the best performing investment trust in its sector of
Far East, including Japan, over the year to October 1, based on mid-market
to mid-market valuations with net income reinvested, according to Micropal.
Mr Charles Fowler, who manages the trust, said the geographical split of
assets at the end of September was Japan (25 per cent), Malaysia (13.3),
Singapore (12.6), Hong Kong (12.5), Korea (9), Indonesia (5.7), Taiwan
(4.6), Thailand (4.4), Australia (3.8), UK (3.3), Philippines (3.1), India
(1.0) and others (3.5).
The trust's performance during the year benefited from the high weightings
in Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, accordingly to Mr Fowler, although he
has gradually reduced his holdings in those countries in the wake of the
rapid rise in share prices.
Total net assets at the end of September were Pounds 612.7m, making Govett
Oriental one of the UK's largest investment trusts.
Revenue attributable to shareholders in the six months to the end of
September was Pounds 1.81m, against Pounds 1.77m, equivalent to earnings per
share of 1p (0.98p).
The interim dividend is maintained at 0.4p.

FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Henry Boot bucks trend in building with
Pounds 2.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HENRY BOOT, the Sheffield-based construction and property company, continued
to defy its debilitated sector by lifting pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.21m
to Pounds 2.35m for the six months to June 30.
The shares, which have outperformed the construction sector since late 1989,
eased 1p to 269p, continuing a decline from their May peak of 283p.
Earnings per share climbed to 6.3p (5.7p). The board declared an interim
dividend of 1.7p (1.6p) on the strength of results so far, but said it saw
little evidence of recovery.
Mr Jamie Boot, managing director, warned the government not to cut public
spending in next month's budget: 'It is crucial for the industry not to
suffer a reduction in public expenditure on the infrastructure as the
private sector is still very uncertain.'
Turnover rose to Pounds 64.7m (Pounds 51.1m), reflecting improved volumes in
construction and housebuilding operations.
Pre-tax margins fell to 3.63 per cent (4.32 per cent). Mr Boot said the
increase in turnover had not been matched by price rises. Lower interest
rates meant a reduced return on cash balances of Pounds 14.5m (Pounds
11.4m). This had been offset by improved trading profits.
Mr Boot said housebuilding reservations and completions were up on the
previous half year and would remain buoyant in the full 12 months.
Civil engineering volumes were up by about 20 per cent on the previous half
year and would finish ahead of the previous full year in spite of an
expected weaker second half.

FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: African side gives boost to Paterson
Zochonis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PATERSON Zochonis, the detergents and Cussons soap manufacturer, announced a
7 per cent increase in annual profits, from Pounds 26.7m to Pounds 28.6m
pre-tax, helped by a strong contribution from Africa and a Pounds 3m
increase in investment income.
Mr Alan Whittaker, finance director, said strong advances in most of the
group's international businesses had helped to offset a decline in Greece.
Sales for the group as a whole were 3 per cent higher at Pounds 233.4m,
against Pounds 227.3m.
At the operating level, Paterson showed a 24 per cent fall to Pounds 12.3m
for the year to May 31. However, 1992's figures had been flattered by a
Pounds 7.3m debt repayment from the Nigerian government, leaving the
underlying 1993 operating profits ahead 39 per cent.
Mr Whittaker said the African businesses had benefited from a stable
Nigerian currency and higher sales. Profits from associated companies,
mainly in Nigeria, more than doubled from Pounds 2.7m to Pounds 5.6m.
The UK exporting business benefited from higher sales to the Middle East and
eastern Europe. In Greece, bumper olive harvests hit olive oil prices,
leaving that business with lower profits.
During the year, Paterson also made its first acquisition in three years
with the Pounds 3.2m purchase of a recently-privatised Polish detergents
manufacturer.
This business, with estimated annual turnover of some Pounds 20m and an 8
per cent share of the Polish powder detergents market, had contributed a
small profit for the two months it was included. The group expected to
double capacity over three years with a Pounds 4.75m investment programme.
Mr Whittaker said the acquisition had 'whetted our appetite for more in
eastern Europe'. Paterson has a hefty war chest, with investments in
equities and currencies totalling Pounds 167.1m and a further Pounds 2.4m in
cash. The buoyant stock market helped investment income rise by Pounds 3.1m
to Pounds 16.4m.
The final dividend is increased to 10.25p for a total of 12.6p (11.45p).
Earnings were ahead 6 per cent at 35.83p (33.79p).

FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: BM Group agrees to amend accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BM GROUP, the construction equipment combine which over-stretched itself
through acquisition, yesterday agreed to amend its accounts under pressure
from the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounts watchdog.
The company incorrectly classified several items in its cash flow statement,
and incorrectly described elements within exceptional profits shown for the
year to June 30 1992.
It will not be required to re-issue last year's accounts, but will show
amended figures in its 1993 accounts.
In exchange, the panel has agreed to take no further action.
Mr Howard Sutton, chief executive, said: 'There was a very fine dividing
line between what we did and what the panel wanted. Everything was basically
disclosed.'
He admitted that the company had made an 'error' in interpreting FRS 1, the
financial reporting standard on the cash flow statement.
It showed bank loans - including those repayable in more than five years'
time - as 'cash and cash equivalents', when FRS 1 says 'cash' must be liquid
assets realisable within three months.
BM also showed as an exceptional item profits less goodwill on the sale of
companies to BB &amp; EA, which was acquired during the year, and some of the
shares in which were then placed on the market. The panel said these
proceeds were misdescribed.
The accounts received an unqualified opinion from Kingston Smith, the
auditor. Total audit fees - including those paid to subsidiary auditors -
were Pounds 725,000, plus Pounds 540,000 in non-audit work by the auditors.
Kingston Smith has since been replaced as auditor to the group by Price
Waterhouse, which Mr Sutton said was considered by the board to be 'in the
best interests of shareholders' in view of the international growth of the
company.

FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: One word which shook a bank - Andrew Jack
and John Gapper consider Samuel Montagu's damages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT COULD prove the most expensive single word answer ever given in corporate
history. It may cost Samuel Montagu more than Pounds 180m, and was yesterday
sounding alarms at other merchant banks in the City of London.
In August 1987, Mr Ian McIntosh, then Montagu's head of corporate finance,
attended a meeting of about 30 people at the offices of Slaughter &amp; May, the
law firm representing British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings, the financial
services group.
B&amp;C wanted a reassurance from Montagu that its client had the money to
complete a purchase. Mr McIntosh was asked and replied, simply: 'Yes.'
The client was Quadrex, a Delaware corporation controlled by Mr Gary Klesch.
It was threatening to make a rival bid for Mercantile House Holdings.
Quadrex would hold back if B&amp;C agreed to sell it Mercantile's wholesale
broking division after the acquisition. B&amp;C, in turn, needed the proceeds
from the sale of Quadrex to allow its Mercantile bid to go ahead.
Mr McIntosh was asked to give his assurance after Quadrex said there was no
time to prepare full documentation, which would require a meeting of its
credit committees.
But after the acquisition, Quadrex failed to provide the cash. That
ultimately helped drive B&amp;C into administration in 1990 with debts of Pounds
1bn.
On Monday Montague was ordered to pay damages of Pounds 172m to B&amp;C's
creditors with further payments possible.
Mr John Gunn, then head of B&amp;C and now with Midland and Scottish, yesterday
recalled the meeting that began five years of litigation. 'From my lawyers I
believed that an oral statement was as good as a written contract.'
Mr Gunn is unrepentant about relying on that single word of assurance. 'You
don't need to see a loan document. A merchant bank earns its money by
putting its reputation at the beck and call of the client,' he said.
Opinion was divided yesterday over whether the judgment would make bankers
more circumspect.
One corporate financier said it would make him far more cautious about
signing 'highly confident' letters in which merchant banks gave assurances
that their clients were able to lay hands on funds for mergers and
acquisitions.
'I signed one of those letters last week, but if you put it in front of me
today I would not do the same thing,' he said. This was because he believed
the judgment did not take full account of what Mr McIntosh meant by his
reply.
He argued that an assurance that a client has funds usually means there is a
credit facility in place from banks. However, such credit facilities will
usually contain provisions that mean that they can be withdrawn in some
circumstances.
'If you tell the man in the street, funds are available, he understands that
there is a pile of cash next door. But when a corporate financier says it,
it does not mean quite the same. Most people in the City know that,' he
said.
However, other bankers argued that they would be wary about making such an
unqualified verbal assurance as Mr McIntosh in a minuted meeting. It would
be more common to sign a letter with a number of disclaimers and conditions.
'With a letter like that, you hedge it around with such a lot of conditions
that you are protected, quite frankly. There tend to be clauses about
current market conditions, and so on,' said one corporate financier.
The 'highly confident' letter, pioneered by Drexel Burnham Lambert, the
failed US investment bank, in the US during the 1980s takeover boom, is one
case of an assurance given by a merchant bank in order to allow a
transaction.
Another UK example is the requirement of the Takeover Panel that a
compulsory takeover offer must carry a merchant bank assurance. In cases of
public takeovers, the bank is protected if it has carried out inquiries
diligently in good faith.
The most notable case in which a merchant bank has come to grief over an
assurance was that involving Kleinwort Benson and the 1985 purchase of House
of Fraser, the stores group, by the Fayed brothers, who were Kleinwort's
client.
Kleinwort was subsequently criticised by Department of Trade and Industry
inspectors for allowing statements in its name that the Fayeds had
sufficient funds to finance the offer, without taking adequate steps to
verify the truth.
Most corporate financiers believe that the House of Fraser case, along with
a general tightening of the regulatory regime, has already made them careful
about giving assurances. The Samuel Montagu judgment will only mark a
further push towards caution.
'I suppose it will make some sloppy operators tighten up a bit,' said one,
'But it is bog standard to be asked to give this sort of assurance. Not many
people will give them without being positive that they are telling the
truth.'

FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Canadian Pizza Pounds 30m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN Pizza, the Salford-based maker of pizza bases which is coming to
the market this month, is likely to be valued at Pounds 30m, according to
its pathfinder prospectus - Pounds 10m less than the company estimated last
month.
Canadian Pizza, which forecast pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 3.15m
(Pounds 2.21m) for 1993, said the Pounds 10m had originally been earmarked
to build a factory in France: 'At that stage our view was that we would
raise the money on the market place.
'Having done projections and cash flows, we have decided that we are cash
generative, we are going to start off in an ungeared position and we will
borrow at that particular time. So we have greatly reduced the amount of
money we plan to raise', said Mr Reg Bolton, finance director.
Some of the shares, due to be priced on November 3, are likely to be placed
with institutions with the remainder placed subject to claw back in an open
offer.
The last date for applications will be November 10.
Canadian Pizza said the flotation, sponsored by Robert Fleming with Hoare
Govett as brokers, offered an exit to venture capital backers, Murray
Johnstone, 3i and ECI Ventures, who supported the company in a Pounds 15.5m
management buy-out from its founder shareholders in May last year.

FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: CentreGold valued at Pounds 50m on 125p
pricing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN CentreGold, which is coming to market through a placing and
intermediaries offer later this month, were priced at 125p yesterday valuing
the publisher and distributor of video games and computer entertainment
software at Pounds 50.3m.
The Birmingham-based group was founded 10 years ago by Mr Geoff Brown, a
former teacher who is now its chief executive.
CentreGold has grown rapidly, fuelled by booming sales of home entertainment
software for Sega and Nintendo video games machines and personal computers.
Of the 20.6m ordinary 1p shares on offer, 12m are placed firm and another
8.59m are being placed subject to a clawback by intermediaries. Ten per cent
of the shares placed subject to clawback are being made available to
directors and employees.
The shares on offer, representing 51.2 per cent of the enlarged issued
capital, comprise 11m existing shares and 9.6m new shares. Mr Brown is
selling 3.95m shares but will retain a 35 per cent stake in the group
following the flotation.
The new shares will raise an estimated Pounds 11.2m net for the company of
which Pounds 600,000 will be used to redeem loan stock.
The balance will provide additional working capital to support ongoing
development and enable the group to take advantage of new opportunities.
For the year to July 31 CentreGold achieved a 60 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.72m (Pounds 1.7m) on turnover ahead 23 per cent
to Pounds 68m (Pounds 55.1m). Earnings per share were 5.53p and the notional
dividend was 2p.
The historic p/e multiple at the offer price is 22.2 and the notional gross
dividend is 2 per cent. Dealings in the shares begin on October 28.

Haemocell, the maker of medical equipment, said yesterday it can now move
'towards new distribution arrangements' in the US following the termination
of an exclusive marketing agreement with Stryker Corp, the medical products
company.
The company said all 'outstanding issues relating to the termination' of the
Stryker agreement, announced in August, had been resolved.
Mr David Wathen, chief executive, said he could not comment on the cost of
unwinding the Stryker agreement as the Haemocell was in its close period.
'Suffice it to say we are very, very happy with the arrangements in place',
he said.
Haemocell dropped the exclusive arrangement with Stryker in August after
sales targets were not met, Mr Trevor Wilson, operations director, said at
the time.

FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Placing values Cantab at lower end of range
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cantab Pharmaceuticals, the bio-technology group, said yesterday that the
placing which will bring it to the London market was fully subscribed at
460p and had raised Pounds 13.8m for the company.
The pricing was dictated by the price prevailing for the shares already
quoted on New York's Nasdaq exchange where the shares were listed in 1992.
The placing values Cantab at Pounds 45.3m, towards the bottom of the range
that the company had been seeking.
Mr Paul Haycock, chief executive, said he was pleased with the placing.
Together with Pounds 7m of net cash already in the company Cantab could now
fund at least two years of development, the upgrading of facilities and
working capital.
Cantab is some way from producing a marketable product but is closest with a
drug called LM-CD45, designed to reduce the incidence of rejection in kidney
transplant operations.
Last year, when Cantab came to the US market, it issued 1m shares at Dollars
10.

FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Recent drug launches help SB advance 9% -
Strong performance from clinical laboratories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITHKLINE Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare company, reported pre-tax
profits for its third quarter to September 30 up 9 per cent from Pounds 267m
to Pounds 291m.
The results were helped by currencies, a strong performance from the
clinical laboratories operations and recently-launched pharmaceuticals.
Group sales were up 16 per cent, from Pounds 1.28bn to Pounds 1.48bn,
including Pounds 11m (Pounds 61m) from discontinued activities. Operating
profits improved from Pounds 270m to Pounds 280m, including Pounds 3m
(Pounds 16m) from discontinued activities. Profits on continuing activities
rose 9 per cent.
At comparable exchange rates, sales and trading profit increased 6 per cent
and 7 per cent respectively.
Turnover at clinical laboratories increased 39 per cent from Pounds 144m to
Pounds 200m, while operating profits rose from Pounds 17m to Pounds 20m. At
constant exchange rates, they rose 15 per cent and 18 per cent.
Pharmaceuticals division trading profit rose 11 per cent from Pounds 171m to
Pounds 189m on sales of Pounds 821m (Pounds 709m). Excluding currencies,
operating profits improved 8 per cent on sales up 2 per cent.
US turnover improved 1 per cent while European sales were up 3 per cent.
German sales grew 1 per cent thanks to a strong performance from antibiotics
in the former East Germany and in spite of healthcare reforms. Italian sales
fell 21 per cent, although the overall market dropped only 7 per cent.
Mr Robert Bauman, chief executive, declined to detail his strategy for
defending Tagamet, the ulcer treatment on which US patents expire next May.
American sales represent about two thirds of Tagamet revenues, which were
Pounds 614m last year. During the third quarter this year they were up 2 per
cent, although this was due mostly to a US price increase in September.
The group was still discussing with the US Food and Drug Administration its
possible status as a non-prescription product to be sold over the counter at
chemists, said Mr Bauman. He added it remained unclear whether further data
or clinical trials would be necessary.
Mr Bauman explained the group would differentiate OTC Tagamet from its Tums
brand, which now has 46.8 per cent of the US antacid market. 'Tagamet will
be the first antacid with proven clinical efficacy. Tums will be targeted at
the mild end of the market. There may be some cannibalisation, but we will
do our best to minimise it,' he said.
The animal health division benefited from restructuring and sales improved
19 per cent from Pounds 85m to Pounds 101m. Excluding currencies, turnover
was up 4 per cent and trading profit 6 per cent at Pounds 17m (Pounds 14m).
Sales of continuing operations at the consumer brands division rose from
Pounds 277m to Pounds 342m, while trading profits fell from Pounds 52m to
Pounds 51m. Excluding currencies, sales were up 11 per cent. Operating
profits dropped 2 per cent because of increased advertising and promotional
support and restructuring costs.
Earnings per share rose to 7.5p and 11.3 cents per equity unit. A third
quarter dividend was declared of 2.533p per share, 4.718 cents per equity
unit and 23.59 cents per equity unit ADR.

FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Independent Insurance to raise Pounds 25m
through listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT Insurance, the general insurer which announced its intention to
float last month, yesterday issued its pathfinder prospectus.
The company, the first insurer to seek a listing for at least 30 years, is
aiming to raise Pounds 25m in fresh capital.
Mr Michael Bright, chief executive, said the listing would help the group
develop its profile among brokers, as well as providing it with cash to
allow it to continue expansion.
Apart from motor insurance, where Mr Bright identified a growth in
competitive pressure, prospects in most markets were good.
A prospectus will be issued on November 10. An offer for intermediaries
closes on November 16 and dealings in the shares are expected to begin on
November 22. The issue will be underwritten by Lazard Brothers and Noble
Group.
The group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.1m for the first eight months
of 1993. The result was struck after a Pounds 5.2m provision for a Lloyd's
stop loss policy. Net assets amounted to Pounds 59m, compared to Pounds
49.8m at the end of 1992.
The group reaffirmed its intention to recommend a final dividend for the
year of not less than 4.75p, making an 8.25p total.
The pathfinder includes a letter from Watsons, the actuaries, reviewing its
assessment of the company's reserves. The review concludes that the
technical reserves are 'soundly based in that, overall, they exceed our
projection of the corresponding liability (net of reinsurance) based on past
and current trends.'
Indications are that only a small number of existing shareholders will sell
their shares.
A further reflection of confidence is that the company's existing management
and staff will be buying extra shares, increasing their interest to an
estimated 10 per cent of the company.
Fenchurch Group, the insurance broker which expects to seek a stock market
flotation before the end of the year, yesterday announced the demerger of
its Lloyd's underwriting agency business. Underlining the change, the name
of Fenchurch Underwriting Agencies will be changed to Minories Underwriting
Agencies.

FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Substantial premium at Virtuality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST day's trading of shares in Virtuality Group excited the City, with
the price hitting 315p at one point, a substantial premium to the placing
price of 170p.
The shares finished the session at 289p.
The price of the flotation, which placed 7.43m shares to raise Pounds 9.45m
for new product development, gave a market valuation of Pounds 44.4m for the
company, which designs and produces virtual reality computer software and
equipment.
But the group ended the day with a much higher valuation of Pounds 75.7m.
Mr Jon Waldern, managing director and founder, owns 10.4 per cent of the
shares.
Analysts attributed the heavy trading in the shares - a total volume of 5.7m
shares was traded - to several factors.
One was that the placing was with some 80 institutions, and that a number of
them decided to take quick profits.
Another was the considerable amount of interest generated by a strong public
relations campaign; about half of the shares on offer yesterday ended up in
individual rather than institutional hands.
The interest was even more surprising considering that Virtuality has made
it clear it does not intend paying dividends in the medium term, preferring
to plough profits back into more research and development.
Motorola and IBM Europe have taken stakes of 3.8 per cent and 2.2 per cent
respectively. Apax Partners, the venture capital company, has a 50.9 per
cent stake.
Virtuality, previously known as W Industries, had turnover of Pounds 5.24m
last year, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 217,000 and earnings per share of
1.1p.
Virtuality's flotation is one of a number planned for October and November,
including Badgerline, the bus company, Gartmore, the fund manager, and the
BSM driving instruction group.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
HAMMERSON, the inter-national property investment company which is in the
hands of new management, yesterday revealed terms of its offer to reform its
two-tier voting structure.
Proposals for the equalisation of votes between the ordinary shares and the
limited voting A ordinary shares include the provision to existing ordinary
shareholders of 2 new shares for every 19 held to compensate for the
elimination of their superior voting rights.
The compensatory scrip will result in the allotment of 5.6m new shares,
representing about 2.23 per cent of the enlarged share capital.
The proposals, which were foreshadowed by the group when it launched its
Pounds 200m rights issue in May and which are subject to shareholders'
approval at a meeting on November 11, were immediately welcomed in the City.
Standard Life, which is a large holder of both classes of stock and was
consulted over the proposals, said it considered the terms 'quite
acceptable' and expressed the hope that other shareholders would also find
them attractive. Like many other institutional investors, Standard Life is
strongly in favour in the principle of enfranchisement.
Hammerson's ordinary shares closed 14p higher at 413p while the A shares
gained 5p to close at 374p.
Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith, chairman, said the enfranchisement proposals
were designed to bring the company's share structure into line with most
other listed companies. 'As a result, the marketability and appeal of the
company's shares should increase to the benefit of all shareholders,' he
said.
Hammerson pointed out that in setting the terms of the compensatory scrip
issue it had taken into account the market price of the two classes of
shares. Over the past 12 months the premium commanded by the ordinary shares
over the A shares had ranged from 4.7 per cent to 11.3 per cent and was 8.1
per cent on Monday.
The proposals are among a package of measures introduced since Mr Ronald
Spinney joined the group as chief executive in May.

FT  20 OCT 93 / ICL launches an advanced system to tackle IBM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICL, owned by Fujitsu of Japan but based in the UK, will today launch an
advanced computer system based on technology developed in Europe and paid
for by the European Community's principal information technology research
programme.
The system, a parallel processor called Goldrush, is one of the first
examples of the commercial exploitation of research carried out under the UK
Alvey initiative, which absorbed Pounds 350m of public funds between 1983
and 1989, and the European Community's Esprit initiative, part of the EC's
Framework programme budgeted at Ecu2.2bn a year.
Parallel processing, where many small computers work together, will
eventually replace conventional data processing methods, experts believe.
Goldrush is designed to process thousands of transactions a second as part
of a larger computer network. It will enable ICL to bid for data processing
contracts for airlines and banks, which have traditionally been won by IBM.
The Goldrush machines will cost from Pounds 750,000 to Pounds 10m.
A small Goldrush system is being tested at the Department of Social
Security, to see whether it can be used to draw together disparate
information held on separate files about claimants.
Alvey and Esprit were started in response to fears that Europe was lagging
the US and Japan in high technology. Designed to boost pan-European
collaboration in basic - or 'pre-competitive' - research, they have been
criticised for absorbing large sums of money while generating little of
commercial value.
The research on which Goldrush is based was carried out by ICL in
collaboration with Groupe Bull of France and Siemens of Germany before the
British company was acquired by Fujitsu in 1990. Neither Bull nor Siemens
have taken up their rights to the research. ICL has spent about Pounds 42m
to develop parallel processing to the point of a commercial offering.
Competitors include Tandem Computers and International Business Machines,
both of the US.
Mr Peter Bonfield, ICL chairman and chief executive, said yesterday that
Fujitsu would not have free access to the Goldrush technology. He hoped that
the computer could be sold to other manufacturers, including Fujitsu, to be
marketed as part of their own product range.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Gilts rally on auction gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England's announcement yesterday that there would be no gilt
auction in November triggered a sharp rally in the government bond market,
as dealers speculated that October's auction may be the last this year.
The December long gilt future reached a new contract high of 114 13/16 ,
closing  1/32 lower but still up more than half a point on the day.
The record size of the October auction, slated at Pounds 3.5bn, and the
government's well advanced funding programme sparked some speculation that
the Bank might also cancel the December auction.
The Bank said that no gilt auction would be held next month because it would
be too close to the Budget on on November 30.
'I can't help feeling the Budget was used rather as an excuse to cancel the
auction,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist with SG Warburg Securities.
The Treasury is well ahead in its funding and market participants estimate
that, including next week's auction, the Bank will have financed some Pounds
40bn of the projected Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement.
Moreover, many analysts expect the PSBR to come in lower than forecast, at
Pounds 45bn-47bn.
If an auction is held in December - and the bank is keeping its options open
 -it could be held earlier than the traditional last Wednesday of the month,
which would be in the middle of the holiday season. 'They could easily hold
an auction in the first half of the month,' said Mr Chris Anthony, gilts
analyst with UBS.
But some traders said that the Bank might be reluctant to hold an auction
mid-month, when market conditions can be volatile amid the regular raft of
monthly data releases.
But even if there were no more auctions until January, 'that doesn't stop
them from selling taps in the meantime,' said Brian Plaistow, head of gilts
trading at Nomura International.
'They could do as much funding through tap sales as if they were holding an
auction,' said another dealer. If the Budget was well received by the gilts
market, the Bank could make substantial tap sales with relative ease.
This year's bull run in the gilts market has facilitated the funding of the
UK's growing PSBR. The yield on the 10-year benchmark gilt has fallen
sharply to 6.78 per cent from 8.15 per cent in January.
The bonds to be sold at this month's auction will carry a 6 per cent coupon
and mature on August 10 1999.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Philip Morris falls 25% as cigarette price war takes toll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CIGARETTE price war raging in the US took its toll on Philip Morris, the
world's biggest cigarette manufacturer, in the third quarter, wiping 25 per
cent off the company's profits.
Net earnings were Dollars 971m compared with Dollars 1.291m in the same
quarter last year. The figures were worse than the market had feared and the
share price fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 52 3/8 .
Philip Morris triggered the price war in April by cutting 20 per cent off
the price of its premium brands - notably Marlboro, its top-selling product,
but also Benson &amp; Hedges, Merit, Parliament and Virginia Slims.
The company was responding to the in-roads made by low-price cigarettes into
its market share, as consumers switched away from famous brands to cheaper
products.
The price cuts produced a fall of 16 per cent in Philip Morris's domestic
tobacco revenues in the third quarter, causing a 53 per cent slump in the
division's operating profits to Dollars 615m.
But the company took consolation from a 1.7 percentage point increase in its
share of the US cigarette market to 25.7 per cent.
Most of the rest of the group performed well. The international tobacco
business showed a 15 per cent rise in operating profits to Dollars 678m,
North American food increased profits by 10 per cent to Dollars 586m, and
the Miller Brewing Company raised its contribution by 71 per cent to Dollars
94m.
International foods, however, saw a 12 per cent fall in operating profits to
Dollars 243m because of adverse currency movements and exceptional gains
from asset sales the previous year.
Group turnover for the quarter rose 1.4 per cent to Dollars 15.2bn, while
net earnings per share fell 23 per cent to Dollars 1.11.
Mr Michael Miles, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Our overall results
indicate that our business strategies are proving effective in very
difficult economic and competitive circumstances.'
The pressure on US cigarette prices seems likely to last and analysts are
gloomy about the prospects of a recovery from this part of the group's
operations.
But Ms Leigh Ferst, analyst at Prudential Securities, said: 'If they can
stop the decline in US cigarette profits, there is growth in the rest of the
business.'

FT  20 OCT 93 / Global bulls graze on familiar pastures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The liquidity-driven global bull market in bonds and equities is still
running strongly, refuelled recently by increased confidence that US
monetary policy is not going to be tightened any time soon, some say not for
another year. Meanwhile, of course, rates are still actually falling in
Japan and Europe.
Classic cyclical influences are at work. As deposit rates come down,
resources are transferred from banks into the securities markets. This is
reinforced by high savings rates because of the low confidence of consumers
in difficult economic conditions, exacerbated by the problems faced by the
personal sectors of several countries in coping with high debt levels
inherited from the 1980s boom. Prices of financial assets are being bid up.
A research note from Kleinwort Benson points out that deposits now account
for just 19 per cent of US household financial assets, down from 26 per cent
in 1985. Mutual funds have risen from 2 per cent to 6 per cent over the same
period, and August net inflows hit a new peak, with Dollars 11.4bn going
into equity funds and Dollars 14.4bn into bond funds. The aggregate net
sales for the year could be over Dollars 250bn at this rate.
An increasing part of these vast capital flows is being directed overseas.
This impetus for the global markets is being reinforced by US pension funds,
which are not revelling in new money flows to anything like the same extent,
but which happen to have embarked on a diversification drive. When 1 per
cent of US pension fund assets moves out of the country, that is Dollars
30bn on the rampage.
In the context of such massive flows of capital, normal bases of stock
market valuation go out of the window. Hong Kong has always been a 'cheap'
market on fundamentals because the risks are high, but these quibbles cannot
survive in the face of tidal waves of foreign capital. The last time it
happened was in 1987, when the Hong Kong market rocketed 51 per cent in five
months before the October crash.
Hence the fears that bubbles are being generated. We know from the 1987
experience how modern financial markets can behave. History will not exactly
repeat itself, but the faintest whisper of a rise in US interest rates is
going to cause a lot of trouble in markets around the world.
The attitude of professional investors is ambivalent. Booming markets
attract business. US mutual funds do not turn money away because it is a bad
time to invest, they eagerly rake it in and keep fully exposed. The risks
can be passed on to the clients.
All the same, one of the lessons learned at the time of the 1987 crash was
of the potential value of tactical asset allocation models, which warn when
the bond and equity markets have got out of line. You might not think that
professional investment managers would need a computer model to tell them
when this has happened, but people can get carried away with bull market
euphoria in a way that microprocessor chips cannot.
Those few that obeyed their TAA models in the summer of 1987 did well. It is
not clear, however, that they will get a similar warning bell in future. The
models they are using are generally quite happy with current yield ratios.
The ratio of the long bond yield to the equity market dividend yield in the
UK, for instance, is about 2, which is very comfortable in terms of the
experience of the past 20 years. But interest rates, inflation and economic
growth are all much lower than they were in the 1970s and 1980s. We need a
model tailored to the 1990s.
If the models cannot be trusted we are thrown back on traditional warning
signs of an imminent stock market peak. One of these is that money tends to
move into fringe areas in search of value that no longer exists in the
mainstream. The Hong Kong market has risen by 54 per cent in the last seven
months. Another is that naive private investor money tends to flood in at
the peak. Does this sound at all familiar?
Still another is that bond prices tend to top out several months before
equities, although there is some evidence that the time lags have tended to
shorten. Last Friday's new low for the US Treasury long bond yield was
reassuring, but we must keep watching closely.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Wolseley tops forecasts with Pounds 121m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of Wolseley rose 18p to 692p yesterday as the rapidly
expanding building materials group again confounded forecasters with higher
than expected profits for the year to July 31.
Pre-tax profits rose by a third from Pounds 91.3m to Pounds 121.1m. Analysts
had pencilled in a figure between Pounds 110m and Pounds 115m.
Mr Jeremy Lancaster, chairman and managing director, said recession had
eased on the US east coast and, more recently, in the UK.
The latest figures included 'surprisingly encouraging first-time results'
from Enertech, the Swedish oil and gas burner manufacturer acquired for
Pounds 45m in April, which made a trading contribution of Pounds 2.6m.
Other acquisitions made during the year contributed Pounds 1.1m. A currency
benefit added Pounds 5.5m, up from Pounds 700,000.
The group had also reduced costs, although Mr Lancaster gave no details. 'We
have run this business lean and mean for 30 years, and we just run it lean
and mean all the time,' he said.
Turnover increased by 27 per cent from Pounds 1.95bn to Pounds 2.5bn,
including Pounds 69.4m from acquisitions. Of the total, Pounds 1bn derived
from building distribution in Europe; Pounds 1.2bn from building
distribution in the US and Pounds 278.5m from European manufacturing and
other activities.
Mr Lancaster described the UK recovery as 'patchy'. Sales of building
materials had been reviving slowly, although there was no sign of an upturn
on the manufacturing side. Hire businesses, however, had returned to
profitability.
Brossette, the French plumbing supplier acquired in February last year,
contributed Pounds 21m to profits on turnover of Pounds 433m. Mr Lancaster
said it had demonstrated aggressive marketing and tight cost controls. The
worst of the French recession was thought to be past.
In the US, Carolina Builders was the star performer, with a 25 per cent rise
in sales and doubled profits. California remained the black spot.
Year-end net debt amounted to Pounds 62.2m, gearing of 14.7 per cent,
excluding construction loan borrowing.
However, the group said it now had about Pounds 10m cash, helped by a vendor
placing in August when it acquired Erb Lumber for Pounds 51m, making it the
largest US building materials distributor. In addition to raising the funds
for the acquisition, Wolseley placed 8.7m shares raising Pounds 55m.
Mr Lancaster said the group planned a further acquisition. He would not give
details, but was hoping talks would be concluded in the New Year.
Earnings per share rose from 26.27p to 33.6p. A final dividend of 9.75p,
against 9.45p, is proposed, taking the total for the year to 13.3p, up from
12.55p.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Lloyd's Names see little hope in vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of loss-making Names will today seek to adjourn a crucial meeting
called to admit corporate investors to the Lloyd's of London insurance
market.
However, leaders of the lossmakers, who have been collecting proxy votes
from the 31,607 Names eligible to vote tomorrow, are playing down their
chances of success.
'We have no illusion about the outcome, but we need to put on record the
fact that thousands of people feel passionately about this,' said Mr
Christopher Stockwell, chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations Working
Party which links 37 groups of lossmakers.
Lossmakers are taking legal action to recover more than Pounds 2bn in
insurance losses.
A vote in favour of corporate capital by Names, the individuals whose assets
support underwriting at the market, will trigger plans by merchant banks and
securities houses to form more than a dozen investment trusts and companies,
which are seeking to raise more than Pounds 1bn in equity capital for
Lloyd's.
The sponsors of five Lloyd's investment trusts have already issued
pathfinder prospectuses, documents used to market their shares among
potential investors.
Mr Stockwell said the working party was not opposed in principle to
admitting corporate investors but felt outstanding legal issues should be
settled first.
'We need to see the terms of the litigation settlement before we can judge
if the terms for corporate capital are fair. Some action groups wish to
press their belief that Lloyd's has got its priorities wrong again.'
Mr Stockwell said he had received 'unprecedented assurances and personal
commitments' to achieving a satisfactory settlement of litigation from both
Mr David Rowland, chairman of Lloyd's, and Mr Peter Middleton, chief
executive.
Professionals at the market say a vote to adjourn the meeting would be
disastrous for the market's image. 'It would be equivalent to putting a big
sign up over the city saying 'Lloyd's ungovernable - do not touch with a
barge pole',' one insider said.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Welsh Office tightens control of WDA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WELSH Office is to tighten its monitoring of government-funded agencies
in Wales following scathing criticism of the Welsh Development Agency by the
Commons public accounts committee.
The government move came as the development agency took disciplinary action
against three senior executives. The agency's chief executive resigned on
Monday.
Speaking in the Commons, Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, said that
government-funded agencies in Wales had been 'reminded of the need for the
highest standards of probity and fairness in the conduct of public business
and of the requirement to comply with rules and guidance'. His intention was
'to achieve a more strategic and effective style of monitoring'.
Mr Redwood was giving his response to the Commons Public Accounts
Committee's critical report on the WDA which was published in July.
The committee attacked the Welsh Office and the WDA's senior management for
'a catalogue of serious and inexcusable breaches of expected standards of
control and accountability'.
The MPs criticised such matters as the recruitment of a convicted fraudster
as a marketing director and an unauthorised redundancy scheme.
Mr Redwood, who became Welsh secretary in May, said it was clear from an
independent inquiry into the committee's findings that his predecessors,
Lord Walker and Mr David Hunt, were not to blame and 'the primary
responsibility lay at executive level in the WDA'.
Mr Ron Davies, Labour's shadow Welsh secretary, said Mr Redwood had been
'almost contrite' in acknowledging the extent to which the WDA 'ran out of
control'.
Mr David Rowe-Beddoe, chairman of the WDA, said the agency would implement
the recommendations of the inquiry. In addition, he would carry out a review
of the agency's organisation.
Mr Rowe-Beddoe disclosed that Mr Michael Henry, an executive director, had
been dismissed; Mr Ian Rooks, marketing director, had been demoted; and Mr
Alun Daniel, director of rural initiatives, had been reprimanded.

FT  20 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Lonrho
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lonrho-gazers were given plenty to ponder in yesterday's Delphic board-room
manoeuvres. The election of two non-executives at Mr Dieter Bock's
suggestion was balanced by the oddly symmetrical and simultaneous elevation
of two other men, presumably at Mr Tiny Rowland's behest. The compromise
prevents a messy public battle for control which neither Mr Bock nor other
shareholders seem to want and which Mr Rowland would almost certainly have
lost. Perhaps Mr Rowland hopes that the move will preserve his voting
advantage on the board, helping him prevent a shake-out of executive
directors. If so, it was bought at a heavy price. The new non-executive
board members will doubtless wish to continue the reform of Lonrho, so at
best Mr Rowland seems to be fighting a doughty, if forlorn, rearguard
action.
Skirmishing will now move on to detailed areas such as the formation of
audit and remuneration committees and the contentious issue of board
membership. Sparks will probably continue to fly, though given that
institutional investors seem to support Mr Bock's initiatives, he may be
expected to make further progress. Presumably the aim is to tidy up the
company sufficiently for the market to accept a rights issue - which is
probably Lonrho's only way forward. The company is not generating
significant amounts of cash. If it is to grow, disposals are only a limited
option. Higher gearing would only reawaken the fears which Mr Bock's reforms
are designed to quell.

FT  20 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Wolseley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wolseley is a modest company with little to be modest about. Despite
setbacks in California and sticky progress in France, Wolseley still
succeeded in lifting earnings per share by 28 per cent last year. Good stock
control, a strong balance sheet and promising acquisitions leave it well
placed for further growth. Although a 6 per cent dividend increase looks
meagre against earnings growth, its 2.5 times cover should enable the
company to sustain a progressive pay-out policy, which is more than can be
said for many in the building materials sector.
The main irritation, though, concerns Wolseley's recent penchant for issuing
paper. The company has effectively staged a one-for-four rights issue on the
quiet by seeping shares into the market through placings. Even here, though,
it can perhaps be excused. Reasonably enough, Wolseley argues acquisitive
growth should be financed with equity and organic growth with cash. So far,
at least, the new shares have been used to buy earnings-enhancing assets.
Nevertheless, having outperformed the sector by more than 200 per cent since
the start of 1990, Wolseley's shares would appear to have little room for
more. Since it never plumbed the depths in recession, Wolseley's earnings
recovery may also be less striking than that of its more reckless peers.
Building materials stocks are also unlikely to be too frisky ahead of the
Budget. The fear is the Chancellor may bear down heavily on local government
and housing spending.

FT  20 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Had the government really been under funding pressure, it would surely have
proceeded with its auction in November regardless of the Budget. The sale
would have been out of the way almost a week before Budget day. So the
decision not to go ahead probably reflects a large degree of funding
comfort, although the Bank might also have legitimate scruples about
launching a large sale just before a Budget that is widely expected to
include an interest rate cut.
For the time being, it matters little if recovery does not reduce the PSBR
much below the original Treasury forecast of Pounds 50bn. October's auction
will bring gilt sales in the current year to some Pounds 40bn. The
authorities are so far ahead of the actual funding need that they can afford
to take a breather. Once again they are spared the need for a long-dated
issue.
The strength of long-dated gilts probably owes as much to shortage of supply
as to a conviction that inflation is permanently under control. Similarly,
short gilts are buoyed by expectations of lower base rates, which,
incidentally, should ensure the success of this month's auction. The
market's benign mood could change if the chancellor pitches his budget
message wrong. Balancing fiscal tightening with interest rate cuts is no
easy matter when underlying inflation may be pushing on its 4 per cent
ceiling next spring. A test of Mr Clarke's success may be whether the Bank
feels able to slip in another auction between the Budget and Christmas.

FT  20 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: SB's diluted tonic
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SmithKline Beecham has not shared in the rehabilitation of other
pharmaceuticals companies this autumn. While Glaxo and Wellcome have risen
by around 30 per cent from depths reached during the summer, and most US
drugs companies have rallied by a lesser amount, SB has continued to
languish. The company suffered less on the downswing by dint of its broad
spread of business, so some underperformance might be expected. But SB
cannot afford to match the inducement of rapid dividend growth now being
promised by some of its rivals.
True, the company finished the third quarter with net cash for the first
time since the transatlantic merger in 1989. It now faces a direct choice
between accumulating cash, increasing investment or raising the pay-out to
shareholders. With a spread of business ranging from animal health to fizzy
drinks, SB has plenty of opportunities for incremental investment. As long
as the outlook for the pharmaceuticals industry remains clouded, it might
also like the chance to build a Glaxo-style cash cushion against hard times.
If so, dividend growth is unlikely to outstrip earnings by much. Since SB
has only recently finished the cost-cutting associated with its merger,
earnings growth stands squarely on the performance of the prescription drugs
and over-the-counter medicines business. There have been recent
disappointments on both fronts, especially the reluctance of the US
regulator to approve an OTC version of Tagamet, the ulcer drug which loses
US patent protection in May. SB will need to demonstrate all its marketing
flair and muscle if it is to shine through the difficult year ahead.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Taiwan seeks fresh start to BAe joint venture talks: UK team
in effort to salvage regional jet project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DENNIS ENGBARTH and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN Aerospace Corporation is seeking a fresh start to negotiations with
British Aerospace on their troubled and long drawn out efforts to set up a
joint venture to manufacture regional jets.
'Under the structure of the original initialled agreement, there is no way
for the two sides to break through their impasse. The best way would be to
start new talks,' Mr George Liu, senior vice-president and TAC spokesman,
said yesterday.
The Taiwan side will also press its demand for a legal commitment from BAe
to co-develop an advanced two-engine passenger jet when talks between TAC
and Mr John Cahill, BAe chairman, begin today.
Mr Cahill is leading a team of BAe technical and financial specialists
seeking to salvage the joint venture proposal which is an integral part of
the company's overall restructuring and recovery strategy.
Collapse of the Taiwanese joint-venture project could lead to some 3,000 job
losses at BAe's Woodford plant, near Manchester, if the UK group decides it
has no alternative but to halt its regional jet activities.
The company, however, has indicated in recent days it could continue
regional jet activities in the UK even if the Taiwan deal fell through. But
many aerospace industry analysts believe the future of these operations
would be severely compromised if Mr Cahill fails in his effort to revive the
joint-venture proposal.
Mr Cahill's team yesterday made contact with Mr David Howell, chairman of
the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee who also arrived in
Taipei last night.
Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister, is also due to arrive today with a
delegation of UK industrialists.
Mr Cahill and Mr Earle Hou, TAC chairman, are expected to meet today to see
if discussions can be resumed.
Talks last month collapsed after TAC called on BAe to provide a detailed
written commitment to co-develop an advanced two-engine 'RJX' regional
passenger jet, in addition to the existing RJ aircraft based on the BAe 146
four-engine regional airliner. Such a project could entail research and
development costs of about Pounds 1bn.
BAe is also seeking assurances that the TAC board and management will be
strengthened. Mr Denny Ko, who signed the original agreement with BAe,
resigned this month as president. Mr Hou has also indicated he wants to
resign as chairman.
Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs renewed its support for TAC to
continue talks with BAe in a written statement yesterday: 'The government
believes this project will be beneficial in upgrading our aerospace
industry. Therefore, we have provided proper assistance and necessary
support. However, at present, the two sides still have a gap in
understanding and need to continue to seek consensus.'

FT  20 OCT 93 / Personal View: Opting out from the welfare state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DENNIS J. SNOWER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The welfare state is in trouble, in the UK as elsewhere. As the public cost
of pensions, education and health inexorably outpaces tax receipts, the
government is finding it increasingly difficult to honour its commitments to
the elderly, the young, and the ill. And in spite of the rise in welfare
spending, the disparity between rich and poor has widened over the past
decade.
Under the current system of universal benefits large amounts are spent on
people who are already well off. It is widely believed that the only
alternative is to channel welfare state services to the poor through means
tests, taxes on pensions, and the like. This would reduce poor people's
incentive to become self-reliant and erode the middle class's political
support for the welfare state.
There is, however, another alternative, one that reduces the government's
welfare state spending without making the poor or the affluent worse off. It
is my welfare opt-out programme, which gives people the option of
relinquishing their entitlements to certain publicly provided welfare state
services in return for a rebate. The size of the rebate would depend on the
cost of the relinquished entitlements. The average per capita cost would be
computed for different groups of people, depending on their income, age,
sex, marital status, and other determinants of welfare state demands.
This rebate would take the form of a claim against the government amounting
to 70 per cent of the cost of the relinquished entitlements, for each group
of people. Where the cost accrues in the future (such as pensions for people
currently of working age), the claim would take the form of government bonds
with an average maturity commensurate with the costs; where the costs accrue
at present (such as education for people with school-aged children), it
would amount to an immediate tax reduction. Of course, the option would have
to be tied to compulsory insurance against sickness, disability and old age.
That would leave 30 per cent of the funds to cover the 'deadweight loss'
arising because people consuming few services are more likely to choose the
opt-out option. By specifying the characteristics of each opt-out group
sufficiently narrowly, the deadweight loss could be reduced below 30 per
cent of the available funds, leaving a surplus to improve the state-provided
services.
To get a rough indication of how this programme would work, observe that
over the past decade, the government's national insurance spending
(excluding unemployment benefits) was about 8.2 per cent of UK gross
domestic product minus total central government revenue. Thus people who
relinquished their entitlement to publicly provided retirement pensions and
sickness and invalidity benefits would qualify for a rebate amounting to
about 5.7 per cent of their income, on average. By the same calculation,
people who gave up their National Health Service entitlement would get a 5.3
per cent income increase; and those not taking advantage of publicly
provided education would receive a 4.6 per cent rise in income.
Some say that allowing people to leave the welfare state system would turn
it into a poverty programme. But this argument does not apply here. There
would be no incentive for the affluent to opt out while the poor stay in.
Those consuming few welfare state services would receive a small rebate and
thus have a small incentive to opt out. And since the rebate is tied to the
cost of the state-provided services those who opt out would have no
incentive to vote for a run-down of the state sector.
The welfare opt-out programme would give people the right incentive for
choosing between public and private provision of welfare state services. The
people who opt out would be the ones whose particular needs could be met
more adequately through private providers. Given the enormous diversity of
needs and the inevitable standardisation of publicly provided services, it
is inevitable that such people should exist. So the public and private
welfare state systems would exist side by side, each providing services in
which they have a comparative advantage. The resulting competition would
give both an incentive to become more efficient.
Here is a way for the government to reduce its spending without hurting
anyone. The reduction in distortional tax-and-transfer arrangements among
middle class groups should gradually generate enough savings to the
government - through taxes from new private welfare state providers - to
permit improved state provision.

has not been threatened with a rocket for bad performance? In Iraq they do
things differently. When the team lost the first game of this week's Asian
World Cup round-robin qualifier in Qatar 2-3 to North Korea, the cabinet,
chaired by Saddam Hussein's son Uday, immediately sacked the team coaches
and warned four players.
The coaches, said an official statement, would be 'passed to an
investigation commission' - which, coming from the Iraqi government, has an
infinitely more sinister ring than, say, an FA tribunal. Last night the
trembling Iraqis drew 2-2 with South Korea.

Keeping up with the Joneses, continued. For a mere Dollars 45,000 (you
supply the car) you can have your very own 'personal security vehicle'.
The O'Gara-Hess &amp; Eisenhart Armoring Company, an Ohio-based manufacturer of
armoured limousines for VIPs, is offering wraparound lightweight composite
armour and plastic-reinforced glass windows for the man in the street
worried about car robberies and random violence.
The company says its armour will stop bullets from .38 calibre and 9mm
handguns and machine pistols - standard street-gear for your average US
criminal.
Optional add-ons include tyres that keep working when riddled with bullets
and an explosion-proof fuel tank. And the joy of it all is that you do not
need to modify the engine, brakes or suspension because the weight is kept
down by not reinforcing the floor or roof.
Doesn't that leave the driver vulnerable? Not at all: 'You only need do the
roof to stop snipers up high and the floor from blasts underneath. Those
have not been a problem here, yet,' says a spokesman.

Jean-Claude Trichet, governor of the Bank of France, proudly unveiled a new
series of banknotes yesterday, starting with a FFr50 bill. Unsurprisingly,
he had a ready reply to the query that now might seem an undiplomatic moment
to signal such a national, as opposed to European, monetary manoeuvre.
The new notes, needless to say, complement European monetary union, and
reflect 'a convergence' with Dutch and German designs. Indeed, it should all
facilitate the design of an eventual Ecu note, Trichet explained.
The new FFr50 note displays Antoine de Saint-Exupery, the aviator and
writer. It also has no less than four new anti-forgery devices, three of
which incorporate images from the aviator's writings.
'This is our latest move in the endless technological race with
counterfeiters,' Trichet boasted.
If only exchange rate policy were as simple as banknotes. Trichet was also
at pains to point out the mendacity of press suggestions that the French
government is weakening in its determination to keep the franc strong.
But that was an area of forgery over which he ruefully admitted to having no
control.

Pugnacious Gerald Corrigan, who captained the New York Fed through many a
market crisis, is happiest in the thick of things.
So what on earth is he doing emerging chez Goldman Sachs to run 'special
projects', head the bank's group of outside advisers and glad hand important
clients - guaranteeing himself everything, in fact, except proximity to the
epicentre of one of Wall Street's leading investment banks?
The 52-year-old former Fed chief, who will no doubt be more than generously
remunerated, sees his position as 'flexible but highly substantive'.
Does that mean he is being lined up as a future chairman? He laughs off the
suggestion, as does Goldman chairman Stephen Friedman, who is nevertheless
expecting his new recruit to view this as 'home for his career, not a way
station'.
However special the deal, meanwhile, Corrigan does not come in as one of the
fabled general partners, who even in 1991, before Wall Street's current
bonanza started, had a share in profits reckoned to run to Dollars 1.15bn.
Eyeing the long list of partners to which his name will not be appended
Corrigan claims, a trifle unconvincingly, to be 'just a footnote'.

Cost overruns on the World Bank's headquarters building in Washington - some
Dollars 100m above the original Dollars 186m - do not seem to have made the
bank one wit more modest when it comes to doling out advice to third world
governments on how to handle their finances.
Some of the staff seem to be equally challenged in the humility department.
Take Armeane Choksi, vice-president for human resources and development
operations policy who, with his wife, is selling the Chevy Chase home to
move into one they are now having built.
A full-page colour ad in Washingtonian magazine describes in painful detail
the heartbreak involved in moving house.
'She will miss their long private drive, the bright and open floor plan and
the wonderful decks overlooking the majestic trees. He'll remember the
luxurious master suite complete with Jacuzzi, skylight, separate shower, and
circular windows, the grand first floor library with fireplace, and the
impressive entry foyer. They'll both miss the dumb waiter which carries
groceries direct into the kitchen]'
The ad also says that this luxurious dwelling boasts 'walls of glass,
soaring ceilings and enormous room sizes'. What it neglects to point out is
that one of Choksi's chief responsibilities is for the bank's anti-poverty
programme.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Credit card war
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK credit card market is hotting up. Vauxhall's launch yesterday of
credit cards offering discounts on the purchase of its cars and
comparatively low interest rates is the biggest threat so far to a business
traditionally dominated by clearing banks. Vauxhall clearly means to make an
impact. A similar card launched in the US by General Motors, its parent, has
attracted 8m customers in just over a year.
Moreover, Vauxhall is not on its own. Financial services group Save &amp;
Prosper recently introduced a card with an interest rate of 14.6 per cent,
much less than the 23 per cent average. MBNA, a US bank, is planning to base
its European credit card operations in the UK. Other non-financial companies
 -with Ford, General Electric and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph touted as
likely candidates - are expected to follow Vauxhall's lead.
This process promises advantages for both new entrants and consumers. For a
company like Vauxhall, a credit card could be a powerful tool to build brand
loyalty. Users will have an incentive to buy Vauxhall cars rather than those
made by rivals.
For customers, stiffer competition should bring lower interest rates as well
as a wider variety of services. While credit card users have not been badly
served by the clearing banks, there have been complaints. Chief among these
are the introduction of annual credit card fees in the past few years and a
switch to charging interest from the date of the transaction instead of the
date of the statement. To this is added the constant gripe that interest
rates are much higher than base rates.
Consumers themselves are partly to blame for not shopping around more
vigorously. Research shows that most do not know what interest charge they
pay. But banks and building societies are also to blame in that they have
generally failed to differentiate their services, so offering consumers
little opportunity to exercise choice. This in turn largely reflects lack of
initiative.
There is, however, one anti-competitive practice which could usefully be
swept away: Visa and Mastercard, the dominant credit card networks,
generally do not admit non-banks to their club. Vauxhall has avoided this
restriction by using the services of HFC Bank. But this is cumbersome. If
the market is to develop to its full potential, credit card clubs should be
pressed to open their doors.

FT  20 OCT 93 / No tragedy despite dramatics: Tony Jackson explains why,
behind the bribery scandals and strikes, Italian industry is doing rather
well
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Italian industry is bothered about its image these days, and with good
reason. The casual visitor need only switch on the TV or pick up a newspaper
to be confronted by a public relations disaster of the first magnitude: yet
more executive arrests and suicides, yet more Mafia killings, yet more
strikes.
Oddly enough, though, Italian industry is in some ways doing rather well.
This year, Italy is headed for its first trade surplus since the war. In the
first six months, exports were up nearly 20 per cent. The severe domestic
recession means profits are down; but the Italian stock market - for what it
is worth - has been one of Europe's star performers this year.
Part of the paradox is easily explained. Amid the general mayhem of the
corruption scandal which has enveloped business and government, Italian
employers have enjoyed one remarkable piece of luck. For decades, they had
been obliged to raise wage rates in line with inflation - the so-called
scala mobile system. In July of last year, the scala mobile was abolished.
Two months later, Italy left the European exchange rate mechanism and the
lira was devalued by more than 20 per cent.
But it was Italy's membership of the ERM which had caused the scala mobile
to be abolished in the first place. The lethal combination of rising wages
and a fixed currency gave employers the ammunition to demonstrate that the
old system was unsustainable. But just as that burden was removed, so too
was the currency straitjacket. Italian industry is thus enjoying the best of
both worlds.
Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, chief operations officer of Fiat, says: 'Between 1987
and 1991, the cost of labour in Italy went up by 9-10 per cent a year,
nearly twice the rate of France or Germany. Since the lira was not
devaluing, we lost 20 or 30 percentage points of competitiveness in that
period. So we fought against the scala mobile, and we won. Then devaluation
came, and overnight we were back to the economics of 1987. We had regained
all the ground we'd lost.'
The economic situation is thus in one sense surprisingly benign. As befits a
country whose prime minister, Mr Carlo Ciampi, is a former governor of the
central bank, inflation is running at a mere 4.3 per cent, more than a full
percentage point down from a year ago despite devaluation. In the
state-owned industries, wage rises are running at practically zero. How long
this will all last is another matter. As a senior Italian official remarks:
'The level of competitiveness of Italian goods is absolutely exceptional at
present. This is another way of saying the lira is undervalued.'
But there may be broader reasons for not taking the headlines at face value.
Mr Innocenzo Cipoletta, director general of the employers' federation,
Confindustria, says: 'In a Latin country like Italy, changes are always
dramatic. Whenever you change, you are in crisis.'
And, he argues, Italy has been here before. 'In the 1970s, we had inflation
of 20 per cent, huge balance of payments deficits, an IMF loan, a political
crisis and a dramatic rise in terrorism. Nobody would have given a lira for
our chances.' In the event, of course, the 1980s proved a boom time for
Italian capitalism, for which it is only now paying the price.
This argument is part of a wider thesis, which says the Italian economy has
a persistent habit of lagging behind the rest of Europe and then catching up
in bursts. The catch-up phases, such as the late 1960s and most of the
1980s, are euphoric. The economy is now in one of the corresponding
downswings, characterised by deep gloom and - as Mr Cipoletta puts it - the
conviction that Italy is merely the most advanced of the developing
countries.
At the level of individual industries, the process of lag and catch-up is
neatly illustrated by Fiat. Conventional wisdom says that if Europe has one
carmaker too many, Fiat - with its unproductive plant and lacklustre models
 -could well be it. But Fiat's new plant at Melfi, in the lunar landscape of
Basilicata in southern Italy, is startlingly modern. Its layout is
revolutionary, its level of automation extreme. Its claimed productivity -
79 vehicles per worker per year - is very nearly the highest in the world.
Its remote site was chosen partly because the local workforce had no
previous knowledge of the car industry. The oldest man in the plant, the
works director, is just 35.
Italy is catching up in another sense. For many decades, the economy has
been cursed with an enormous and inefficient state-owned industrial sector.
Great chunks of it, from banking to steel, are now to be privatised. The
process is contentious, since privatisation is a potential weapon against
corruption and therefore resisted by the old guard. But it seems unlikely
that Italy can resist the European privatisation vogue: and in any case, the
hugely indebted Italian state badly needs the cash.
This is not to deny that the private sector has a stiff job ahead of it. For
a start, the corruption scandal - known locally as Tangentopoli ('Bribe
Cities') - has done serious harm, even if some industrialists are inclined
to shrug it off. The damage, says Mr Cipoletta, has been enormous. Or
perhaps not, according to a senior colleague at Confindustria, Mr Rosolino
Orlando. 'Companies weren't involved in Tangentopoli,' Mr Orlando says.
'People were. If you want to buy an Italian machine tool or Italian
textiles, you don't think about Tangentopoli. You don't buy images, you buy
products. You buy on price and service.'
Behind this inconsistency is a resentful feeling among many industrialists
that they were in some sense victims of the political system. The
ambivalence is well expressed by Mr Garuzzo of Fiat, who at one point had a
warrant out for his arrest over Fiat's involvement. 'This is a welcome
process,' he says. 'The process of doing business with the state must be
transparent. If the scandals are the price of righting the situation, the
scandals are welcome. But if the scale of it was not known, its existence
was common knowledge. So perhaps we should clean our laundry less publicly.'
Even without the corruption scandal, the image problem remains. Take, for
instance, labour relations. In recent months there has been a recurrence of
that old Italian bugbear, the rail strike. There has also been a
particularly nasty conflict at a state-owned chemical plant at Crotone, in
Italy's deep south.
Employers in the private sector take a predictably hard line on this. 'We
have to pass through a period of strikes over the next year,' says Mr
Cipoletta of Confindustria. 'If not, you can't change anything. You can't
get rid of 50,000 teachers without causing tension in the educational
system. The rail strike going on at present is a good strike.'
As for the Crotone dispute, employers say, this is a typical instance of
managerial incompetence in state-run industries. For northern managers,
there is a further sub-text: Crotone is in the south, so what else can you
expect?
This is a reminder of yet another persistent problem: the regional tensions
within the Italian state. In the wealthy regions of the industrial north,
there is deep resentment over the cost of propping up the impoverished
south. But it is one thing for northern industrialists to argue - as they do
 -that the south should forget industry and concentrate on tourism and
agriculture. It is another to go along with more extreme talk of separatism,
which from a business viewpoint is a prescription for chaos.
Dr Roberto Tronchetti Provera, vice-chairman of the Lombard employers'
federation, based in Milan, says: 'Separatism would solve nothing. Perhaps
we would pay less taxes, but we need the southern market. Our members are
working not just in the European single market but in the domestic market.
We need rules to allow them to operate properly within it.'
But however formidable the list of problems, the case for optimism remains.
None of the issues is new; the point is that they are all being addressed at
once. The process is both painful and humiliating. But one cannot quite
dismiss Dr Tronchetti Provera when he claims: 'Italian companies will come
out of this period much stronger than before. Not in the near future, but in
the medium term, Italy will be a very interesting area.'

FT  20 OCT 93 / Leading Article: The question for Mr Clarke
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST unified Budget, due in November, is also Mr Kenneth Clarke's first
Budget. The chancellor must stamp his mark on economic strategy.
The biggest question he faces is whether further fiscal adjustments are
required, beyond those announced by Mr Norman Lamont last March. The former
chancellor introduced a fiscal 'wedge', which is set to raise Pounds 6.7bn
(1 per cent of gross domestic product) in 1994-95 and Pounds 10.3bn in
1995-96. Even so the public sector borrowing requirement would, according to
the Treasury's forecasts, only decline from 9 per cent of GDP (excluding
privatisation proceeds) this year to the still high level of 4 per cent in
1997-98.
The 'green budget' put forward yesterday by the Institute for Fiscal Studies
in collaboration with Goldman Sachs indicates that further action is
probably needed. Indeed, it notes that on some measures the present fiscal
position is worse than it has been in peacetime: the general government
'primary' deficit - the deficit less net interest - will peak at close to 6
per cent of GDP; the 'real' Budget deficit - the deficit adjusted for
inflation - is higher still; and the ratio of public debt to GDP is set to
double in half a decade.
There are two gleams of light in this otherwise sombre picture: the first is
that the inflation of the 1970s and the fiscal surpluses of the late 1980s
brought the ratio of gross public sector debt to GDP to the exceptionally
low level of 35 per cent in the early 1990s, from over 80 per cent 20 years
before. The second is that the economy is in recovery, which should allow it
several years of above-trend growth.
The authors of the green budget argue that if the economy were to recover at
3 per cent a year, while public spending were to grow at 2 per cent in real
terms (which is what happened at a comparable stage of the last cycle), the
PSBR could fall to 3.6 per cent of GDP by 1997-98. Even this would not be
low enough to stabilise the ratio of public sector debt to GDP, forecast to
be just over 50 per cent at that time, if the inflation rate is also to fall
within the government's target of 1-4 per cent. But the required fiscal
adjustment would be modest, no more than about 1 per cent of GDP.
It would be possible to argue for a higher peak ratio of debt to GDP. But
this would be risky, since the primary surplus ultimately required to
stabilise the ratio of public debt to GDP increases with that ratio whenever
the real interest rate exceeds the real growth of the economy.
The most important objection to doing nothing more is that 3 per cent
economic growth, while possible, is far from certain. If things were to go
wrong, the government could find itself under severe pressure to raise taxes
in the run-up to the next election.
Some argue that further fiscal adjustment would itself delay recovery and so
make the fiscal position still worse in the medium term. That would be a
powerful argument if it were impossible or unwise to use monetary policy to
offset fiscal tightening.
Early action on the fiscal position, offset by monetary loosening, might
even make it easier to sustain the desired rate of growth. The reason for
the deterioration in the fiscal position was the extraordinary tightness of
monetary policy during the period of ERM membership. This needed to be
rebalanced. To an extent, it has been. But the rebalancing may have to go
further if growth is to be sustained without an explosive increase in the
external deficit. A controlled depreciation now, when the economy has plenty
of slack, would be far better than an uncontrollable one later.
Taking no further fiscal action might work out, but only if everything were
to turn out well. Only a foolhardy chancellor would bet on that. The
probability is that a further fiscal adjustment will be required. Politics
suggest the adjustment should come sooner rather than later. Economics
suggest there is no great merit in delay. Mr Clarke should go for higher
taxes and lower interest rates.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Bhutto revisited
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MS BENAZIR BHUTTO'S first term as Pakistan's prime minister from 1988 to
1990 was a catalogue of disasters born of her own inexperience and of
hostility on the part of the country's political and military
establishments. The second chance that began yesterday may therefore not
seem a cause for unalloyed rejoicing. There are, however, reasons to suppose
that this time could be different, and that Pakistan is not quite the same
place that she attempted to rule five years ago.
The first is that the Pakistani elite may have learnt something from the
turmoil the country has just been through. After a year of wrangling between
opposition, government and president, Pakistan this month managed to stage
something like a free and fair general election. Although the result was a
hung parliament, Ms Bhutto's mandate now seems clear enough, thanks to
support from small parties. Her main opponent, Mr Nawaz Sharif, has also
promised to respect the result. The army, which with the then president
brought Ms Bhutto down last time, now seems prepared to play a more neutral
role. And while the danger persists of destabilising constitutional disputes
between the government and the president, who is to be elected separately
next month, all must now be aware that such battles only lead up a blind
alley.
Second, Ms Bhutto herself ought this time to be in a stronger position both
to diagnose her country's political and economic ills and to treat them,
largely thanks to the remarkable interim premiership of her immediate
predecessor, Mr Moeen Qureshi. During barely three months in office, Mr
Qureshi, spurred on by a foreign exchange crisis, set about tackling the
networks of political and financial patronage that lie at the heart of
Pakistan's malaise - vowing to tax the country's farmers, for example, and
empowering state-owned banks to redeem bad loans they had been forced to
make to politicians and powerful businessmen.
The economic emergency persists and Ms Bhutto has promised to continue with
reforms needed to qualify for a three-year programme of International
Monetary Fund loans, as well as to try to end Pakistan's international
isolation. None of this will be easy, least of all in a fragile coalition
government. But at least Ms Bhutto now knows what she has to do, and has a
freer hand than she had before to do it.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Up the pole at the town hall: A review of UK local
government could cost voters money - and the Tories votes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Local government is leading the government back into political trouble, only
months after the death of the poll tax.
This time the issue is local government reorganisation. Plans to streamline
local authorities in England to save on administration costs and improve
accountability threaten to be both costly and unpopular with voters.
Launched enthusiastically two years ago by Mr Michael Heseltine, then
environment secretary, the objective of the independent Local Government
Commission was to do away with the two-tier system of district and county
councils which cover most of England outside the conurbations. Mr Heseltine
thought local government would be cheaper, and easier for voters to
understand, if all local services were provided by a single, all-purpose
unitary authority.
Yet far from saving money, it now appears sweeping reorganisation along
lines envisaged by Mr Heseltine will add to the cost of local government
both in the transition period and afterwards. One estimate is that it could
add Pounds 100 to each council tax bill in the first year of reorganisation,
1996 - within 12 months of the next general election.
The new environment secretary, Mr John Gummer, confronted the issue last
month by announcing the government might accept restructuring plans which
were more expensive than the status quo. He also bolstered the review by
shortening its timetable, and announcing that leaving two tiers intact would
be 'the exception'. He apparently sees single-tier authorities as a cause
worth paying for.
Besides courting trouble with voters, that judgment appalled employers,
worried that they would be asked to foot the bill via business rates. Mr
Howard Davies, director-general of the CBI, told Mr Gummer last week that
'we have always suspected that local government reorganisation could turn
out to be an expensive hobby for the government'. He added: 'This looks to
be an exercise in bureaucratic job creation across the country.'
Worse for the government, Sir John Banham, the former CBI director-general
appointed by Mr Heseltine to chair the Commission, takes a similar view. For
him, the review is an opportunity to save money: if unitary authorities will
not achieve that, he would be happy to retain the status quo.
His misgivings have been strengthened by Mori polls conducted for the
commission in Derbyshire, Durham and Cleveland, the first mainland counties
on which proposals have been published.
These suggest the 'man in the street' has little or no enthusiasm for
reform. In Durham, 54 per cent favoured the status quo. In Derbyshire the
status quo was the single most popular option with 39 per cent. The most
popular unitary option - splitting Derbyshire into two councils - was
favoured by just 11 per cent.
'Artificial' counties created in 1974 - for instance Cleveland and Avon,
which did not conform to historical county borders - may be an exception to
the trend. Mori's Cleveland poll showed only 21 per cent favouring the
status quo, and a conversion into three or four unitary authorities now
seems likely. Big cities lacking their own strategic authority - such as
Bristol, Leicester and Nottingham - can also be expected to muster
enthusiasm.
The polling evidence has led Sir John to doubt the recommendations his
commission has made for new, large single-tier authorities. He believes the
Durham poll shows voters have been 'thoroughly unimpressed' by the unitary
options put to them.
Public opinion was to have driven the commission in its work, as Mr
Heseltine sought to avoid the mistakes of the last reorganisation of local
government in 1974. But it is the government that is ever more enthusiastic
about reform.
Mr David Curry, local government minister, said this week the government
might reject proposals which would protect the status quo. He added: 'If I
wanted the entire reorganisation to be determined by Mori, I would have
asked them to carry it out in the first place.'
Policymakers even have an ideal size in mind for the single-tier
authorities, according to Mr Martin Easteal, chief executive of the
commission. He says the latest guidance from Whitehall suggests ministers
believe the ideal population under a new single tier authority would be
between 150,000 and 250,000.
The stance taken by Mr Gummer and Mr Curry is hard to explain. Mr Gummer
argues it is 'clearer where responsibility lies' if there is a single level
of local government, adding unitary authorities 'can reduce bureacracy and
costs, and improve the co-ordination and quality of services.'
Yet research suggests that it is far from proven that unitary authorities
are cheaper and more accountable. According to Professor John Stewart of the
University of Birmingham's Institute of Local Government Studies, there is
no evidence that the existence of two tiers of local government confuses
people over local authorities' responsibilities. Around 70 per cent of
voters know that education is provided by counties - a figure not far behind
those correctly identifying the prime minister.
Confusion over accountability is serious only for services provided by
appointed government boards, such as hospitals - thought by 50 per cent to
be run by counties, and by 20 per cent to be run by districts.
Professor Stewart points out that three-tier government is the norm in
larger European countries. No EC country other than Luxembourg has unitary
authorities. The extra tier allows the lowest level to be small and thus
highly accountable. While the average English district has a population of
more than 100,000, the largest lowest-level authorities elsewhere in Europe
have populations of 28,000 in Sweden and 17,000 in Denmark.
As for cost, re-organisation seems likely to increase council tax bills.
Ernst &amp; Young, accountants appointed by the commission, have found a marked
'economy of scale'. While councils serving a population of 50,000 or less
needed more than five administrative staff per 1,000 population, only 3.5
were needed for a population of 300,000. Less than three were needed in
councils with a population of more than 1m. Replacing a two-tier system with
small unitary authorities could thus increase total staff costs.
There would also be transitional expenses. The Association of County
Councils estimates that converting each county into three unitary
authorities - roughly the option the government has in mind - would cost
about Pounds 27.2m per county in new town halls, redundancy bills and other
transitional costs. The Department of the Environment has left open the
option that council taxpayers should foot this bill, possibly adding more
than Pounds 100 per head to council tax bills.
Against this background, Mr Major's decision in July to reject a proposal
from the department for authorities to 'opt in' to the review process if
local people were dissatisfied with the status quo looks like a mistake. An
'opt in' process would have allowed a less ambitious review of council
boundaries, much as the Boundary Commission periodically redraws
parliamentary boundaries. Unpopular 'artificial' counties, such as Avon and
Humberside, might then be disbanded, while Yorkshiremen could reclaim their
ridings and Bristol might become a city in full control of all its services.
Areas happy with the two-tier structure could carry on undisturbed.
Mr Major felt a voluntary review would encourage authorities in Wales and
Scotland - where restructuring plans have been imposed without formal
consultation - to resist change; moreover, this would show lack of
confidence in a policy seen as a vote-winner in the last general election.
But the new, accelerated review could lose votes. If the commission finishes
its work by the end of next year, the new councils, with their higher
council tax bills, should come into being in May 1996. The next general
election must be held by April 1997.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: EC research programmes far from
'failed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof ROBIN WHITTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Innovation in Europe' (October 14), reflects the
confusion and short-termism which might be about to panic some governments
out of future funding for EC research and development programmes. You accuse
the EC of having 'squandered' money on 'failed prestige projects such as . .
. the Jessi microchip scheme'; yet you stress evidence on results of the
programmes is 'far from conclusive'.
Large programmes such as Esprit and Jessi and, in the past, the UK's Alvey,
do not 'fail'. Jessi is alive and well, as a quick call to the Jessi office
in Munich, or to the Department of Trade and Industry, would confirm. It has
been restructured and is now producing world-class results, helping some big
European companies to enter into equal-status ventures with US and Japanese
companies at the forefront of microchip technology. Or why not look at
Europe's success in telecommunications and systems, rather than
concentrating on computers and microchips? In any case, success or failure
in these programmes is, as an FT advert might remind us, 'not black and
white'.
The outputs of research and development filter down over a long period of
time. The Alvey programme is scoring technological successes now, five years
since its conclusion, that probably could not have been predicted while the
programme was running, even by the scientists involved. Esprit will
certainly be able to demonstrate similar benefits, the more so because the
EC has put considerable thought into nurturing the take-up of its R&amp;D, for
example through the Value and Essi programmes.
In 1988 there were more than 3,000 scientists and engineers working on
Esprit projects. How can we calculate the potential damage, five years
later, of not having fostered and trained our technology workforce in this
way? Esprit has cost the EC well over Ecu2bn in funding, bringing us on a
par with the US in terms of percentage expenditure on R&amp;D. How can Europe
hope to be taken seriously in information technology without showing such
commitment?
Of course, the individual programmes must be, and are being, continuously
assessed and adjusted in focus and implementation. Things could be made much
easier for small and medium-sized enterprises, for example; perhaps more
money should be spent on running the programmes and less on individual
projects within them. But the vote-losing potential of spending large
amounts of money on our technological future is probably not a very helpful
or enlightening parameter in the equation.

<BYLINE>
   From Mr PHILIP GREENING-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would ask your readers to join me in a little game.
Next time you are waiting in a bank queue, work out the bank's Service Score
(SS). This is calculated by applying the following formula:
CP/CA x CW = SS, where
CP=number of possible cashiers (ie, number of windows),
CA=actual number of cashiers working,
CW=number of customers waiting in the queue.
I would like to start the competition with NatWest Liverpool Fruit Exchange.
At 11.20 on October 15 it scored:
CP=5,
CA=2,
CW=13,
giving a value to SS of 32.5. This will take some beating, but I am
confident that the banks will rise to the challenge.
Perhaps the banking ombudsman could be prevailed upon to donate a small
prize.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Odd comment on ITV cartels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER IBBOTSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his letter of October 13, the director-general of the Incorporated
Society of British Advertisers opposes changes to the ITV ownership rules on
the grounds that 'advertisers do not want to see new cartels and monopolies
develop'. This is an odd observation, since the rules on airtime sales have
for some time past allowed any single sales point to sell up to 25 per cent
of the ITV market. At present, there are five sales points selling ITV, and
there are no proposals to reduce their number.
With respect to his concerns about regional programmes within the 15 licence
areas of ITV, the Independent Television Commission has an effective armoury
of powers to ensure their provision at the level and quality promised in the
application process of 1991. It is our contention that the resources to
sustain regional commitments (and also with growing competition the strength
of the network schedule) will be best ensured by allowing further
rationalisation of the system. Underpinning programme strength must surely
be in the long-term interest of viewers and advertisers alike.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN GOLDIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The estimate of annual gains of at least Dollars 213bn (in 1992
dollars) which will accrue by 2002 from a successful completion of the
Uruguay Round has been discussed in a recent FT editorial ('Endgame in the
Gatt', September 29) and in commentaries by David Dodwell (World Trade News,
September 30), Frances Williams (World Trade News, September 30) and Samuel
Brittan ('Where Gatt's Dollars 200bn really comes from', October 4).
Your readers may be forgiven for finding it difficult to identify the source
of these numbers. The one citation that has been given (September 30) was
erroneous as it referred to an earlier publication I co-authored rather than
the relevant recently released volume.
The book which summarises the results of the four-year modelling
collaboration between the OECD Development Centre and the World Bank is
published jointly by OECD and the World Bank under the title, Trade
Liberalisation: Global Economic Implications, by Ian Goldin, Odin Knudsen
and Dominique van der Mensbrugghe.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Freight ignored in assessing
Eurotunnel's prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BARRY WORTHINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I would like to correct a misconception in the Lex column regarding
Eurotunnel ('Tunnel vision', October 12). As any transport student would
tell you, Eurotunnel is not a glorified fixed-link version of a
roll-on-roll-off ferry, nor is it a short-haul flight.
Half the capacity is dedicated to international rail traffic, yet one does
not hear of this side of the business, only of 'Le Shuttle' - a reflection
on whoever does the marketing for 'Eurostar'.
The important point is that this project will connect the UK with a growing
continental TGV system, and will revolutionise freight handling. No sane
person will change a mode of transport twice when there is a direct and fast
city centre to city centre service. No sane businessman will send goods via
ship in the face of a simpler freight alternative that delivers door-to-door
within 24 hours.
On this basis, the demands upon tunnel capacity will grow, and it is likely
that a second one will be in the planning stage by the turn of the century.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Can-do versus no-do: Europe must act and not just sneer at
US foreign policy failures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Trilateral Commission, 20 years old this year, might plausibly claim to
be the most influential non-governmental, non-profit-making organisation in
the world. It brings together members of the political and business elites
from north America, Europe and Japan. Its former members now in public
service include President Bill Clinton and 20 senior figures in his
administration; Mr Tsutomu Hata, the new Japanese foreign minister; and Mr
Johan Jorgen Holst, the Norwegian foreign minister who played a vital role
in brokering the recent Middle East peace accord. As networks go, that takes
some beating.
The commission's three current chairmen - Count Otto Lambsdorff (former
German economy minister), Mr Paul Volcker (former chairman of the US Federal
Reserve) and Mr Akio Morita (founder of Sony) - are not just names on a
letterhead. All three were present last weekend, and each made a personal
report on the state of the economy in his region, at the commission's
meeting in Barcelona - which was not even the annual plenary meeting, only a
mid-term European regional one.
That meant it was essentially a gathering of the west European elite. (No
central or east Europeans - not even a Greek or Turk.) One session was
devoted to the host country, Spain, and another to the 'Mediterranean
dialogue' between Europe and the Arab world. But the short breakfast meeting
on Russia was, to me, the most revealing - not so much about Russia as about
western Europe. It was not very encouraging.
Mr Sergio Romano, who served as Italian ambassador in Moscow during the
perestroika years, gave a short talk. His main concern was to pour cold
water on the notion that President Boris Yeltsin's recent victory over
parliament should be seen as a victory for either democracy or the market
economy.
There would, he suggested, be 'little democracy in Russia's near future'.
The diarchy of president and parliament would be replaced by 'a diarchy of
centre and periphery'. There might be 'more room for some economic measures
along the lines originally tried by Gaidar (first deputy prime minister)',
but the army would be stronger and 'if Russia is strong the countries of the
Caucasus and central Asia will inevitably rally, as in the past, under
Russian power' - a development which he personally considered 'very
positive'.
In the discussion that followed some details of this analysis were
questioned but the general tone of elegant scepticism, mixed with nostalgia
for the simple certainties of great power politics, was maintained - until
Mr Richard Gardner, newly arrived US ambassador to Spain and one of the very
few non-Europeans in the room, intervened. He alone pointed out that what
happens in Russia is hardly a matter of indifference to the rest of the
world and that, while no one can be sure of success, there are things that
the west can and should be doing about it. In fact, he produced six:
Head off nuclear proliferation, by holding former Soviet republics to, and
helping them implement, their commitments under the strategic arms reduction
treaties. Secure and where necessary decommission unsafe nuclear energy
plants.
Help Russia develop its oil and gas industries.
Give technical assistance, bypassing central government as far as possible,
in the skills a market economy requires.
Set up an 'enterprise fund' to finance privatisation and military conversion
schemes, and help launch joint ventures.
Give 'political technical assistance' with such things as elections, rule of
law and an independent judiciary.
This was back-of-the-envelope stuff, neither definitive nor original. In all
the areas mentioned western efforts are already being made, though perhaps
not enough, and none of them is simple to implement in the chaotic
circumstances now prevailing. Mr Gardner was not claiming to have all the
answers, but his tone was refreshing. Here spoke the representative of a
power which has not given up - which still believes there are things that
need doing in the world, and that something can be done.
Contrast that with the reported remarks of Mr Jacques Delors, president of
the European Commission, who that same day was telling Radio Luxembourg that
the European Community was 'drifting towards a free-trade zone, that is to
say an English-style Europe', which in 15 years would lead to a break-up.
Clearly Euro-pessimism is back with a vengeance, while the US, with a new
administration, is at least trying to identify global problems and propose
solutions to them.
Yet at the same time the remarks made over the weekend by Mr Clinton and his
secretary of state, Warren Christopher, make it clear that the US now has
limited resources, and limited patience, to devote to European problems. The
cold war is over, and European security no longer has the overriding urgency
it once had, either for US policy-makers or, still less, for the US public.
To sneer at the blunders of the Clinton administration, as it feels its way
towards a foreign policy in a new and anarchic world, is easy enough. But it
will not do Europe any good. What Europe needs is a dose of that
much-derided 'can do' spirit that courses through American veins. If west
Europeans would only come together in that spirit, rather than haggling
endlessly over the 'national' interests of producer lobbies, they could
remind themselves that the breakdown of communism is an opportunity and a
challenge, as well as a threat. Who knows, they might even work out a common
strategy for dealing with it.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Arts: Deadly fanaticisms - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Because many Hassidic Jews regard television as impious, they will not have
seen the play that has caused the controversy, Wall of Silence (BBC1,
Sunday).
Comedy writers Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran (both Jewish) set a murder
mystery in the strictly orthodox, mysterious Hassidic community in north
London, which sounded promising and was mysterious enough. But, by the end I
still had no idea how the estate-agent with the gentile wife in Bristol
fitted in, nor how the lady with a fractured skull underneath her
ultra-orthodox wig came to be sitting on a train.
The greater mystery was how such poppycock ever achieved the Screen One
slot. Marks and Gran's comedy background showed in wooden dialogue,
preposterous characters and huge sign-posts to tell viewers what is going to
happen next. The police chief agrees to lend his car to a colleague. 'Have
you seen the way he treats his car, gov?', cautions a minion. Surprise,
surprise: the hero, PC Mullens (Bill Paterson) writes it off in the next
scene.
The story starts when the corpse of a kosher butcher is pulled from a canal
in his Volvo, a swastika daubed on the bonnet. But this is no racial murder,
as PC Mullens realises when he is informed, implausibly late in the day,
that the corpse had been stabbed through the eyes.
Mullins duly expounds more customs of the Hassidim. The butcher must have
been a moyser, or informant, to have been killed by this grisly ritual. On
Radio 4's Sunday programme, orthodox Jews expressed fears (a touch
unrealistic to my mind) that viewers might link eye-stabbing to the ancient
libel about Jews ritually murdering Christian children and incite
antisemitism.
According to The Jewish Chronicle, the upshot was that PC Mullens's spiel
was altered to include the qualifying comments about eye-stabbing being
entirely alien to British Jewry. However, a closer look suggests that this
was a strangely grudging and partial appeasement.
The Encyclopaedia Judaica's discussion of legal penalties for moysers - the
source, I would guess, for Marks and Gran - gives no record of anyone ever
being treated thus, although some European rabbi seems to have favoured
mutilation as a lesser punishment than excommunication.
So why did Gran and Marks get it wrong? It is legitimate to write plays
about Hassidim or any other religious group. But the odder and more alien
the group appears to the rest of society, the more it behoves a playwright
to strive to be accurate.
Assignment: The Price of Gold (BBC 2, Tuesday) spelled out something I
should have known, the vital link between a decade of gold prospecting in
Brazil and the destruction of the rain forest. Julian Pettifer's interesting
report painted a vivid picture of the frontier mentality of Amazon mining
towns.
The gold prospectors are as one would expect - tough, uneducated men who
have little faith that they will make old bones. A bullet, a mining
accident, or malaria will probably get them first. Very low down their list
of anxieties, if anywhere at all, are the long-term health risks of using
mercury.
Mercury is banned, but it is used in large quantities. It is mixed with the
sludge dredged from the river because it bonds to the gold particles. Some
of this mercury is released into the river and a great deal more is burnt
off with blow-lamps. This vapor mixes with ash from burning the forests. The
result is high levels of mercury in the atmosphere above the Amazon and, in
some unspecified circumstances, methyl mercury forming in the rivers. This
deadly substance passes up the food chain and ends up in fish eaten by the
riverside dwellers.
How serious are the health-risks is as yet unclear. Scientists are keener to
analyse satellite data than to brave the Amazon to study its poisoned
inhabitants. However, experts spoke of a 'time-bomb' which will inevitably
go off, even if the gold-prospectors can be persuaded to burn off mercury in
retorts, which is cheaper as well as safe.
Minister for the Amazon and Environment, Mr Rubens Rimpero referred to
levels of metal mercury being higher than those in an industrial accident at
Minemata in Japan. Pettifer reminded us that fish contaminated with methyl
mercury caused 'hundreds' of deaths and led to 'thousands' of children being
born with disabilities. Momentarily, my willingness to follow Mr Pettifer
dipped. The consequences of Minemata must be known with more precision. Why
are documentary-makers so often cavalier with statistics?
The statistics of the Waco siege are clear enough; 84 corpses, 20 of them
children. Anything but clear, as we were reminded by Panorama; Sinful
Messiah (BBC 1, Monday) is whether the FBI were justified in mounting the
assault on the Branch Davidian headquarters. Fresh material given to
Panorama, a taped conversation between cult-leader David Koresh and his
lawyer late in the siege, suggests that Koresh did not want mass-suicide.
Koresh explained that he was delaying until he had finished writing the
revelations of the Twelfth Seal. This the FBI dismissed as mere bluff, so
Koresh's deadline was literally that. However, the first chapters of the
book were found on the word-processor. Which will be the lucky publisher who
lays hands on the Sinful Messiah's final revelations?
Timewatch; A Hidden History (BBC 2, 8.00) told the story of another kind of
deadly fanaticism which led ten Republicans to starve themselves to death in
the Maze Prison hunger strike of 1981. Survivors talked about the
experience, one of them describing the sensation as being like having one's
brain rubbed with a grater.
This well-researched documentary aired allegations that despite the Thatcher
government's claims not to have struck any deal with the Republican
prisoners, negotiations were conducted throughout the strike and concessions
were quietly made after it ended.
The programme's weakness was to have left the attitude of the Catholic
Church so unclear, especially as Maze chaplain Father Dennis Faul played a
prominent part in the drama and was interviewed at some length. What seemed
to emerge was that fasting in protest was permissible - indeed, as I recall,
St Patrick was said to have fasted against an uncooperative king.
However, the hierarchy's attitude to the hunger-strike changed when it was
deemed that the protestors intended to die. Once across this rather fine
line, they would presumably have committed suicide, a mortal sin for
Catholics. If this was indeed the case, the fact that papal emissaries
brought Bobby Sands a golden crucifix before he died needed some
explanation.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Arts: Looking Through a Glass Onion - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a mildly biblical sound to Looking Through a Glass Onion, the new
entertainment at the Criterion. 'Glass Onion' is the name of a song by the
late John Lennon; the looking through bit reminds one of St Paul, darkly.
The sub-title is more accurate: John Lennon in Word and Music.
The show is probably for addicts: to others it may seem a shade dull. Lennon
is not nearly as inspired a musician as his one-time Beatles colleague, Paul
McCartney. Nevertheless, he has a good story to tell. As the Beatles broke
up, he went off with Yoko Ono to do his own thing. Someone else who did
their own thing shot him dead in the street in New York.
I admire the discretion of the production. There are the sounds of a couple
of gun shots at the beginning, but we do not move to the final killing. This
is largely a one-man show, written and performed by John Waters as Lennon.
Waters simply tells the tale and sings the songs. 'We didn't come from
Liverpool,' he says of the early Beatles, 'we were just there.' When they
took off, 'every day was like the world cup final' (which England won when
the Beatles were at their peak).
Lennon admits the musical superiority of McCartney and the first act ends on
'Strawberry Fields' with the group still together. Then Lennon broke away,
Yoko Ono, he claims not even knowing initially who he was. The pair of them
became part of the peace movement of the early 1970s. According to the
Waters version, the Anglo-Saxon press attacked Lennon because Yoko was a
'Nip'.
The second half, however, is mainly songs, with some very effective lighting
by Peter Neufeld and the musical direction and keyboards by Stewart
D'Arietta. It struck me that there was one very clever off-rhyme; 'working
placebo' with 'working class ego', but the linguistic acoustics are not
perfect and I may have misheard it. Yet the piece did remind me of another
off-rhyme, at least in modern English: 'Since 'tis not to be had at home,
He'll travel for a martyrdom.' I've changed the gender, but that's the sort
of thing Glass Onion is meant to be about: from Merseyside to London to the
US. The religious touch in the title is not accidental.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Arts: Christa Ludwig's farewell tour - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The generation of singers that burst on to the stage after the war is
gradually taking its final bow. Earlier this year Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau
retired with unexpected suddenness, leaving probably the last of his
long-serving German contemporaries to continue progress on her own, more
patiently orchestrated tour of farewells.
It is extraordinary to think that Christa Ludwig made her professional debut
as long ago as 1946. Since then she has been at the top of her profession, a
warm, glowing, Germanic mezzo-soprano with power enough to conquer some of
the summits of the operatic repertoire. However ambitious she was,
stretching up to Beethoven's soprano Leonore, embracing Wagnerian heroines,
the voice never suggested she had gone too far.
Farewells have already been said in Salzburg, New York and Paris. A pair of
recitals at the Wigmore Hall and a concert with the Philharmonia next
February constitute her final London appearances. A tear was in the singer's
eye as she finished her encore at the second of the recitals on Monday, but
the evening seemed more a cause for rejoicing that she can still sing so
much so well, some passing problems with intonation apart.
The programme was illustrated with the leaflet advertising her debut recital
in London. That was at the Wigmore Hall in 1957 - interesting to note that
she was already described as 'the great mezzo-soprano', although she had
only recently made her first major recordings. Clearly the word had got
around. Two of the songs that she sang then were in Monday's selection, and
were among her most successful: Mahler's 'Rheinlegendchen' and 'Ich bin der
Welt abhanden gekommen'.
The latter exemplifies the very best of Ludwig. When she sings that she
'rests in a quiet realm', music and singer seem spiritually at one. The
song's expansive, late romantic vocal lines, unfolded as though time is of
no importance, could not be better suited to this voice. The sound, always
at its most beautiful in the lower middle, simply pours out, relaxed, free
from tension, expressive of deep-seated Mahlerian calm.
Part of that is achieved because she does not try to seize upon the words in
the intense style of a Schwarzkopf or Fischer-Dieskau. Ludwig's way has been
simpler and to that extent less memorable in what she has had to say than
they were. But this was not the occasion to complain. By the time Charles
Spencer allowed the final notes of Strauss's 'Morgen' to die away, the
singer's unforced eloquence had unarguably made her case for her - a moving
end to a reign of nearly half a century.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Arts: Tchaikovsky's 'Cherevichki' - Wexford Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If some of us knew anything about this obscure Tchaikovsky opera, it was
probably just that it was called something like 'The Tsarina's Slippers'.
Even that turns out to be wrong: the footgear at stake is elegant travelling
boots. On hearing that Vakula the Smith, whose mother is the sexy old witch
Solokha, needs to get hold of those cherevichki to win the hand of Oksana,
however, ENO regulars can guess that the libretto was drawn from the same
Gogol story as Rimsky-Korsakov's Christmas (Gogol's title). The latter was
premiered ten years later, in 1895.
'Vakula the Smith' was Tchaikovsky's name for his first version (1874); the
new label came with the definitive, much-revised score. That is what
Francesca Zambello has staged for Wexford (in the original language), with
admirable resource, plenty of colour, seven Russian and Ukrainian leads, a
Russian conductor, and what seems to be half of the town's kids as little
demons, wood sprites, village children and court pages. Bruno Schwegl's
designs, wittily economical, conjure up a fine, wintry fairytale nimbus.
Not only Miss Zambello's clever imagination keeps the opera bubbling, but
also Alexander Anissimov's light, confident hand with the music. If
Tchaikovsky's score is less brightly enamelled than Rimsky's, it is also
more developed, more humanly expressive and often earthier too. The comedy
reveals a more sympathetic ear for folk accents - indeed, the composer
rarely sounds as close-to-the-ground Russian as he does here. The visiting
Slav singers make the most of that. Especially in the grossly Gogolian scene
where Solokha is beset by a succession of grizzled lechers: in Rimsky's
opera that is only a cartoon, in Tchaikovsky's a lusty tour-de-force.
Roman Tsymbala's husky hero and Marina Levitt's fresh heroine, lyrical and
wilful; Valentina Cherbinina's ripely irresistible witch-mother, with
rolling eye and a hairdo with curved horns, and Leonid Boldin's lubricious
old Devil; Vladimir Matorin's stentorian bass for Oksana's father, a
patriarchal ram, and Wjacheslav Weinorovski and Anatoly Lochak as
Schoolmaster and His Excellency Potemkin (notably refined singing in his
couplets) - all get their teeth firmly into their roles. Keith Latham's
Mayor lives up to their enthusiastic style.
By comparison the orchestra sounded slightly backward, and Anissimov too
polite about following his singers; stage and pit occasionally slipped out
of synch. But one should not look this gift horse in the mouth: with all its
trappings, quite opulent by Wexford standards, it prances and curvets to
splendid effect.

The programme of the week is undoubtedly Thatcher: The Downing Street Years
(BBC 1, 9.30). In this first part of the four-part series, Lady Thatcher
speaks candidly about her heroic struggle against the 'Wets', those who
looked down upon her as being a mere woman.
Lords Prior and Gilmour are among those who counter these charges
vigorously, the latter describing the former premier as 'fevered and
irrational'.
Open Space, How Safe the Ferryman (BBC 2, 7.30), will be music to the ears
of Eurotunnel shareholders. It alleges that ferries are thoroughly unsafe
and that a collision between car-ferries is bound to happen sooner or later.
Moreover, it argues that safety legislation is flouted daily.
ScreenPlay: Not Even God Is Wise Enough (BBC2, 9.25) follows a young
Nigerian-born Londoner who embarks on a fantastical journey in search for
his long-estranged father.
Bookmark, The Vampire's Life (BBC 2, 8.00), interviews horror writer Anne
Rice, who lives in New Orleans with Louis the vampire, a creation who has
sold four million copies of Rice's first book.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Arts: Sonny's flights of fancy - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sonny Rollins, 'saxophone colossus', is generally regarded as one of the
most important (surviving) figures in modern jazz. With a considered
technique and driven by awesome stamina and dexterity, the 64 year old New
Yorker has set the standard for saxophone the improvisors for the last 40
years.
An annual visitor to Europe, he is fussy about the venues he plays and on
Monday he brought the regular band and his rag bag of battered old tunes to
the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane. For the committed Rollins fans this will
have been a source of great relief and joy: since the 1970s the Rollins
repertoire has consisted of short but strong melodies which provide
recognisable reference points for the saxophonist's flights of fancy. The
band's role is strictly a as reliable support crew which provides some
mid-air refuelling for the boss between aerobatics.
So it was on Monday. With a familiar flight plan comprising old favourites
such as 'Duke of Iron', 'Prelude to a Kiss', and 'Long Ago and Faraway',
Rollins roared matter-of-factly over his musical landscape like a veteran
flying circus pilot. Breathtaking time changes like stall turns are executed
effortlessly; now he loops around a fast moving melody with deadly grace,
later ambushing the rhythm from behind before finally turning genial barrel
rolls through a tin pan alley tune like 'Tennessee Waltz'.
The band looks skyward indulgently. Jerome Harris and Bob Cranshaw on
electric guitar and bass were solid and slavish while Cliff Anderson's
trombone supplied buoyant fat notes to fill where Rollins took a breather. A
new and welcome addition to the band came in the unlikely shape of
percussionist Victor See Yuan whose Confucian appearance belied a splendidly
kinetic way with congas and various shakers.
But if Rollins retains all the old firepower as well as the chocs-away
trickery in his display, the repertoire is beginning to sound all too
familiar for a performer whose appeal has always been strongest heard live.
The corny, jangly C &amp; W tinged 'Tennessee Waltz' and his calypso trademark
'Don't Stop the Carnival' brought loud cheers of approval from the full
house, but that did not entirely extinguish the strong feeling of deja vu.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Management: Navigators without a map or compass - UK
companies are failing to look to the future with a sense of strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Many British companies, sizeable as well as small, are trying to navigate
their way to competitive survival in the dark, without either a map or a
compass. Almost a third look no further forward than one-year budgets, and
more than half have no long-term goals.
This bleak picture emerges from a study of the way that over 1,100 UK
companies of all shapes and sizes think, plan and act strategically - or
fail to do so.
But this picture may be just the tip of a miserable iceberg. The study,
called 'Unplanned and Unprepared', suggests that, on top of the 30 per cent
which have no strategy, up to another 40 per cent plan inadequately.
The study was conducted by a thriving consultancy called Strategy for
Success, formed out of one of the few fee-earning parts of the National
Economic Development Office, which was wound up at the end of last year.
The study makes instructive reading, even if its terminology owes too much
to Nedo's belief in formal planning and too little to the new business
orthodoxy of what academics call 'emergent strategies': those which emerge
from entre-preneurial action, albeit within a loose strategic framework.
This view sees 'strategy' and 'planning' as two separate animals: strategy
as a sense of direction, and planning as the detailed road map which one
uses to get there.
The 'planning' frame of reference causes the authors of the study to be a
little over-ready to suggest that three-year formal plans are too short for
many companies' best interests, when in many industries - consumer and
office electronics, for instance - this is the furthest that things can be
plotted in any detail.
Of the 1,100 companies surveyed, no fewer than 15 with revenues of over
Pounds 500m put themselves in the category of having 'unclear goals', or
none at all. A further five were contained in the 10 per cent of the sample
which had only short-term goals. Making only short-term plans may be
excusable, even sensible, but having only short-term goals, or none at all,
is suicidal. As one respondent put it, doing so is tantamount to being
'adrift and rudderless in a turbulent sea'.
Another problem which emerges from the survey is the failure of some
companies to realise that planning can - and should - be much more than just
a corporate activity directed at acquisitions and marketing: plans, or at
least goals and strategies, should be formulated at every level of the
organisation and for every activity.
Commenting on the results of the study, Brian Weekes, the consultancy's
managing director, says some companies 'have won in the UK third division
without taking a strategic view, and therefore think they'll survive in the
international marketplace'.
But other companies recognise the problem: 'They know they've been jammed
into a short-term timeframe - often by their own top management  - and they
know they must get out of it,' says Weekes. For sizeable companies he cites
two particular impediments to long-term thinking or planning, depending on
the type of company.
In private companies, the main problem is often the owner-manager's refusal
to allow strategic issues to be thrashed out properly because of the obvious
need either for large injections of capital or for radical changes in the
nature of the business - or for both.
For subsidiaries of public companies, he says a frequent problem is that
their freedom to think and act strategically is constrained by their lack of
complete control over key activities such as marketing or manufacturing;
these are carried out by the parent company surprisingly often, Weekes says.
A third common barrier to strategic thinking and action is the lack of
cross-functional collaboration, especially between marketing, engineering
and manufacturing.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Management: Improving business with the community's help
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Involvement in the community through training, economic regeneration,
education and equal opportunities policies can improve corporate
performance, according to a new survey of top business executives and other
opinion formers.
Companies with active community affairs programmes are likely to have a more
committed and happy workforce, the survey found. There are also benefits in
public image and customer loyalty.
Over 80 per cent of those polled said that a reputation for being socially
responsive and responsible is becoming a competitive advantage.
The findings of the survey were presented last night to the annual meeting
of the Per Cent Club in London, a group of large companies which devote a
proportion of their profits to community activities.
Sponsored by six, blue-chip companies, with well-developed community
involvement programmes, the survey was based on interviews with 700 opinion
leaders around the country, including more than 120 top executives from both
industry and the City of London.
The survey will offer some reassurance to business leaders who must justify
every expense in the current adverse climate. However, it also suggests ways
in which companies can maximise the returns from their community
involvement:
City investors should be informed of the rationale for community involvement
programmes - at present, they are often unconvinced of the commercial
benefits.
Senior managers also need more convincing of the value of community
programmes - they are often less clear about their objectives.
Local managers should be given greater responsibility for community
investment programmes, as this will result in more effective links with
community organisations.
New forms of partnership are needed with national charities to support the
aims of both businesses and charities through strategies such as
cause-related marketing.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Management: Quality street cred - TQM is struggling to make
an impact in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
They were handing out the Oscars to Europe's leading 'quality' companies
last week. But amid all the razzamatazz in Turin no one seemed to notice
that this year's winning businesses - like some of last year's - are foreign
owned.
The 1993 award conferred by the European Foundation for Quality Management
was won by last year's runner up, the European operations of textile
products group Milliken - a US company with its headquarters in Georgia.
ICL, whose manufacturing and supply division had to settle for second place,
is an 80 per cent subsidiary of Fujitsu of Japan. Ranx Xerox, which was the
overall victor in 1992, the first year the Award was given, is a hybrid, 50
per cent controlled by the US Xerox Corporation.
The non-European parentage of all three companies is too much of a
coincidence to let pass. At the very least it reinforces the view that Total
Quality Management - the addictive religion of the quality movement -
remains better understood and more widely accepted in North America (where
it was invented) and in Japan (where it was first properly applied).
Nearly all the attendees at last week's Quality Forum organised by the EFQM,
which culminated in the prize-giving ceremony in Turin, were converts. The
challenge they face is how to spread the word beyond the tiny elite of
mostly large companies which practice what they preach, and how to
reinvigorate a message which may be losing its force.
At its baldest, TQM means applying quality right across an organisation  -
to delivery systems, administration and customers as well as to a product or
service - in the quest for competitive advantage. TQM reached Europe in the
early to mid-1980s and has been as durable as any recent management idea,
although it has encountered considerable scepticism in the market place.
For some it was an attractively simple concept, which has now been
needlessly overloaded with jargon and used as a meaningless 'catch all' for
other management nostrums. Consultancy firms - always on the look out for
new ways to sell their services - have contributed to a feeling that TQM has
been superseded by concepts such as Just In Time manufacturing or Business
Process Re-engineering.
The fuss over European-wide certification - notably complaints by small and
medium-sized suppliers about the time and money spent on acquiring the
quality standard ISO 9000 to appease their more demanding customers - has
also given TQM a bad name. On top of this, surveys have shown that TQM
programmes have too often failed to deliver the sort of benefits anticipated
by managers. The correlation between TQM and financial performance is
particularly hard to prove, though one recently demonstrated that out of a
sample of 29 companies running formal programmes, 70 per cent did better
than the average in their sectors.
Mike Gallagher, manager of the European quality award, acknowledges the
confusion but argues that TQM has highlighted four 'timeless' ideas 'which
are constantly of importance to the top team'. These are the importance of
the customer; the need to involve everyone in the company; the concept of
process management (every business activity should be viewed as a process);
and the goal of continuous improvement.
Business Process Re-engineering, he argues, is 'really just looking at
process management starting with first principles. It does not provide all
the answers - what about employee involvement or customers, for instance?'
Besides its annual prizes and award, EFQM's mission is to stimulate quality
activity as widely as possible, notably through the application of its
self-assessment model*. This is based on the simple premise that processes
are the means by which the organisation harnesses and releases the talents
of its people to produce results.
As the illustration demonstrates, customer satisfaction, people (employee)
satisfaction and impact on society are achieved through a company's
leadership driving its policy and strategy, people management, resources and
processes. This ultimately leads to excellence in business results. Each of
the nine elements is a criterion which can be used to assess the
organisation's progress towards TQM and thereafter to adopt improvement
strategies. The percentages shown are those used for the purpose of the EFQM
award, but can be varied depending on the nature of the company concerned.
Besides its use as a self-improvement tool, Gallagher believes that the EFQM
self-assessment process offers a sound basis for strategic direction and
priority setting.
Naturally enough, strong endorsement comes from ICL and Milliken Europe. The
latter's chairman and managing director, Clive Jeanes, adds that the
assessment process for the award was 'a great learning tool' and among other
things prompted him to institute bi-monthly meetings of top executives from
the company's four European businesses.
Jeanes says Milliken Europe first adopted a planned approach to quality in
1981. 'We have always believed in buying the best technology, but I remember
being struck how the Japanese in those days were more efficient than us
using machines that were 20 years older.'
By 1985, the company noted that measuring performance was having a bottom
line impact, but it still had not asked its customers what they wanted.
'When we did we were amazed to find that after product quality, on-time
delivery was the next most important item. At that stage, however, only 75
per cent were arriving when we said they would.'
Jeanes says Milliken's TQM took off in 1987 and 1988. Before visiting Japan
in 1991 - when 24 of the company's executives saw 10 companies in 10 days -
he read six textbooks on the subject.
'With a quality programme you add to your costs in the very short term, you
recognise problems you didn't know about. But the payback over two to three
years is tremendous.'

FT  20 OCT 93 / People: Hanson sends Cotton to chair Renison
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson is taking a 'hands on' approach to Renison Goldfields Consolidated,
the quoted Australian mining group in which the Anglo-American conglomerate
has a 40 per cent stake and which has a far from sparkling recent financial
record. Hanson has persuaded one of its senior directors, Anthony Cotton, to
become deputy chairman at Renison for a year before taking over from
chairman Max Roberts; he will stay to help with the changeover.
Hanson acquired the Renison stake when it paid Pounds 3.9bn for Consolidated
Gold Fields in 1989, a purchase that proved far from the bonanza Lord Hanson
must have hoped for.
Campbell Anderson, until recently Renison's chief executive, used to say
that there were three types of company in Hanson's portfolio - the A
companies were core businesses and not for sale; buyers were actively being
sought for C companies; leaving the B companies which were for sale if
someone should come along with the right offer. Poor old Renison, he
suggested, was on the B list.
Hanson was keen to give the impression yesterday that Renison had now moved
to the A list and has 'persuaded one of our senior people to take this
appointment'.
According to an official, Hanson is anxious to increase its presence in
Australia and the Asia-Pacific region and Renison might provide some
opportunities for that.
Renison, analysts suggest, is an ideal candidate for 'Hansonisation'. It has
been badly hit by the collapse in most commodity prices and recorded net
losses for the past two financial years. But there have also been strategic
mistakes which have added to the pain.
Hanson's chance to move in emerged because Campbell Anderson, seen as the
likely successor to the present chairman, decided instead to move to North
Broker Hill Peko, another Australian resources group, as chief executive.
Cotton has been Hanson's deputy chief operating officer UK, responsible for
the group's main building products interests. He has been chairman of ARC,
Beazer, London Brick, Butterley Brick and, until its recent sale, Ever Ready
UK. He has been a director of Renison since 1991 and will continue as a
Hanson director.
His move to Sydney has led to two consequential appointments at Hanson. Ross
Chiese becomes assistant chief operating officer UK. He has been an
associate director of the group since 1990. Andrew Dougal becomes deputy
finance director and an associate director.

<TEXT>
Owners Abroad has appointed Francis Baron as chief executive, thus
completing the top management reorganisation triggered by the resignation of
Howard Klein from both positions in July.
Baron has been chairman and chief executive of Anglo-Saxon Television, a
family company he set up last year after he resigned from European TV
Networks.
Michael Julien, former chief executive of Storehouse who was appointed
non-executive chairman of Owners Abroad in August, is understood to have
wanted a chief executive with strong management and marketing skills.
Klein was forced to resign after he issued a profits warning only four
months after Owners Abroad narrowly fought off a hostile bid from rival
Airtours.
Baron joined WH Smith in 1983 to build a television division from scratch.
By 1991, when WH Smith sold its television interests, the division had
become one of the largest satellite operators in the UK.
Baron helped put together an international consortium, which became European
Television Networks, to buy the business from WH Smith for Pounds 50m.
But he resigned last year after differences with the foreign shareholders
and set up Anglo-Saxon Television.

<TEXT>
Mike Jones has been appointed finance director at ALEXON group; he moves
from the Merchant Retail group, where he was group finance director. He
replaces David Cohen who left on October 1 to join EDS Europe.
In April this year Alexon went through some turmoil as three of its biggest
institutional shareholders forced a change of management after some dismal
financial results.
Then, Lawrence Snyder stepped down as chairman and Ruth Henderson and Peter
Ridsdale resigned as joint chief operating officers.
John Sadler, a former finance director of the John Lewis Partnership was
appointed non-executive chairman and John Osborn, a former director of
Sears, took over as chief executive.
Alexon lost nearly Pounds 1m before tax last year and passed its final
dividend; it had made an Pounds 11.3m profit in the previous year. Its
interim figures showed a pre-tax loss of Pounds 10.2m, against profits of
Pounds 1.5m last time round.

FT  20 OCT 93 / People: Adding up at KPMG
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The search is on for a new head of the tax discipline at KPMG Peat Marwick,
the UK's second largest accountancy firm, following changes in all the
senior positions.
Gerry Acher was yesterday announced as the new head of audit and accounting,
following the elevation of his predecessor, Michael Fowle, to become head of
the firm's south-east practice.
Fowle takes over from Colin Sharman, currently deputy senior partner, who
becomes senior partner at the start of next year following the retirement of
Jim Butler.
Acher's current role as head of corporate finance is taken on by Neil
Lerner, currently head of privatisations. He will probably continue to hold
this existing job.
Roger White, currently head of tax, will remain as the senior tax partner,
but it is believed there will be a new head of the tax discipline, while
White will concentrate more on practice protection. Tim Hayward is remaining
head of insolvency.
All the appointments except Sharman's have effect from the start of this
month. But that leaves one vacant post from Christmas: deputy senior
partner, which Sharman inherited when Bill Morrison retired, and which he
will vacate from the start of 1994.
KPMG is a firm with six regional partnerships, but with the south east
accounting for 60 per cent of fee income. That has traditionally made head
of the south-east the number two position in the firm.
Sharman is still considering whether he will also need a new deputy senior
partner, on top of a management team of about eight people to include the
heads of the disciplines, and functional areas such as practice protection
and risk management.
Acher, 48, who led the firm on bid defence work including Hanson and ICI,
BTR and Hawker Siddeley, and Whyte and Mackay and Invergordon, says there is
still too much 'low-balling' or competitive fee-cutting between accountancy
firms. One of his priorities is to give the firm a higher profile in the
current audit and accounting debates.
Jon Madonna, chairman and chief executive of KPMG Peat Marwick in the US,
has also taken on the role of deputy chairman of the firm worldwide.
Madonnna's new job, which has just been created, will give him
responsibility for Asia/Pacific and Latin America, and for developing
international marketing and communications.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Business and the Environment: Turning full circle at the
power station - Europe's first energy plant fuelled by old tyres has opened
in Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most vehicles in Britain are not just running on four wheels but on a
potential energy resource - tyres - which an innovative power company has
begun burning to generate electricity.
The idea of burning tyres raises images of noxious fumes and black smoke,
but Elm Energy, a US joint venture, has won permission to open Europe's
first power station in Britain, fuelled by Michelins, Goodyears, Pirellis
and other makes.
An intensive lobbying campaign by the company has convinced regulators and
local authorities not only that drivers' last punctured tyres may be
consigned safely to the furnace, but that a stringent recycling system will
ensure they will not then inhale the by-products.
Standing outside Elm Energy's newly completed power station in
Wolverhampton, which has its formal opening early in November, Anne Evans,
the managing director, claims the recycling facility will out-perform other
waste-to-energy schemes.
An average tyre, she says, contains the equivalent energy of 12 cu m of
natural gas and is second only to oil in British Thermal Units (BTU), the
common measure of heat energy produced during incineration.
Following the completion of pre-production tests at the plant, truck loads
of old tyres are being fed into five giant furnaces where they will burn at
up to 950`C. Elm Energy expects to generate heat energy of 13,500 BTU per
pound, compared with 12,000 BTU for coal, 2,500 BTU for household rubbish
and 1,500 BTU for food waste.
Burning tyres is hot work and could easily produce the steam to drive a
turbine.
Elm Energy's success has rested on citing similar operations in the US where
the tyre industry can dispose of its rubbish at one end of a power station
and see no harmful gases emerge at the other.
The company - formed by Nipsco, the Indiana utility group, and the
Performance Service Corporation of Connecticut - has pioneered a system
which it claims will consume 21 per cent of Britain's waste tyres with
minimal emissions.
That claim is based on its unique power generation and recycling process.
Under the system, batches of tyres are rammed into furnaces, where all the
material is expected to burn so rapidly that almost no carbon gases can
form. Split-level hearths in the furnace will, meanwhile, pulsate along a
series of steps so that the ash - mostly steel wire - can be fed into
hoppers for recycling to the scrap metal industry.
Before reaching the next stage, where furnace gases flow around water-filled
drums to produce turbine-driving steam, any remaining organic material is
incinerated in reburn tunnels fed with combustion air. Having produced
enough energy for 30MW of electricity - supplying 25,000 homes - the tyres'
job is done.
If the remaining gases were pumped straight into the atmosphere,
environmentalists would have justifiable complaint. But Elm Energy says its
recycling means that emissions of harmful substances will be less than
one-millionth of the World Health Organisation limits.
First, the flue gases are filtered through hundreds of Gore-Tex bags to
extract zinc oxide. The company plans to sell this waste to the tyre
industry for re-use in new products.
Remaining waste gases flow into a lime reactor which converts harmful
sulphur dioxide into calcium sulphite. At the final stage, the sulphite will
be filtered through another series of Gore-Tex bags and the residue sold for
building materials.
'There will be no black smoke, no environmental problem,' predicts Evans.
'If this plant isn't clean enough then you cannot build anything in the UK.'
She may be right. But all this technology costs money and the government,
determined to encourage alternatives to coal, has underwritten the scheme.
Elm Energy's initial contracts with the Non Fossil Fuel Agency, which
purchases the power and resells it to Midlands Electricity company, are
confidential.
Evans says these contracts would be withdrawn if she revealed their value.
All she will admit is that the government has guaranteed the company's
short-term contracts, so helping the company to borrow the capital to set up
the plant.
More than Pounds 48m has been invested in the Wolverhampton plant and Elm
Energy is confident of a handsome return.
That income has a double bonus: on the one hand, the government wants to
promote waste-to-energy schemes; on the other, the tyre industry is keener
to see its tyres go into power generation than landfill sites.
Elm Energy says its operation will be cheaper than other waste-fuelled power
schemes because there will not be tonnes of burnt ash to dispose of.
The company is so certain it can provide energy at the right price that it
is already planning further plants in Scotland, southern England and
continental Europe.
In Wolverhampton, Evans says people have the right attitude: 'They're not
afraid of tyres.'

FT  20 OCT 93 / Business and the Environment: Run-of-the-mill debates - The
Nordic pulp industry is under pressure to change its bleaching methods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When it comes to stirring up public antipathy towards the pulp and paper
industry, a picture of a horribly maimed fish goes a long way. Or so
Greenpeace in Germany found several years ago, when as part of a campaign to
promote 'totally chlorine-free' (TCF) pulp and paper production, it put out
a spoof version of the magazine Der Spiegel, complete with photographs
claiming to show the devastating impact which pulp mill effluents could have
on marine life.
It must rank as one of German Greenpeace's most successful campaigns. By
common consent, the environmental organisation did much to create the
consumer pressure which has forced many German publishers, paper
manufacturers and merchants to go 'totally chlorine-free' in the last two
years. This in turn has forced a number of pulp mills which supply the
German market to find substitute bleaching agents for the chlorine compounds
they use.
'German Greenpeace took the initiative against chlorine and it has
succeeded,' says Pertti Laine, director of the Finnish Forest Industries
Federation's industrial and environmental unit. 'We have had to invest
billions of markka to change our bleaching methods.' The latest in a long
line of such investments will come on stream next month when Metsa-Botnia's
Kaskinen mill in western Finland inaugurates a new ozone bleaching plant as
part of its commitment to TCF production.
At least 10 Nordic pulp mills now have the capacity to produce TCF pulp, and
nearly all of them have started these operations in the last couple of
years. The investments have had to be made despite the severe financial
squeeze which has gripped the industry as the pulp price has plummeted from
more than Dollars 800 (Pounds 570) a tonne in 1989 to the Dollars 400 a
tonne level which prevails today. The impetus has come because 'nobody can
afford to lose the German market', according to Richard Cockram, a
consultant with the UK company NLK Consultants.
Germany is not the only country where environmentalists are pressing for
TCF. Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands, as well as the Nordic
countries are all now leading consumers of TCF pulp, helping TCF's share of
Europe's graphic papers market to more than double from seven per cent to 15
per cent in the past year.
But the trend has been much slower to catch on in the UK, France, Italy and
other European countries, where consumers have been reluctant to pay extra
for TCF.
There is no doubt that TCF pulp production costs more, simply because it
requires substantial investment in new machinery. Thus the pulp mill wants a
TCF premium from the paper manufacturer, who wants one from the publisher,
who in turn wants one from the end-customer. This may be relatively easy to
achieve in buoyant markets. But during the recession it has undoubtedly
caused a squeeze which means not everyone in the chain is receiving the
premium they require. Hans Burmeister, marketing director of Sweden's Sodra
Cell, the biggest supplier of TCF market pulp in Europe, says his company is
generally managing to obtain the DM100-DM150 (Pounds 41-Pounds 62) per tonne
premium from German customers which it needs to cover its additional costs.
But the premium is only relative to a very depressed general pulp price, he
notes.
The recession has also intensified the debate about the most effective and
cost-efficient TCF bleaching process. Some mills just use hydrogen peroxide,
but this is very costly; some use a combination of hydrogen peroxide and
enzymes, but the pulp produced is less bright. More recently, a number of
mills have started using ozone, as this enhances pulp brightness. But the
development has not been universally welcomed because the gas is very
reactive and highly poisonous.
A more fundamental debate centres on whether TCF is any more
environmentally-friendly than the ECF (elemental chlorine-free) bleaching
process it is replacing. The latter uses chlorine dioxide and is far less
damaging to the environment than elemental chlorine which is being rapidly
phased out. In modern ECF mills, emissions of chlorine compounds can be as
low as 0.3kg-0.4kg per tonne of pulp produced, which is well below the 50kg
level common only a few years ago.
A study by a group of Canadian scientists has added spice to the ECF/TCF
debate. It has found evidence of fish being damaged by pulp mill effluents,
irrespective both of the bleaching process used and whether it carries out
any bleaching at all. It concludes there is something toxic in pulp-mill
effluent, but that this cannot be attributed to the bleaching plant.
The question is whether such studies will slow growth in TCF demand or
merely change the focus of the debate from chlorine dioxide to the wider
issue of effluent-free pulping. Christoph Thies, a paper specialist with
Greenpeace in Hamburg, is confident the trend towards TCF is irreversible.
He gives two reasons for his view. First, increased recycling will create
pressure for cleaner input of raw material. Second, he says that chlorine
has to be eliminated if pulp mills are to achieve their wider ambition of
totally enclosing their water systems so that they discharge no liquid
effluent at all. 'TCF is only a step on the way to an effluent-free mill,'
he states.
The view that TCF demand will continue to grow is supported by NLK
Consultants, although it notes that this is a European issue and has not yet
become an important concern in the US. It believes European demand for TCF
pulp will grow from 1.8m tonnes in 1993, a 15 per cent market share, to 3.2m
tonnes in 1996, a 25 per cent share.
But its predictions also show a persistent gap between consumption in the
German-speaking and Nordic markets and the rest of Europe. It expects 70 per
cent of the fine paper consumed in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and the
Nordic states to be TCF grade in 1996 against only 10 per cent for the rest
of Europe.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Government wins defence votes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government secured comfortable majorities in the Commons last night over
its defence policy but was again warned that excessive spending cuts imposed
by the Treasury would spark a revolt by Tory backbenchers.
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, chairman of the Commons defence select committee, and
Mr Patrick Cormack, MP for Staffordshire South, were among prominent Tory
backbenchers who gave notice that they would oppose any attempt to slash the
defence budget by Pounds 1bn.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, said he had taken note of
the significant number of Tory backbenchers who had expressed 'very grave
reservations'.
He suggested that there was scope for 'substantial' savings through the
continuing drive to secure improved efficiency and value for money without
reducing the operational efficiency of the front-line services. Mr Aitken
stressed that these were not the kind of cuts 'on which tears or votes
should be shed'.
Sir Nicholas insisted that the Treasury should not be allowed to take
control in deciding Britain's defence commitments. He could not believe that
it would remain properly defended if any more 'substantial cuts' were
imposed.
Mr Cormack said now was not the time to seek to 'balance the books' by
cutting the defence budget by Pounds 1bn. If that happened, he would seek to
persuade as many Tory MPs as possible to join him in voting against it.
Mr Cormack said he had been assured by a backbencher that they would not
take much persuading.
The government won a majority of 55 (322-267) to defeat a Labour attempt to
condemn its failure to address long-term security needs.
Labour leftwingers - ignoring the official party line to abstain - were
defeated by a government majority of 298 (332-34) when they voted against
the defence estimates.

THE GOVERNMENT last night awarded a Pounds 200m contract for ammunition to
Royal Ordnance, ending a period of uncertainty for the British Aerospace
subsidiary, David Owen writes.
The move, which was announced in the Commons debate on defence by Mr Jeremy

Royal Ordnance said it was 'delighted' at the news. On a purely commercial

FT  20 OCT 93 / US-style warehouse a retailer, say stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE leading supermarket chains launched a High Court action yesterday to
block planning permission given for an American 'warehouse club' to trade in
Thurrock, Essex.
Mr David Pannick QC, for the supermarkets, challenged Thurrock Borough
Council's decision to treat Costco as a wholesaler rather than a retailer.
Evidence from Costco's US operations showed that 35 per cent of sales were
made to the public and the planning application made no mention of the
conditions for club membership.
Mr Richard Humphreys, for the council, said planning permission had been
granted on condition that the proportion of sales to the public would not
rise above 35 per cent and so not damage other local traders. Costco also
marketed a far more limited range of products than supermarkets. Items would
be sold in bulk, appealing more to business buyers than the public.
The case is being watched closely by sectors of the retail trade concerned
about the impact the arrival of warehouse clubs could have on traditional UK
shopping outlets.
Thurrock has given planning permission for the US company Costco to build a
12,880 sq m warehouse at the Lakeside trading estate. The warehouse will
sell a range of products in bulk and at a heavy discount to members of the
club - usually businesses - and to the public.
J. Sainsbury, Safeway and Tesco have objected to the proposed development,
claiming the council acted unlawfully by treating it as a wholesaler rather
than a retailer, and so did not use planning criteria applied to proposed
supermarket developments.
Planning criteria on Thurrock's land use, which place a higher priority on
commercial and industrial projects than retail operations, were not
considered, they say.
The hearing is expected to end today.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Dockyard labour terms in danger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON and ROLAND ADBURGHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FULL-SCALE privatisation of Devonport and Rosyth naval dockyards, announced
on Monday by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, is likely to mean
less generous conditions of employment for the workforce.
Babcock Thorn, the consortium of Babcock and Thorn EMI which operates
Rosyth, said yesterday that it would 'examine' employment conditions,
including pay, pensions and redundancy terms, if it were successful in a
bid.
Unit labour costs at the dockyards are higher than those in comparable
private-sector operations because of terms inherited from the Ministry of
Defence when private-sector managers took over in 1987.
The MoD also covers the cost of redundancies, something that will probably
cease on privatisation.
The government intends to sell the two dockyards to separate companies by
1996 as part of its drive for defence savings.
Both Babcock Thorn and Devonport Management (DML) consider themselves well
placed to bid for their yards, though both want to see the tender documents
first.
VSEL, the submarine builder, GEC, which owns the Yarrow warship yard,
British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce all registered an interest in bidding for
the yards when the MoD asked for expressions of interest last year.
As well as being concerned about employment terms, unions at the yards fear
privatisation will lead to further redundancies.
Despite winning the contract to refit Trident submarines in July, DML
announced this month a further 500 redundancies which will reduce the
workforce to 4,400, while Rosyth has cut its workforce from 4,100 to under
3,700 since the start of the year.
Babcock Thorn said yesterday that job cuts after privatisation depended on
how successful Rosyth was at winning warship and outside commercial work.
Mr Peter Whitehouse, business development manager of DML, said the company
regarded itself in 'a very strong position as sitting tenants' to bid
successfully for the yard.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Court backs Canary package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE High Court yesterday approved the Pounds 1.1bn restructuring package
proposed for Canary Wharf, allowing the development to come out of
administration and operate again as a solvent group of companies.
The decision is a crucial one for those trying to resurrect the troubled
London Docklands project, which collapsed in May last year.
The government's commitment to fund the extension of the Jubilee Underground
line to Canary Wharf depended on yesterday's ruling.
It also means that Canary Wharf can finally sign contracts with two large
new tenants - Mirror Group Newspapers and London Underground - which will
take the occupancy level of the development up to about 50 per cent.
Giving his judgment, Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, rejected the
argument mounted by advertising group WPP and its subsidiary Ogilvy &amp; Mather
that too little information had been provided about the restructuring
package for anyone to be certain about the outcome of allowing the companies
to resume normal trading. Ogilvy &amp; Mather is a Canary Wharf tenant, and had
maintained that the package did not secure sufficient cashflow to safeguard
tenants' interests.
The court was in effect being asked to buy 'a pig in a poke', lawyers for
WPP had alleged.
Sir Donald dismissed the claim, describing the restructuring package as
'impressive' and saying he had no doubts about discharging Canary Wharf's
administrators Ernst &amp; Young.
He said: 'The success of this scheme is far from assured - the
administrators do not claim otherwise. However, I can see no reason to doubt
that the scheme stands a fair chance of success and provides the best hope
for the companies and their creditors. It deserves to be given a chance.'
The companies will not finally emerge from administration until October 29,
when the period for objections to the company voluntary arrangements, agreed
as part of the package, has elapsed.
A further court hearing will be held that day to discharge the
administrators formally. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, will
then immediately authorise the extension of the Jubilee line.
Speaking after the court's ruling, Mr Stephen Adamson, one of the three
Ernst &amp; Young accountants who have acted as administrators, welcomed the
decision.
He said: 'The project is extremely well-placed to benefit over the next 10
to 15 years.'

FT  20 OCT 93 / Hearing on US warehouse opens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE leading supermarket chains launched a High Court action yesterday to
block planning permission given for an American 'warehouse club' to trade in
Thurrock, Essex.
The case is being watched closely by sectors of the retail trade concerned
about the impact the arrival of warehouse clubs could have on traditional UK
shopping outlets.
Thurrock Borough Council has given planning permission for the US company
Costco to build a 12,880 sq m warehouse at the Lakeside trading estate. The
warehouse will sell a range of products in bulk and at a heavy discount to
members of the club - usually businesses - and to the public.
J. Sainsbury, Safeway and Tesco have objected to the proposed development,
claiming the council acted unlawfully by treating it as a wholesaler rather
than a retailer, and so did not use planning criteria applied to proposed
supermarket developments.
Planning criteria on Thurrock's land use, which place a higher priority on
commercial and industrial projects than retail operations, were not
considered, they say.
Mr David Pannick QC, for the supermarkets, challenged Thurrock's decision to
treat Costco as a wholesaler rather than a retailer. Evidence from Costco's
US operations showed that 35 per cent of sales were made to the public and
the planning application made no mention of the conditions for club
membership.
Mr Richard Humphreys, for Thurrock Borough Council, said planning permission
had been granted on condition that the proportion of sales to the public
would not rise above 35 per cent and so not damage other local traders.
Costco also marketed a far more limited range of products than supermarkets.
Items would be sold in bulk, appealing more to business buyers than the
public.
The hearing is expected to end today.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Training sale to 'fraudster' attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR MPs yesterday stepped up their attack on the government for failing
to prevent 13 privatised skill centres being acquired by a company whose
chief executive, Mr Patrick Doyle, was a 'convicted fraudster'.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, said in the Commons that Mr
Doyle, chief executive of AST Training, had been imprisoned for 'forgery and
fraud'.
Mr Rhodri Morgan, a Labour frontbencher, is among the signatories of a
motion which levels a charge of 'collusion' against Arthur Andersen,
receivers of Astra Training Services, the privatised skillcentre network of
the Department of Employment. It claims that 'alternative purchasers were
unable to get information from Arthur Andersen'.
Miss Ann Widdecombe, employment minister, said the government had no power
to tell the receiver 'to whom he should sell the assets of a private
company'. She said the government had been assured by the training and
employment councils that they could supply all the training that used to be
provided by the closed Astra outlets.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Brunei default on debts alleged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of Labour MPs last night accused the High Commission of Brunei in
London of failing to honour debts incurred by sponsored students from the
Sultanate.
In a motion tabled under parliamentary privilege, the MPs called on the
Sultan of Brunei to 'meet the debts owed by his High Commission to landlords
and other debts in the United Kingdom'.
The MPs, led by Mr Nigel Griffiths (Edinburgh South), said the commission
had failed to honour payments owed to the landlords of properties rented by
their students.
They added that promissory notes issued by the High Commissioner in the name
of the Sultan were 'worthless'. The High Commission failed to honour the
securities it had given to creditors.
The motion said that the High Commissioner had failed to answer
correspondance from solicitors and MPs and warned all universities of the
'financial unreliability' of the High Commission.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Ammunition contract awarded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT last night awarded a Pounds 200m contract for ammunition to
Royal Ordnance, ending a period of uncertainty for the British Aerospace
subsidiary.
The move, which was announced in the Commons by Mr Jeremy Hanley, the armed
forces minister, will help safeguard nearly 1,000 jobs over five years.
Royal Ordnance said it was 'delighted' at the news.
The announcement came as it emerged that the 5,000-strong Ministry of
Defence police has been earmarked as the next MoD unit to be proposed for
agency status. Officials said that work on the transition would begin within
a year, but said the move was unlikely to be a stepping-stone to
privatisation.
Opening the second day of a Commons defence debate, Mr Hanley announced that
Britain was sending a ship to Haiti to help in the enforcement of United
Nations sanctions.
He said the vessel would work 'in very close co-operation' with the US Navy
and others.
The move came within a day of Downing Street's acknowledgement that the
transatlantic dispute over the west's handling of the Bosnian crisis was
placing Britain's relationship with the US under strain.
Mr Hanley attacked recent press reports criticising high staffing levels at
the MoD. There had been a 48 per cent reduction in the number of UK-based
MoD civil servants since 1979, he said.
Other announcements made by Mr Hanley included:
The full integration of the Women's Royal Naval Service with the Royal Navy
from next month in a move aimed at enhancing career opportunities for women.
Mixed staffing at sea had proved to be 'a real success story'.
The completion of a study concluding there were enough UK seafarers
available to crew merchant ships required by the MoD in times of crisis. A
review last year said there were still enough merchant vessels on UK
registers for defence purposes.
The publication of a code of practice for submarine operations in shallow
waters.
The closure of the Royal Naval Engineering College near Plymouth.
The withdrawal of so-called 'Z berth' status from seven sites used for
occasional visits by nuclear submarines. Approved locations for visits by
nuclear-powered warships would remain at 25 to 30 UK locations.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Gummer gives warning on water charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday warned that further improvements in water standards
must be balanced against costs to consumers. It also said it was talking to
other European Community states about ways to reduce the cost of
implementing the latest waste-water directive.
Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, said: 'Charges will have to rise to
finance further improvements.'
He also confirmed the UK was sounding out other EC member states on whether
changes could be made to the timetable for implementing the Urban Waste
Water Treatment directive.
Mr Gummer complained that the cost of implementation 'has greatly exceeded
initial estimates'.
UK water companies have estimated it will cost about Pounds 10bn to meet the
directive's requirement to upgrade treatment of sewage, especially the 200m
gallons of raw sewage which are pumped directly into British tidal waters
each day.
Mr Gummer's comments - in a written answer to a parliamentary question  -
coincided with publication of a government report which outlined the
political and policy framework which Ofwat, the water industry regulator,
will use in setting annual percentage increases in water bills for the 10
years to the year 2005.
Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat director-general, said he was 'delighted that ministers
had recognised that further improvements should proceed at a rate which
customers can afford'. The water companies said Mr Gummer had 'taken the
strain off consumers'.
The government report also suggested that:
The regulator look at the extent to which water companies could raise more
funds through borrowing or equity financing rather than through consumer
charges.
Regulators ensure that any action they take to make marginal improvements to
standards does not cause companies to incur substantial costs.
That companies' capital programmes be geared to a 'reasonable certainty of
meeting requirements' rather than trying to achieve 'absolute certainty'.

FT  20 OCT 93 / 'Wise men' warn over tax rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY tightening in fiscal policy in next month's Budget should be accompanied
by a cut in interest rates to avoid jeopardising the fragile recovery, the
Treasury's panel of outside economic advisers - the so-called 'wise men' -
said yesterday.
The group said that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, should set out a
long-term package of measures to bring down public borrowing as a way to
boost confidence in financial markets, while spreading any tax rises over a
wide spectrum of the economy to minimise the effects on demand.
In a cautious assessment of economic prospects, the economists said the slow
upturn would continue but might 'falter' in the second half of this year,
partly because of weakening consumer spending as tax rises loom.
The panel expects the gross domestic product to grow 1.7 per cent this year
and 2.7 per cent next year. Recovery might be held back by 'below potential'
growth for some time in export markets in continental Europe.
The economists are concerned about the threat to the recovery of the Pounds
6.8bn of tax rises already due to take effect in April.
Even so, they believe Mr Clarke should take action to cut the growing gap
between public spending and revenues - likely to reach Pounds 50bn this
financial year - because of the danger of a rapid increase in borrowing over
the next few years.
The panel said: 'A prudent solution would be to introduce a package of tax
and spending reforms, desirable in themselves, which would reduce the public
sector borrowing requirement over a number of years.'
For the next financial year, the group suggested a 'modest fiscal
tightening' because anything more might damage the recovery. For 1995-96 and
beyond the Treasury should pencil in a net fiscal tightening, taking into
account both tax rises and cuts in public spending, amounting to about 1 per
cent of gross domestic product, or roughly Pounds 6bn.
The panel said one of the threats to the recovery was that personal
disposable incomes were likely to grow 'slowly if at all' in
inflation-adjusted terms. Also there were 'worrying signs' that the housing
market had failed to pick up convincingly.
The consensus among the panellists was that the government's 4 per cent
ceiling for underlying inflation was unlikely to breached by the end of next
year.

FT  20 OCT 93 / New stock market listings boosted by venture capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY HALF of the companies that obtained a London stock market listing in
the year to the end of June were financed at some stage in their development
by venture capital.
Of the 75 companies that gained a listing in the period, 36 - or 48 per cent
 -had received venture-capital finance, the British Venture Capital
Association said yesterday.
Half of the venture-backed companies which floated had been formed by
management buy-outs.
The remainder had been supported by the venture-capital industry in the
start-up, early stage or development phases.
Most of the companies that went to market were still quite small. Nine had
an initial capitalisation of less than Pounds 20m while 11 were in the range
of Pounds 20m to Pounds 50m.
Among the largest recent listings that were venture backed were Anglian
Group, a double-glazing manufacturer capitalised at its listing at Pounds
183m, and MFI, a furniture retailer and manufacturer, capitalised at Pounds
668m. Both were originally buy-outs.
Listings have returned to favour after a long period during which most
venture-capital backed companies were sold to another company.
Buyers seeking to expand could usually offer more than a company could raise
by flotation.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Tighter fiscal policy urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH Clarke, the chancellor, was advised yesterday to tighten fiscal
policy by about Pounds 6bn to reduce the government's medium-term borrowing
needs, but add only Pounds 1bn to taxes in the forthcoming November Budget.
In their latest 'Green Budget', the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies
and Goldman Sachs, the US-owned securities house, warned that substantial
fiscal tightening on top of the measures announced in the March Budget would
risk damaging the UK recovery.
The report said there was a strong case for Mr Clarke combining any
tightening of fiscal policy with a further loosening of monetary policy to
strengthen the economy and encourage a rebalancing of demand away from
consumption and into exports and investment.
The Green Budget, so named because it is meant to fulfil the role of a
government consultative document, said it would be very hard for the
government to meet tight public spending plans set for the remainder of this
parliament. As a result, action to correct the budget deficit would have to
come through tax increases.
It said the public sector borrowing requirement for 1993-94 was unlikely to
differ significantly from the Pounds 50bn forecast in March. Mr Gavyn
Davies, chief UK economist of Goldman Sachs, warned that without fiscal
tightening the PSBR would total Pounds 30bn or 3.6 per cent of gross
domestic product in 1997-98 on a 'central' assumption of average annual
economic growth of 2.8 per cent.
Mr Andrew Dilnot, director of the IFS, suggested that the chancellor could
announce a budget package that would phase in sharply reduced income tax
allowances.
He advocated a Budget that would:
Restrict personal allowances to the lowest 20 per cent income tax rate and
cut the basic rate to 24 per cent to raise Pounds 3bn.
Freeze tax allowances and thresholds at current levels to raise Pounds 1bn.
Raise a further Pounds 1bn from changes to national insurance contributions,
profit related pay rules and through the imposition of landfill charges.
Impose value added tax on newspapers and increase excise duties on
cigarettes to raise Pounds 500m.
Save the government Pounds 500m through tightening benefit rules.
Options for 1994: the Green Budget, Pounds 7.50 from IFS, 7 Ridgmount
Street, London WC1E 7AE.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Watchdog lists executive dodges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Audit Office report highlights some disqualification cases:
A case pending: a retail company went into liquidation in 1992 with debts of
Pounds 400,000. The directors had been previously responsible for two
companies which failed in similar circumstances. Conduct included
misapplication of goods and company funds, excessive director remuneration
and expenses, retention of customer deposits while knowingly insolvent, and
failure to keep adequate accounts books.
A case leading to disqualification of two directors for 10 years: a
manufacturing company entered voluntary liquidation in 1989 with debts of
more than Pounds 500,000. The directors advanced monies to a connected
company without due consideration; carried out transactions to the detriment
of specific creditors; maintained insufficient accounting records; and
traded without reasonable prospect of payment of creditors.
Insolvency practitioners also gave examples of the type of actions taken by
unfit directors.
A typical director of a company engaging in unfit conduct may have
deliberately paid off a bank overdraft in the months before the company
failed because the overdraft was secured against his or her own property.
Directors often reduce outstanding loans they have made to their company
before collapse, using their knowledge of the state of the finances unfairly
to put them ahead of other creditors to the company.
They may well be consistently late in paying tax to the Inland Revenue,
value added tax to Customs and Excise, and in sending annual returns to
Companies House.
Mr John Alexander, corporate insolvency partner with Pannell Kerr Forster in
London, said he often came across cases of directors who had used company
funds to pay for house extensions at the same time as rebuilding work at
their factory.
They may have holiday homes overseas, pay their spouses as though they were
company employees and give their children company cars. There may also be
corporate hospitality boxes at football or rugby clubs.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Japanese-owned plants sell to China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A JAPANESE-OWNED factory set up in the UK to serve the European market for
ball bearings has won its first orders from the Far East because of the
strength of the Japanese yen.
The NSK Bearings plant at Peterlee, County Durham, set up in 1976, was one
of the first inward investments in the north-east. Its Tokyo-based parent
company has now switched orders from its Japanese factories to the UK. The
Peterlee plant is to supply bearings for white goods industries in China and
Indonesia.
Mr David Smith, human resources director at Peterlee, said: 'We are
naturally delighted to win these orders. The uncompetitive yen exchange rate
meant our parent was going to have problems in profitably serving some Asian
markets.'
The order highlights the problems for Japanese manufacturers caused by
currency factors, as well as high domestic costs, over the past two years.
Many of them are considering exporting more of their output to overseas
plants.
Japanese manufacturers are also seeking to source components needed for
their domestic production plants from overseas. Komatsu, the biggest
Japanese construction equipment producer, recently announced that such
purchases would increase for its Japanese plants, with suppliers to Komatsu
UK being added to its procurement list for the first time.
Komatsu also manufactures in the north-east, producing hydraulic excavators
from a former Caterpillar plant at Birtley near Newcastle.
NSK's Peterlee operation - four plants employing about 820 people - normally
exports about 80 per cent of its bearings to continental Europe, with the
rest sold in the UK.
The recession in continental Europe has forced the company to reduce
operating volumes. But the Asian orders have helped avert an extended
Christmas break at Peterlee for the first time in two years.
'Peterlee was chosen to supply China and Indonesia because our quality is
high enough to take the place of Japanese-manufactured ball bearings,' said
Mr Smith. However he added that the UK company could not rely on the Asian
business in the long term and Europe continued to be very depressed, dragged
down mainly by the poor state of the German economy.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Channel 4 expects Pounds 200m surcharge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANNEL 4 forecast yesterday it would have to give more than Pounds 200m to
the ITV companies during its present 10-year licence period.
The scale of the cost of the 'insurance policy' to protect Channel 4's
financial structure was revealed in a submission to the Commons national
heritage committee, which is looking at the future of British broadcasting.
Under the Broadcasting Act 1990, half of any Channel 4 income in excess of
14 per cent of total independent television advertising revenue goes to the
ITV companies. The rest is placed in a reserve fund to compensate it if
revenues ever fall below 12 per cent.
Channel 4's board has assured the all-party committee that it intends to pay
its way throughout its 10-year licence and that as a result 'there will be
substantial transfers of money' from Channel 4 to ITV.
If Channel 4 is successful over the first half of the licence period the
level of reserves built up will more than cover any later downside risks.
This year ITV will get more than Pounds 30m from Channel 4 and the total is
expected to be more than Pounds 200m over the full licence period. Channel 4
expects revenue of Pounds 325m in 1993.
In spite of the high cost of the 'insurance policy', Channel 4 wants to
stick to the arrangement in the interests of stability.
Mr Michael Grade, Channel 4 chief executive, appealed to the MPs yesterday
for a period of stability. He also accused Sky Television of 'ripping off'
the public by charging large amounts for sporting events and films and said
it would be 'a tragedy' if Sky bought up events such as Wimbledon.
A US cable company has raised more than Pounds 270m to invest in building
cable television and telephone networks in the UK, the largest sum to be
raised by the industry so far it is believed.
International CableTel has raised Dollars 411m (Pounds 274m) in a mixture of
debt and equity in New York to build cable networks in England, Scotland and
Wales.
Altogether the company, which includes the former interests of Insight
Communications, holds franchises covering 950,000 homes in the UK. They are
for Huddersfield, Guildford, Cardiff and Newport and west Glasgow.

Roland Rudd finds former colleagues in harmony as they gang up on TV to
respond to charges by 'that woman'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER BEING savaged by Baroness Thatcher in her memoirs, the so-called
'wets' and 'grandees' have bitten back, attacking the style and policy of
what opponents have described as 'that woman'.
Lord Prior says Lady Thatcher was 'dictatorial'. Lord Pym says she was
against any suggestion of compromise, 'which meant she had a confrontational
style'. Lord Gilmour thinks her judgment was misguided. 'She very seldom
said a sentence in itself that was interesting. Rather surprising in all
those years.'
In a BBC documentary series, Thatcher: The Downing Street Years, starting
tonight, victims of the former prime minister describe their intense dislike
of her manner. Lady Thatcher's quotation of St Francis of Assisi, beginning
'where there is discord, may we bring harmony', is attacked by Lord Prior,
her former employment secretary, as 'complete humbug' and 'hypocritical'. It
was 'utter nonsense' for her to have used the quotation as she was the last
person to believe in harmony.
Lord Pym, her former foreign secretary, says her distain for compromise made
it very difficult to have constructive cabinet meetings. 'The idea that
somebody else might have a valid point of view which might be a right point
of view would never enter her mind at all. Not part of her philosophy.'
Lord Prior discloses that Lord Soames, who was leader of the House of the
Lords, told him that he would not have treated his gamekeeper as badly as
Lady Thatcher treated one of her cabinet.
Lord Gilmour recalls how he and Lord Carrington, who were then lord privy
seal and foreign secretary respectively, tried to negotiate a Pounds 1bn
refund from the EC at the 1979 Dublin summit and ended with only two thirds
of that amount. They thought they had done rather well. But when they told
her, she became 'incandescent'.
Lord Gilmour says: 'Had we been bailiffs coming to take away the furniture I
think we would have been more cordially received. She was like a sort of
firework, and one could almost hear her almost sizzling.'
Lord Carrington believes Lady Thatcher 'did the Foreign Office a great deal
of damage'. He has also said: 'All of us had learned over 30 years or so to
come to compromises. This is something she hadn't started to learn.'
Lady Thatcher recognises that she was unpopular with many colleagues and
throughout the country but was determined to stick to her guns. 'My name was
mud with some of my colleagues. They always wanted, some of them, an easy
way. But I always had enough to get us through.'
She says they talked of her as 'that woman'. 'It was that woman which got
things done. It never occured to me that I was a woman prime minister.' As
for her critics she says: 'They had that biblical weakness - some of them,
not all of them - vanity, vanity, all is vanity.'
The only former colleague interviewed who remains loyal is Lord Whitelaw,
former deputy prime minister, who points out that the Tories won three
general elections under Lady Thatcher's leadership.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Growth seen in London economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S ECONOMY was yesterday given a qualified seal of approval by the
London Chamber of Commerce, which reported a slow improvement in business
but continued job losses.
In the chamber's third-quarter survey of member companies, both
manufacturing and service sectors reported improved domestic activity with
more businesses expecting profits to rise in the months ahead than at any
time in the past 3 1/2 years.
Exports weakened, however, particularly among manufacturing companies with
33 per cent of them reporting a drop in export orders against 29 per cent
reporting an increase.
On balance, companies expected to increase investment over the next 12
months. Among manufacturers, 27 per cent said they planned to revise upwards
their investment plans against 7 per cent predicting a downwards revision.
Among service-sector companies 24 per cent forecast higher investment
against 4 per cent predicting a fall.
Demands for government help for manufacturing were stepped up yesterday by
the Confederation of British Industry and the Engineering Employers'
Federation, Tim Burt writes.
Both organisations called for new policies to encourage investment in
industry, claiming such moves were vital if companies were to raise finance
for expansion.
The CBI said at a manufacturing seminar in Birmingham attended by Mr Tim
Sainsbury, industry minister, that the government should replace the
Business Expansion Scheme with a new system to raise 'seedbed finance'.
However, Mr Sainsbury said that industry did not want to see government
intervention beyond the pursuit of a low-inflation strategy for growth.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Call to bar more unfit directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEWER THAN a fifth of directors who show signs of being unfit to run their
companies are being pursued for disqualification, the National Audit Office
says today.
The public-spending watchdog says in a report that even in cases where the
directors of collapsed companies have demonstrated seriously deficient
conduct, the government has pursued legal action against just two-thirds of
those brought to its attention.
The details come in the first detailed examination of procedures for
punishing executives since the regime was introduced through the Directors'
Disqualification Act in 1986.
The watchdog criticises the government's Insolvency Service, which is part
of the Department of Trade and Industry, and also raises concerns about the
conduct of insolvency practitioners in the private sector.
The study shows that there have been about 153,000 corporate insolvencies
from 1987 to 1993, of which 28,541 - or 19 per cent - involved some
incidence of unfit conduct.
It estimates that about 15 per cent of these cases - or 4,278 - involved
serious 'public interest' breaches, but that there had been just 2,891
directions to begin disqualification proceedings against directors, and
1,935 against companies. Only 1,700 have so far led to successful director
disqualifications.
The report highlighted considerable regional variations between the
performance of the Insolvency Service's offices. The average time to select
a case for investigation varied from 21 days to 57 days.
While the number of compulsory insolvencies - handled by the official
receiver's office - rose 160 per cent between 1987 and 1993, the number of
cases submitted for disqualification proceedings fell.
Some official receivers were investigating less important 'public interest'
cases for potential disqualification before more serious ones.
The NAO said that 78 per cent of statutory reports, required to be filed to
the DTI from insolvency practitioners, were submitted after the deadline
which is six months from their appointment. More than one-fifth of these
late returns were filed at least one year after the appointment.
It also showed that 34 per cent of reports filed by practitioners were
incomplete, with important documents omitted such as statements of affairs
and audited accounts.
It said Companies House, part of the DTI, had failed to maintain a complete
list of disqualified directors and there was not sufficient effort to ensure
that these people resigned existing directorships and did not take any new
ones.
Three-quarters of a sample of 103 insolvency practitioners surveyed for the
report said an insufficient number of directors were being disqualified.
Just one-third believed that the existing arrangements deterred unfit
conduct, and one-quarter that disqualification was successful in protecting
the public.
A separate survey of 517 company directors showed that nearly 60 per cent
were unaware of the existence of the act and 57 per cent said they were not
well informed about disqualification procedures. But 43 per cent believed
that insufficient numbers of directors were being disqualified.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Orange juice goes on VAT list
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CUSTOMS &amp; EXCISE yesterday squeezed value added tax out of orange juice
sellers after conflicting results in appeals by manufacturers last year.
The 1993 Valued Added Tax (Beverages) Order, which was introduced in
parliament yesterday, extends from the end of this year standard-rate VAT to
all beverages except milk and other named exemptions.
Customs said the change would provide up to Pounds 5m in additional VAT
revenues, but stressed that it had introduced the change to introduce
consistency to the rules. Its decision followed 'representations from UK
apple juice producers' who were keen that their products, which are
VAT-rated, should be treated in the same way as similar juices.

TIMBER farmers in Shropshire and the Welsh borders have secured a 'coals to
Newcastle' export deal with an order from Sweden for fir trees, the Forestry
Commission said yesterday.
Rundvirke Stab, a pole manufacturer, turned to the UK for supplies of
Douglas firs because Scandinavian producers do not have trees large enough.
The company, which needs the timber for 80ft poles to support power lines,
has placed an order worth Pounds 75,000 with Forest Enterprises, the
business arm of the commission.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Multinationals pay directors 6%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS of UK subsidiaries of multinational enterprises enjoyed median pay
increases of 6 per cent this year, according to the latest survey of
managerial pay in Europe published yesterday by Monks Partnership, the
British consultants.
After adjustment for inflation the increase in UK was 3.3 per cent, compared
with 3.1 per cent in France and 3.4 per cent in Germany.
According to the survey, Britain's directors earn after tax just under
Pounds 30,000 a year which puts them in 10th position in the European
earnings table with only the Nordic countries below.
But the UK tops the table on company cars. A total of 87 per cent of senior
managers in companies with an annual turnover of more than Pounds 20m have a
company car, compared with 78 per cent of German senior managers and 55 per
cent in France.
The average pay settlement in the engineering industry for the three months
to September was 2.3 per cent, the Engineering Employers Federation's latest
pay survey found. This compares with 2.49 per cent for the June to August
period.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Signs of revival in executive recruiting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXECUTIVE recruitment is showing signs of recovery with the highest growth
for five years recorded in demand for staff, the latest quarterly survey by
MSL, the human resource consultancy, shows, Robert Taylor writes.
Overall senior recruitment rose by 15 per cent but the biggest growth in
demand has been in the high technology sector, which rose 117 per cent in
the quarter to September, followed by sales and marketing with a 73 per cent
improvement. There was a 50 per cent increase in the demand for senior
managers in retailing, 48 per cent in energy related industries, and 27 per
cent in general management.
The survey's quarterly index - which began in 1959 - is based on the
monitoring of advertised demand for executives and managers.
The trend for the first six months of the year was flat although this was an
improvement on the previous 17 months of steady decline.

DEMANDS for government help for manufacturing were stepped up yesterday by
the Confederation of British Industry and the Engineering Employers'

Both organisations called for new policies to encourage investment in
industry, claiming such moves were vital if companies were to raise finance
for expansion.
The CBI said at a manufacturing seminar in Birmingham attended by Mr Tim
Sainsbury, industry minister, that the government should replace the
Business Expansion Scheme with a new system to raise 'seedbed finance'.
Mr Mark Radcliffe, CBI adviser on industry, said: 'The government is not
doing enough in areas where it has unique responsibility. We want to see
more help for new small and medium-size companies and enhanced credits for
exporters.'
His call was backed by Mr Neil Johnson, director-general of the Engineering
Employers' Federation.
He said the government must restructure tax allowances for investors.
The minister, however, said industry did not want to see government
intervention beyond the pursuit of a low inflation strategy for growth.
London's economy was yesterday given a qualified seal of approval by the

DOCTORS' leaders have been asked by the government to identify urgent
medical conditions which should receive hospital treatment within about six
weeks, Alan Pike writes.
The move comes amid growing concern that funding pressures are already

The medical royal colleges are producing definitions of conditions that
should be treated as a matter of urgency. The information will be passed to
the Department of Health by the end of this month.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Labour stars seek shadow roles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VAST MAJORITY of Labour's 271 MPs will today visit a room in the Commons
to cast their votes in the party's annual popularity stakes.
The results of their deliberations will determine whether Mr John Smith will
have changes to his shadow cabinet forced upon him.
The Labour leader retains full authority to shuffle portfolios but can
choose only from among the 18 MPs elected by their colleagues.
Mr Smith has not decided whether to reshuffle if the same 18 are elected,
although it is expected that he would.
Forecasting the outcome of these polls is hazardous - the quality of a
shadow cabinet member's performance is a notoriously unreliable guide.
This year a series of factors has combined to produce even greater
uncertainty than usual.
This will be the first shadow cabinet election to be conducted by secret
ballot, featuring much tighter restrictions on proxy voting. Some believe
this guarantee of anonymity could have a significant impact.
MPs must now include four women in their 18 nominations, up from three last
year. This has led to a widespread view that the number of women in the
shadow cabinet is set to rise from five.
But the water has been muddied by the fact that there are no fewer than 15
women among the 44 MPs standing. The result could be that votes are so
widely spread among these women candidates that no more are elected.
At least six women not in the shadow cabinet stand some chance of election.
The front runners are thought to be Ms Clare Short, an environment
spokeswoman; Ms Joyce Quin, employment; Ms Llin Golding, social security;
and Ms Dawn Primarolo, health.
One final source of uncertainty is that the 69 Labour MPs who entered
parliament in 1992 now know the candidates much better. Last year they had
to vote within months of arriving at Westminster.
In spite of this, the most commonly expressed view is that there will be few
changes.
Among those most likely to benefit from any reshuffle is Mr John Prescott,
the long-serving shadow transport secretary. Mr Smith certainly owes him a
favour after his speech in Brighton which was widely held to have swung the
critical vote on selection reforms in Mr Smith's favour.

FT  20 OCT 93 / PM refuses to axe charity tax relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS in a Home Office-sponsored report that charitable tax relief
should be abolished were firmly rejected by Mr John Major last night.
'It is the privilege of everyone to submit reports to government
departments, but it is the right of government ministers to reject them,' he
said. 'And this prime minister does just that. I want to make it clear that
tax relief for charitable giving is here to stay.'
Abolition of tax relief was among a range of controversial recommendations
in a report by three former advisers to the Home Office's voluntary services
unit.
Mr Major told Business in the Community's Per Cent Club - a group of leading
companies committed to community involvement - that the government had
increased incentives for individual and corporate charitable donations
through the inheritance, income and corporation tax systems. 'I stand
four-square behind the tax concessions we have made to the voluntary
sector,' he said.
Voluntary-sector leaders will be relieved that Mr Major has stamped on the
suggestion of withdrawing tax concessions.
Other aspects of the report - notably a suggestion that charities providing
government-funded welfare services should surrender their campaigning role -
has stimulated considerable debate.
Mr Major announced other initiatives to promote the voluntary sector in his
speech. These included plans for a national network of volunteers.
A new award scheme will encourage people to offer themselves for voluntary
work. Local organisations will be able to bid for grants for projects that
increase the scale and impact of voluntary effort. The first awards will be
made next year.
The government, said Mr Major, was working with the Prince's Trust charity
to encourage more young volunteers, and the number of awards for voluntary
service would double to more than 300 in future honours lists.
A deregulation task force studying burdens on the voluntary sector is due to
report by Christmas and, the prime minister said, has already identified 50
potential areas for reform. 'When you have to obtain more than 10 different
licences or permits just to run the village hall, when you spend more time
fending off environmental health officers, social workers, fire officers
than giving the service you want to give, then no wonder some people think
it's not worth it. They give their time for free, they don't expect it to be
wasted by bureaucracy.'

FT  20 OCT 93 / FO 'ignored' fears on Jordan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN Office officials deliberately ignored intelligence experts who were
worried that Jordan might be used for diverting weapons of mass destruction
to Iraq, the Scott inquiry heard yesterday.
As a result, Jordan's name was obliterated from a list of suspect countries
published in parliament in December 1991.
Mr Simon Fuller, who headed the Foreign Office's Near East and North Africa
department between 1990 and 1993, described a series of intelligence reports
on sanctions-busting in Jordan as irrelevant to the country's inclusion on
the list.
One report said chemicals which could be used in explosives were going to
Iraq through Jordan in September 1991. Another report said that officials of
Technology and Development Group, the former London-based nerve centre for
Iraqi procurement, were attempting to re-establish their operation in
Jordan.
Mr Fuller said he had supported the removal of Jordan from the list in spite
of the opposition of defence intelligence experts at a Cabinet Office
meeting where the matter was discussed. Three intelligence officials had
left the meeting believing Jordan would be listed.
In a heated exchange with Lord Justice Scott, Mr Fuller said the government
would have been accusing Jordan of a 'heinous crime' had it included the
country on its list. This was because the listing would suggest there had
been irrefutable evidence that Jordan was diverting exports to supply Iraq's
chemical weapons programme where no such evidence existed.
Lord Justice Scott described his suggestion as 'fanciful'. Mr Fuller told
the inquiry that he knew of only one instance since 1985 of a British
military export to Jordan diverted on to Iraq.
He said that the matter had been raised with King Hussein of Jordan, who
promised that diversions would not happen again.
Mr Fuller added that the Joint Intelligence Committee, the main Whitehall
body responsible for security, had not turned up any evidence of military
deliveries from Jordan to Iraq since the imposition of UN sanctions at the
time of the invasion of Kuwait.
He said this had been the case up to the end of 1991 and still remains to
his knowledge.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Campaign aims to alter tunnel vision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CAMPAIGN by Eurotunnel, operator of the Channel tunnel, to counter the
public's innate suspicion of being linked to mainland Europe begins this
week, Diane Summers writes.
Newspaper advertisements (above) will aim to explain how the tunnel
car-passenger service from Folkestone to Calais will operate from next May.
The Pounds 2m advertisements will form part of a wider Pounds 25m
pan-European campaign to publicise 'Le Shuttle'.
Eurotunnel said there was still widespread ignorance about how it would
work.
BMP DDB Needham, which devised the advertisements, said the public was less
interested in the engineering achievements of the tunnel than how the
shuttle would work in practice.
The 1990s marketing techniques are being applied to an idea that dates back
more than a century. Work on the first Channel tunnel began during the 1880s
at Folkestone, Kent (below).
By 1888, 2,000 yards had been dug from England but fears over national
security forced the government of the day to scrap the project.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Interest in new town property up sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Commission for New Towns yesterday reported a doubling of inquiries
during the past six months from potential purchasers of land and buildings,
Michael Cassell writes.
The commission, which is responsible for selling the assets of the 21 former
English new towns, said improved marketing techniques and a revival in
economic confidence had led to a revival of interest in its property
portfolio.
Sir Neil Shields, commission chairman, said that nearly 1,800 specific
inquiries had been received since April, more than double the total recorded
during the same period a year earlier.
He added: 'After several years of uncertainty and depressed property
markets, it is encouraging to report some signs of an upturn. This is in no
way to suggest unalloyed optimism about the future of asset sales, but it is
an indication that perhaps the worst is behind us.'
Sir Neil said interest from overseas companies had strengthened in recent
months, not just from traditional sources such as the Far East but also from
continental Europe. He cited one Taiwanese manufacturing company which is to
close its plant in Germany and relocate at an existing facility in Telford,
Shropshire, 'because of lower costs and a more supportive environment'.
The recession, however, ensured that receipts from property and land sales
in 1992-93 fell to their lowest level since the mid-1980s. The commission
registered 435 sales of land and property during the year to April compared
with 837 in the previous year.
The value of commission sales including commercial property, development
sites and housing land totalled Pounds 136.5m against Pounds 177.4m for
1991-92.
Sales to date, which have raised more than Pounds 2bn in the past decade,
leave the commission with a portfolio of 18,000 acres of housing and
commercial land spread throughout England. Half of it has planning
permission. There is also 2.5m sq ft of available commercial premises for
sale.
The commission announced earlier this month that it is to be split into two
agencies.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Shadow roles sought by Labour stars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VAST MAJORITY of Labour's 271 MPs will today visit a small room in the
Commons to cast their votes in the party's annual popularity stakes.
The results of their deliberations will determine whether Mr John Smith will
have changes to his shadow cabinet forced upon him.
The Labour leader retains full authority to shuffle portfolios but can only
choose from among the 18 MPs elected by their colleagues.
Mr Smith has not decided whether to reshuffle if the same 18 are elected,
although it is expected that he would.
Forecasting the outcome of these polls is hazardous - the quality of a
shadow cabinet member's performance is a notoriously unreliable guide.
This year a series of factors has combined to produce even greater
uncertainty than usual.
For one thing, this will be the first ever shadow cabinet election to be
conducted by secret ballot, featuring much tighter restrictions on proxy
voting than in the past.
Some participants believe this guarantee of anonymity could have a
significant impact on how MPs cast their votes.
For another, MPs must now include four women in their 18 nominations, up
from three last year. This has led to a widespread assumption that the
number of women in the shadow cabinet is set to rise from five at present.
But the water has been muddied by the fact that there are no fewer than 15
women among the 44 MPs standing for election. While it is possible therefore
that the female contingent will increase, it could equally transpire that
votes are so widely spread among these women candidates that no more are
elected.
One final source of uncertainty is that the 69 Labour MPs who entered
parliament in 1992 - more than a quarter of the electorate - now know the
candidates much better. In last year's ballot they had to vote within months
of arriving at Westminster.
In spite of this, the most commonly expressed view is that there will be few
changes.
Among those most likely to benefit from any subsequent reshuffle is Mr John
Prescott. Mr Smith certainly owes his long-serving shadow transport
secretary a favour after his powerful speech in Brighton which was widely
held to have swung the critical vote on selection reforms in Mr Smith's
favour.
It is also speculated that Mr Smith might want to move Mr Jack Cunningham,
shadow foreign secretary, and Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief Treasury
secretary, neither of whom are thought to have found their feet.
The most vulnerable are arguably Mr Tom Clarke, shadow Scottish secretary,
Mr Ron Davies, shadow Welsh secretary, who won the race to replace Mr Bryan
Gould after his resignation, and Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary.
Ms Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, is also expected to see a decline
in her support.
As usual, it is Mr George Robertson, a frontbench foreign affairs spokesman,
who heads the list of those waiting in the wings. His impressive
performances during the passage of the Maastricht bill may help him add to
his tally last year when he was 22 votes short of a shadow cabinet seat.
At least six women not in the cabinet stand some chance of being elected.
The front runners are generally thought to be Ms Clare Short, an environment
spokeswoman, Ms Joyce Quin, employment, Ms Llin Golding, social security,
and Ms Dawn Primarolo, health.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Ulster peace overture heralds uncertain finale: What has
been agreed in the latest initiative seeking a settlement in the province
and what are its chances of leading to something more solid?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAN an overture for peace in Northern Ireland which has been welcomed by the
IRA be taken seriously?
The welcome comes from people who have pushed home their political message,
not just through megaphones in street rallies, or through hunger strikes in
prison, but with the car bomb and the silenced pistol shot in the night.
That is the question that will face Mr John Major, the prime minister, next
week when he hears from the Irish government the details of the recent peace
initiative created by Mr John Hume of the Social Democratic and Labour
party, and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Provisional IRA.
The two nationalist leaders from the province say that, after six months of
bilateral discussions, they are 'convinced that a process can be designed to
lead to agreement among the divided people of this island, which will
provide a solid basis for peace'.
With the Treasury pressing hard for deep defence cuts, the IRA believes the
temptation for Mr Major must be at least to explore what may be offered.
At the same time, however, Mr Major's precarious Westminster majority and
the threat of further backbench revolts has increased his dependence on the
support of the Ulster Unionist party, led by Mr James Molyneaux.
Mr Molyneaux, who sees treachery and betrayal of the Union behind the
Hume-Adams initiative, thus has a powerful weapon with which to attack it.
And attack it he has, saying last week in no uncertain terms: 'We reject
Hume-Adams. It is sheer lunacy.'
So what is there for Mr Major to chew on in this initiative, and what makes
it different from the many failed peace initiatives of the past two decades?
First, it is not coming solely from Mr Adams.
It is co-authored by Mr John Hume, a widely respected lifelong opponent of
using violence for political ends. His political inspiration is drawn from
figures such as Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi rather than such
traditional republican heroes as Wolfe Tone or James Connolly.
Second, the initiative has the blessing of the Irish government, which has
as much interest as the British government in seeing a peaceful settlement
of the conflict in Northern Ireland.
Mr Hume and Mr Adams have agreed to keep details of the initiative secret
until both governments have had time to evaluate it. But recent interviews
with both men allow the following outline to be pieced together:
The initiative envisages a three-stage process, beginning with the search
for a mechanism to bring about a cessation of hostilities. It would then
progress through a protracted period of all-inclusive negotiations on the
future constitutional status of Northern Ireland and culminate in a
simultaneous referendum north and south of the border on any proposed
changes.
Mr Hume and Mr Adams do not have any blueprint for a future constitutional
settlement, but are united in believing that Unionists should not be allowed
to block the British government's own efforts to achieve political progress
and dialogue.
Mr Hume and Mr Adams would accept the outcome of a referendum, even if a
majority in Northern Ireland were to reject a solution which would favour a
nationalist perspective.
In relation to the last point, Mr Hume said a simultaneous referendum both
north and south of the border 'would require a Yes from each. If either says
No, it's not on. How much further can I go to reassure Unionists? I have not
even suggested what a final agreement should look like, nor has Gerry
Adams,' he said.
On that same point, Mr Adams said: 'I and Sinn Fein want to see an Irish
national democracy but what form that takes is for the Irish people to
decide.'
He said that were Sinn Fein's goal of a united Ireland to be rejected in a
referendum, even just by a northern majority 'we would continue to seek a
Republican model but through the normal political process'.
Mr Adams was not prepared at this stage to reveal what might be the minimum
terms the IRA would find acceptable to lay down their guns. But he told the
Financial Times that he would like to see the IRA 'in permanent retirement'
and that the Republican movement was prepared to make concessions to end the
violence.
He said: 'We are trying to take the armed element out of the conflict, all
aspects of it and not just the IRA. British forces are one element and the
loyalist paramilitaries are another.
'We are trying to put together a political process, such that those
presently involved in the military side of the struggle can become involved
in a political process, putting aside the military aspect.
'I would like to see the IRA in permanent retirement. The Unionists have no
monopoly in wanting peace.'
He continued: 'John Hume and I do not profess to have all the answers.
Others also have to grasp the nettle as well, and we may have to make it
easier for them to do so. If our proposals are not good enough, then let's
hear why and see if people at this end can accommodate them.
'Everything is possible if the British government has the political will to
move this process forward.'
The Northern Ireland Office (NIO) has responded with predictable caution to
Mr Adams remarks.
It said yesterday: 'Is there anyone who does not want to see all the
paramilitaries in permanent retirement? Ending violence is enough of a
valid, and long overdue aim in itself without it having to be paid for in
concessions or pre-conditions. There can be no concessions to violence.'
An NIO spokesman also referred to a speech by the Northern Ireland
secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, in Coleraine last December: 'In the event of
a genuine and established cessation of violence the whole range of responses
that we have had to make to that violence could and would inevitably be
looked at afresh.'
Clearly the biggest hurdle to the entire Hume-Adams initiative, however, is
whether terms can now be agreed for the IRA to hand in its weapons, without
either the British or Irish governments giving the impression they are in
any way negotiating with the IRA or Sinn Fein.
Such an impression could prompt a unionist backlash and the well rehearsed
cries of a political sell-out, together with a likely escalation of loyalist
violence.
Neither Mr Hume nor Mr Adams has any illusions that their initiative faces
intense hostility from unionists, and both are deeply concerned that the
Conservative-UUP alliance at Westminster will prevent their proposals from
being fully explored.
Mr Hume has raised the stakes by putting his political career on the line in
backing the initiative. If it fails, so will his credibility as leader of
the SDLP.
As the focus now shifts to the British and Irish governments' responses,
which are expected next week, they must be well aware of the significance of
such a failure and the message it will send to the IRA.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Major spurns move by nationalists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday discounted the possibility that the Hume-Adams peace
initiative will lead to a breakthrough in attempts to secure peace in
Northern Ireland. He told MPs that he knew nothing of what had been agreed
by the two nationalist leaders.
The prime minister also delivered a scarcely veiled rebuke to Mr Albert
Reynolds. He said the Irish premier's announcement that he was to have talks
on the initiative with Mr Major in Brussels next week was 'uncleared with
me'.
If Mr Reynolds wished to raise matters that he believed would bring violence
to an end in Northern Ireland, 'then I am compelled to listen', Mr Major
said.
He emphasised again his government's refusal to negotiate with terrorists.
'We do not negotiate with people who deal with bullet and bomb and we do not
surrender to their violence either now or in the future,' he said in
comments which brought cheers from the Ulster Unionist party benches.
His remarks came just two days after Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist
leader, dismissed the Hume-Adams initiative as 'sheer lunacy'.
Mr Major is under pressure to take account of the Ulster Unionist position
because of the precariousness of his 17-strong Westminster majority.
His meeting with Mr Reynolds is expected to take place two days after the
next scheduled meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference in Belfast next
Wednesday.
Mr Major's comments came as the Institute for Public Policy Research, the
left-of-centre think-tank, published a plan for a new constitution for the
province in which sovereignty would be shared by its people and the British
and Irish governments.
Mr Kevin McNamara, Labour's Northern Ireland spokesman, said the IPPR model
deserved 'considered examination' but the party had no plans to change its
policy of unity only by consent.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Battle over rice imports will test coalition: Hosokawa faces
a tough time selling Japan's concession on farm trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE rice farmers took to the streets of Tokyo last week in protest at
the government's offer in the Gatt negotiations on world trade
liberalisation to phase out the country's ban on rice imports.
Japan, seeking to avoid being blamed for delaying the Uruguay Round talks,
said informally it would open its rice market after a six-year moratorium.
The move angered many farmers, but most are aware that an eventual opening
of the Japanese rice market is inevitable.
Since taking office, the prime minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, and his
cabinet have made the ritual protests against rice liberalisation.
However, before becoming prime minister, Mr Hosokawa was in favour of an
open rice market. Furthermore, he is supported by the backroom power broker,
Mr Ichiro Ozawa of the Japan Renewal party. The key posts of agriculture
minister, foreign minister, and minister of international trade, are held by
JRP members.
Japan's controversial offer, leaked to the press last week, includes a
six-year grace period of tarification on rice, during which it will accept
imports equal to 3 to 5 per cent of domestic rice consumption. US officials
point out that while it remains to be seen if other countries will accept
the plan, Japan's move was a 'big step forward'.
Even if other Gatt members accept Japan's plan, Mr Hosokawa will need to
convince coalition members who staunchly oppose rice imports.
The socialists, who rely on the rural vote, have generally opposed lifting
the import ban. Some are threatening to leave the coalition if the ban is
lifted.
The Liberal Democratic party, strong in rural constituencies, also opposes
liberalisation. The LDP, however, risks being split over the rice issue,
since some LDP members, including young urban MPs, support liberalisation.
In order to avoid a rift within the coalition disrupting the debate over
political reform currently under way in parliament, the government is
considering a parliamentary vote over rice imports. In 1988, parliament
unanimously voted against opening the rice market.
But having lost much of its support base in the recent election, the
Socialist party does not seem to have much choice other than eventually to
side with Mr Hosokawa. Many of the younger members feel the party will not
have much to gain by leaving the coalition government, and are calling for
the party to accept liberalisation.
Mr Jeff Young, political analyst at brokers Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, says:
'The only chance for the socialists' survival is to cling to the coalition.'
There is a high possibility they will opt for concessions likely to be
offered by Mr Hosokawa, such as income support for farmers, instead of
abandoning the coalition.
Mr Hosokawa is also trying to weaken the strong rice lobby by electoral
reform, which will ease the disparity between the rural and urban vote. By
redefining the constituencies, he wants to weaken the clout of the rural
vote, which can be worth up to three urban votes.
It is likely that Japan will officially make its offer after the EC and US
settle their disagreement over agricultural trade, thus placing Japan at the
centre of the negotiations and allowing the government to say it has
defended farmers' interests in the face of international pressure.

Japan, seeking to avoid being blamed for delaying the Uruguay Round world
trade talks, said informally it would open its rice market after a six-year

But while many farmers are angered by the government's move, most are aware
that an eventual opening of the Japanese rice market is would be inevitable.
Only last year, the then prime minister Mr Kiichi Miyazawa called for
'flexibility' on the rice issue, while members of his cabinet moved to build
public opinion for the opening of the rice market.
The government started to prepare a package to liberalise the rice market
following rising prospects of an early agreement of the Uruguay Round.
However, Mr Miyazawa managed to escape making the big decision to open the
market, as the government shelved plans to lift the import ban earlier this
year after the US and EC failed to agree on farm subsidies.
The prime minister, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, and his cabinet are making the
ritual protests against rice liberalisation.
However, before becoming prime minister, Mr Hosokawa was in favour of an
open rice market. Furthermore, he is supported by the back room power

FT  20 OCT 93 / Keating pulls off Aborigine land rights deal: Compromise
package satisfies most farmers, mining interests and Aborigines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAUL Keating, the Australian prime minister, has not enjoyed too many
political successes in recent months. But yesterday he was finally able to
declare that the issue of Aborigine land rights, which has provoked a storm
of controversy in the mining and farming sectors, was a big step closer to
resolution.
A compromise package, which clears the way for legislation later this year,
was carved out in a long cabinet meeting on Monday night. As the details
became clearer during the day, cautious support from many of the interested
parties - including the mining and farming lobbies - began to emerge.
All this was the result of some hairy, last-minute bargaining. On Monday
afternoon, for example, Mr Keating told parliament that land which was held
under pastoral leases could be subject to native title claims - a statement
which reversed an earlier government commitment to farmers.
Yet by the time the cabinet meeting broke up in the small hours of Tuesday
morning, this concession to the Aborigine contingent had been dropped.
Instead, Aboriginal representatives agreed to an alternative proposal - that
they be allowed to convert their own pastoral leases into native title, thus
giving them permanent security on such land.
For the past 16 months, it has been touch-and-go whether the government
could broker a solution to a High Court decision which makes land rights
legislation imperative. This ruling was handed down in June 1992, when the
court determined that the Meriam people in the Torres Strait were holders of
native title on about nine square kilometres of land. The judgment became
known as the 'Mabo' decision, after Eddie Mabo, leader of the Meriam people
who had begun the court action a decade earlier.
The land involved in Mabo may have been modest, but the implications were
huge. Australian law had always operated on the assumption that the land was
unoccupied before European settlement - the principle of 'terra nullius'.
The High Court, by contrast, ruled that native title claims could be
successful where the indigenous people had maintained a close connection
with the land, although it also said that land titles acquired under
accepted law since European settlement should not be disturbed.
To complicate matters further, the Mabo decision determined that states and
territories could extinguish native title - but only in accordance with the
country's constitution and laws, notably the 1975 Racial Discrimination Act.
In short, compensation could be required.
Unfortunately, the High Court ruling was made in the narrow context of one
claim, and gave little guidance on the practical application of these
principles. From the outset, the federal government was forced to tread a
fine line between meeting Aboriginal demands, now backed up by the Mabo
ruling, and delivering a degree of reassurance to existing land users, such
as the mining companies and farmers, so that economic stability was not
threatened. To make the task harder, it also had to juggle a delicate
relationship with Australia's states and territories, traditionally
responsible for land management.
The final package, as agreed by the cabinet this week, is complex.
Essentially, it will allow indigenous people to pursue claims for native
title either through the federal court or through state jurisdiction.
Decisions on the economic use of land, however, will remain the domain of
the states, provided they comply with the 'spirit and principles' of the
Commonwealth legislation.
All existing leases can be 'validated', and native title will then be
extinguished for all categories other than mining leases. Governments will
pick up any compensation costs resulting from validation of existing grants
and 'there will be further discussions with states and territories on
cost-sharing arrangements between the Commonwealth and complying states'.
Where land is subject to native title, the indigenous holders will not have
a veto on development, but they will have a 'right to negotiation'. Mr
Keating's statement suggested that the time limits for negotiation would be
set at four months in the case of exploration licences, and six months for
mining leases. There would also be four- and six-month arbitration periods
for the two respective categories.
Will the package fly? On the political front, the Australian Democrats, one
of the two minority parties whose parliamentary support is essential,
welcomed the package. State premiers in New South Wales and South Australia
and the chief minister in the Northern Territory reserved judgment, but
Queensland and Victoria came out in support.
National Federation of Farmers supported the deal. Even the Australian
Mining Industry Council, an umbrella group for the large mining companies,
gave lukewarm endorsement. It noted that the package would at least provide
certainty by validating existing leases. But the AMIC still quarrelled with
the lack of parity between mining and pastoral leases; claimed that native
title claimants' right to choose between federal and state jurisdictions
would prove unwieldy; and maintained that all states would need to be
supportive for the package to work.
This may be the sticking point. Western Australia - a key natural resources
state - has taken the hardest line against the federal proposals to date.
Yesterday, Mr Richard Court, the Liberal premier, said the legislation could
lead to long court battles, and pointed out that up to 40 per cent of the
state may be subject to native title claim. He is due to hold talks with Mr
Keating's legal advisers in Melbourne today.
The Aborigines' response, meanwhile, was mixed. Although Aboriginal
representatives were closely involved in the final negotiations, more
radical elements within the indigenous community were far from impressed.
'It's the coming of the second invasion,' said Mr Bob Weatherall, a
Brisbane-based activist and chairman of the Aboriginal Provisional
Government.
It was up to Aboriginal people to prove that native title existed rather
than the other way round, he commented. 'The High Court made it plain that
it was wrong for governments and commercial groups to collude in taking away
Aboriginal land interests in the past without accounting to Aboriginal
people. It must be equally wrong for the federal parliament, and the states
and territories, in 1993 to repeat the dose by 'validating'.'

<TEXT>
THE 64-day impasse over the Australian budget ended yesterday when the
federal government reached a deal with minority parties, who hold the
balance of power in the Senate.
This should ensure that the government's revenue-raising proposals can pass
through both houses. Previously, the Senate had voted down two elements of
the package - a second round of wholesale tax increases, due to come into
effect in 1995, and measures to increase wine tax.
The main negotiations yesterday centred on the two Green Party senators.
They emerged from the discussions late in the afternoon to announce that the
government would make a series of concessions to compensate for the
wholesale tax increases. These would include:
A ADollars 3 (Pounds 1.20) increase in the job search allowance for the
short-term unemployed from March next year.
An extra ADollars 1 a child a week in family payments to low-income
families.
An extra ADollars 2m in emergency programme payments.
Abandonment of the higher education charge for students taking more than the
minimum time to complete their degrees.
The two Greens also negotiated to have future wine tax increases examined by
an independent inquiry, headed by Mr John Button, a former industry
minister, rather than by the Industry Commission.
Commenting on the changes, Mr Paul Keating, the prime minster, said he
believed the agreement was 'a reasonable compromise which does not undermine
the government's medium term debt reduction strategy and is consistent with
the intentions of the government for future budgets'.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Russia spurns Japan's plea over dumping

FRESH tension entered relations between Japan and Russia yesterday, when
Tokyo issued a formal protest over Russian dumping of nuclear waste in the
Sea of Japan.
Mr Lyudvig Chizhov, the Russian ambassador to Japan, was summoned to the
Foreign Ministry to receive a demand that no further dumping should occur.
Mr Chizhov was reported to have replied that Russia did not plan to end the
practice, because of inadequate storage on land.
At the same time, the US lent Japan its support by urging Russia to honour
an international moratorium on dumping nuclear waste at sea.
The dumping, last Sunday, of 900 tonnes of low-level coolant and cleaning
water from Russia's ageing fleet of nuclear submarines, has provoked
widespread anger in Japan.
It came only a week after strained relations with Russia looked set to
improve, thanks to a diplomatically successful visit to Tokyo by Mr Boris
Yeltsin, the Russian president.
The Foreign Ministry asked Mr Chizhov to ensure that the Moscow government
cancelled plans to dump a second load of radioactive waste by November 15
and repeated an offer to help Russia dispose of nuclear waste on its own
territory.
'It is absolutely deplorable. We shall strongly protest if Russia goes ahead
with plans to dump nuclear waste again,' said Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's
foreign minister.
The complaint was delivered after a cabinet meeting in which several
ministers voiced anger.
Officials from both sides are to meet in Moscow on November 11 and 12 to
discuss the problem of radioactive waste dumping at sea.
Russia informed the International Atomic Energy Agency in advance, an agency
official confirmed yesterday.
The moratorium on dumping only covers high-level waste, though signatory
countries had also voluntarily decided not to dump low-level material, he
said.
The radioactivity of both loads of waste, as registered by the Russians, was
within agency guidelines.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Money supply grows faster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE money supply increased its growth rate slightly last month, adding
weight to banking industry claims that there is no credit shortage.
The broadly defined aggregate of M2 (cash in circulation and time and demand
deposits) plus certificates of deposit rose 2 per cent in September, against
the same month last year, having risen 1.7 per cent in August, the Bank of
Japan said yesterday. It attributed the September rise, the sixth monthly
increase in a row, to greater corporate fund raising in the capital markets,
rather than more bank lending.
This coincided with an announcement from the Federation of Bankers'
Associations of Japan, the main industry body, that it had asked members to
back the government's recent economic stimulation package by maintaining
'smooth lending'.
Outstanding loans by the 11 top commercial banks fell 0.5 per cent to
Y222,260bn (Pounds 1,365bn)in the six months to the end of September, the
first half-yearly fall since the survey began 39 years ago. Mr Tadashi
Okura, federation chairman, said banks would continue to try to help
business through the recession.

<TEXT>
MS BENAZIR Bhutto was sworn in as Pakistan's 16th prime minister yesterday,
marking a political comeback almost three years after her previous
government's dismissal.
Ms Bhutto, 40, polled 121 votes from her Pakistan People's party (PPP) and
its allies, against 72 for Mr Nawaz Sharif, leader of the Pakistan Moslem
League (PML), in a parliamentary vote.
At least eight members abstained during voting in the 217-seat National
Assembly, the lower house of parliament. These included six members
belonging to Islamic parties which consider the rule by a woman to be
against their religion.
Her victory was also strengthened by the first signs of PPP gains in the
Punjab - Pakistan's largest and wealthiest province, which is crucial for
the smooth functioning of the central government. The PPP's candidate in
elections for the speaker of the provincial assembly polled 131 votes
against the PML nominee's 107. That result, ahead of today's elections for
the provincial government, finally confirmed Ms Bhutto's lead.
In her acceptance speech, Ms Bhutto sought the co-operation of the
opposition in her efforts to form a stable government. She said Pakistan was
under pressure on the nuclear issue, the spread of narcotics and terrorism,
and faced economic difficulties. 'Our government will be one of reforms.
People want a change of system not a change of faces.' In response, Mr
Sharif promised to support actions which served the 'national interest'.
On the future of the economic reforms begun under Mr Moeen Qureshi, the
interim prime minister, Ms Bhutto said: 'We want to stimulate the economy,
and if. . . steps have been taken which prevent that, we would review those
steps.' She did not give any further details.
Mr Qureshi said he was encouraged by the substantial majority Ms Bhutto
appeared to have obtained.
Ms Bhutto's victory ended a year of intense political turmoil which began
last November when the opposition began an anti-government campaign. That
initiative was resisted by Mr Sharif through widespread arrests of PPP
activists, showing virtually no room existed for a compromise between the
two sides.
Mr Sharif's power was further curtailed when he turned against Mr Ghulam
Ishaq Khan, the former president, in an effort to repeal presidential powers
of dismissing prime ministers and dissolving elected assemblies.
Although Mr Sharif's dismissal in April was followed by his return a month
later in a supreme court reversal of a presidential order, the government's
restoration only intensified the political crisis. Both Mr Sharif and Mr
Khan were forced out of office in July in a deal brokered by Gen Abdul
Waheed, the army chief.
The final results of the October 6 elections have put Ms Bhutto back in
power, but she is still faced with difficult odds. It is not clear how long
her coalition will last, especially if Mr Sharif tries to break apart Ms
Bhutto's allies.
It is also not clear that Ms Bhutto and Mr Sharif could co-operate in
resolving issues such as the presidential powers for dismissal of
governments, which were used against both of them.
Despite such concerns, senior PPP leaders are confident there is no threat
of intervention by the army, which has ruled Pakistan for 24 of its 46
years.

MR P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, yesterday offered to hold
'wide-ranging and sustained bilateral discussions' with Pakistan on issues
including Kashmir.
In a message to Ms Benazir Bhutto, the newly elected prime minister, Mr Rao
said New Delhi looked forward to working with Pakistan to promote peace and
stability in the region and normalise relations between the two countries.
An Indian official said later senior diplomats from both countries would
hold discussions in Cyprus, where they will be attending the Commonwealth
conference.
Earlier, violence erupted on the streets of Srinagar, capital of Kashmir,
after talks on ending the siege of the city's holiest shrine collapsed. At
least 40 people were injured as security forces used tear gas and batons to
disperse hundreds of demonstrators marching in support of militants who have
taken control of the shrine and are surrounded by troops.
Meanwhile, Pakistan expelled an Indian diplomat and three staff for
'indulging in espionage'. This follows India's demand that four Pakistani
diplomats leave.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is to withdraw its detachment of Army Rangers from Somalia,
reflecting its shift away from a policy of aggressively pursuing General
Mohammed Farah Aideed, the Somali clan leader.
President Bill Clinton said the move did not mean the US was abandoning the
search for Gen Aideed, but that the Rangers were no longer needed in
Mogadishu now that a force of 3,600 Marines was positioned offshore.
'It means that right now we are engaging in a political process to see how
we can resolve our mission in Somalia and to do all the things the United
Nations was ordered to do,' Mr Clinton said.
US officials denied that the withdrawal of the Rangers, whose principal role
during their stay in Somalia has been to carry out raids aimed at capturing
Gen Aideed or his lieutenants, was part of a deal struck with the Somali
leader to obtain the release last week of a US helicopter pilot shot down
and held prisoner by his forces.
Since the US abandoned its policy of aggressively chasing the general, the
US combat forces in Somalia have been largely confined to barracks.
The White House described the removal of the 600 Rangers, who are trained in
special operations such as 'snatch' missions, as a 'rotation of forces.'
Mr Peter Tarnoff, the undersecretary for policy at the State Department,
told members of Congress that the primary mission of the Marine amphibious
forces deployed off the coast of Mogadishu was to protect US troops in
Somalia.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL, in a gesture of goodwill, freed its longest-held Palestinian
political prisoner yesterday, beginning the process of releasing thousands
of Palestinians serving time in Israeli jails.
The release of up to 12,000 Palestinian prisoners is considered by
Palestinian peace negotiators to be the single most important
confidence-building measure between the two sides, who resume talks in the
Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba today. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's premier,
has said the numbers, timing and conditions for releasing prisoners must be
negotiated properly in the Taba talks.
Israeli officials said the release of Mr Salim Zrei, a commander in the
Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organisation held by Israel for 23
years, was intended as a reward to the PLO for renouncing violence under the
framework peace accord.
His release comes on the eve of the arrival in Israel of Mr Dennis Ross, US
co-ordinator for Middle East peace talks, who is touring the region ahead of
a visit early next month by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state.
Palestinian officials have said Israeli negotiators have promised to free
4,500-6,000 prisoners in the coming weeks. Hundreds of prisoners being held
on minor charges will be released in the first wave.
Israeli officials have rejected PLO demands to release activists of the
Islamic fundamentalist Hamas movement, including Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the
Hamas spiritual leader. The PLO, anxious to show quick results, wants Hamas
prisoners freed and the remaining deportees to return home, to undercut
Hamas opposition to the peace agreement.
Mr Uri Savir, director-general of Israel's Foreign Ministry, indicated
yesterday that this week's talks in Taba could see more significant releases
in the context of mutual security guarantees. The Taba talks will also get
down to more detailed negotiation about the size of the Jericho area from
which Israeli troops will begin withdrawing by December 13.
The Palestinians want an area of 345 sq km, the old Jordanian district of
Jericho, while Israel is offering only 27 sq km, the boundaries of the town.
Much of the Palestinian negotiation focuses on access to the Dead Sea and a
border crossing to Jordan, with inclusion of strategic roads, water sources
and religious sites.

FT  20 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Fine-tuning in the overseas risk business
 -A new chief at the Overseas Private Investment Corp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA BRANSTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN a corner behind the door to Ms Ruth Harkin's office sits a pile of framed
maps of the world, which the new head of the Overseas Private Investment
Corporation has not yet had time to hang.
'My personal imprint on the office so far is the paperwork on my desk,' she
says, several months after her June 2 swearing in.
In April President Bill Clinton launched Opic on its most challenging
venture to date: providing loans, loan guarantees and risk insurance to US
companies going in to the former Soviet Union, as part of the
administration's Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.05bn) Russian aid package.
Opic hopes to convert Dollars 40m of government funds into more than Dollars
1bn in loan guarantees, new loans and equity projects in Russia over the
next two years.
Like his Republican predecessor, the new president sees Opic as a foreign
policy tool. Especially in the current cash-strapped era it is easier to
encourage business to go abroad and contribute to development efforts than
to make direct appropriations of foreign aid.
In 1992 the 22-year-old agency received its first congressional
appropriation. Since then it has done something almost unheard of in the
halls of government: return the money. This year, Ms Harkin says, she will
give back about Dollars 17m to Congress.
The agency's main mission is to provide insurance against currency problems,
political violence and expropriations to companies seeking to invest abroad.
It functions much like a private insurer collecting fees from the
organisations it insures. Opic also offers financial services such as direct
loans to businesses and fee-earning advisory services.
The agency has attracted a degree of controversy, with labour unions arguing
it is encouraging 'runaway plants' that cost US jobs. During the 1992
election campaign the Clinton camp lambasted Opic, along with the Agency for
International Development, for encouraging manufacturers to relocate their
plants in Central America.
But business believes it has found a champion in Ms Harkin, according to Mr
Willard Workman, vice-president of the US Chamber of Commerce. The business
community feels the Department of Labour is resistant to foreign investment
because of the consequent job losses at home.
'We think that's a specious argument because there are going to be some jobs
created in Guatemala, but there are also going to be jobs created here to
oversee that investment,' says Mr Workman. However, labour, which is not
such a natural ally for Opic, has expressed hope that Ms Harkin will be more
sensitive to job-loss issues, in that her husband, democratic Senator Tom
Harkin, has always been a strong union supporter.
Ms Harkin said she would not encourage companies to take plants abroad, but
she takes a business-oriented approach to whether moving a factory costs
American jobs. Factories moving abroad can still create jobs at home, she
says, because 'you are utilising the local workforce, but at the same time
you are bringing over American equipment, which means American jobs.'
The battle over the North American Free Trade Agreement has served to
heighten sensitivities about Opic policies, with labour and environmental
groups scrutinising US trade policy more closely than before.
'Given the heated debate about Nafta there is a change in the nature of the
debate that was not there in the past,' says Dr Robert Lawrence, a professor
of economics at Harvard University.
Thus far, however, Ms Harkin has earned cautious support from factions which
are fighting tooth and nail over the agreement.
One of the agency's newest initiatives is an environmental growth fund that
Opic will use to encourage US 'envirotech' companies to help clean pollution
abroad - a project which Ms Harkin sees as the agency's biggest departure
from the Bush era.
Overall, Ms Harkin believes her role is to fine-tune rather than overhaul
the agency, which she describes as 'a jewel in terms of its efficiency and
the calibre of its employees'.
It is a job quite different from that confronting the head of the troubled
Agency for International Development, a job Ms Harkin went after but did not
get. 'The intrigue at AID was on a totally different level,' she said. 'Many
people have told me that I am very fortunate (not to be at AID) and I
believe them.'

ITALY'S Belelli group has won a L130bn (Pounds 54.6m) contract to build an
offshore oil platform for Shell and BP for deep- water production in the US
waters of the Gulf of Mexico, writes Robert Graham in Rome.
The 20,000-ton platform, designed to sit in 910 metres of water, will be
able to produce 100,000 b/d of crude and 110m cubic feet of natural gas.
Belelli will be using a special 'tension leg' design which involves a
floating hull stabilised through the attachment of steel tendons to the
ocean floor.
The new platform will operate some 200km south-west of New Orleans in the
Mars field, which the new tension leg technology has made it possible to
exploit. Belelli has built a previous tension leg platform for Shell for use
in the Gulf of Mexico.

FT  20 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Credit agencies' future brightens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPORT credit agencies last year saw an improvement in their vulnerability
to dangers of non-payment, for the first time since the 1983 Latin American
debt crisis, according to the Berne Union, the umbrella body representing
the world's leading agencies.
Mr Ragnar Sohlman, president of the Berne Union and chief executive of
Exportkreditnamnden, Sweden's export credit agency, said at the end of the
group's annual meeting that the overhang from the 1980s' debt crisis
'remains a substantial problem', with most members showing significant
cumulative deficits.
But closer linkage now being imposed between insurance premiums paid by
exporters and the amount of export business covered 'gives some hope for
further improvement', he added. Debt restructuring arrangements being made
under the auspices of the Paris Club of creditor countries implied 'there
will not be full or early recovery of many of the claims paid during the
1980s'. So far, 58 countries have reached such arrangements.
New business underwritten in 1992 by the union's 43 members amounted to
Dollars 311bn (Pounds 206bn), 6 per cent lower than 1991. Claims fell, while
premium income and debt recoveries increased.
The most dramatic change was in insurance cover for investments overseas, a
type of cover offered by just 21 of the union's members.
This leapt by 48 per cent from Dollars 4.8bn in 1991 to Dollars 7.1bn last
year. Much of the new cover was given for investments in the newly emerging
markets of east and central Europe.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A GATT accord would help France promote its service sector, protect its
patents and, in the fraught agricultural area, push its processed food
exports, Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the world trade body, said
yesterday, writes David Buchan in Paris.
In a powerful speech to a business conference in Paris, he underlined
France's self-interest in a rapid conclusion to the Uruguay Round
negotiations. Mr Sutherland also warned that a failure of Gatt talks would
not halt adjustments in the world economy, but simply ensure that 'the law
of the jungle will prevail'.
The Gatt chief praised Prime Minister Edouard Balladur for launching his
country into a national debate on the world trade talks' outcome. France and
other European countries, he said, faced a choice between 'thriving in an
open global economy with effective and fair rules. . . or stifling to death
in an over-protected EC'.
Mr Sutherland rejected the widespread notion in France that the December 15
deadline for Gatt negotiators to finish their work was an 'American' date,
pointing out that it also had EC acceptance. He noted a Gatt deal would help
suppress counterfeiting of French luxury goods and protect the patents of
high-tech industry.

REFUSAL by the US to open talks with the European Community on 'clarifying'
the Blair House farm trade agreement will make it hard to conclude the
Uruguay Round world trade reform negotiations by their December 15 deadline,
Mr Rene Steichen, EC agriculture commissioner, warned yesterday.
'The deadline might be realistic if the Americans are prepared to shift a
bit,' Mr Steichen said.
Briefing EC farm ministers on his talks last week with Mr Mickey Kantor, the
US trade representative, Mr Steichen said he was disappointed by
Washington's intransigence over the EC's 'legitimate, reasonable and
responsible' demands.
According to the commissioner, Mr Kantor refused to discuss the additional
farm trade concessions sought by France and incorporated into the EC's
negotiating brief after a special meeting of foreign, trade and agriculture
ministers on September 20.
Mr Kantor also refused to open technical discussions with the EC at senior
level, dismissing the 'clarifications' sought by Europe as an internal
Community problem.
At yesterday's Council of Ministers, however, the Commission and most member
states argued that the US stance might be tactical. 'It was always unlikely
that the Americans would say now what more they were prepared to discuss in
agriculture,' one senior Brussels official said.
Mr Steichen's comments set the tone for a low-key debate on the Gatt farm
chapter, but also prompted France, Spain, Belgium, Ireland and others to
question the December 15 deadline, when the US administration's 'fast track'
negotiating authority runs out.
Mr Jean Puech, France's agriculture minister, insisted the EC should not be
mesmerised by the date. He also introduced a new element into the farm trade
imbroglio by insisting the Commission nail down precise interpretations of
the extent to which sanitary, plant health and veterinary regulations can
interrupt normal trade in agricultural produce.

FT  20 OCT 93 / World Trade News: BAe-Taiwan joint venture aircraft would
rival Boeing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and DENNIS ENGBARTH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RJ-X aircraft for which Taiwan is insisting on a British Aerospace
development pledge would be a direct competitor to the Boeing 737, the
world's biggest-selling aircraft.
BAe has already spent about Pounds 10m researching the RJ-X. Last month it
presented documents to Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC) showing that the
aircraft would be a complete redesign of the existing model, the RJ.
Its fuselage would be built of an aluminium-lithium alloy, a material
normally associated with military aircraft.
Unlike the RJ's configuration of four engines attached to wings above the
passenger cabin, the RJ-X would have a more conventional layout of two
engines on a wing below the fuselage. There would be two versions of the
aircraft, according to documents shown to the Financial Times by Taiwanese
officials yesterday, one with 96 seats and the other with 125. Its range
would be extended to 'more than 1,500 nautical miles'.
This would bring the aircraft into one of the most competitive civil
airliner markets, competing against the smaller Boeing 737 versions as well
as the latest addition to the Airbus family, the A319 - a smaller version of
the A320 which was announced at the Paris Air Show in June. Boeing is now
planning to develop a new family of 737 aircraft to give the airliner more
efficiency and a longer range.
It would also compete directly against the Fokker F-100 and the McDonnell
Douglas DC9/MD90.
'Within the next 10 years, many 737s and 727s will retire. This would be a
good time to market the RJ-X,' said Mr David Chu, director of the government
advisory team.
While TAC is insisting BAe commit itself to the development of the RJ-X, the
UK company is less confident than Taiwan of its future. It is pressing for a
detailed survey of the aircraft's potential market to be conducted first.
This position fails to convince Mr Chu. 'Without the RJ-X, the joint venture
would not be a success. It's not a question of yes or no but when it would
be built.'

A SURGE in apartment building during September pushed US construction starts
to their highest rate for three and a half years even though building of
single-family homes weakened, the Commerce Department said yesterday, Reuter
reports from Washington.
The overall annual rate of starts on new homes increased by 2.8 per cent to
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.35m after a revised rise of 6.7 per
cent in August. Starts were up everywhere except in the South, where they
fell.
The September pick-up was entirely in multi-family homes, which soared by 52
per cent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 210,000. By contrast,
starts on single-family homes fell 3 per cent to a rate of 1.14m.
Mortgage rates were moderate throughout September and by last week had
touched a 25-year low of 6.81 per cent for a 30-year loan.

A US Navy frigate briefly stopped and boarded a ship from Belize bound for
Haiti yesterday in the first maritime interception since the reimposition of
a UN oil and weapons blockade on the Caribbean country aimed at restoring
its exiled president, agencies report from Port-au-Prince.
The ship's master reported he was carrying cement, an item not prohibited
under the embargo. The ship was allowed to proceed after an hour-long
inspection.
Six US and three Canadian navy ships are off the coast of Haiti to enforce
the embargo under Operation Support Democracy, and a French frigate is on
the way to join them. Britain and the Netherland said they would send
frigates, and Argentina is also considering sending vessels.
In Haiti, Lt Gen Raoul Cedras, the army commander, ignored demands to
respect the UN-brokered plan for the return of President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide.
Gen Cedras relaxed with aides at army headquarters early yesterday after the
midnight deadline for him to comply with the plan passed. News photographers
snapped shots of him smoking and joking.
Asked what the army would do if US troops came ashore to rescue Americans,
he said: 'I'm certain it will not reach such a point.'
The embargo aims to compel him to live up to an accord he signed to allow Mr
Aristide to return to office on October 30. Gen Cedras was a key part of the
military coup which overthrew Mr Aristide - Haiti's first popularly elected
president - in 1991.
The capital, Port-au-Prince, came to life slowly on the first day of the
embargo. 'Gas supplies are normal. There's no rationing, yet,' a pump
attendant said. Prices remained stable at about Dollars 1.50 (Pounds 1) a
gallon and there were no queues.
But schools, government offices and some shops remained closed for a second
day on Mr Aristide's orders, to mourn the assassination last week of Mr Guy
Malary, the justice minister, who was part of the transition cabinet
preparing for Mr Aristide's return.
The sanctions decreed by the UN Security Council include a ban on oil and
petrol shipments, a ban on weapons, and a freezing of overseas assets of
Haiti's de facto authorities or 'their agents'.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Canadian Elections: Poll revives question, will Quebec quit?
 -Tory collapse stokes separatist debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE industrial and farming centre of Sherbrooke, in the rolling countryside
east of Montreal, will be one of the most closely watched constituencies on
election night in Canada next Monday. Political analysts say the outcome
there could have a significant impact on national, and especially Quebec,
politics over the next few years.
The result in Sherbrooke will shape the political future of Mr Jean Charest,
who is the town's sitting MP and, since last June, deputy prime minister in
Ms Kim Campbell's Progressive Conservative cabinet.
Most important, the youthful Mr Charest, aged 35, is viewed as one of the
few Quebec politicians able to articulate a vision of the future in which
the francophone province remains part of Canada. But the Conservatives, who
have held office in Ottawa for nine years, have their backs to the wall in
the election campaign.
Recent opinion polls indicate that the Tories will not only be defeated by
the Liberal party, they may even fail to gain enough seats to form the
official opposition.
Nowhere has the Tories' collapse been more spectacular than in Quebec. The
party now has 56 out of 75 Quebec seats in the House of Commons. But if
recent opinion polls are any guide, it will be lucky to win three or four on
October 25.
The Tories have fallen victim in Quebec less to the Liberals than to the
Bloc Quebecois (BQ), a group formed in 1988 to press for sovereignty for the
francophone province. The BQ, led by Mr Lucien Bouchard, a former
Conservative cabinet minister, is expected to pick up between 40 and 55
seats on election day.
The BQ's strength has again brought to the boil the interminable debate
about whether and for how long Quebec will remain part of Canada. The
election of a large group of BQ MPs will not in itself bring independence to
Quebec. 'We cannot do anything formally to implement sovereignty in Ottawa,'
Mr Bouchard says. 'This has to be done through a decision made by Quebeckers
in a referendum.'
In any case, opinion polls suggest the number of Quebeckers who vote for the
BQ next week will be greater than the hard core of nationalists who actually
favour a break with the rest of Canada.
Among those likely to back the BQ in the election are many who, while not
favouring full independence, are frustrated by the failure of one set of
constitutional talks after another over the past decade to devolve more
powers from the federal government to Quebec.
observers also ascribe the BQ's strength to Quebeckers' sense that a vote
for the Bloc next Monday carries few risks. For many, the BQ's attraction is
that it offers a change from the two traditional parties, holding out the
promise of better economic times if Quebec's interests are given higher
priority in Ottawa.
Mr Alain Dubuc, chief editorial writer at La Presse newspaper in Montreal,
wrote in a recent column: 'There are no alternatives to the Bloc and that's
the problem.'
The provincial poll to be held some time during 1994 will be far more
crucial to Quebec's future than the general election. The BQ's provincial
arm, the Parti Quebecois, has pledged to hold a sovereignty referendum
within 12 months if it succeeds in unseating the ruling Liberals in the
provincial election.
The risk is that the presence of a large contingent of separatist MPs in
Ottawa could generate rising support for sovereignty within Quebec as the
provincial election and then - possibly - a referendum approaches.
Mr Bouchard has promised the BQ will not obstruct the parliamentary process.
But it could raise the level of Quebeckers' frustration with the federal
system by making demands which a national government, balancing Quebec's
needs with those of other parts of the country, cannot fulfil. For instance,
among the decisions facing the next government is the likely closure of some
military bases. Mr Bouchard notes, however, that while Quebec has 25 per
cent of Canada's population, it has only four out of 26 bases. He insists
all four must remain open.
The BQ's ability to further the separatist cause could be enhanced by the
expected strong performance next Monday of the right-wing Reform party,
whose main support is in western Canada.
A pillar of the Reform platform is that Quebec should get precisely the same
treatment as all nine other provinces. If Quebeckers insist on special
powers, so the Reform argument goes, they should not be discouraged from
leaving the fold.
The political situation within Quebec is also fluid. Mr Robert Bourassa, the
respected and popular Liberal premier, announced his resignation from
politics last month.
The timing of his announcement at the start of the federal election campaign
was widely interpreted as a signal to Quebeckers that they might wish to
think twice before adding one bit of political instability to another by
voting BQ.
But Mr Bourassa's decision has thrown his own provincial Liberal party into
disarray. The new leader will be chosen at a convention next January. But
only one candidate for Mr Bourassa's job - Treasury Board president Mr
Daniel Johnson - has so far come forward.
Other senior party members are offended that Mr Bourassa turned a blind eye
to Mr Johnson's early lobbying for the leadership and failed to give them
enough time to organise their campaigns.
Mr Johnson is a staunch federalist and has a blue-chip political background.
Both his father and brother were premiers of the province.
But there is some doubt whether he can match either Mr Bourassa's deft
political touch within the party, or Mr Bouchard's charisma on the stump.
Hence the hope in federalist circles that Mr Charest will still have a
platform after next Monday from which to appeal to Quebeckers not to give up
on Canada.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Brazil's Congress to probe corruption claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S Congress yesterday decided to conduct a special inquiry into
corruption allegations levelled against more than 20 members. But an
important constitutional revision process, which some analysts feared would
be delayed by the scandal, appeared to remain on track.
The inquiry has 45 days to decide if there is any truth to the allegations
which have been made by Mr Jose Carlos Alves dos Santos, a former budget
secretary who is now facing murder and other charges.
He named several senior politicians, including two serving government
ministers and the president of the Senate, as benefiting from a corrupt
scheme linked to construction contracts under the governments of former
presidents Jose Sarney and Fernando Collor.
Investigators found Dollars 1.4m (Pounds 933,000), including Dollars 30,000
in counterfeit US currency, at Mr dos Santos's home and in safety deposit
boxes, police said.
He said in a weekend interview with the Veja news magazine that he
repeatedly witnessed bribery transactions and had received large money
bribes.
All the politicians involved have denied the charges. An inquiry last year
led to the downfall of then-president Collor on unrelated corruption
charges.
Congress decided yesterday to continue work on the constitutional revision,
aimed at simplifying and modernising the constitution, in parallel with the
investigation. Groups opposed to the review, including left-wing politicians
and church groups, had called for its suspension pending the outcome of the
inquiry. They argued that with so many members of Congress under suspicion,
its rulings on the constitution would be in doubt.
The two government ministers have remained at their posts, despite offering
their resignations to President Itamar Franco in order to contest the
allegations.
Mr Franco, who has stressed the probity of his regime compared to that of
his disgraced predecessor, is thought to want to hear any evidence in full
before making a decision on their future.
The government yesterday sought to play down the significance of Mr Franco's
earlier comments that he would not block early presidential and
congressional elections if Congress wanted them.
Government leaders and senior politicians said that his comments had been
exaggerated and few saw any chance or advantage of holding elections before
they are due late next year.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Travel tax 'to make up tariff losses'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration yesterday proposed Dollars 2.35bn (Pounds 1.55bn)
in new travel taxes to compensate for the loss of tariff revenue as a result
of the North American Free Trade Agreement. It did this even though some
Republicans have threatened to oppose Nafta if it leads to new taxes.
Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, told the House ways and means
committee the entry tax would amount to Dollars 5-Dollars 10 on all aircraft
or ocean-liner tickets; Dollars 7.50-Dollars 15 on railroad and Dollars
5-Dollars 10 on commercial vehicles. The revenue-raising method had been
selected, he said, because of the close ties between trade and travel.
The administration had by law to come up with taxes or budget cuts to
replace lost tariff revenue. But, this way, it defied a group of Republicans
led by Mr Newt Gingrich, House minority whip, who say they would find it
'difficult' to support a Nafta which includes new taxes.
One month before the November 17 House vote on Nafta, the administration is
facing numerous such obstacles in its fight to get the implementing
legislation approved. Much of its troubles stem from the uneasy alliance in
support of the pact.
This includes moderate Democrats, at present about one-quarter to one-third
of the House Democrats, and Republicans on the lookout for political traps.
Worried the administration will pull away from Nafta and they will be left
alone in support of an unpopular pact, Republicans have demanded the
administration lure at least 100 Democrats to the pro-Nafta side.
They also insisted on a labour side agreement that is so weak it has failed
to attract the hoped-for union support.
Democrats such as Mr Richard Gephardt, House majority leader, have demanded
a strong job-training programme. Because this would require more taxes,
which would anger Republicans, the administration has proposed only an
18-month Dollars 90m plan with the promise it will propose a more
comprehensive programme next year.
If, as expected, 145,000 workers lose jobs by 1995 because of Nafta, this
'bridge' plan would provide only Dollars 620.69 per worker, according to
Congressman Collin Peterson, a Minnesota Democrat.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Mexicans warn on environment

<TEXT>
THE Mexican government has warned that environmental protection will be
undermined if the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) is
rejected by the US Congress, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City.
Mr Santiago Onate, attorney-general for the environment, said that without
Nafta there could be a backlash in Mexico that would make environmental
enforcement more difficult, and damage co-operation with the US and Canada.
Mr Onate, Mexico's top environmental official, said he was concerned it
would be impossible to fund a clean-up of the US-Mexican border, as planned
under a billion-dollar scheme.
His comments appear part of a concerted campaign by Mexico to pressure the
US into approving the treaty. President Carlos Salinas has suggested that
rejection of the treaty could set back US-Mexican relations for generations.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Aylwin snubs Chilean health strikers

THE CHILEAN government has refused to negotiate with striking health
workers, whose national stoppage today enters its third week. Most hospitals
yesterday continued to turn away all non-emergency cases, a situation that
has persisted since the 55,000-strong Federation of National Health Workers
called a national strike on October 6.
President Patricio Aylwin recently told the federation, which comprises
mainly low-paid auxiliary hospital staff: 'This strike is pointless. The
position of the government is very clear: we will not negotiate while strike
action continues'. Last week the president's phrase 'not a peso more' was
splashed over the front pages.
The governing centre-left coalition, the Concertacion, is determined not to
appear weak in the face of popular demands, many of which have festered
since the end of Chile's 17-year military rule in 1990. Many middle class
and semi-skilled workers saw their real wages drop substantially during the
1980s.
The Concertacion has insisted that its policy of fiscal restraint,
maintained throughout four years in office, will not be slackened in the
run-up to this December's general election. Its determination to resist high
wage demands, many of which it regards as politically motivated, is all the
more difficult given the economy's average growth rate of 6.5 per cent since
1990.
The government has characterised as electioneering the guarded support for
health workers from Mr Arturo Alessandri, presidential candidate of the
right-wing electoral pact, Union for Chilean Progress.

FT  20 OCT 93 / US shifts focus of drugs crusade
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Lee Brown, director of the White House drug control policy office, will
today outline a shift in US anti-narcotics strategy which envisages a
reduction of operations to intercept drugs transported through Central
America and the Caribbean.
Mr Brown's testimony before the Senate judiciary committee follows a review
by government agencies of US drugs strategy.
One of the conclusions of the review is that interdiction operations in
Central American and Caribbean - including deployment of AWACs and CP3
surveillance aircraft and naval patrol craft - have not been cost-effective.
Interdiction will remain an important part of the strategy but its focus
will shift towards source countries, where the emphasis will be on
developing local capabilities in intercepting drugs flights and halting
operations of cocaine laboratories.
'What we are trying to do as part of the new strategy is to place more
emphasis on institution building and more emphasis on support for source
countries in terms of economic growth and development,' said a senior State
Department official.
The strategy will propose increased help for cocaine-producing countries -
chiefly Bolivia, Peru and Colombia - in their domestic anti-drug programmes,
aid with the administration of justice, which is also seen as cementing
democracy, and greater emphasis on alternative development in the countries'
coca-growing regions.
The US is expected to seek support from the Washington-based international
financial institutions in developing the strategy.
Mr Brown's testimony will, however, emphasise developments in drug policy on
the domestic front. As well as outlining the strategy - whose full detail
will not be known until the budget is presented to Congress next February -
Mr Brown is attempting to extend his office's current five-year
authorisation, which expires this year.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Argentina to pay creditor banks Dollars 7bn this month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA is to issue Dollars 7.23bn (Pounds 4.78bn) in bonds to creditor
banks by the end of this month to securitise unpaid interest on its foreign
debt and so bring to a virtual close the restructuring of its commercial
bank debts.
Earlier this year Argentina signed an agreement with its bankers to cut its
Dollars 32bn external debt by a third by issuing concessional 'Brady bonds'
which stretch out maturities and cut both principal and interest.
As part of this agreement, Argentina also agreed to pay Dollars 8.5bn
interest arrears accumulated up to December 1991 by issuing more bonds.
Until then, Argentina paid banks only Dollars 70m a month in token interest
payments.
It will now begin paying the arrears with 12-year bonds that pay  13/16 per
cent over Libor. Payment will come in two stages.
Mr Daniel Marx, financial secretary, said yesterday that bonds worth Dollars
7.23bn would be issued this month.
A second batch, worth Dollars 1.28bn, would be issued by December. Mr Marx
said the delays were due to difficulties facing bankers, auditors and
government officials in establishing the precise amount of unpaid interest
due.
Once the process is complete, Argentina will have Dollars 25.4bn-worth of
Brady bonds outstanding.
These bonds offer creditors the choice between maintaining the value of loan
principal but accepting a low fixed interest rate, or accepting a 30 per
cent cut in principal in exchange for floating interest rates.
Banks took Dollars 12.6bn-worth of par bonds that preserve principal and
Dollars 4.3bn in bonds that pay floating interest. These bonds are backed by
Dollars 3.2bn-worth of zero coupon US Treasury bonds.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LT GEN Raoul Cedras, Haiti's army commander, yesterday ignored demands to
respect the United Nations-brokered plan allowing the country's exiled
president to return, despite the re-imposition of an international embargo,
AP reports from Port-au-Prince.
Six US and three Canadian navy ships were offshore to enforce the embargo
yesterday, and a French frigate was on the way to join them. Britain said it
would send a frigate.
Gen Cedras relaxed with aides at army headquarters early yesterday after the
midnight deadline for him to comply with the plan passed. News photographers
snapped shots of him smoking and joking.
Asked what the army would do if US troops came ashore to rescue Americans,
he said: 'I'm certain it will not reach such a point.'
The embargo aims to compel him to live up to an accord he signed to allow
exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to return to office on October 30.
Gen Cedras was a key part of the military coup which overthrew Mr Aristide -
Haiti's first popularly elected president - in 1991.
The capital, Port-au-Prince, came to life slowly on the first day of the
embargo. 'Gas supplies are normal. There's no rationing, yet,' a pump
attendant said. Prices remained stable at about Dollars 1.50 (Pounds 1) a
gallon and there were no queues.
But schools, government offices and some shops remained closed for a second
day on Mr Aristide's orders, to mourn the assassination last week of Mr Guy
Malary, the justice minister, who was part of the transition cabinet
preparing for Mr Aristide's return. Mr Robert Malval, the prime minister,
has blamed military authorities for the murder.
The sanctions decreed by the UN Security Council include a ban on oil and
petrol shipments, a ban on weapons, and a freezing of overseas assets of
Haiti's de facto authorities or 'their agents'.
While the blockade could stop tankers, the UN has taken no measures to halt
petrol shipments from the Dominican Republic, which shares the island of
Hispaniola with Haiti. The Dominican government is close to Haiti's army,
and previous cross-border embargo violations had been reported.
The Haitian military is also believed to have stockpiled several weeks'
supply of oil reserves.
The dispute has raised tensions in Port-au-Prince. Hundreds of residents
have fled to the countryside in anticipation of more army repression or a
foreign invasion.
Gen Cedras said the solution to the crisis lay in further negotiation, but
UN envoy Mr Dante Caputo, the architect of the plan to restore Mr Aristide,
rejected that idea.

<TEXT>
TWO of Canada's most senior politicians have warned of the dangers of
electing Bloc Quebecois candidates in next Monday's election, writes Bernard
Simon in Toronto. Mr Robert Bourassa (right), Quebec's premier, said that a
vote for the BQ could be 'very risky. It can be counter-productive to favour
the instability of Canadian institutions'.
Federalists in Quebec have been hoping Mr Bourassa, arguably the most
respected politician in the province, would intervene on their side in the
election campaign. But opinions are divided on whether his remarks will have
a significant impact.
Mr Michael Wilson, the former finance minister who is not standing for
re-election, wrote in a commentary in the Globe and Mail newspaper yesterday
that 'without a strong, truly national voice in parliament, the debate (on
Quebec's place in Canada) could become nasty and divisive for the country.'
He said strong support for the BQ and the Reform party, based in western
Canada, 'could generate significant risks for Canada'.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Hungry Russia watches Georgia carve itself up: John Lloyd
and Steve LeVine report from the threatened capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COUP against the elected president brought him to power; now that
president's forces threaten to deprive him of office. Mr Eduard Shevardnadze
has had a traumatising 18 months as Georgia's head of state. Today he sits,
amid the ruin of all his hopes, in the building from which Mr Zviad
Gamsakhurdia was forced in January 1992.
As the 'Zviadists' advance toward Tbilisi, Mr Shevardnadze turns in
desperation to Russia, begging to be let in to the Commonwealth of
Independent States, in which he saw 'no future' last year. Russia is
reasserting its hegemony over many of the former Soviet republics, and
especially his; a Russia which 'is putting its empire together again', in
the words of veteran commentator Mr Levan Khaindrava.
Mr Shevardnadze told Georgian politicians and intellectuals on Monday: 'We
will not be able to live if we cannot settle matters with Russia.'
He encouraged the view that he was Georgia's last hope after a coalition of
paramilitary and political forces violently ousted Mr Gamsakhurdia. Now,
after becoming one of the most famous statesmen of the late 20th century as
Soviet foreign minister, he has little to show for his return to the state
where he was once Communist party leader.
Defending, in an interview last week, his decision to take Georgia into the
CIS, he said, 'The CIS is not a powerful union, so we don't have to
sacrifice much of our sovereignty.' Yet the very prostration of his country
calls into question how much of that 'sovereignty' is left.
The economy is ruined. Mr Gia Nodia, who runs Tbilisi's only independent
think-tank, says a basic food basket for a month costs Dollars 20 (Pounds
13.20); the official average salary, paid in the wildly inflating coupon, is
Dollars 2 a month. Bread lines for loaves priced at the equivalent of one
fifth of a cent are massive, while wheat is sold off on the black market to
Armenian and other traders. Since Mr Gamsakhurdia's forces took the junction
town of Samtredia last Sunday, food in the port of Batumi is denied the
capital, and supplies are down to a week or two.
Unemployment is at least 50 per cent, and the streets are crowded with
lounging men. In the second city of Kutaisi, now directly threatened by Mr
Gamsakhurdia, the big truck plant 'barely works', according to the mayor,
who adds that 'most enterprises work at around 30 per cent capacity at most.
Anyway, who needs what they produce?'
The republic of 5.5m people is dismembered. The fall of the resort town of
Sukhumi at the end of September ended the Georgian military presence in the
province of Abkhazia, which has been agitating for independence for two
years and has now declared itself an independent state. It is now another
land which is undergoing 'ethnic cleansing': Georgians, once nearly half the
population, are down to a few thousand and they are trying to flee.
Refugees in Chubery, a village in the Svanetian mountains next to Abkhazia,
speak of hideous atrocities. Mr Levan Amliani, who fled Sukhumi three weeks
ago, said he saw the bodies of women with breasts cut off; men hanged and
nailed to crosses; and - a recurring, nightmarish tale - men and women with
throats cut and tongue pulled through the gash to make an 'Abkhazian
necktie'.
The other two autonomous regions of Georgia are also wholly or partly lost
to Tbilisi. South Ossetia, scene of murderous fighting three years ago, is
now de facto occupied by Russian troops - and is peaceful. Ajaria, the
southern part-Moslem region, is peaceful but prefers Moscow to Tbilisi.
Mr Shevardnadze has no army. Thus, he has had to rely increasingly on the
showy, violent, semi-criminal band known as the Mekhedrioni, who owe their
loyalty (and their pay) to Mr Jaba Josseliani, now effectively second man
after the president. Imprisoned by Mr Gamsakhurdia, he has been more or less
loyal to Mr Shevardnadze and his bandit-like force has provided the spine of
the state's military arm.
Though he came in with a string of western friends, Mr Shevardnadze has had
nothing from the west but concerned words. 'He addressed many love letters
to them,' says Mr Khaindrava in his waspish way, 'but it was in the end
platonic.' Even Mr Tedo Japaridze, his national security adviser, concedes
that 'he raised too many hopes about the west'.
Mr Japaridze claims that, in a meeting with President Bill Clinton, he was
told that Georgia must reconcile itself to being in the Russian sphere of
influence. He also says that President Boris Yeltsin told Mr Clinton at the
Group of Seven meeting in Tokyo that if Russia were to leave the Caucasus,
'they would murder each other'. It is widely believed that Russians have
been helping the murdering, by providing arms to the Abkhazian separatists
and at least allowing in guerrilla forces from the Russian northern
Caucasus. Mr Shevardnaze believes that Mr Yeltsin did not sanction this and
that he represents the 'progressive Russia' with which Georgia can live;
others believe all the Russians are the same, and they want Georgia back.
No-one pushes these points harder than Mr Gamsakhurdia. Interviewed at the
weekend in his headquarters city of Zugdidi, the former president,
soft-spoken and only occasionally portraying the immense paranoia of former
years, inveighed against the 'criminal bands' of Mr Shevardnadze and
promised to rid Georgia of them. His prime minister in exile, Mr Pessarion
Gugushvili, said: 'Everything we said about Shevardnadze has proven to be
true. He has ruined his country and is delivering it to the Russians.'
Georgia was as pleasant a place as could be found in the Soviet Union's last
years, its towns relatively gracious, its climate warm, its people
notoriously hospitable. Now it is grim, squalid, nervy, riven with conflict
and patrolled by unpredictable thugs with automatics who answer to unknown
authorites or none. Russia may in the end save the republic. Georgia's wild
spree of independence is coming to an end.

Some CIS member states could act together to help Georgia protect a supply
lifeline from rebel attack but Moscow would not intervene on its own, two
Russian cabinet ministers said yesterday, Reuter reports.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, foreign minister, responding to a late-night appeal for
military assistance by Georgia's leader, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, told
Interfax news agency that Russia would not send in troops by itself. The
Russian defence minister, Mr Pavel Grachev, speaking in Finland, echoed his
words. 'Nobody intends to interfere in Georgia's internal affairs or civil
war,' he said, 'but it is necessary to protect the Tbilisi-Poti road.
Probably tough measures will be needed.'
Rebels backing ex-president Zviad Gamsakhurdia have made strong gains in
western Georgia in recent days, not only threatening supplies to the
capital, Tbilisi, and to Russian units based in the country, but also to
Armenia and Azerbaijan, who fear the fighting will throttle their supply
routes.

<TEXT>
FIERCE artillery bombardments and the stench of explosives has reminded the
inhabitants of Sarajevo that in spite of a two-month lull and the push for a
settlement in Geneva, Serb besiegers can wreak havoc on their lives at any
time.
Using 152mm artillery, the biggest in their arsenal, Serb fighters have
again been pounding the city from their positions on the heights.
This latest onslaught mocks any attempt to maintain a semblance of normal
life in the valley below. Efforts by the UN to clear the rubble-strewn
streets, restore power, water and telephone lines or repair the tram lines
in the devastated city appear utterly absurd, given the Serbs' ability to
strike at any moment.
The UN's 'clean city' operation has so far done little more than provide an
extra role for its 5,000 soldiers encamped there.
Bombarding the city with artillery and mortars as well as targeting civilian
areas with anti-aircraft guns, Serb chieftains, bolstered by their Croat
counterparts and western indifference, are killing whatever spirit remains
in the Bosnian capital.
Despite brave efforts to maintain a core of tolerance, many people fear they
have lost the battle to preserve the centuries-old mixed ethnic identity of
Sarajevo.
As winter descends from the encircling mountains, people are desperate to
abandon the city they all vowed to save.
Exhausted, 'Sarajlija', the Serbo-Croat word for the city's inhabitants, no
longer debate the future shape of their country. While they dismiss as
'unfair' the Geneva plan to split Bosnia into three, few hold out hope of a
better agreement. They criticise their government sharply for failing either
to obtain weapons or surrender.
An overwhelming majority of citizens simply want the guns to fall silent.
They spend their time devising ways to survive until somehow they can get
out of Sarajevo.
As they enter their second winter of war, the fear of bombardment is mingled
with a dread of cold and disease.
In the anxiety to tap into the city's barely functioning natural gas system,
Sarajevo homes have become fire hazards, say UN officials. When Serb
besiegers allow supplies through, city dwellers rig up a tangle of rubber
garden hoses to channel in small amounts of natural gas.
Epidemics pose another threat. Local entrepreneurs have formed a company to
exterminate the rats which infest the city. There is also a fear of a
breakdown in law and order. Gangsters have been snatching UN vehicles.
While most people speak of an intense desire to leave instead of struggling
through another winter, few have real hope of getting out. Even if the
Moslem-led Bosnian government gives permission, Serb leaders have raised
objections with the UN over 'violations' of the airport agreement which only
allows transport of humanitarian aid.
The spirit of Sarajevo still persists. Even after 18 months of war, vestiges
of a cosmopolitan life have endured, distinguishing it from other cities in
Bosnia under the control of Serb and Croat regimes.
Performing artists and writers have worked to maintain cultural life,
organising art exhibits, plays, concerts, and fashion shows, including one
with materials made entirely of reinforced window plastic provided by the UN
refugee relief agency.
But this spirit of resistance is weak and no match for the Serbian guns.
Even those most dedicated to its preservation say there is little chance of
life in the city in the future. A combination of anger at their Serb
adversaries and the incompetence of the west have weakened their will.
With their bombs, Serb leaders appear ready to stop at nothing until the
Moslems endorse a peace plan which formally puts an end to their Bosnian
state.

A SENIOR official in President Boris Yeltsin's administration yesterday
warned Russia's pro-reform parties they should co-operate over the December
12 elections or be denounced as being unwilling to do so 'for the good of
Russia'.
Mr Vyacheslav Volkov, deputy head of the president's administration, said
Russia's Choice, set up at the weekend by supporters of Mr Yeltsin and a
number of anti-Communist parties, would convene leaders of all similar
groups two weeks before the elections. Politicians who rejected an agreement
'not to get in each other's way and not shoot arrows at each other' would be
publicly denounced.
This ultimatum will further fuel discontent about heavy-handedness and
bullying from the president's supporters.
Mr Konstantin Borovoi, head of the liberal Economic Freedom party, who has
refused to join Russia's Choice, even though he shares its economic
platform, rejected 'co-operation proposed in the form of blackmail. . . if
they continue this way we will boycott the elections.'

RUSSIA'S defence minister, Mr Pavel Grachev, said yesterday his country
could not help in Georgia with military action, as this could be interpreted
as interfering in the internal affairs of another country, Reuter reports.
But Mr Grachev, on a visit to Finland, said Russian, Azerbaijani, Armenian
and Georgian troops could go to Tbilisi at the request of Mr Eduard
Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, to secure supplies of food and medicine
into the country.
Rebels backing ex-president Zviad Gamsakhurdia have made strong gains in
western Georgia in recent days, threatening supplies to the capital.
'Georgia is an independent state with which Russia does not have any
agreement on mutual military co-operation. Georgia is not a CIS country and
is not thus part of collective security arrangements,' Mr Grachev said. His
comments followed a late-night appeal for military help by Mr Shevardnadze.

Hungary is to try again to bring officials of the former communist regime to
justice after parliament yesterday opened the way for war crimes trials,
writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest. Prosecutions will centre on torture,
mass shootings and other 'inhuman' means used to suppress the 1956
revolution. That uprising against Soviet occupation and communist rule left
2,500 dead and many more injured. Few cases are likely to go before the
courts and legal experts expect sentences to be light, even suspended. Some
veterans of 1956 even argue for an amnesty, after justice is done.

<TEXT>
POLICE in Nicosia yesterday sprayed tear-gas at schoolchildren demonstrating
against a controversial visit to Cyprus by Queen Elizabeth.
The Queen's visit, planned as part of the Commonwealth Conference which
opens tomorrow has revived bitter memories of two critical periods in the
island's history - the struggle for independence from Britain and the
Turkish invasion of the island in 1974, which has left it divided.
The Queen, in Nicosia to receive the key of the city, was greeted by jeering
Greek Cypriots who yelled: 'We don't want you here.' Earlier, police had
used tear gas to disperse dozens of schoolchildren to clear the road for the
Queen.
At the ceremony, the mayor of Nicosia, Mr Lellos Demetriades, told the
Queen: 'The city has the unenviable title of the last divided capital in
Europe.' Outside, angry demonstrators recalled the island's guerrilla war
for independence from Britain in the 1950s when EOKA guerrillas fought for
unity between Cyprus and Greece.
In 1955, Britain hanged nine men accused of guerrilla activity. The Queen
had turned down pleas for mercy.
Many Cypriots also resent Britain's role during the events of 1974, when
Greek Cypriots still hoping for union with Greece, staged a short-lived coup
against the then-president Makarios.
Turkey, which ruled Cyprus for more than 300 years, responded by invading
the north of the island, saying it had to protect the Turkish Cypriot
minority.
As Greek-Cypriots jeered the Queen during her visit to Nicosia she was able
to chat amicably with peacekeepers from her country's former Falklands
conflict adversary Argentina, Reuter reports from Nicosia. The Argentinians
later stood firmly to attention as a British military band played 'God save
the Queen'.

A nationwide strike by Italian transport workers yesterday heralded the
start of 10 days of serious labour protests by the country's air, maritime
and rail workers, writes Robert Graham. The protests will culminate in a
four-hour general strike scheduled for October 28. Like the strike called by
the three main trade union confederations, the protests in the transport
sector are directed against the government's 1994 austerity budget and the
growing threat of unemployment.

<TEXT>
STRIKING Air France workers yesterday brought chaos to the two main airports
in Paris, blocking runways and forcing the cancellation of flights to and
from the French capital.
The protests are the most serious to be launched against the loss-making
airline's recovery plan, which was announced last month and which involves
the loss of 4,000 jobs by the end of next year and the implementation of
economy measures. Both Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports were paralysed by
the protests, which left hundreds of passengers stranded at airports and on
board aircraft. Orly later re-opened.
Air France said it was unclear what the situation would be today, but it
seemed likely that flights serving destinations in Europe, Turkey and Israel
would be cancelled. The airline said that between five and 10 long-haul
flights were expected to operate from Charles de Gaulle airport tomorrow.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE state may be going broke, industry may be flat on its back, but the west
German citizen is still doing very nicely, thank you (see charts above).
The average family has financial reserves worth some DM110,000 (Pounds
44,700) and has no debt troubles, according to a Bundesbank study of
post-war household wealth in Germany, published today in its October monthly
report.
Including houses, other property and consumer durables, net personal assets
in the region totalled well over DM8,000bn at the end of last year. This
national nest-egg has grown more than 50 per cent faster than disposable
incomes in the past 20 years, and in the meantime real per capita growth in
economic output has exceeded the European Community average by a third.
The implied message in this brief history of good times past - published as
the national debate on the future of Germany's economic and social system
comes to a head - is that the population can tolerate belt-tightening by
government and industry without too much grief.
More explicit is a warning to east Germans that getting rich requires hard
work. Wealth creation in the former GDR has advanced relatively quickly, the
report says. But 'further progress along this road cannot be expected from
west German transfers . . . it will depend far more on increased production
and incomes.'
Three years after unification, and thanks largely to hand-outs from Bonn
totalling around DM180bn this year alone, almost two-thirds of households in
the east already have at least one car, compared with 73 per cent in the
west; the place is saturated with television sets, and 90 per cent of homes
have a washing machine, the report says.
Since unification, and despite the shopping extravaganza which followed,
private financial reserves in the former communist command economy have
grown a third to an average DM30,000 per household.
Disposable incomes have increased a real 17 per cent, although they are
still only 55 per cent of western levels. As the growth in their private
capital base demonstrates, despite their relative poverty, easterners share
that great German virtue - thrift - with westerners.
They save around 13 per cent of their disposable income, compared with 14
per cent in the west, and they keep almost 80 per cent of their funds in
banks and building societies.
Westerners, on the other hand, spread their piles more widely. Around 30 per
cent of their funds are locked up in pensions and life insurance schemes.
A further quarter is invested in securities, but since caution is the
watchword, most of that is in bonds or similar instruments.
Only a token DM128bn - or 4 per cent of total private capital assets - is at
the mercy of the the stock market.
According to Bundesbank estimates, annual dividends and interest earnings of
DM173bn, account for 8.5 per cent of total west German private incomes.
Bricks and mortar have gained popularity only slowly. The rate of home
ownership in west Germany has increased from 38 per cent to around 50 per
cent in the past 30 years, but still lags behind other EC countries and the
US. Although home loans account for three-quarters of total private debt of
DM1,215bn in the west, high land and construction prices discourage would-
be buyers, the report says.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Dutch group Akzo raided by Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission believes Akzo, the Dutch chemicals group, has
hindered an investigation into what could be a serious breach of EC
competition rules.
The Commission inquiry is believed to focus on Akzo's growing dominance of
the salt market, following the group's takeover of Dansk Salt of Denmark
earlier this year. Akzo claims to be the world's biggest salt producer.
Brussels yesterday threatened Akzo with a daily penalty of Ecu1,000 (Pounds
776) because its anti-trust investigators were refused access to the group's
headquarters in Arnhem earlier this month. The threat was lifted after Akzo
allowed the Commission to enter its offices.
Akzo claims that when the EC team first visited Arnhem, it was not
authorised to carry out a search. The same team was allowed to enter the
offices of Akzo Chemicals at other locations in the Netherlands.
'They hadn't done their homework,' said one Akzo executive yesterday. 'We
co-operate with these studies because we have nothing to hide, but when they
have the wrong documents we will not allow them in.'
However, Brussels officials denied they needed specific authorisation. In a
strongly worded statement, the Commission said it would 'under no
circumstances' tolerate attempts to escape such investigations, commonly
known as 'dawn raids'. Raids are carried out without warning when Brussels
suspects an infringement of EC rules, particularly in cases involving
alleged price-fixing, or abuse of a company's dominant position.
Neither Akzo nor the Commission would comment on the reason for the raids,
which took place on October 6 and 7, but industry sources suggested that the
inquiry followed complaints by Danish consumers and competitors in the salt
market. Akzo, in addition to acquiring Dansk Salt, last month took a
majority stake in a Danish producer of food ingredients, which owns an
Icelandic salt manufacturer.
Most of the 15m tonnes of salt produced by Akzo annually is intended for use
in industrial electrolysis by the chemicals industry, for instance to
produce chloride and caustic soda.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S intelligence services are to be reorganised under a single
authority, controlled directly by the prime minister.
This was the outcome of a special meeting called on Monday evening by
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro of the senior ministers, defence chiefs and
heads of the intelligence services. The meeting had been prompted by
mounting evidence that elements of Italy's intelligence community were
linked to organised crime and had been behind acts of terrorism.
Legislation outlining the new authority is expected to be submitted to
parliament in the form of a decree by the end of the month. The two
principal existing agencies - Sisde (domestic intelligence) and Sismi
(military intelligence) - will disappear. They will be replaced by two
revamped organisations whose responsibilities will be split between domestic
and foreign intelligence activities.
However, direct ministerial responsibility will remain as it was with Sisde
and Sismi - the Interior Ministry will supervise domestic intelligence, the
Defence Ministry the foreign (and national security) side. Recruitment is
due to be by exam and the previously large covert budgets are expected to be
curtailed. The intelligence services were last restructured in 1977.
Parliament and the prime minister have exercised negligible monitoring
powers. Despite repeated scandals, and known links with right-wing
extremists, the P2 Masonic lodge and elements of the Mafia, the intelligence
services have remained a law unto themselves. The question now is the likely
behaviour of the large numbers of intelligence personnel being made
redundant. Many commentators believe the fears of these people who risk
losing their jobs and their immunity has been behind the recent wave of
bombings, coup rumours and campaigns of misinformation.

FT  20 OCT 93 / EC plans 5 per cent jobless target: Employment package urges
wage restraint and lower labour costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is calling for wage restraint, a reduction in
companies' welfare obligations, and tax incentives for training, as part of
a radical plan to reduce unemployment in the European Community from the
current 10.4 per cent to 5 per cent by the year 2000.
The plan, spelt out yesterday by Mr Padraig Flynn, the EC social affairs
commissioner, aims to combine 'solidarity and competitiveness' and will form
a key element of Mr Jacques Delors' White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness
and Employment, due to be published next month. Although Mr Flynn rejected
wholesale labour market deregulation, he went further than before in
spelling out the changes required to traditional forms of labour protection
and the sacrifices needed from the securely employed.
'I believe we should encourage increases in hourly wages below the rate of
productivity growth, not in order to reduce wages, but in order to increase
the number of jobs that can be made available,' said Mr Flynn, addressing a
three-day conference on employment in Europe, organised by the Commission.
He also suggested making employers' non-wage social security costs less
regressive to create more jobs for the less skilled and proposed switching
some of those costs from employers to general taxation.
This attempt to reduce the price of labour will be greeted with suspicion by
Europe's trade unions. However, Mr Flynn has couched the changes in terms
that will appeal to the left: 'Europe needs a new solidarity - between those
with work and those without, and between those who earn their income from
wages and from investments.'
He also called for a progressive reduction in average hours of work per
employee and for 'minimising the financial incentives for longer hours
amongst the better paid'. Mr Flynn said that tinkering with the old system
would no longer suffice and that 're-regulation' was required to take
account of labour market changes, such as the increase in part-time and
temporary work. He proposed, for example, the restructuring of government
income support schemes to be combined with income from work.
Mrs Miet Smets, the Belgian labour minister, said the EC should not be made
a scapegoat for unemployment and claimed that without its efforts the
situation would be worse. She proposed an EC-wide energy tax to promote
employment and an increase in career breaks to create jobs.

BELGIUM will today begin the formal stage of talks between government,
employers and unions aimed at reforming the social security system,
improving the competitiveness of Belgian companies and reducing
unemployment.
An outline agreement, submitted to the Belgian government yesterday,
envisages far-reaching changes to the social security system. The brunt of
efforts to reduce expenditure would fall on health and unemployment
benefits.
Without immediate action, the report forecasts that Belgium's social
security deficit could rise to BFr100bn (Pounds 1.9bn) by 1996. The report
also proposes freezing real salary increases between 1994 and 1996, although
it says the country's basic system of wage indexation should be maintained.

FT  20 OCT 93 / EC will boost aid to east Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community is likely at least to double its aid to east Germany
next year from the current annual figure of Ecu1bn (Pounds 770m) to try to
narrow the region's economic gap with the rest of the EC.
Mr Bruce Millan, commissioner for regional policy, said in London yesterday
that east Germany was due to receive a 'very considerable' increase in
structural fund payments next year, but did not give a figure.
The payments would rise as eastern Germany was brought fully into the
mechanism for channelling money to regions with gross domestic product per
head of less than 75 per cent of the EC average.
In parts of east Germany, the figure was only 30-40 per cent, Mr Millan
said. 'The scale of problems is unbelievable.'
His comments reflect a desire by the Commission to show that the EC is
taking east Germany's structural problems seriously.
Anti-EC feeling in Germany seems partly to reflect the belief that the
Community is leaving west Germany to shoulder the burden alone, a view put
last month by Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, chief executive of Dresdner Bank.
Separately, Mr Millan held out the hope of EC cash for British local
authorities seeking funds for tourism and urban regeneration projects in
southern England.
He said criteria on structural funding for areas in industrial decline had
been widened to include those suffering from problems in non-traditional
industries.
In a map submitted by the UK government, London and south coast towns like
Brighton are included for the first time among applicants for structural aid
to Britain which could amount to Pounds 1bn a year.
These southern areas often have urban problems and fading tourism
industries.

December long gilt future reached a new contract high of 114.26 after the
Bank of England announced there would be no gilt auction in November and
dealers speculated that October's auction may be the last this year. The
record size of the October auction, slated at Pounds 3.5bn, and the
government's well advanced funding programme sparked speculation that the
Bank might also cancel the December auction. There would be no gilt auction
next month because of the timing of the Budget.

next month's Budget.
Amid angry exchanges in the House of Commons with Mr John Smith, the Labour
leader, Mr Major also hinted that the Treasury will seek to raise part of
the additional revenue it needs by closing so-called tax loopholes.
Mr Major's upbeat assessment that the economic recovery will be sustained
followed a warning to the cabinet from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor,
that the government's Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement must be reduced.
But fears that recession elsewhere in Europe and weakening consumer
confidence could abort the upturn prompted renewed warnings from prominent
Conservative backbench MPs about the risks of large tax increases.
While a majority of Tory MPs appear resigned to an overall rise in tax of
Pounds 2bn or Pounds 3bn, Mr Clarke was told at an 80-strong meeting last
night of the party's backbench finance committee to rule out higher income
taxes.
Mr John Townend, the chairman of the committee, said afterwards the general
view was that Mr Clarke should do nothing to prejudice the economic
recovery.
That caution was reinforced by a recommendation from the Treasury's panel of
outside economic advisers that Mr Clarke should opt for only a 'modest'
tightening of fiscal policy next year. The advisers said this should be
accompanied by an early cut in interest rates and by a medium-term package
of spending and tax measures to reduce borrowing.
After an hour-long cabinet discussion of the economic outlook, Downing
Street issued only a brief statement saying that Mr Clarke would 'take into
account' his colleagues' views when framing the November Budget.
But ministers said the chancellor - with the support of some cabinet
ministers - had left no doubt that he was planning to add to the Pounds 7bn
package of tax increases pencilled in for April.
Most senior ministers believe Mr Clarke will be obliged to raise at least an
extra Pounds 3bn in revenue despite the opposition of several rightwing
colleagues.
Some believe that if the economic outlook improves over the next few weeks
the figure could be closer to Pounds 5bn or Pounds 6bn, with a 1 percentage
point cut in interest rates to 'sweeten' the package.
Several cabinet ministers, including Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, are thought to favour further restrictions on mortgage
interest relief, perhaps limiting it to 15 per cent. Others believe personal
income tax allowances should be restricted to the 20p rate, a move which
might be combined with a modest extension of VAT.
Rejecting calls from Mr Smith to reverse the planned introduction of VAT on
fuel, Mr Major underlined his determination to reduce borrowing by telling
MPs: 'The reality is that we need to cope with the fiscal deficit and we
have the courage to do so.'
But he responded positively to Labour calls for any tax rises to focus on
ending tax concessions enjoyed by wealthy individuals, companies and
overseas residents.
Alluding to the Treasury's internal forecast that the economy will grow by
about 1.75 per cent this year, Mr Major added that evidence that recovery
had taken root was 'unmistakable'. Mr Clarke echoed that view at a meeting
of the National Housing and Town Planning Council.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Vauxhall to enter credit-card market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VAUXHALL MOTORS, a subsidiary of General Motors, has become the first UK car
manufacturer to enter the credit-card market, launching a British version of
the GM card currently available in the US.
The card, to be issued in association with HFC bank, will offer customers a
discount of up to Pounds 2,500 towards the cost of a new Vauxhall car.
Customers will be able to choose either a Visa or MasterCard general-purpose
credit card, and will pay no annual fee. The annualised percentage rate of
interest will be 19.9 per cent, compared with 22.9 per cent at Barclaycard,
which has 8.8m cards in issue, and 23.9 per cent at National Westminster
bank, which has 4m cards.
Since the GM card was launched in the US in September 1992, almost 8m people
have become cardholders. There are a further 800,000 in Canada, where it
became available last June. GM said the card had helped sell over 70,000
vehicles.
Cardholders will receive a rebate of 5 per cent of the value of all
purchases made with the card, up to a maximum of Pounds 500 a year. These
rebate points can be put towards the price of a new vehicle, up to a maximum
of Pounds 2,500 for any one car. The points will also apply to balances
transferred from other cards to the GM card, which is due to become
available in the new year.
Mr Charles Golden, chairman and managing director of Vauxhall, said the aim
was to strengthen the relationship with existing Vauxhall customers and to
give the company an advantage in attracting customers.
The card could signal a strengthening of competition in the UK credit card
market. MBNA American bank has announced its intention to set up a European
headquarters and issue credit cards in the UK.
Company car drivers will have the option of turning their discount points
into vouchers that can be used in some shops, hotels and restaurants, rather
than towards a reduction in a new car. This part of the scheme will take
effect next April.
GM Europe will be monitoring the progress of the card in the UK with a view
to possible expansion into Europe, but Vauxhall made the point that the UK's
pattern of credit card use is closer to the US pattern than is the case
elsewhere in Europe.
The Consumers Association welcomed the card for its competitive interest
rates rather than for the 'gimmick' of the discount on a new car.

FT  20 OCT 93 / Lonrho power balance slips away from Rowland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TINY ROWLAND'S reign as the undisputed master of Lonrho came to an end
yesterday after the international group's board agreed to the appointment of
non-executive directors for the first time in 20 years.
In a meeting that lasted barely 20 minutes the 12-man board voted
unanimously to appoint its first non-executive directors nominated by Mr
Dieter Bock, the group's joint chief executive, Mr Peter Harper, a director
of the conglomerate Hanson, and Mr Stephen Walls, chairman of the food
group, Albert Fisher.
In a last-minute move, however, Mr Rowland succeeded in having two other
directors appointed: Sir John Leahy, former ambassador to South Africa as a
non-executive, and Mr Terence Wilkinson, managing director of Lonrho's South
African interests who has been with the group since 1973, as an executive.
Although the much-heralded boardroom showdown between Lonrho's charismatic
guiding force for 30 years, and Mr Bock, the steely German financier
appointed last year, ended bloodlessly, there was little doubt that the
balance of power had slipped decisively away from the company's 75-year-old
elder statesman.
The real negotiations had taken place the previous afternoon in private at
the company's Cheapside head office in the City of London where a deal was
struck that preserved the appearance of compromise.
Mr Rowland insisted that Mr Bock's nominees should be balanced by a further
two appointments. Mr Bock acquiesced, because he 'did not want to embroil
the company in an expensive public row', according to one of his advisers.
Mr Rowland has been opposed to non-executives - whom he once described as
'decorations on a Christmas tree' - since 1973 when the 'straight eight'
directors tried unsuccessfully to remove him. Mr Rowland succeeded 12 days
ago in delaying the appointments of Mr Harper and Mr Walls.
Mr Bock believes, according to the adviser, that both Sir John and Mr
Wilkinson will act as impartial directors. Colleagues of Sir John and Mr
Wilkinson said yesterday that they were 'individualists'.
Mr Bock, who acquired 18.8 per cent of Lonrho's shares at the start of the
year and then became joint chief executive, is therefore convinced that the
balance on the board, which now has 16 members, has been tipped in his
favour, because he believes he already has the backing of several
executives.
