FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (3): This is the one to
match / Company profile of Parametric Technology
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WHEN A company boosts sales from Dollars 11m in 1989 to nearly Dollars 87m
last year, and roughly doubles its net profits every year, it is easy to see
why it captures many of the superlatives regularly dished out by observers
of its industry and financial analysts.
Such is the case with Massachusetts-based Parametric Technology, which over
the past five years has emerged from nowhere to claim leadership in the
mechanical design automation industry - and has become one of the darlings
of Wall Street in the process.
In July, the company reported a 101 per cent surge in third-quarter earnings
to Dollars 11.4m. Its market capitalisation exceeds Dollars 2bn and Mr
Steven Walske, president and chief executive, says: 'We continue to be the
driving force in the market place for high-end mechanical design automation
software products.'
Independent observers enthuse similarly. The Cad Report, an industry
newsletter, says Parametric's Pro/Engineer family of software products has
become the most attractive system for three-dimensional mechanical design,
and adds that the company's breathtaking growth should not surprise anyone.
The object of all this adulation is a company formed in 1985 by Mr Sam
Geisberg. Recognising earlier than many how things were going in the Cadcam
industry, Mr Geisberg wanted to develop a new Cadcam system that was not
only technologically innovative in itself but also not restricted to any
particular hardware.
The first Pro/Engineer was launched in 1988 and is now a family of about 27
software modules ranging from conceptual design to manufacturing. The
underlying business strategy is to concentrate on mechanical
design-through-manufacturing, and to set the pace through 'technological
leadership, hardware independence, aggressive price/performance, worldwide
distribution and extensive customer support'.
In practice, this means that Parametric sells only software, which runs on
all the major Unix platforms including the latest releases from Sun,
Hewlett-Packard, Silicon Graphics, DEC and IBM. At the CIM '93 show at
Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre, it will be running Pro/Engineer on
a Compaq 486-based Deskpro 66M under Windows HT, Microsoft's new 32-bit
operating system.
It also means regular product enhancements - two big releases each year
compared with one for many of its rivals. Release 11 of Pro/Engineer was
made this May, and introduced two new software products: Pro/Dieface, which
provides stamping designers with the tools to define complex components used
in the manufacture of car body panels and other 'deep drawn' products; and
Pro/PDM (Parametric Design Manager), which manages the development and
support of large-scale parametric designs and traditional engineering data.
And then there is the core product itself, Pro/Engineer. This uses a unique,
single data structure which, says Parametric, improves interaction among
engineers by allowing all members of the product development team to work on
the design simultaneously. It also uses 'parametric design,' which means
that when a dimension such as a diameter is changed, the software works out
on its own how much to change the rest of the product accordingly.
According to The Cad Report, other advantages of Pro/Engineer are that it is
visually attractive, has menu terms that mean something to engineers and is
reasonably priced.
Competitors really began to take notice of Parametric last year when it
announced that Caterpillar, the world's largest construction equipment
group, had ordered 2,000 'seats' - the term used in the industry for copies
of the software - in what is believed to be the biggest single order ever
received by a Cadcam company. Cummins Engine also said it would
progressively standardise on Pro/Engineer, and Toyota and Ford placed
significant orders.
To make the most of its opportunities, Parametric is now aggressively
expanding outside the US. Its international sales grew by 80 per cent last
year.
In Europe, it has rapidly expanded its presence in the past two years, and
sales more than doubled last year following heavy investments to broaden the
company's direct sales and support operations throughout the continent.
In an interview earlier this year, Mr Louis Volpe, Parametric's senior
vice-president for marketing and operations, said the company was targeting
electronics packaging and automotive companies in Europe. It hoped to use
the new Pro/Dieface software as a way to expand its presence in the
automotive industry.
But Mr Volpe also made clear that Parametric attaches a high priority to
Asia. Over the next 10 years, it wants to achieve a broad balance between
its US, European and Asian turnover.
Independent distribution channels have been established throughout the
region and a wholly-owned business subsidiary established in Japan, seen as
the biggest market opportunity in Asia. Parametric is keen to exploit the
Japanese move from two-dimensional to three- dimensional mechanical design,
where - surprisingly, perhaps - the country lags behind developments in
Europe and the US.
Some of Parametric's recent orders bear witness to the developing global
strategy. In August, it announced a significant order from British Aerospace
Defence for seats of Pro/Engineer for the Lostock, Lancs, and Stevenage,
Herts sites of the UK company's Dynamics Division.
Earlier in the year, it won an order for more than 100 seats from Groupe
Schneider, the French industrial and electrical products group. It also
picked up one of the largest Cadcam contracts placed by an Indian company -
from Tata Engineering and Locomotive (Telco), which makes cars, trucks and
construction equipment.
Inevitably, Parametric's surge raises questions about how long the growth
can continue. Parametric does not have the diversity of several competitors
whose products go a long way beyond mechanical design-to-manufacturing.
Thus, it could be said to have all its eggs in one basket.
However, according to Mr Walske and Mr Geisberg in the company's 1992 annual
report: 'The size of our market opportunity remains great. There are an
estimated 3m to 5m engineers, designers and drafting professionals worldwide
who could benefit from mechanical design automation software such as
Pro/Engineer.'
The hype surrounding Parametric has set it up as the one to match in its
chosen market. But, according to Engineering Automation Report last October,
the company is not 'a short-term phenomenon, destined to flame out as soon
as the competition gets its act together. This company is here for the long
haul.'
That is backed up by Mr Jeffry Canin, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. 'I am
very confident that Parametric will grow faster than the mechanical design
automation market as a whole,' he says.
But it looks as if further doubling of net earnings could be a tall order,
as Mr Canin adds a cautionary note: the Dollars 1.8bn MDA market worldwide
is growing only at 11-12 per cent a year, and is maturing. Earnings per
share in the year just ended will virtually have doubled, he says, but the
rise in 1993-94 could be a mere 43 per cent.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (4): Data is in the
right bucket / Case study of Ford Electronics in Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUCCESS IN manufacturing, as in most walks of life, is based on
decision-making. But correct decisions can only be taken if employees are in
full possession of information.
If those employees can be 'empowered' with the information, the chances of
getting the entire production process right, from receiving components from
suppliers to sending high-quality finished products to customers on time, is
increased.
This is the thinking behind an enterprise-wide IT strategy at Ford
Electronics Division in Cadiz, Spain, which is part of a worldwide division
providing components for Ford Motor, its parent company and other customers.
The plant was opened three years ago, but in developing its IT strategy
managers took the unusual step of involving potential users in assessing
what their present and future needs would be - rather than simply leaving
everything to be decided and implemented by a systems department.
What has emerged is something that is still very rare in manufacturing -
and, until recently, frustratingly hard to achieve, especially for those who
believed everything their IT vendors were telling them in the mid-1980s.
The plant uses an IT system that integrates every element of the
manufacturing, warehouse, finance, business, plant management and personnel.
All employees have access to on-line real-time information. Every piece of
hardware - whether it be a personal computer, printer of fax machine - and
every application is linked via voice or data networks and all information
is provided to the user with a 'graphical user interface'.
The core of the system is a relational database supplied by Oracle, the
California-based company which is among the world's top three software
suppliers. Employees share common information which they use in different
ways, but most importantly they can access the information in the form they
require.
The problem with many traditional database systems is that they are
'data-rich but information poor,' according to Mr Chris Stephenson,
manufacturing applications manager at Oracle UK. The Oracle system works as
if the user is picking up a bucket of data and putting it into his bucket,
for example a PC, after which he can do what he likes with it.
As the Cadiz plant is part of a worldwide corporation, its system is linked
to Ford Electronics Division's database and information is downloaded and
uploaded as required. Most of the data, though, is generated on the plant
floor and the key is to be able to get hold of it quickly and flexibly.
For example, all incoming components from suppliers are barcoded, and the
information is downloaded into the database. The system can be programmed to
alert operators if a part needs to be checked or if it can proceed to the
next stage. The progress of the component through the plant can be traced so
that, if the ultimate customer complains about the finished product, all the
information on the original suppliers is maintained in the database.
The availability of real-time information allows an operator - working,
perhaps, on the night-shift when there are no computer engineers around - to
assess what to do if a part is in short supply. The database will tell him
whether the part is in, and whether it has been allocated to a department
that does not need it urgently.
High-quality information on production bottlenecks can be made
instantaneously available, and data, for example on the top five problems on
the plant floor, readily obtained - even down to the performance of
individual robots.
All this represents 'tangible business savings,' says Mr Madjid Homayounfal,
information systems manager at Ford Electronics' Enfield plant in the UK,
where planning for the installation of a similar system has been completed.
Although the system at Cadiz is in effect one database, it is in reality a
series of integrated applications. The data from the shopfloor is supported
by the Oracle Manufacturing software, then there is Oracle Financial for the
accountants and Oracle Personnel.
Consequently, 'soft issues' such as training and employees' skills are
captured on computer in much the same way as the 'nitty-gritty' data from
the production process. A supervisor wanting to know what skills are
available from his work group for a particular project can call them up
quickly from the database without having to wait for a personnel department
to provide it.
This is what is meant by empowerment, although it is clearly an area where
companies have to be diplomatic, says Mr Homayounfal. But worries about such
databases can be allayed by making employees feel part of the whole process,
which could be used to track people's education and training achievements.
Ford is not saying how much money it will save from the Cadiz database but
is clearly impressed by the business benefits, in terms of both time and
money saved.
The benefits of such a database could multiply if installed across several
plants in a global business. It would be relatively simple to produce, in a
matter of minutes, a list of the five most common production or quality
problems around the group.
Consequently, big customers such as Ford are very important for Oracle,
which had sales of Dollars 1.5bn last year and manufacturing customers
ranging from Asea Brown Boveri to Beijing No 1 Machine Tool Plant.
But the attitude of companies towards making such an investment are pretty
hard-nosed. 'The typical payback would be 12-18 months,' says Mr Stephenson,
because 'things change so fast.' No company could commit itself to a
database that took five years to pay for itself in the current business
environment.
This underlines why even the biggest companies are going for off-the-shelf
packages such as Oracle's, which can be adapted to suit most companies'
needs without changing the core software.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (1): Era of
explosive growth - The impetus behind expansion is the international shift
towards services, increased globalisation, new technology, declining costs
and prices, and deregulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
GROWTH, competition and privatisation are today's watchwords in the
international telecommunications industry.
A few facts give the big picture:
Last year the market for international telecoms traffic grew by around 13
per cent despite widespread recession, according to TeleGeography's 1993
survey of the industry.* That was about ten times the growth in global GDP
over the year.
Around 20 privatisations of national public telecommunications operators
(PTOs) are likely to take place in the next three to four years. Taken
together, the market capitalisation of the newly privatised companies is
likely to be around Dollars 150bn, according to estimates by Mr Richard
Ryder, telecoms analyst at Salomon Brothers in London. Worldwide, some 46
telecommunications companies now have separate listings. By the end of the
decade that number could have doubled.
In Europe alone, according to Mr Ryder's estimates, telecommunications
companies could be a larger equity sector than banks by the end of the
decade. This poses unprecedented challenges and opportunities for the
sector.
Serious international competition between rival alliances of
telecommunications companies is becoming a reality for the first time. In
the last six months both American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the US giant, and
British Telecommunications have formed international alliances with global
pretensions. Both are bidding to become prime outsourcer to the world's
multinational companies. A host of smaller alliances have sprung up, with
most PTOs debating which international clubs to join.
The eruption of mobile communications into the consumer market seems
imminent. For the first time, network operators are marketing packages with
wide appeal beyond the business sector. Most analysts project a trebling of
the number of cellular subscribers by the end of the decade. If this year's
growth figures are sustained, and cheap mobile phones hit the high street by
the mid-1990s, that could be a conservative estimate.
Growth in international telecoms traffic is slower than in the late 1980s,
when it stood at between 15 and 20 per cent a year. But it still far exceeds
growth in the international economy, and is set to continue doing so for the
foreseeable future.
However, it is the nature as much as the size of the recent growth which
signifies. Mr Gregory Staple, editor of TeleGeography, notes that in the US,
Japan, and the UK, the volume of international traffic added by new carriers
last year was, for the first time, greater than the volume of traffic added
by the main established carriers. In the US, MCI added more traffic than
AT&amp;T; Mercury outperformed BT in the UK; IDC and ITK together added more
traffic than KDD in Japan.
'This suggests that head-to-head competition for international market share
will be the reality for most carriers in the years ahead,' he says.
'It also implies that the half dozen new international carriers which will
cut their teeth in the early 1990s - in Sweden, Australia, Malaysia,
Indonesia, Israel and Chile - may have a harder time than the first
generation.'
Competition and privatisation are proceeding hand-in-hand. This June, the
European Community agreed a timetable for competition between operators for
national voice traffic. All the EC's larger countries have agreed to allow
new operators to compete with their PTOs by January 1998 - save for Spain,
which has an extra five years grace.
The thorny question of allowing operators to build new infrastructure of
their own has been deferred. But it would be extraordinary if that were not
also permitted in due course.
BY 1998, it is a fair bet that most of western Europe's leading PTOs will be
wholly or partially in the private sector. The remaining government stake in
British Telecommunications was sold off this summer. Germany, Denmark and
the Netherlands are all proceeding with sales - the last two within the next
year.
The Spanish and Italian PTOs are already listed, and the disposal of more
state shares is imminent. France's Balladur government has begun privatising
in earnest, and telecoms is unlikely to be far down the track. Several of
Europe's smaller states are thinking of privatising their PTOs, albeit after
an interval of corporate status.
Analysts discount fears of market saturation. Mr Robert Morris,
international telecoms analyst at Goldman Sachs, notes in his latest global
survey that in recent years the telecoms sector has consistently
outperformed world market averages.
'In every country we examined, the pace of unit growth - whether it be
access line growth, calling volumes or network utilisation - outstripped the
pace of real domestic GDP growth', he says.
The main reasons for the growth are the international shift towards
services; increased globalisation; new technology; declining costs and
prices; and deregulation.
One point is of particular note. As Mr Morris puts it: 'The industry is
characterised by large up-front investments with very low marginal costs,
such that the unit cost of production is next to zero, contributing to
attractive operating leverage and asset turnover rates.'
To give an idea of what this means in practice, consider the US-UK
translatlantic telecoms route. This summer a consortium of US and European
operators ordered a new undersea fibre-optic system from AT&amp;T and STC
Submarine Systems, the UK-based supplier. Called Tat-12, it has around five
times the circuit capacity of the last system built by STC, and around 12
times the capacity of the first fibre-optic undersea system (called Tat-8),
which dates back only seven years.
In real terms, the price of successive undersea systems has remained
constant, reducing the cost per circuit from around Dollars 45 (Tat-8) to
Dollars 5 (Tat-12).
In the developed world, the problem is not one of generating sufficient
telecoms capacity, but of finding practical and affordable uses for the huge
quantity already available - or soon to be so.
Privatisation and liberalisation will introduce a host of new operators,
small and large, dedicated to the task. Mr Morris views them as an internal
dynamic likely to force the industry into still faster growth -
'liberalisation should fuel continued privatisation efforts throughout the
world and contribute to the continued growth of this industry.'
However, the developed world is only one part of the picture. Most countries
have minimal infrastructure and few telephones. Of 133 countries recently
studied by the International Telecommunications Union, 70 have fewer than
five exchange lines per 100 people. Sweden tops the league with a
'teledensity' of 68 (ie 68 exchange lines per 100 people); Chad takes the
bottom slot with a teledensity of 0.07. Most countries are far closer to
Chad than to Sweden - including most of Asia, Latin America and eastern
Europe.
Unspurprisingly, teledensity correlates closely with national wealth.
Virtually all countries with annual per capita GDP of more than Dollars
7,000 have a teledensity higher than 30. Most of the world has per capita
GDP of less than Dollars 2,000, and a teledensity of less than five.
The contrast is as stark within as between regions. In Asia-Pacific, Hong
Kong has a teledensity of 49 and Singapore 40, whereas the Philippines
languishes at 1.5 and Thailand at 2.7. Even within the European Community,
Portgual (at 32) and France (at 52) are poles apart.
For most countries, then, line growth is the overriding priority. In many
developing and emerging market states, the appetite for more and better
basic networks will lead to a telecoms explosion in the next decade every
bit as dramatic as that being forged by liberalisation, privatisation and
mobile communications in the developed world. Indeed, all three will also be
in evidence in developing countries, as governments look for new sources of
investment and investors come to see wireless local networks as viable
alternatives - not just supplements, as now - to wireline networks.
Asia-Pacific is the region set to experience fastest line growth. Mr Andrew
Harrington, telecoms analyst with Salomon Brothers in Hong Kong, expects the
total number of lines in the region to have doubled by the end of the
decade. That means 100m new access lines, 60m of which will be in China.
Should its government provide a climate favourable to sustained investment
by overseas companies, the opportunities in China are mind-boggling. The
Bejing government's target is to quadruple China's network from 20m to 80m
lines. That means more new lines than the existing networks of Britain and
Germany put together. To make significant progress fast, Mr Harrington is
convinced that China will be forced to allow direct foreign investment by
overseas operators within the next year - 'it will probably take the form of
joint ventures in which Chinese partners retain majority stakes,' he says.
'But if they want to expand fast, they have got to allow in foreign equity,
and a reasonable degree of management control by the overseas investors.'
Back to the developed world, the growth of mobile communications will
dominate industry headlines over the coming year. At a recent FT conference,
Mr Seth Myrby, chief executive of Telia Mobitel, predicted that nine of ten
Swedes would have a mobile phone by the end of the decade. Sweden already
has the highest level of cellular penetration in the world (nine in 100
inhabitants), but that nonetheless constitutes one of the boldest of the
year's claims by a senior industry executive.
Bold, but not fantastic - if you include portable phones linked to wireline
connections. One by one, cellular operators in Europe and the US are
announcing packages for the residential market. The incentive for them to do
so comes partly from increased competition: rival cellular operators to PTOs
are now licensed in most west European countries, and many beyond. It is
also the conseqeunce of the building of new digital cellular networks with
far greater capacity and reliability than their analogue predecessors.
Although handset prices remain prohibitive for all but the highest-income
private consumers, prices are falling fast, and imaginative marketing
gimmicks are making the mobile phone a plausible competitor to the
fixed-line phone for the first time.
So far, the plaudits go to Mercury One-2-One, the UK network jointly owned
by Cable and Wireless and US West, which launched its network last month
with a special residential tariff offering free local calls in the London
area in the evenings and at week-ends. Rival operators have slashed their
London prices, and mobile phones are now in the shops of all the main
electronics retailers.
In the US, the Federal Communications Commission last month laid down ground
rules for personal communications services (PCS) networks, unveiling what
could eventually be a multi-billion dollar business. PCS, similar to
cellular, uses digital technology and greater density of cell sites to
improve reception and multiply capacity: see report, page 8. The FCC has
decided to allow up to seven licences in each PCS market, with two for
larger carriers and five for smaller ones. A significant expansion of US
cellular competition is in the offing.
For the leading operators, a delicate balance has to be struck between
securing one's position in the home market and staking out claims abroad.
The recent activities of AT&amp;T and BT, the most aggressive international
operators, are a telling commentary. In June, BT hailed its Dollars 5.3bn
alliance with MCI, the US carrier, as the telecoms deal of the century. The
deal involved BT taking a 20 per cent stake in MCI, the second largest US
long-distance carrier, and the formation of a Dollars 1bn joint venture
company with MCI to stake out claims in the international market.
This summer AT&amp;T set up an international outsourcing venture of its own,
called Worldsource. But not to be outdone in the investment league, in
August it spent more than Dollars 12bn buying McCaw, one of the largest US
cellular companies, to reinforce its position at home.
Talk to the executives of both companies, and the word 'multimedia' is more
likely to come up than 'telephone.' Services spanning the
telecoms/computing/entertainment divides are already on offer; the prospect
of new multimedia offerings causes more excitement than any other subject in
today's telecoms industry. Later articles in the survey explain why and how.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of Computers in Manufacturing (1): This time IT has
to work - With Cadcam - computer-aided design and manufacturing - reaching
new levels of sophistication, the challenge for customers is to find what is
right for them rather than pay for what the equipment vendors want them to
buy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THERE CAN be few markets where the disappointments of the past are so
closely matched by the promise for the future as that of the computers and
information technology products used in manufacturing.
Customers faced with an increasingly complex array of technologies are
trying to forget the frustrations of the mid-to-late 1980s - when many of
the products they bought simply failed to live up to expectations.
Now, in the more straitened circumstances of the 1990s when all capital
investments have to be scrutinised closely, especially in the recession-hit
engineering sector, advances in technology promise to make real some of the
illusory gains of the past.
That, at least, is what IT vendors will be hoping to prove at the Computers
in Manufacturing Show (CIM '93), which runs from tomorrow until Thursday at
Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre - under the motto: 'Squeeze harder.'
Behind the optimism lies the conviction that their customers have learnt
from the past, too. No longer dazzled by technology, manufacturers are
learning the hard way that they need a business strategy that is supported
and enhanced by IT, rather than vice versa .
The state of the current market place is revealed by recent studies, backed
up by the views of leading vendors, which show spending on IT continuing to
rise even as customers try to achieve value for money.
In July, the annual survey by Price Waterhouse Management Consultants of
spending on IT suggested it had slipped out of the grip of British managers
and might be racing away out of control.
It found that spending had risen by 9 per cent last year, bringing the
increase in the past three years to nearly 50 per cent. British managers had
yet to tackle effectively the problem of how to make the computer work more
cheaply for their companies, it said.
The Price Waterhouse survey covered all UK businesses and included the
public sector, but figures produced by Benchmark for CIM '93 show that
spending on IT in the manufacturing sector has also continued to rise.
Total spending by manufacturers on computers for manufacturing applications
rose from Pounds 1.37bn in 1992-93 to a projected Pounds 1.41bn in the 12
months from this summer, with engineering industries accounting for Pounds
780m and process industries for Pounds 628m.
Further research by Benchmark during the summer revealed what Mr John
Puttick, European director of manufacturing for PA Consulting Group, sees as
a communication gap between IT suppliers and manufacturers that is holding
back UK industry.
The research showed that manufacturers remained unconvinced and distrustful
of the benefits of IT and reverted to manual methods during critical
production runs. Some 43 per cent of managers polled still believed that
manual methods were more suited to control shopfloor processes and 21 per
cent were convinced that manual methods were better for scheduling
production.
Mr Puttick says manufacturers are 'so caught up in the chaotic world of the
factory floor that they are unable to define their problems adequately, let
alone explain them to anyone else. Meanwhile, IT suppliers do not fully
understand the manufacturing world and are so sales-oriented that they are
not focusing on the real problem.'
On top of that, manufacturers clearly worry about what the spending on IT
has achieved. Mr John Farrant, consultant at IBM Consulting Group, says that
over the past 10 years there has been a dramatic increase in the performance
of IT systems, with the change from mainframes to personal computers and now
workstations, and 'staggering' development in Cadcam technology.
'But over the last couple of years, people have been saying: 'I've invested,
I've bought the technology, but I'm not sure it's doing anything for me'.'
A few years back, he says, potential purchasers of a new Cad system would be
'literally bedazzled' by the vendor's presentation, and would burst into
spontaneous applause. 'But the recession has changed all that. People are
saying that they must quantify the benefits of a new investment.'
Mr Farrant contrasts the hard-nosed approach to IT buying in the US - where
it is a 'business-led decision, not driven by the technology' - to the more
experimental approach in the UK, where industry has tended to use technology
to see what the benefits are.
But some see another contrast between attitudes in the UK and those of
continental Europe. Mr Ray Krienke, sales co-ordinator for European
manufacturing industry at the Cadcam supplier Intergraph, says UK
manufacturers have always tried to get value for money, because of the
cyclical nature of the UK market.
'In Germany, it has been the other extreme - companies have stuck with a
system if it did a job, and expanded it regularly every year. But in the
past nine months, that attitude has changed because of the recession, and
capital spending has halted or been called into question.'
Across Europe as a whole, he says, most manufacturers have invested
significantly in Cadcam. 'They have speeded up a function or a department,
and they have made a return, but so has everyone else.
'Now they are trying to take another step forward on return on investment.
They can continue increasing efficiency through departmental solutions, and
can also recognise the huge benefits from sharing data across departments.'
It is in this area, integrating through IT all the functions involved in
product development and manufacturing, that most progress still has to be
made, and where the future competitive advantages from spending on IT could
well be derived.
Mr Farrant sees the main challenge for IT vendors as helping companies to
integrate the engineering world with that of manufacturing itself which,
after going through several painful phases, is about 15 years ahead of
engineering in terms of the control offered by IT over business functions.
He suggests that, if companies wish to reduce the cost of the design phase
in product development - often estimated to be as much as 80 per cent of the
total - they need to ensure that the design engineer has all the relevant
information available about the product and its business context, rather
than just its design data. 'This is where artificial intelligence can help
enormously,' he says.
The desire by manufacturers to ensure that information is available
throughout the business also points to an increasing role for powerful
databases and their related applications software, as illustrated by the
experience of Ford Electronics in Spain (see Page 2).
The need for companies to 'pull things together' via their IT investments
also convinces Mr Krienke that there are still good opportunities in
relatively mature industrial sectors such as automotive and aerospace
industries.
'Their huge investments in systems have delivered some of the benefits they
expected but not all. Now they are asking whether there is a better way of
doing things. So they are looking at systems that can help them see the big
picture as well as give them more 'functionality' at departmental level.'
From the customer's point of view, though, the big picture also involves
having a clear idea of how the business works before using IT. Then the
pay-backs that have proved unachievable in the past can become a reality.

FT  18 OCT 93 / The people and the treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's constitutional court ruling, giving the green light to the
Maastricht Treaty of European Union, is a cause of celebration on at least
two counts. After nearly two years of cliff-hanging setbacks and delays, the
treaty can at last come into force. No one knows any more how this treaty
will perform, but at least it has now been brought more or less intact to
the starting line.
As a result, next week's European Community summit in Brussels should be a
jolly party. We can expect plenty of the usual rhetoric from the usual
Euro-enthusiasts about the deathless claims of the European ideal; and we
can expect John Major to put in his predictable penny's worth, to reassure
the Tory faithful that the treaty means even less than it says, thanks to
his doughty defence of the national interest.
But the second cause of celebration is that the German ruling laid down an
important marker for the need for political legitimacy. In the run-up to the
decision, there had been widespread apprehension that the red-robed judges
in Karlsruhe might tie the treaty in so many legal knots as to bring it
crashing to the ground. Some feared the court would rule that the transfer
of powers inherent in the treaty would be incompatible with German
sovereignty; others that Maastricht was unacceptable because it gave too few
powers to the European Parliament.
Instead, the judges merely ruled that the Maastricht treaty in particular,
and the Community in general, are essentially conditional on the
legitimation of popular democracy. And since popular democracy is still
primarily expressed through national parliaments, the consequence is that
Maastricht cannot be implemented without the support and approval of the
German parliament. 'The democracy principle does not prevent Germany joining
a supranationally organised community of states,' said the court. 'But a
precondition of membership is a guarantee that legitimation and influence by
the people are secured within the association of states.
'It is principally the peoples of the member states who must legitimate this
through their national parliaments . . . In addition, and increasingly as
European nations grow together, democratic legitimation is conveyed by the
European Parliament elected by the citizens of member states.
'If, as is currently the case, the peoples convey democratic legitimation
through national parliaments, then the democratic principle sets limits on
the expansion of the tasks and powers of the European Communities. The
German Bundestag must retain tasks and powers of substantial weight.'
As a description of political reality, this is an admirably pithy and
middle-of-the-road synthesis - as far as it goes. German governments have
long been in the forefront of those seeking a strengthening of the
Community's political institutions, especially the European Parliament. But
the plain fact is that the Community is still essentially a grouping of
nation states. As a result, democratic legitimation has to come largely
through national parliaments.
Unfortunately, the Karlsruhe judgment does not go far enough: it describes
reality, but does not offer a solution to the political challenge of
Maastricht. It is easy to underline the point that the Community is
critically dependent on democratic support; not just because all claims to
political legitimacy in Europe hang essentially on popular democracy, but
because the Maastricht treaty in particular came within a whisker of being
thrown out by the voters. Since power still lies mainly with the Council of
Ministers, it is also easy to see that democracy must come mainly through
national parliaments; denunciations of the Community as a threatening
mega-state are simply the product of delirious fantasy.
The problem is that the Community's popular legitimacy has been severely
shaken; the challenge facing the 12 is not just working out how to implement
a treaty whose practical credibility has been battered by events but, even
more important, how to recover popular support for the general objectives of
the enterprise.
The Karlsruhe prescription is that the Bundestag (and other national
parliaments) must exercise a bigger role in the Community process. This is a
very proper thought, from a national point of view. But it is not clear how,
in operative terms, it can be squared with any reasonably expeditious
decision-making process in Brussels.
It is the role of parliaments to control initiatives taken by governments.
But if all 12 parliaments increase their controlling function, the unstated
premise of the prescription is that any or all of them must be able to slow
the Community right down, and perhaps even stop it entirely. This could only
help restore legitimacy to the Community in a very limited sense, and on the
narrow assumption that the voters only want to be reassured that nothing
much will be decided in Brussels in future.
Moreover, it is not easy to square a systematic increase in the controlling
power of national parliaments with majority voting in the Council of
Ministers, which will be strengthened by the Maastricht treaty. Moreover,
even if the basic rules remain the same, majority voting will be further
strengthened if the Community is enlarged, because more members mean more
countries can be outvoted.
Somehow, the member states have got to come up with some positive answers to
the problem of legitimacy. And that means finding ways to ensure that the
Community meets the needs of electorates, in terms of prosperity and
economic growth, and is seen to do so.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Monday Interview: Ketchup in his veins - Mike Quinlan,
chairman of McDonald's, talks to Guy de Jonquieres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If there is one thing Mike Quinlan, chairman of McDonald's really relishes,
it is getting out and selling the products. When he can, he drops in at one
of the company's 14,000 restaurants, dons a smock and pitches in with
employees in the kitchen or behind the counter.
'I can make hamburgers and Big Macs and fries. I'm a great counter person. I
can work the drive-through,' he says. 'The restaurant activities have always
been my favourite part of McDonald's. That's where we make or break the
relationship with our customers.'
Often, he will quiz diners about the quality of food and service, telling
them only later what his job is. 'I love relating to the customers. I'm very
interested in what our constituency wants from us and how we can do things
better. That is how you grow the business.'
The hands-on enthusiasm rings true because the Mcfamily, as Mr Quinlan calls
it, has been part of his life, man and boy, for 30 years. A jaunty
49-year-old who still speaks with the distinctive lilt of Chicago's Irish
west side where he grew up, he started working with the company part-time to
supplement his income while at college.
He joined full-time on graduation, after turning down a place at law school
because he could not afford the fees. By his own admission, he is a 'lifer'
with the company. As the saying goes in McDonald's, he has ketchup in his
veins.
With every passing week, more ketchup is poured on more McDonald's
hamburgers in ever more restaurants around the globe. A further 900 will
open this year, more than twice the total number in operation when Mr
Quinlan joined the company. Next year, he aims to add another 1,000. On top
of that, a proliferation of smaller outlets known as 'special venues' is
bringing McDonald's to places it has never reached before.
'We are in locations we never thought of seven or eight years ago. Airports,
service stations, superhighways, cruise ships. Hospitals are going like
crazy. We are in Wal-Mart (the US discount store chain), Tesco in Britain.
We have kiosks all over the world. We're already on one train in
Switzerland, and we'll soon be on another in Germany.'
He can see no end to the growth. But then, he says, he never has been able
to. He recalls that Raymond Kroc, the company's late founder, was first
asked almost 30 years ago when the market would be saturated and replied
laconically: 'Hell, I don't know.' 'The answer,' says Mr Quinlan, 'is that
you can't give an answer.'
Nonetheless, he guesses that sales will at least double in the next decade -
a conservative estimate, given that they trebled during the last one. 'In 15
years,' he says, 'I think we will be a giant company.'
Even in the US, where McDonald's has one restaurant for every 29,000 people
and faces steadily increasing competition, he sees plenty still to go for.
The game may be all about increasing share in a mature market, but
McDonald's aims to do so profitably by offering more varied menus, such as
chicken and pizza, lowering the break-even level of restaurants and sourcing
raw materials more efficiently.
Outside the US, by contrast, the potential has barely been scratched. Though
the company's operations span almost 70 countries, in most the fast-food
market is in its infancy. In some, the opening of a new McDonald's amounts
to a minor cultural revolution.
The restaurant in Moscow's Pushkin Square continues to generate sales
volumes 12 times higher than the norm for outlets of its size, almost four
years after it opened. The first two restaurants in Poland set records for
customer traffic, while operations in China are profitable after only 18
months.
However, political uncertainties, limited consumer spending power, supply
difficulties and the time needed to establish the McDonald's brand all make
Mr Quinlan cautious about the speed of future expansion in the developing
world. During this decade, he is counting on western Europe to act as the
main engine of growth outside the US.
The prospect of increased size and management complexity does not daunt him,
he says, because his rise through the ranks has given him first-hand
experience of almost every aspect of the company's operations. Most of
McDonald's top managers have also worked their way up from the bottom, a
system he says provides stability and continuity.
What prevents the culture from becoming inward-looking is the nature of
McDonald's compact with its 9,000 franchisees, some of whom are now in their
third generation. 'We don't stand back and say: 'Here's your franchise, pay
us your royalty, now sink or swim.' We only succeed when they succeed. If
their sales don't grow, our profits don't grow. That has a way of sorting
things out, of prioritising the way you do business.'
McDonald's prides itself on imposing uniform standards and business systems
throughout its operations, while still instilling in each of its franchisees
a spirit of entrepreneurship. 'I can go to restaurants in Norway, Singapore,
Butte, Montana, or Glasgow, and honest to God, it's like talking to
associates I've known for 25 years. I can go anywhere in the world and feel
I'm a welcome member of the family.'
To go on working, the formula needs continuously to be refined and improved.
'We cannot allow ourselves to become a commodity. When customers think of
McDonald's, they have to think of us as different. Whether it's our
marketing, our children's programmes, our birthday parties, our community
and charitable involvement, people expect a bit more of us.'
This view of McDonald's as one big happy family, united in the quest for
excellence, is not universally shared. In the US, fast food has become a
byword in some quarters for a low-wage business offering dreary jobs to a
shiftless army of unskilled workers. To its critics overseas, on the other
hand, the company is the ultimate symbol of the spread of American
throw-away culture.
Mr Quinlan will have none of it. True, the company relies heavily on casual
workers, and turnover among counter staff is high. But it offers training
and unrivalled promotion opportunities to young people who stay with it.
Furthermore, as he describes it, work in McDonald's restaurants is not the
soulless routine alleged by some critics, but a genuine community
enterprise.
'The younger people use the older full-time staff as consiglieri. They ask
them advice about life, not just about the job. Each store takes on the
characteristics of a family. You may think I'm kidding, but I'm not. A
thousand little dramas are played out every day in each of our restaurants.'
Hostility, he insists, is often the result of ignorance. Such was the case
with the French farmers, who recently protested against the US stance on
agricultural trade by picketing its restaurants and burning effigies of
Ronald McDonald. The company defused the situation by patiently pointing out
that 90 per cent of the raw materials used in its restaurants were locally
produced.
Displays of good corporate citizenship are not, however, enough to quell
frequent resistance to McDonald's choice of new sites. It has recently
fought lengthy planning battles to open restaurants in Hampstead, north
London, in the Piazza di Spagna in Rome and near the Eiffel Tower in Paris.
(It eventually won the first two, but lost the third.)
Mr Quinlan replies that McDonald's will go as far as it can to tailor the
design of its restaurants to local conditions. 'But when all is said and
done, the answer lies in the consumer response when we finally open the
doors. Piazza di Spagna opened with blockbuster volumes from day one, and
I've seen the same thing happen all over the world. If we are providing
people with what they want, they will tell us if they want us or not. I rest
my case on that.
'When I look at my colleagues around the world, I think we all have a large
dose of humility and a genuine love of serving our customers. It's kind of a
religion with us. I don't think that's corny. It's the lifeblood of our
business.'

FT  18 OCT 93 / Quarterbacks on the wrong pitch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The merit of co-operation between government, big business and unions seems
an article of faith in the White House. The clearest sign of a tilt toward
'corporatist' policies was President Bill Clinton's recent announcement that
the federal government would join forces with the Big Three American
carmakers to develop a new generation of fuel-efficient supercars. 'We want
to position the US auto industry to be the principal force in the
marketplace of the next century,' said Mr Al Gore, the vice-president. He
added that it was absurd that commercial carmakers were still dependent on
the internal combustion engine, a technology dating from 1876.
The Dollars 500m supercar initiative is the most visible element in an
emerging web of industrial policies. The administration has allocated
Dollars 1.5bn to help private companies create the world's first
'information superhighways'. It is showering subsidies on high-tech
industries and even helping dinosaurs such as shipbuilding. To appease trade
unions, there is talk of a substantial increase in the minimum wage and,
conceivably, changes in labour laws to improve the bargaining position of
workers.
Spending on industrial policy is admittedly trivial in the context of a
Dollars 1,500bn budget. But the economic culture in Washington is changing.
The Competitiveness Policy Council, a corporatist coalition of business,
union and government officials, is urging Mr Clinton to make competitiveness
'the centre-piece of US economic policymaking'. Excited by the deal with
Detroit, it advocates a depressingly mushy set of policies, including tax
subsidies for investment and regular doses of devaluation to ensure
'equitable' trading conditions for US companies. The council's chairman, Mr
Fred Bergsten, also advocates 'managed' trade as a way of levering open
foreign markets.
Co-operation between government and business to improve competitiveness may
seem harmless enough. Now that the cold war is over, the huge financial
resources of the federal laboratories surely should be harnessed to
commercial as well as military goals. In its quest for jobs and higher
living standards, why shouldn't the White House serve as an inspirational
'quarterback' to US business?
The pragmatic case against corporatism is that, if Washington throws its
weight behind American business, Brussels and Tokyo are certain to respond
in kind. Instead of the arms race of past decades, Mr Clinton could face an
equally stupid subsidies race, with ever larger industrial handouts being
required to offset the largesse of competitors.
But there are also matters of principle at stake. Corporatism is a crude
form of economic nationalism. The hard task for government today is surely
to establish global rules and institutions that serve the economic interests
of all individuals and companies - regardless of their origin or
nationality. The best route is normally unhindered competition. In a market
system, the government should be referee, not quarterback or coach.
Competitiveness, in any case, is a dubious concept on which to build an
economic strategy. The US can become more competitive only if other regions
become less competitive. Should the US really make policies designed to
reduce the competitiveness of Europe and Japan the centrepiece of economic
policymaking, as Mr Bergsten's council suggests? Of course not: the federal
government should concentrate on its fundamental economic duties, such as
keeping inflation under control, balancing its budget and minimising the
distortions imposed by taxes and regulations. Economic growth and the US's
performance relative to other countries will be determined largely by
factors beyond the control of politicians, such as private agents'
propensity to work, save and take risks.
To see how little competitiveness may depend on public policy, consider Mr
Bergsten's own Institute for International Economics. It may be a
non-profit-making body, but as a provider of economic services it is rather
typical of the new information economy. It has to compete, moreover, with
many similar think-tanks and institutes, both in the US and abroad. What
makes Fred competitive? There are many factors, including the skills of his
staff. But the most important is Mr Bergsten's own entrepreneurial flair. He
makes shrewd judgments about the economic topics that are going to hit the
headlines and markets his timely products aggressively.
It is precisely the entrepreneurial ability to predict how consumer demand
will change and to find cost-efficient ways of suppling new products that
governs business success. Companies such as General Motors and IBM have run
into trouble not because they lack talented staff or financial resources but
because of a loss of entrepreneurial alertness.
Competitiveness is a near obsession for the administration and allied groups
such as Mr Bergsten's council. Yet their reams of analysis say little, if
anything, about entrepreneurship. The emphasis on failings in public policy
is so total that the actual process of wealth creation is almost entirely
overlooked. You would never suspect from the literature on competitiveness
that the US's surge to global economic dominance at the end of the 19th
century occurred at a time when federal spending was 3 per cent, rather than
23 per cent, of GDP.

DEBATE over how Belgium, and to a lesser extent France, will pull themselves
out of their currency dilemmas is set to preoccupy the financial markets
this week, writes Peter John.
The Belgian government is due to release details of its much vaunted social
pact, the blueprint for wage indexation and employment which is aimed at
reducing the country's crippling national debt.
Currency dealers remain sceptical of its immediate benefits and are expected
to concentrate on the cleft-stick argument: they say that while currency
support by the Belgian National Bank has failed to maintain the Belgian
franc's strength against the D-Mark the ultimate weapon of higher interest
rates might only depress the economy further.
Belgium already has an official interest rate of 9.65 per cent and short
term lending rates at around 10 per cent while the country's inflation is
only 2.8 per cent.
Mr George Magnus, economist at SG Warburg, said: 'I can't see how Belgium
can get out of this one alive without lower interest rates and a weaker
currency.'
Many believe that Belgium and France will have to follow the path taken by
Spain over the past year. Spain devalued its currency to help its economy
and has subsequently been able to lower interest rates to the benefit rather
than the detriment of the currency. Last week it cut its key rate by half a
percentage point and the peseta strengthened.
Many investors have been looking at the fundamental benefits to the Belgian
economy of cutting rates and abandoning its strong franc policy. US money
has been pouring in to the Belgian stock and bond markets pushing the former
to record highs.
Elsewhere investors are looking towards German M3 growth figures this week.

FT  18 OCT 93 / International Bonds: EC issue underlines its commitment to
the Ecu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community tapped the Eurobond markets in inimitable style last
week, as it made the most of the favourable sentiment sparked by the removal
of the last legal obstacle to the ratification of the Maastricht treaty on
European union.
The proceeds of its two offerings, one in Ecu and the other in D-Marks, will
fund a large part of the second Ecu2bn tranche of the EC's Ecu8bn balance of
payments loan to Italy. The EC will launch a third issue in the coming weeks
to complete this tranche.
The market had been waiting for several weeks for the EC's issues to emerge,
but the EC held fire until last Wednesday, the day after the German federal
constitutional court made its ruling in favour of the treaty.
The EC chose to make the first offering of bonds in Ecu to underline the
importance of the German court's decision. The treaty, which covers the
second phase of European economic and monetary union, can now become
European law from November 1.
In addition, the Ecu1bn offering of seven-year Eurobonds underlined the EC's
commitment to the future of the Ecu bond market. This sector had been one of
the main casualties of the long period of uncertainty about the future of
the treaty.
Institutional investors deserted the Ecu bond market after Denmark rejected
the treaty in a referendum in June 1992. The EC has been keen to attract
them back since their presence is needed to allow the Ecu market to develop
fully.
As a result, the EC decided to give up a few basis points when the bonds
were priced in order to re-open the market to institutions. Nevertheless,
the EC still achieved aggressive pricing for its bonds which, at the launch,
yielded 12 basis points less than the French government's 9 1/2 per cent
Ecu-denominated OAT due 2000.
By the end of the week, the yield spread had tightened to 14 basis points
below the OAT and the bonds had risen to 99.25 bid from a fixed re-offer
price of 98.97, which traders said indicated the strong demand for liquid
Ecu bonds.
The EC intends to continue to show its leadership in the Ecu bond market by
issuing its Eurobond offerings in Ecu wherever possible. However, since it
is effectively raising the funds on behalf of a third party, in this case
Italy, it is reluctant to dictate the terms.
The immediate performance of the EC's DM1bn offering of five-year Eurobonds
has also been strong. At the launch on Thursday the bonds had a fixed
re-offer price of 100.025 to yield eight basis points over the series 107 of
German government medium-term notes. On Friday, the bonds were trading at
100.15 bid and the yield spread had tightened to six basis points.
The EC's ability to command aggressive pricing in the Eurobond market works
in the favour of the ultimate borrower of the funds, because the EC does not
make a profit on its lending, apart from covering the costs of issuing the
bonds. As a result, Italy paid a competitive all-in cost of 6.2 per cent for
its funds.
However, since the EC can only borrow in the Eurobond market to raise money
for specific purposes - it must not plug any shortfall in its budget, as
this has to come from savings or contributions from member states - it is
relatively unusual for its Eurobond transactions to be this large.
This was another reason why last week's issues sold so quickly, since
investors would probably have to wait at least six months before the EC
launched another series of large Eurobond offerings to finance the third
tranche for Italy.
However, it is possible that the EC might have to raise larger amounts in
the Eurobond market in the future in order to fund the EC's commitment to
creating new jobs within the Community.
In addition, it has not yet been decided if the EC's Ecu500m aid package to
the West Bank and Gaza Strip will be in the form of a grant or a loan.
For now, at least, the EC's narrowly-defined borrowing remit and its
inability to warehouse money mean that it is unlikely to be as active in the
Eurobond market as the European Investment Bank, the EC's long-term
financing institution. The EIB's annual borrowing programme of almost
Dollars 19bn makes it one of the biggest issuers in the Eurobond market.
These constraints also bar the EC from taking advantage of the benefits
offered by the global bond offering, a concept pioneered by the World Bank
to enable borrowers to achieve a single world price and global distribution
for their bonds.
The World Bank, which has already issued global bond offerings in dollars
and yen, is expected to launch its first D-Mark global bond offering, of
DM3bn, early this week.
The solution devised by the World Bank to bridge the legal differences
between the US and Germany has opened up this type of financing to the EC,
since the D-Mark would be the most likely currency for any global offering
in the future.
EC officials believe that the trend to a global market is irreversible and
that it is only be a matter of time before the EC jumps on the global bond
bandwagon.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Risk and Reward: Corporate debt sector goes retrospective
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE corporate debt market went retrospective last week, producing a spate of
exotic long-dated bonds the likes of which have not been in fashion since
the 1950s. Boeing, the US aerospace group, launched a Dollars 125m,
non-callable, 50-year issue: and ABN Amro, the Dutch bank, sold Dollars 150m
of 100-year bonds.
The bank issue was priced to yield 110 basis points over the benchmark 7.125
per cent 30-year US Treasury bond. A Yankee bond denominated in US dollars,
it was snapped up by yield-hungry US money managers.
There have been two other 'century' bond issues this year, by Walt Disney
and Coca-Cola. It is not nostalgia that is bringing these bonds back, but a
return to a tranquil, low inflation environment.
This has boosted real rates of return and made the leverage provided by
ultra long-term securities attractive to investors who believe interest
rates still have room to slide.
The risk, of course, is that the leverage these issues offer cuts both ways
 -and when rates rise, the price of the long-dated bonds will fall far more
precipitously than shorter maturities.
From the point of view of corporate borrowers with high credit quality,
interest rates have fallen far enough to make a long-term lock seem prudent.
The market for the ABN Amro bond and the 50-year Boeing issue was
underpinned by news last week that the so-called 'core' rate of US wholesale
price inflation was flat in September, and that the closely-watched consumer
price index was up only 2.7 per cent on a year-on-year basis.
Traders who had bought the Boeing and ABN Amro issues on Monday and Tuesday
were already sitting on a profit by the end of the week, while the portfolio
jockeys who had opted for a ride on the Disney century bond in July had
logged an impressive gain of 900 basis points.
The debate over ultra long-term debt is by no means one-sided. Some
economists argue that the value added from buying a bond with a 100-year
maturity is only marginal when compared with returns from more conventional
30-year corporate debt.
'There's a school of thought which says it's like using a sledge-hammer to
hang a picture,' says Mr Michael Bassett, an investment consultant with
Stone &amp; McCarthy.
According to Mr Bassett's calculations, the extra 70 years of maturity in a
century bond will deliver only one more year of duration to the average
portfolio than a conventional 30-year issue.
What the century bonds do deliver is 'convexity', or price appreciation in
response to a drop in interest rates.
Be that as it may, extra-long dated bonds have proved popular with investors
who, having missed the initial stages of the bond rally, are now playing
catch-up.
These investors have bought the extra-long dated bonds to get a quick boost
for their portfolios, and have no intention of holding them to maturity.
Other interested buyers have been insurance companies, which like a long,
steady stream of coupon payments to match long-term liabilities, such as
life insurance claims.
Century bonds are predictable, and avoid the reinvestment costs and risks
posed by shorter maturities.
Ultra-long bonds are essentially annuities, with buyers more interested in
their coupon stream than in recovering principal.
For extremely long-dated corporate issues to be successful, an issuer must
be perceived as a very high-quality borrower, says Mr Fred Sturm, an
economist with Fuji Securities.
With the yield on 30-year US Treasury bonds rapidly approaching 5 1/2 per
cent, more long-dated corporate bonds are likely to appear on the market.
Their rarity and relative illiquidity will require special analysis,
possibly more akin to individual equity valuation than traditional corporate
bond rating.

FT  18 OCT 93 / UK Gilts: Inflationary pressure shrugged off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GILT market took a relaxed view of last week's higher than expected
figures for inflation, with long-dated bonds barely moving and prices of
short-dated securities edging higher.
The overall effect of a spate of data about the UK economy was to flatten
the yield curve slightly, as investors reasoned that signs of a faltering in
the recovery were more likely to push Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, for
an early cut in interest rates.
Perceptions that inflationary pressures in the UK remain weak, in spite of a
relatively big move upwards in the retail prices index and also in prices
for factory goods at the wholesale level, were behind the modest increase in
yields for gilts with maturities of more than 10 years.
On Friday night the yield for the 8.75 per cent bond payable in 2017 was
quoted at 7.18 per cent, compared with 7.17 per cent the week before.
At the other end of the yield curve, the 10 per cent gilt dated 1996 had a
yield on Friday night of 5.9 per cent, comfortably down on the 6.06 per cent
quoted the week before.
The move fits in with the feeling that, on the back of evidence of a
sluggish economy, Mr Clarke may reduce base rates from the current 6 per
cent around the time of the Budget on November 30, possibly to offset the
effects of a fiscal tightening.
However, the changes in the yield curve have to be put in the context of
moves in other European bond markets.
With investor interest in French and German bonds fairly strong, 10-year
gilts fell back last week in relation to equivalent German bonds.
At the end of the week, yields on the UK instruments were around 106 basis
points higher than those on corresponding German securities, after a yield
difference of just 96 basis points seven days earlier.
This took the yield spread back to the levels seen in July, after which the
difference had come down as a result of the relatively good performance of
UK bonds during the summer.
With the future direction of gilt prices somewhat uncertain, a firmer clue
as to likely levels of demand for the bonds may come today when the Treasury
announces how much the government had to borrow last month to make up the
shortfall between spending and revenues.
City analysts reckon this will come out at around Pounds 5.3bn, a number
large enough to reinforce worries about the large volume of gilts to be
issued over the next few years.
A figure of this magnitude could easily lead to a sell-off in gilts, a day
ahead of the announcement tomorrow about the volume of bonds the Bank of
England is due to auction on October 27.
It appears likely that the Bank will decide to auction about Pounds 3.25bn
of these bonds, in the maturity range 1997 to 2001.
Last week was marked by heavy two-way gilt trading as investors wrestled
with the contradictory messages from the UK economic data.
On one hand, the move up last month in the Treasury's preferred measure of
underlying retail inflation - the year-on-year increase in the RPI excluding
mortgage interest payments - gave the impression that price pressures were
increasing.
The change in this measure from 3.1 per cent in August to 3.3 per cent last
month, while the year-on-year change in the RPI itself went up from 1.7 per
cent to 1.8 per cent, came after news that prices of finished manufactured
goods - excluding the volatile elements of food, drink, tobacco and petrol -
rose by 3 per cent in the year to September after advancing by 2.7 per cent
in the year to August.
However, giving a different view to gilt investors were further Central
Statistical Office figures showing that growth in industrial production
faltered during the summer, with manufacturing output down 0.7 per cent in
the three months to August 31 compared with the previous three-month period.
Some gilt analysts paid more attention to this element of the week's data -
which backed up recent anecdotal evidence of subdued business activity
throughout the economy - especially in view of the perception that the RPI
figures seem to have been distorted by unusually high prices of second-hand
cars.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Ecu Bonds: Yields fall on German court ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST Tuesday's ruling on the Maastricht treaty by Germany's constitutional
court breathed new life into the Ecu market, causing it to outperform all
significant European bond markets last week.
Although it attached some conditions to the ruling, the court judged the
Maastricht treaty for European monetary union to be consistent with
Germany's basic law.
While the verdict 'does not accelerate the progress to monetary union, it
does remove an important factor which could have derailed it,' said Mr
Adrian James, a bond analyst with NatWest Markets.
After the ruling, the yield on the benchmark 8 per cent Ecu OAT due 2003
fell some 25 basis points to 6.40 per cent on Friday. The Ecu bond's yield
gap over the 6.5 per cent 10-year German bund narrowed to 49 from 69 basis
points.
However, in spite of their sharp rises, Ecu bonds are expected to post
further gains as investors return to the market after a protracted absence.
'With the last legal hurdle out of the way, we've seen keen demand from
international investors,' said Mr Hans Knol ten Bensel, Ecu analyst with
Kredietbank NV.
Borrowers, too, are expected to flock back to the Ecu sector, adding depth
to a market which was becoming increasingly illiquid amid the uncertainty
following the Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty in a referendum in
June 1992.
Following the German court ruling, the European Community was the first to
tap pent-up demand for Ecu bonds last week with its Ecu1bn of 6 per cent
7-year Eurobonds.
According to Mr Knol ten Bensel, 'there is great demand for current-coupon
issues,' as many older bonds with higher coupons trade at a large premium to
their par value, which deters many investors.
The coming months will see more supply, the bulk of which is likely to be
issued by EC bodies and sovereigns.
Among the sovereigns, France and the UK have been regular Ecu borrowers, but
Belgium is also said to be considering a programme of Ecu-denominated OLOs,
or linear Treasury bonds.
The next Ecu issue will be the UK Treasury's Ecu500bn 8 per cent notes due
1996, to be auctioned tomorrow. The notes are expected to meet with a warm
welcome at a time when many investors are shifting back into shorter
maturities in anticipation of near-term European rate cuts.
'The issue is almost perfectly timed,' said Mr Bob Tyley, head of bond
analysis at Paribas Capital Markets.
'The best value is towards the shorter end,' says Mr Steven Major, senior
bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais. As he sees it, Europe's bond markets have
now reached a turning point, and yield curves are set to steepen as
central-bank easing resumes.
Investors are also expected to take comfort from the freezing of the Ecu
when the Maastricht treaty takes effect on November 1.
In the past, the basket has undergone regular five-yearly revisions, and the
freezing of the Ecu's composition will remove another source of uncertainty
for investors, according to analysts.
Meanwhile, Ecu bonds offer an interesing opportunity for French franc
investors, Mr Major points out. Switching into Ecu out of francs
substantially reduces currency risk, while the bonds offer a yield pick-up
of some 50 basis points over 10-year OATs, he says.
Another indicator of Ecu bonds' value is the relationship between actual and
their theoretical yields (calculated according to the bond yields of the
Ecu's component currencies). On Friday, the actual yield was some 14 basis
points below the theoretical yield, indicating that the bonds are expensive
relative to their theoretical value.
However, many expect that spread to widen further; Mr Tyley at Paribas says
the actual yield could move as much as 20 - 25 basis points below its
theoretical counterpart.

FT  18 OCT 93 / US Money and Credit: Doubts over strength of bull run
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST HOW low can US bond yields go? That question may be asked a lot on Wall
Street over the coming week as the market dwells on a bull run which last
Friday took the yield on longer dated issues down to levels not seen for a
quarter century.
For amid the euphoria, there are straws in the wind indicating that some
corporate Treasurers and top money managers think long rates may be getting
close to the bottom of the cycle.
Last week's rally was pushed along by good inflation figures and weak retail
sales statistics for September. The producer price index, unveiled on
Thursday, rose 0.2 per cent during the month, while the consumer price index
was unchanged.
The consumer data, released on Friday, set off a flood of buying orders
which pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond down to 5.78 by the
close, compared with 5.85 per cent on Thursday and 5.92 per cent at the end
of the previous week. The 10-year Treasury note ended the week at 5.16 per
cent, its lowest since 1967.
For now, the main forces working on the market seem to be benign. Inflation
is subdued, with consumer prices rising at an annual rate of 2.5 per cent so
far this year. Economic growth remains sluggish, with third-quarter GDP
figures, due on October 8, expected to show a rise of around 3 per cent,
with some further acceleration possible in the fourth quarter.
The dollar appears to be on a gently firming trend and the political
backdrop seems favourable. Mr Mitchell Held, of Smith Barney Shearson, says
market psychology should be helped over the next few months by further
budget deficit cutting initiatives, including the Senate's consideration of
a balanced-budget amendment to the constitution.
There is no apparent need for the Federal Reserve to change its policy
stance - a perception which has stalled short-term interest rates while the
long end has come sharply down, producing a much flatter yield curve, albeit
one still on the steep side compared to past trends. The spread between the
two-year note and the 30-year bond stands at around 200 basis points.
The result is a broad consensus that the yield on the long bond has further
to fall - possibly to around 5.5 per cent - and that the market may then
oscillate for a considerable time within a band of between 5.5 per cent and
6 per cent before the interest rate cycle turns upwards.
However, this picture could be upset by unpleasant inflation surprises.
Analysts are already warning, for example, that October's figures are likely
to be bad, in part because of the introduction of a new tax on gasoline.
While mutual fund money pours into the market, other leading fund managers
seem to be slowly trimming their portfolios, in the belief that it is better
to narrowly miss the bottom than suffer when rates rise once more.
Some analysts argue that a more sluggish performance over the past few weeks
in interest-rate sensitive equity sectors - such as utilities and banking
stocks - could be a sign of a bond bull market which is losing momentum.

FT  18 OCT 93 / International Company News: BNP shares expected to trade at
a premium
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the bank spearheading the French
government's privatisation programme, are expected to rise to a premium when
they start trading this morning.
BNP's new shares, which were sold at the unexpectedly low price of FFr240,
were trading at FFr277 on the 'grey', or unofficial, market late last week.
Analysts expect the shares to rise to a similar level when trading begins.
'The original issue was so heavily oversubscribed that there is bound be to
strong demand,' said one analyst. 'Also, the offer price is generally
accepted as having been too low, which should make the institutions even
keener to pick up stock in the market.'
The BNP issue, which values the bank at FFr43bn (Dollars 7.5bn), was heavily
oversubscribed. The institutional part of the issue was closed after only
two days, having attracted applications for 12 times the number of shares
available. The public issue was five times subscribed, with 2.8m investors
applying for shares against the original target of 1m.
The government has increased the allocation of shares to the public by
reducing the number earmarked for institutional investors and 'hard core'
shareholders. But it has also rationed the shares given to the public from
the original 40 to 15 each.
In spite of the high level of interest in BNP's shares, analysts do not
expect the French to 'stag' the issue by taking quick profits on their
shares, as UK investors did in the 1980s privatisations.
The next phase of the privatisation programme will be the announcement,
expected today or tomorrow, of the next candidate for sale. The government
last week said the next issue would be either Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals
company, or Elf Aquitaine, the oil and gas group.

FT  18 OCT 93 / International Company News: QVC adds Dollars 1bn to
war-chest for Paramount bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
QVC Network, the TV home shopping business, yesterday increased its
financial strength in its hostile Dollars 9.6bn bid for Paramount
Communications by announcing a further Dollars 1bn equity investment from
two media groups, Advance Publications and Cox Enterprises.
Each will invest Dollars 500m in QVC common and convertible preferred stock
if the QVC bid for Paramount succeeds. Cox owns 18 newspapers, 24 cable TV
systems and 19 TV and radio stations. Advance, owned by the Newhouse family,
has interests including The New Yorker magazine and the Conde Nast group.
QVC, led by Mr Barry Diller, a prominent film industry figure, is competing
for Paramount against an agreed bid, currently worth about Dollars 8bn, from
cable group Viacom. Its latest move will put more pressure on Viacom to
improve its offer. Paramount has agreed to study QVC's bid, but has
questioned the company's financial resources. QVC, with revenues of around
Dollars 1bn, is smaller than Paramount or Viacom, but has powerful financial
allies.
When it launched its bid last month, QVC said its two largest corporate
shareholders, cable groups Comcast and Liberty Media, had each agreed to
invest Dollars 500m in its convertible stock.
Last Wednesday, Liberty and its associate, cable group Tele-Communications
Inc, agreed to be acquired by local telecoms group Bell Atlantic in a merger
that could be worth more than Dollars 20bn. The deal prompted speculation
that Mr John Malone, who heads both TCI and Liberty, might be less committed
to the QVC bid.
However, yesterday's announcement made clear Liberty remained one of QVC's
backers, though the terms of its investment, and that of Comcast, have been
changed to mirror the Cox and Advance agreements.
Each of the four will buy Dollars 250m of QVC common stock at Dollars 60 a
share and Dollars 250m of convertible exchangeable preferred stock, carrying
6 per cent dividends and convertible at Dollars 65.45 a share. QVC stock
closed on Friday at Dollars 58, up Dollars  1/4.

1992 total
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE volume of loan syndications in the first nine months of this year has
beaten last year's total by Dollars 40bn, in spite of a fall in volume in
the third quarter.
However, the rise in volume has not generated a similar rise in earnings for
the banks. 'Healthy bank balance sheets juxtaposed with a dearth of deals
have driven pricing and fees down to record lows, to the dismay of lenders,'
said Investment Dealers' Digest and Bank Loan Report.
Loan syndications volume for the first nine months of 1993 stood at Dollars
388.3bn, compared with Dollars 348.5bn last year.
Third-quarter volume fell 14 per cent to Dollars 141.3bn from Dollars
164.3bn in the second quarter, but the third-quarter figure represented a
46.7 per cent rise over the same period in 1992.
Chemical Bank remained at the top of the global loan syndications rankings
at the end of the third quarter, with more than Dollars 38bn in syndications
volume. Citicorp also retained its second position, with Dollars 33bn, while
JP Morgan rose from 11th position to third position, with nearly Dollars
22bn.

<TEXT>
KIA MOTORS officials have expressed concern that the company, South Korea's
second-largest vehicle manufacturer, may become the target of the country's
first takeover bid, writes John Burton in Seoul.
Samsung, the electronics conglomerate, has lifted its stake in Kia by 40 per
cent to 9.6 per cent during the past three months, according to the
Securities Supervisory Board. This makes Samsung the second-largest
corporate shareholder in Kia after Ford of the US, which has 10 per cent.
Samsung denies the stock purchase is the start of a takeover bid. But
analysts say it is unusual for such a large investment to be made in one
company.
If Samsung is preparing a bid, it would be Korea's first big merger or
acquisition through the purchase of large blocks of shares on the stock
exchange.

media share prices to raise ADollars 4bn to ADollars 5bn (USDollars 3.3bn)
by issuing new shares to telecommunications or other strategic partners,
AP-DJ reports from Sydney.
News Corp last week announced plans to give existing shareholders a new
class of shares that carry increased voting rights. This will allow the
group to sell large parcels of conventional common stock to form strategic
alliances without diluting Mr Murdoch's 30 per cent voting stake.
In an interview published over the weekend in The Australian, News Corp's
flagship Australian newspaper, Mr Murdoch said the company did not need
additional funds at this time.
However, 'this does seem to be a moment of opportunity,' he said. 'There's a
bit of a frenzy developing in terms of the media and investment and it looks
like it may last for a while. This may be a window of opportunity to take a
quantum step forward.
'We just want to be ready to do it should that opportunity arise. We could
place up to 20 per cent of the company and raise ADollars 4bn to ADollars
5bn. We would be willing to do that,' he told the newspaper.
'At today's prices we're valued at USDollars 15bn to USDollars 16bn. If we
increase that by 20 per cent, that would give us enormous financial
strength,' Mr Murdoch maintained.
Share prices of media companies, particularly in the US, soared last week on
news of a proposed merger between Bell Atlantic, a telephone company, and
Tele-Communications, a cable television operator.
Investors bought shares in the hope of positioning themselves to cash in on
an expected linking of telephone companies, cable TV operators, information
companies, media concerns and film studios.
News Corp has film and satellite TV interests as well as newspaper and
magazine units. The company's shares climbed 52 cents to ADollars 11.62 on
the Australian Stock Exchange on Friday.
Mr Murdoch said that any of the larger groups 'who buy into us would provide
further financial and industry strength.
'They could give us access to new technologies and cash, or just the cash.
We have a feeding frenzy at the moment and like all feeding frenzies it
won't last forever,' he said.

FT  18 OCT 93 / International Company News: Kia Motors concerned as Samsung
lifts stake

<TEXT>
KIA MOTORS officials expressed concern at the weekend that the company,
South Korea's second-largest vehicle manufacturer, may become the target of
the country's first takeover bid.
Samsung, the big electronics conglomerate, has increased its shareholding in
Kia by 40 per cent to 9.6 per cent during the past three months, according
to a new report from the Securities Supervisory Board.
This makes Samsung the second-largest corporate shareholder in Kia after
Ford Motor of the US, which has 10 per cent. Mazda Motors of Japan has 8 per
cent.
Samsung has made little secret of its desire to add vehicles to its list of
activities. It is already taking its first step into the motor industry by
starting truck production next year in co-operation with Nissan Diesel of
Japan.
Samsung officials deny that the recent stock purchase represents the
beginning of a takeover bid for Kia, explaining that it is part of a shift
in the group's securities portfolio from banks to manufacturing companies.
But analysts point out that it is highly unusual for such a large investment
to be made in one company.
Kia's ownership is fragmented for a Korean company, with 11.4 per cent held
by employees and a 2.4 per cent interest belonging to the family of Mr Kim
Ho-chul, its founder.
If Samsung is preparing a bid for Kia, it would be the first big merger or
acquisition to occur in Korea through the purchase of large blocks of shares
on the stock exchange.
Any such move would coincide with a proposed legal change next year that
would eliminate rules that have prevented corporate raids via the stock
market.
Investors are presently barred from acquiring more than 10 per cent of a
company if they held less than that amount when the concern was listed.
There have been persistent reports on the Seoul bourse for the past year
that Samsung is interested in acquiring control of Kia Motors, the flagship
of the Kia group, Korea's eighth biggest conglomerate.
Korea's other motor companies, which include Hyundai and Daewoo, have argued
that Korea could not support a fourth car manufacturer if Samsung began
independent production.
The government cited overcapacity in blocking Samsung's proposed car joint
venture with Chrysler in 1985.

HAVAS, the leading French leisure group, saw net profits fall by 3.4 per
cent to FFr423m (Dollars 74m) in the first half of this year from the same
period of 1992 and warned of lower net profits for the full year.
The group, which has extensive media and travel interests in France, said it
had been affected by 'sluggish trends' in its advertising businesses,
billboard interests and travel activities.
Havas pushed up revenues by 4.1 per cent to FFr14.8bn in the first six
months of 1993. The proportion of its revenue made outside France rose to
37.9 per cent from 33.8 per cent.

FT  18 OCT 93 / International Company News: Syndicated loan volume ahead of
1992 total
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE volume of loan syndications in the first nine months of this year has
beaten last year's total by Dollars 40bn, in spite of a fall in volume in
the third quarter.
However, the rise in volume has not generated a similar rise in earnings for
the banks. 'Healthy bank balance sheets juxtaposed with a dearth of deals
have driven pricing and fees down to record lows, to the dismay of lenders,'
said Investment Dealers' Digest and Bank Loan Report.
Loan syndications volume for the first nine months of 1993 stood at Dollars
388.3bn, compared with Dollars 348.5bn last year.
Third-quarter volume fell 14 per cent to Dollars 141.3bn from Dollars
164.3bn in the second quarter, but the third-quarter figure represented a
46.7 per cent rise over the same period in 1992.
Chemical Bank remained at the top of the global loan syndications rankings
at the end of the third quarter, with more than Dollars 38bn in syndications
volume. Citicorp also retained its second position, with Dollars 33bn, while
JP Morgan rose from 11th position to third position, with nearly Dollars
22bn.
The top 10 deals closed in the third quarter of 1993 were: the Kingdom of
Spain (Dollars 4.58bn), Sears Roebuck (Dollars 4bn), US West (Dollars
2.6bn), Chrysler Financial Corp (Dollars 2.5bn), British Aerospace (Dollars
2.3bn), Morgan Stanley Group (Dollars 2.2bn), AT&amp;T Capital Corp (Dollars
2bn), Province of Ontario (Dollars 2bn), Seagram (Dollars 2bn) and Fleet
Mortgage Group (Dollars 1.8bn).

SFr1.84bn.
The group also forecast further sales growth in the fourth quarter and said
that its net income for the year would rise by more than 10 per cent from
last year's SFr1.49bn.
Roche recently reported a third-quarter sales jump of 18 per cent to
SFr3.6bn and Ciba an 8.3 per cent rise to SFr5.2bn.

FT  18 OCT 93 / International Company News: Credito Italiano sale expected
in December
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIVATISATION of Credito Italiano, the commercial bank 67 per cent owned
by Iri, the state holding company, is expected to begin in early December.
The timetable has been firmed up following changes approved last week to
Credito's statutes. They have been revised to include a 3 per cent ceiling
on single shareholdings by new shareholders.
The aim of the 3 per cent limit is to encourage as wide a share base as
possible. Within the government there were contrasting views, and Professor
Romani Prodi, head of Iri, was reported to have been pressing for a maximum
2 per cent block.
The same ceiling will apply to Banca Commerciale Italiano, the second of
Iri's large banks. The sale of Iri's 57 per cent stake in BCI is expected to
begin next April.
Credito's privatisation was announced in September 1992. The original
intention was to organise a trade sale, but a month ago a share offer,
including a portion reserved for foreign institutional investors, was
agreed.
In another privatisation development, Eni, the state oil concern, has
appointed Rothschild to handle the valuation and flotation of its energy
interests. The Rothschild brief indicates that the privatisation proposed by
Eni chairman Mr Franco Bernabe is broader than initially envisaged.

FT  18 OCT 93 / International Company News: Apple looks to next generation -
The US computer group's latest boardroom shuffle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Sculley, who had hoped to orchestrate a graceful departure from
Apple Computer after 10 years at the helm of the personal computer company,
was last week forced into an abrupt resignation.
The move by Apple's board to replace Mr Sculley, one of the better known and
more articulate executives in the US, came as the company ended one of the
most troubled years in its history. Last week, Apple reported a meagre
Dollars 2.7m fourth-quarter profit, down 97 per cent on the same period last
year.
Struggling to maintain its share of the PC market, Apple has repeatedly cut
prices over the past year, paring gross profit margins from 43 per cent to
less than 26 per cent in the process.
For Mr Sculley, the timing could not have been worse. A year ago, he might
have left Apple as a hero who had led the company to record sales and
profits and steered it toward emerging technologies. Instead, as Apple's
financial problems deepened, he became the target of intense criticism,
blamed for the company's woes.
Mr Sculley's desire to move on to new challenges has become increasingly
apparent over the past two years. He seemed to be losing interest in the
price and market-share battles of the PC market, enthusing instead about the
new opportunities to be found in the confluence of computer, communications
and consumer electronics technology, which he predicted would create a
Dollars 3,500bn industry.
Speculation was rife that Mr Sculley would, before long, leave Apple -
perhaps for a post in the Clinton administration or to form his own
high-tech company, a move that he acknowledges is his dream.
Earlier this year, he made an unsuccessful bid for the top job at
International Business Machines by proposing an audacious merger plan -
combining Apple with the most profitable portions of IBM's business. Most of
IBM's directors were too short-sighted to recognise the potential of his
proposal, he later complained.
Few, however, had foreseen such an ignominious end to Mr Sculley's career at
Apple. Even when, four months ago, he handed over the role of chief
executive to his second in command, Mr Michael Spindler, Apple was at pains
to deny that Mr Sculley was being forced to relinquish power.
It now appears, however, that Mr Sculley, like his predecessor Mr Steve
Jobs, fell victim to a boardroom dispute. Indeed, there are uncanny
parallels between the circumstances, in 1985, when Mr Jobs was forced out of
the company he co-founded, and Mr Sculley's untimely departure.
Mr Jobs was ousted when Apple, as it is today, was facing a financial crisis
and its first Macintosh personal computer was failing to live up to
expectations.
Similarly, Mr Sculley's departure coincides with disappointment over the
performance of the Newton Messagepad, his pet project.
Mr Sculley turned 'Steve's machine' into a huge commercial success,
increasing Apple's revenues over his 10-year tenure from Dollars 600m to
almost Dollars 8bn. However, he always seemed to harbour a desire to prove
himself the equal of the young man he had displaced at Apple by creating his
own technology breakthrough and becoming, like Mr Jobs, recognised for his
'technology vision'.
It will now be up to Mr Sculley's successors - Mr Michael Spindler, the new
chief executive, and Mr Mike Markkula, Apple's new chairman - to determine
whether Mr Sculley's Newton can become Apple's most important product
technology for the 1990s.
Mr Sculley's legacy at Apple will also be judged, however, on the success of
the technology alliances that he formed with IBM two years ago to develop
microprocessor and software technology for the next generation of Apple
personal computers.
The first of these 'PowerPC' products is expected to be ready for market
next year. That will be none too soon for Apple's new management team.

<TEXT>
GUOCO Group, the Hong Kong-based company controlled by the Malaysian Quek
family, has completed the HKDollars 4.46bn (USDollars 577m) acquisition of
the Overseas Trust Bank (OTB) from the Hong Kong government.
The deal was announced in July, but the price agreed to was a HKDollars 420m
premium to a subsequent asset valuation of the bank.
The OTB will be linked with Guoco's wholly owned subsidiary, Dao Heng Bank,
to form Hong Kong's fourth-largest banking group.
Guoco announced that it would complete the flotation of the enlarged Dao
Heng Bank before the end of the year. Guoco's purchase of OTB was partly
funded by a HK2.8bn issue of preference shares, which will be convertible
into Dao Heng shares once it obtains a separate listing.
Following the Dao Heng flotation, Guoco will become an investment holding
company with interests which will include a majority stake in
Singapore-based First Capital Corporation, and several property
developments.
The sale of the OTB completes the government's successful turnround of
several banks which collapsed during the mid-1980s.
At the price paid for OTB, the government will recuperate the costs of its
1985 rescue of the banking group.

FT  18 OCT 93 / International Company News: Mexico set to create market for
mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER and STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Mexican government is set to introduce legislation that will facilitate
the development of a market in mortgage securities, according to Mr
Guillermo Ortiz, under-minister of finance.
Mr Ortiz said the government 'was willing to contemplate government
intervention to extend guarantees of mortgages'. The government may
guarantee part of a loan over a given maturity, to help those who could not
otherwise finance the purchase of a house or apartment.
The legislation, to be introduced after November, will include allowing
property titles to be transferred to third parties without being certified
by public notaries. Difficulties in transferring titles have inhibited the
development of a secondary market in mortgages.
Mexico has an acute shortage of housing, in part because of the difficulty
and high cost of obtaining a mortgage. But as inflation has fallen, loans of
up to 10 years have become available and interest in the mortgage market has
grown.
However, banks have complained about the legal obstacles in securitising
mortgage and consumer loans. The lack of a secondary market in such loans
has kept mortgage interest rates higher than they would otherwise be, and
stifled demand.
Mr Ortiz concedes that the proposed legislation will not meet all of the
bankers' demands. The legal process in taking possession of houses when a
mortgage has been defaulted is long and uncertain. Mr Ricardo Guajardo,
chief executive of Bancomer, Mexico's second-largest bank, says it can take
about three years to win settlement in the case of a mortgage default.
The government is also planning to introduce next year a derivatives market
to allow investors to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risk, Mr
Ortiz said. The government will first have to establish capitalisation rules
for participants, he said.

FT  18 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Former 3i chief for Tring ahead of SE
flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALAN Wheatley, former chairman of the 3i venture capital group, is to
become chairman of Tring International, the privately-owned publisher and
distributor of cut-price compact discs and cassettes, ahead of a planned
Stock Exchange listing.
Tring expects to sell about Pounds 20m-worth of new and existing shares
probably through a placing within the next few months, although UBS, the
sponsor to the listing, said the details were still under discussion. The
company wants a listing to help it expand in the UK and overseas. The
flotation is likely to capitalise Tring at more than Pounds 45m, UBS said.
Mr Wheatley is currently a non-executive director of British Steel, Forte,
Legal &amp; General, and NM Rothschild.
Tring was set up in 1990 by Mr Mark Frey and Mr Philip Robinson, the joint
chief executives who each own about 20 per cent of the company, and by Mr
Mark Levinson.
It currently has a catalogue of more than 800 classical, jazz and pop
titles. For the year to March it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.3m on
sales of Pounds 16.6m.
Mr Philip Keane, finance director, said the pathfinder prospectus would be
available in the middle of November.

FT  18 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Expanding Midland Independent plans to
launch four new weeklies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND Independent Newspapers, publisher of the Birmingham Post and Mail,
is planning to launch up to four new weekly newspapers in the next 12
months.
The new launches, which will at least start as free newspapers, are the
latest signs of expansion by the management buy-out team at MIN led by chief
executive Mr Chris Oakley.
Earlier this year the company bought 20 free weekly newspapers from Thomson
Regional Newspapers. The company is also interested in the possibility of a
significant newspaper acquisition outside its Midlands regional heartland.
The news of further expansion comes as Midland announced a fall in pre-tax
profit for the six months to end June from Pounds 3.47m to Pounds 1.92m. The
main reason for the drop was a Pounds 1.7m increase in interest charges
flowing from the loan stock used in the acquisition of the Thomson titles.
Operating profit increased by to Pounds 7.8m (Pounds 7.3m) with margins
continuing at more than 21 per cent. The acquired titles, which increased
the company's reach into the east Midlands, generated profit of Pounds
260,000.
A flotation is getting closer for the group bought out from Ingersol
Newspapers. It could happen towards the end of next year. No firm target
date has been set because of uncertainties such as whether VAT is imposed on
newspapers in next month's budget or whether a large acquisition comes
along.
The Birmingham Post marginally increased its sales in the period while the
Mail circulation dropped 3 per cent, the Coventry paper 1.5 per cent and the
Mercury 3 per cent - all less than the regional average.

FT  18 OCT 93 / UK Company News: An attempt at reviving the Habitat habit -
Swedish owner wants the home furnishings chain to return to its roots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR VITTORIO Radice, managing director of Habitat UK, whips out a picture of
six swarthy men intent on a serious game of boules. One lounges in a deck
chair, munching his way through an overstuffed sandwich. 'This is what I use
to describe what Habitat is all about,' Mr Radice says. Under the photograph
is a single word - comfortable.
Tomorrow Mr Radice hopes to paint a fuller picture of his vision for the
home furnishings retail chain with something slightly more obvious - the
opening of the revamped flagship store on the King's Road in Chelsea,
London. Here in a 1930s cinema restored to its former Art Deco glory, he
will attempt to convince customers that Habitat's future lies in recapturing
its past. 'We have put one word back into the equation - passion,' he says.
That philosophy is shared by Stichting Ingka, the trust set up by Mr Ingvar
Kamprad, Sweden's guru of affordable chic and founder of the Ikea retailing
phenomenon. It is almost a year to the day since the trust bought Habitat's
European operations from Storehouse for Pounds 78m.
Mr Kamprad, like his UK managing director, believes the way forward for
Habitat lies in returning to its roots as a retailer of quality design
furnishings at affordable prices. Recently he wrote to Sir Terence Conran,
Habitat's founder, to reassure him that Stichting intended to revive the
spirit behind that first shop he opened on Fulham Road in 1964.
The mistakes of the past have been well documented. Sir Terence Conran's
original concept lost its way in the mid- to late 1980s when new management
sought to drive the company for dividend and volume growth. .
While the continental businesses were left to follow their own path, the UK
division had four management and strategy changes in six years, and made
significant losses.
There have been few changes since Stichting took over last year. Many of the
most significant shifts - such as abandoning the out of town wastelands and
returning Habitat to its high street roots - had already been launched by Mr
Radice when he arrived from a Milanese furniture company in 1990.
However, Stichting made what Mr Radice considers to be one of the most
important decisions for the chain's future as an international brand. Within
weeks of the takeover, Habitat's headquarters were moved from London to
Paris. 'Now we are seriously working to make this one business,' Mr Radice
says. 'A global view can only (be achieved) if we are run as one business.'
The two divisions will share an increasing proportion of products and ranges
in their catalogues. Habitat UK's catalogue is already showing a greater
emphasis on the simple, timeless furniture for which Habitat was originally
renowned and which the French business never abandoned.
The design teams of both divisions are also encouraged to share the colour
schemes and influences which form the basis of their furnishings. Shared
sourcing and distribution are natural goals, which previously had been
largely ignored.
Now, says Mr Radice, Habitat is back on track to make significant profits
and is more focused on the type of customer it wants to attract than it has
been for years. 'We want a customer with some passion, some heart,' Mr
Radice insists. 'One that has confidence to say THIS is the glass I like.'
Comfort will be the driving force behind the product offer, rather than the
creation of a stylised look such as that offered in Habitat catalogues of
the 1980s. 'Ours is a catalogue of ideas,' Mr Radice says. 'That was a
hardware catalogue.'
Mr Radice says he is determined to recreate the atmosphere that made Sir
Terence's stores so popular. 'It should be a place to meet, not to buy,' he
says. Thus, the plans for an elegant but affordable cafe - Italian of course
 -above the King's Road shop.
Habitat's commitment to opening new shops in unusual sites - much as Sir
Terence sought out churches and cinemas for his original stores - is also
part of Mr Radice's Habitat revival.
While most welcome the shift in emphasis which has become apparent over the
last 18 months, there are those who warn of the dangers of becoming too
focused on an image which does not have mass market appeal.
'There is a fine dividing line between being focused and limiting your
potential,' says Ms Hilary Monk of the market research organisation Verdict.
Sir Terence agrees. While praising the group's success in 'throwing off the
Storehouse glooms', he says: 'It worries me that Habitat has given up some
of the very straightforward, very everyday things we used to sell so
success-fully.'
For the moment, however, Mr Radice has other things on his mind; most
immediately, the relaunch of the King's Road site. To commemorate the
occasion, he is frantically searching for the desert epic with which the
Gaumont Palace cinema opened in 1934 - The Camels are Coming.
Mr Radice, a lively Italian proud of his unorthodox managerial methods, is
also angling to make his entrance on the back of a camel. This time,
however, the Stichting board may have other ideas.

FT  18 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Court decision today over B&amp;C litigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HIGH COURT judge is expected to award substantial damages today against
Samuel Montagu and Quadrex Holdings in the long-running litigation brought
against them by British &amp; Commonwealth, the financial services group that
collapsed in June 1990.
Mr Justice Gatehouse will make public in the Commercial Court this morning
his assessment of damages following hearings which finished in March this
year. His ruling follows an earlier judgment in May 1991 in which he
determined that both Samuel Montagu and Quadrex were liable to pay damages
to B&amp;C.
The litigation was triggered by the 1987 takeover of Mercantile House
Holdings by British &amp; Commonwealth, the group now in administration.
The acquisition relied on an agreement that Quadrex, a Delaware corporation
headed by Mr Gary Klesch, would buy Mercantile's wholesale broking division
after B&amp;C made a takeover bid.
After the acquisition, Quadrex did not have the funds to make the purchase,
which led to B&amp;C bringing a claim of damages for breach of contract of
Pounds 200m against the abortive sale in 1988.
However, the judge ruled in 1991 that Quadrex could collect from B&amp;C Pounds
20m-Pounds 30m to compensate for non-fraudulent misrepresentations during
talks on the sale of its wholesale broking division.
B&amp;C also claimed against Samuel Montagu, Quadrex's financial advisers, for
negligent mis-statements made to the company by its head of corporate
finance. Creditors to B&amp;C are unlikely to receive any dividends as a result
of the award in the next few months, because the original verdict is still
on appeal.
Early last year the administrators estimated that creditors to B&amp;C Holdings
would eventually receive dividends of 23p in the pound and those to B&amp;C
Group Finance 37p before the outcome of the litigation.
Those involved in the trial have agreed that any appeals from tomorrow's
decision will be heard at the same time as the appeals on the original
liability case two years ago. These hearings have been scheduled for January
1995.
The costs to B&amp;C alone have been more than Pounds 16m since proceedings
began following the acquisition in 1987.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO'S big institutional shareholders have given unequivocal support to Mr
Dieter Bock's attempts to stamp his authority on the conglomerate with the
appointment of non-executive directors.
The German financier, who was appointed earlier this year as joint chief
executive with Mr Tiny Rowland, remains confident that tomorrow's board
meeting will accept his nominated non-executives: Mr Peter Harper, director
of Hanson, the conglomerate, and Mr Stephen Walls, chairman of Albert
Fisher, food processor and distributor.
Mr Bock has had support from four big institutional shareholders: Fidelity
Management Research, the US investment fund, with 8.9 per cent; Genting, one
of Malaysia's biggest companies with 3.9 per cent; PDFM, the Union Bank of
Switzerland fund management arm with 2 per cent and Postel, with 1.5 per
cent.

FT  18 OCT 93 / UK leads in European cross-border takeovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN has jumped six places to first position in the European cross-border
takeover league, with UK companies completing more acquisitions in Europe
than their counterparts in any other country during the first nine months of
the year.
At the same time the rate of cross-border activity in Europe has declined in
the first three quarters, reflecting deepening economic difficulties in many
countries. Foreign acquisitions by German companies are expected to fall by
as much as 50 per cent this year.
A survey by cross-border mergers and acquisitions specialist, Translink,
shows British companies completed 160 deals in the first three quarters,
against 158 for all of last year.
So far, 810 cross-border deals have been completed by companies in Europe.
Translink estimates that some 1,100 will be completed this year, a decline
of 20 per cent.
The company said yesterday Britain's aggressive cross-border activity
appeared to confirm its emergence from recession. 'It seems we are slightly
ahead in the economic cycle,' Translink said.
The US, last year's leader with a total of 215 deals for 1992, fell to
second place with 156 acquisitions for the nine months. France holds third
place with 121 deals, compared with 202 for all of 1992.
Britain also remains the most popular target, with foreign groups snapping
up 150 companies so far, against 196 in 1992.

FT  18 OCT 93 / A friendship splits over the way forward / A look at issues
behind the Lonrho board dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE disagreement between Mr Tiny Rowland and Mr Dieter Bock over the
appointment of non-executive directors to Lonrho is more than an arcane
dispute over corporate governance.
If tomorrow's board meeting gives the go-ahead to the appointments, the
balance of power within the company would swing irrevocably in favour of the
German financier. It would also signal a radical shake-up at the top of the
company. The new directors would establish an audit committee to monitor its
financial performance and take a fresh look at the remuneration of existing
executive directors.
Adding to the uncertainty is the fact that the board opinion is finely
balanced. The allegiance of Mr Rene Leclezio, Lonrho's chairman, is not in
doubt, but Mr Rowland can only be confident of retaining the continued
support of enough other directors to give him a majority of one on the 12
man board.
It is a far cry from the arrival of Mr Bock when he acquired his 18.8 per
cent stake at the start of the year. Then the joint chief executives
described themselves as 'indivisible'.
Mr Bock left the delicate task of changing the board's structure until after
he had completed restructuring most of the group's complicated mix of
businesses. Restructuring had the enthusiastic support of Mr Rowland, who
has been able to spend more time in Africa. Mr Bock was confident that Mr
Rowland was ready to approve the appointment of two non-executives.
But a board meeting earlier this month put off a decision under pressure
from Mr Rowland who felt the full-time directors should first meet Mr Bock's
proposed non-executives.
If tomorrow's board meeting does not approve the appointment of Lonrho's
first non-executives for two decades, Mr Bock may put the issue to
shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting. He would only risk this as
a last resort since it would publicly set the two men against each other.
Some analysts are surprised Mr Bock did not expect opposition from Mr
Rowland. The latter has been opposed to non-executives ever since the
'straight eight' directors unsuccessfully tried to remove him in 1973.
However, earlier this year, he indicated his support for the 'right'
candidates who would make a positive contribution to the running of the
board.
Then over the last few months internal politics began to give the issue a
new significance.
Key Lonrho directors began to shift their loyalty from Mr Rowland, who has
run the group for more than 30 years, to Mr Bock. The beginnings of a split
have developed on the board which broadly reflects the different working
patterns of the two chief executives.
Mr Bock likes to be at his desk by 8.30am. By the time he arrives for work
he often finds Mr Robin Whitten and Mr Philip Tarsh, both accountants with
special responsibility for finance, and Mr Nick Morrell, another director,
are already in their offices. The three directors have formed a strong bond
with Mr Bock.
In contrast, when Mr Rowland is in London he usually arrives at the the
group's Cheapside headquarters at around 10.30am. This is the preferred
starting time of two of his most loyal directors: Mr Robert Dunlop and Mr
Paul Spicer. Two years ago Mr Rowland promoted them to joint deputy
chairman.
Yet Mr Bock was still taken by surprise at Mr Rowland's decision to delay
the appointment of non-executives. Mr Rowland had announced in January that
he was planning to retire in three years. He also continued to say that Mr
Bock's appointment as joint chief executive had solved the group's
succession problem.
But the 75 year-old entrepreneur has a habit of falling out with old
friends.
After Mr Rowland won his battle with the 'straight eight' he became friends
with the Kuwaiti Sabah Brothers, Sheikhs Nasser and Hamed, who took a stake
of about 26 per cent. But in 1975 they sold their shares after many of their
demands, including the appointment of non-executives, had been ignored.
Even Mr Mohamed Al-Fayed, who Mr Rowland never forgave for winning control
of the House of Fraser, was once a friend and appointed to the Lonrho board.
Mr Rowland will soon be 76, though, and may not relish the prospect of
another row. Furthermore, Mr Bock remains emollient, softly-spoken, and
respectful of Mr Rowland, which may lessen the chances of a feud.
This is part of the reason why Mr Bock remains confident that Mr Rowland
will tomorrow agree to the appointment of the two nominated non-executives.
A number of Mr Rowland's close directors, however, are unlikely to urge him
to agree to Mr Bock's demands. They are aware that new directors would
radically change Lonrho.
The non-executives plan to join the group's remuneration committee and
re-evaluate directors' pay. They will also determine what to pay Mr Bock,
who has not drawn a salary since becoming joint chief executive.
They would almost certainly bring an end to Lonrho's practice of allowing
directors to draw their pension as well as their salary when they reach 65.
Mr Roland, Mr Leclezio and Mr Spicer are all understood to be drawing their
pension as well as their annual salary.
They will also set up the company's first audit committee. A reduction in
the estimated Pounds 20m annual costs of running the headquarters is likely
to be one of its first tasks. One way to achieve this would be to cut head
office staff from the current 160 and to cut executive board members,
currently 12, by half.
Mr Rowland's closest directors are not eager to vote for the appointment of
non-executives who may hasten their own departure. The outcome will depend
on whether Mr Rowland is willing to cede control of the company he has
dominated for three decades.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Economics Notebook: Sowing seeds of doubt in the taxpayer's
mind
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a lot of grumbling about 'red tape' from farmers this year when
they were asked to complete the complex forms needed to claim compensation
for cuts in EC production subsidies.
But one farmer with 2,000 acres in Britain's rich cereal-growing region of
East Anglia was determined to look on the bright side. He calculated that
the payment he would receive for completing the 10-page document would
amount to Pounds 12,500 per page.
Out of his total income of Pounds 125,000 from the EC, moreover, he would be
paid nearly Pounds 25,000 simply for not growing cereals on part of his
land.
As the first compensation cheques arrive through the post this month, it
will be possible to see exactly how much taxpayers' money goes to supporting
each farmer. Under last year's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy,
arable farmers receive cash in hand to compensate them for a 29 per cent cut
in cereal support prices over three years. To be paid, however, they must
leave idle, or 'set aside,' 15 per cent of their land.
The reform of the CAP was seen as vital to ending the worst excesses of
agricultural protectionism. It was designed to pave the way for a Gatt
agreement which requires the EC to cut the value and volume of cereal export
subsidies by 36 per cent and 21 per cent respectively over six years.
But it is by no means certain things will work out that way. To begin with,
subsidising farmers for setting their land aside could run foul of tax-
payers.
Agricultural subsidies to producers alone cost EC consumers and taxpayers
Ecu66bn (Pounds 51bn) last year, according to the OECD. Because member
states have undertaken to cushion farmers from the cuts in cereal support
prices, that overall burden will remain much the same until and unless
production falls.
However, as support shifts to highly visible payments, so taxpayers will be
more likely to question the cost. Set-aside payments are due to rise to
about Ecu1.2bn in 1995.
The farmers themselves could also jeopardise the scheme. They dislike
set-aside because it goes against their instincts for making the land
productive.
Critics of the scheme say it was hampered from the start by the exemption of
small farmers producing less than 92 tonnes of cereals a year on the grounds
that they would be unfairly penalised. This measure alone is estimated to
reduce the overall set-aside area from 15 per cent of EC arable land to
between 9 and 12 per cent.
Experience in the US, where set-aside has operated since the 1930s, shows
there are also inherent problems which lessen the chances of the scheme
controlling output:
Farmers put their poorest land into set-aside
Yields on the remaining land rise as farmers use more labour, machinery and
chemicals to compensate for the lost production
Yields increase when land enriched by fallowing comes back into production.
To overcome the first of these problems, the European Commission initially
required farmers to 'rotate' the area they set aside each year for six
years, so that 90 per cent of their arable land was left fallow at some
point during the scheme.
But it is now proposing, under French pressure, to limit the scheme to three
years. Although the required set-aside area would be increased to 20 per
cent, only 60 per cent of land would go out of production during the
lifetime of the scheme. In other words, the richest land would probably
remain untouched.
Meanwhile, there are already signs that yields have improved. The EC grain
traders' association, Coceral, estimates that average yields are up about 5
per cent compared with last year on a harvest that has fallen only about 3
per cent to some 164m tonnes.
Yields tend to increase by about 2 per cent a year because of improvements
in seed and fertiliser technology. The extra rise suggests more intense
production, although it could be partly due to better weather.
Coceral estimates that the land in cereal production has fallen by only 7
per cent, lower even than the Commission's actual target of 8-9 per cent for
the first year.
The Commission puts a brave face on all this, arguing that the policy will
work better as prices fall. Some arable farmers may initially have found it
worthwhile to forgo compensation payments in order to sell more crops. It
says last year's harvest was poor and the fall from a more normal harvest
would have been closer to 8 per cent.
Brussels also argues that the problem of more intensive farming on land in
production will lessen as declining prices cease to cover the cost of extra
inputs.
But the policy faces erosion on other fronts.
The commission has agreed to allow fixed as well as rotating set-aside from
next season provided 20 per cent of the farm is taken out of production.
This increases the prospects that only less fertile land will be affected.
Set-aside also depends on compliance. 'If the problems the EC has
experienced in enforcing its dairy quota - especially in Italy where they
simply were never enforced - are any indication, then non-compliance could
be a serious problem,' says Mr Michael Herlihy, an economist with the US
Department of Agriculture, in a recent paper on US and EC set-aside.
Cereal farmers know last year's CAP reforms may not be the end of the
matter. Some fear they could face increased set-aside requirements as the
winds of free trade begin to blow into the EC's protected market. French
farm unions claim more than 30 per cent of land would have to be left idle
to meet the requirements of the Blair House farm deal between the US and the
EC.
The industry has long been regarded as a special case. 'A free trade policy
for cereal production is seen as a bridge too far for policy-makers and
farmers,' says Mr Michael Murphy, an agricultural economist at Cambridge
University, in a recent paper.
But as taxpayers begin to see the size of subsidies, especially to the most
prosperous of the EC's farmers, the pressure for even more radical change
may become unstoppable.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Trafalgar to launch third rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEED for yet more write-downs on its property portfolio will this morning
lead Trafalgar House to announce a rights issue of up to Pounds 400m, its
third cash call within two years.
The construction and engineering group, in which the Jardine
Matheson-controlled Hongkong Land has a 25 per cent stake, will also confirm
that Mr Allan Gormly is to stand down as chief executive next August to
become chairman of Royal Insurance. He will remain on Trafalgar's board.
He will be replaced as chief executive by Mr Nigel Rich, managing director
of Jardine Matheson in Hong Kong.
The group's advisers, Robert Fleming and Schroders, have recommended that
the group strengthen its balance sheet by asking its shareholders for money
instead of making 'fire sale' disposals.
Although Trafalgar still plans to sell its hotels, including the Ritz, it
will do so when the market improves.
The rights issue is needed because of further property write-downs and the
equity requirements for its growing engineering and construction division.
The group's net debt varies from Pounds 250m to Pounds 500m on a seasonal
basis.
Trafalgar had hoped to wait until mid-December when it will announce its
full-year results to unveil its latest rights issue. But market speculation
that it is planning to tap shareholders for cash forced it to bring forward
its announcement to today.
Shareholders may be weary at being asked for more finance for their
loss-making company. But Trafalgar is expected to argue that its new board,
including a new finance director, Mr David Gawler, from Jardine Matheson,
believes the company is significantly undercapitalised for the level of its
business.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Deaths threaten rival to Zovirax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SUPPLIES of Usevir, the only licensed effective competitor in the world to
Zovirax, Wellcome's herpes and shingles treatment, have been halted in Japan
following three deaths among patients.
The development is a severe blow to Bristol-Myers Squibb, the US
pharmaceuticals group which in 1989 acquired the global marketing rights for
the drug, excluding Japan.
Usevir, also known as Bvarau, was only launched on September 3. Industry
analysts expect the medicine to be withdrawn completely from the Japanese
market.
The medicine has reached late-stage clinical trials in the US and is one of
the most important compound drugs in Bristol-Myers Squibb's pipeline. The
company believed the drug was capable of generating revenues of Dollars 1bn
(Pounds 600m) by the late 1990s.
The group urgently needs new products because the US patents of the
heart-drug Capoten, its top-selling medicine with revenues of Dollars 1.6bn,
expire in 1995.
The Japanese company with marketing rights to Usevir is Nippon Shoji, the
Osaka-based pharmaceuticals wholesaling group. The rights were acquired from
Yamasa Shoyu, a small Japanese company which invented Usevir.
Nippon Shoji had hoped to gain a significant share of Japan's Y25bn (Pounds
156m) shingles market, currently dominated by Zovirax.
The deaths in Japan are understood to have been caused by simultaneous use
of Usevir with an anti-cancer agent called fluorouracil. The drug's
packaging warns against use with certain anti-cancer agents.
The Japanese Health and Welfare Ministry has ordered Nippon Shoji to
dispatch emergency instructions to medical institutions warning against the
use of the drug with fluorouracil, prescribing the drug to patients who have
been treated for cancer, and prescribing the drug to patients taking
medication which cannot be confirmed. Nippon Shoji has also sent staff to
warn of the dangers of the side effects.
Wellcome's Zovirax has been used for more than 10 years and has an excellent
safety record.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Clinton admits mistakes in handling foreign policy:
President hits back at criticism from western Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US PRESIDENT Bill Clinton and Mr Warren Christopher, his secretary of state,
conceded over the weekend that their conduct of foreign policy had not been
free of error, especially in Somalia.
But both, in interviews with the Washington Post, resisted suggestions that
the administration's foreign policy team needed shaking up or that the
president should reduce his concentration on domestic issues.
Both also had harsh words for western Europe. On Bosnia, for example, Mr
Clinton observed: 'I had the feeling that the British and the French felt it
was far more important to avoid lifting the arms embargo than to save the
country.'
The president disclosed that Mr John Major told him his government could
fall if he agreed to US demands to lift the embargo and launch air strikes
against the Serbs. 'John Major told me he wasn't sure he could sustain his
government if he approved the plan,' Mr Clinton said.
Mr Christopher responded sharply to an editorial in last week's Economist
magazine calling for his removal also by citing Bosnia. Such 'blame America'
rhetoric, he said, stemmed from the US 'not having resolved the problem that
Europe failed to resolve itself'.
He said he thought official Washington had been for too long too
'Eurocentric' and that 'western Europe is no longer the dominant area of the
world . . . there is a lot of criticism coming from western Europe but I
don't see or hear it coming from Asia'.
Mr Clinton noted three areas where the US foreign policy record might have
been better: failing to engage the American public more in explaining the US
role in the post-cold war world, allowing US soldiers to serve under UN
command and letting diplomatic efforts in Somalia languish over the summer.
Mr Christopher said it was 'probably an error' not to have reviewed US
policy in Somalia when UN peacekeepers began getting killed.
In fact the State Department is so unhappy with the performance of Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, that it is trying to dissuade
him from visiting Somalia this week as planned. It fears his presence might
jeopardise the fragile ceasefire between the UN and the forces of General
Mohammed Farah Aideed.
Although in a self-critical mood, Mr Clinton doubted that a more intense
'national dialogue' in foreign policy would necessarily have made any
difference. 'I don't think you can ever say . . . looking objectively at the
problems of people in this country, that we could be more successful in
foreign affairs if we talked about it more, to the exclusion of domestic
efforts,' he said.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Bonn ignores EC cereals limit in eastern Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BONN government is refusing to abide by European Community limits on the
amount of land which can be sown with cereals in eastern Germany,
threatening a bruising row between Germany and the EC at a meeting of
agriculture ministers today.
A senior Commission official said Bonn's militancy on agriculture threatened
to unravel the Common Agricultural Policy reform, break budgetary limits
Bonn is constantly urging on Brussels, and further complicate General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks already on the brink over the farm
issue.
The dispute was ignited because the east German Lander, or states, have
exceeded by nearly 10 per cent the area they are entitled to plant. Under
last year's reform of the CAP, which introduced big price cuts and
production restraints to rein in oversupply, budgetary outlays, and to try
to make possible a Gatt farm trade agreement, the former east Germany was
given a 'base area' eligible for EC price support of 3.6m hectares. This has
been overshot by 347,000 hectares.
The Commission, interpreting the rules flexibly to take account of the
prostration of the eastern German economy, on Friday proposed a gradual
phasing in of the automatic penalties for exceeding the planted area.
Brussels proposes that instead of facing a 10 per cent reduction in aid next
year, the normal penalty for cultivating 10 per cent too much land, an
immediate reduction of only 1 per cent will be imposed. As for the excess
land, the Commission says 10 per cent must be taken out of production next
year, 20 per cent in 1995, 50 per cent in 1996 and 100 per cent in 1997.
The Commission's concession will cost an extra Ecu85m (Pounds 66m) to an
Ecu36bn farm budget already in danger of exceeding its legal ceiling.
Germany responded on Friday by saying it would not respect this compromise,
and would compensate its farmers for any penalties from national funds.
Bonn says the original calculation of the 'base area' in east Germany, made
by Brussels in 1992, was incorrect, by failing to include some 180,000
hectares of land devoted to maize.
Mr Jochen Borchert, the German agriculture minister, said Brussels had
failed to allow for the upheaval in east German agriculture. Far more land
was taken out of use for livestock production than had been forecast, and
the land was switched to cereal production, which was unexpected. 'The very
survival of many farms in east Germany will be at stake,' he said.
Although Chancellor Helmut Kohl has written to Commission president Mr
Jacques Delors defending Germany's case, Brussels regards this posture as an
infraction of EC law.
If the dispute is not resolved, legal action could result, and the
Commission says it will claw back any illicit German aid at the end-of-year
clearing of accounts.

FT  18 OCT 93 / DTI advises Heseltine against Post Office sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry is to recommend that the Post Office
should not be privatised, despite the conclusions of its advisers who
believe a sale would not jeopardise the nationwide delivery network.
The recommendation to leave the Royal Mail, which is the letters division,
and Post Office Counters in the public sector but with greater commercial
freedom will be put to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
when he returns to work, possibly this week. He is not expected to overrule
the department's recommendation.
The DTI, however, is considering some options to give the Post Office
greater commercial freedom in the public sector while introducing more
competition.
The sale of Parcelforce, already announced, will still go ahead.
Kleinwort Benson, the government's adviser on the future of the service,
believes a regulated, privatised Royal Mail could continue to deliver
letters to every address in the UK without charging more in rural areas.
However, many ministers fear that privatisation could provoke another
unwelcome split in the Conservative party, similar to the row over the
break-up of British Rail. The government would only have a slim majority of
about one on the committee stage of any bill privatising the Post Office,
which is regarded as too small to ensure success.
The first sign of a backtrack came when Mr John Major sacked the junior
industry minister Mr Edward Leigh, a strong supporter of privatisation, in
his spring reshuffle.
Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive of the Post Office, believes the future
ownership of the corporation is a matter for the government, but he has
called on ministers to cut it loose 'from the stifling cash book culture of
the public sector'.
Last year the Post Office contributed Pounds 80m in cash to the Treasury.
This year its target contribution has risen to Pounds 181m, described by the
Post Office as a daunting challenge.

FT  18 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: BAT Industries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BAT Industries' shares are only a shade below the level from which they fell
on Marlboro Friday in April. If Philip Morris can take the blame for the
derating - thanks to its strategy of discounting - it is also partially
responsible for the bounce. Investors have decided that the US company is
cheap, dragging BAT up in sympathy. To the extent that US cigarette prices
have stabilised it is certainly easier to take stock of the damage. BAT's
operating margins in US tobacco have fallen by 10 percentage points. Profits
from that business are likely to fall by more than half this year.
It seems too much to hope that cigarette prices might soon be on the up.
Even the reduced margins now being earned are respectable by the standards
of other markets.
President Clinton's proposed tobacco tax remains a threat. A tax anywhere
near the Dollars 1-a-pack suggested would accelerate the shrinkage of the US
cigarette market through the second half of the decade. While pricing
pressures remain, it will be difficult to use the increased duty as cover
for widening margins.
The comfort is that US tobacco will probably account for less than 20 per
cent of BAT's profits this year, down from 45 per cent at the end of the
1980s. The balance of risks now lies squarely in financial services, where
BAT is enjoying better luck. Even at around 500p it might be argued that the
shares do not reflect the full value of Eagle Star, Allied Dunbar and
Farmers - but that seems an occupational hazard for a conglomerate.

</HEADLINE>

When the main reason for believing shares will go up is based on the view
that everyone else believes they will go up, it is probably time to sell.
For that reason, there is room for nervousness about the UK property sector.
By most objective measures, property shares have raced up too far, too fast.
With the FT-A Property sector having risen 2.3 times since Black Wednesday,
property shares should at least linger a while for the underlying
fundamentals of the property market to catch up.
But such caution takes little account of the abandon of fund managers with
asset allocation targets to meet. The short-term yield attractions of both
property shares and direct property is still enticing investors into both
markets, creating a virtuous circle of demand. Property companies have
hardly been slow to exploit the favourable sentiment by tapping shareholders
for some Pounds 1.4bn this year. But even that has seemingly not dampened
the ardour.
Any cuts in interest rates fuelling equities and lowering dividend yields
could lead to another upward spurt in property shares. But for the run to be
sustained much further will depend on prospects for income growth. Although
the rental market may be bottoming out, growth is unlikely to resume before
1995.
In the meantime, property shares will be vulnerable to jolts. A reversal of
interest rate trends would be a nasty surprise. Any concrete proposals from
the government to alter upwards-only rent reviews could also precipitate a
retreat.

National Power and PowerGen have sensibly kept a low profile in the most
recent debate about the future of coal. The two generating companies did
nicely from the deal struck in March, and the reduction in coal stocks will
allow them to reduce working capital substantially in coming years. There
was, however, an expectation that they would take extra coal to support some
mines, and while the encroachment of competing fuels provides some excuse,
their reluctance to do so will have won them few political friends.
That comes at a time when electricity pool prices and the generators' market
dominance is under investigation by the regulator. He is under pressure to
act against the generators because spot prices have risen. National Power
and PowerGen can point to their declining market share, but they still
control all of the marginal plant which dictates the pool price. If the
regulator decides that such market power is unacceptable he faces a choice
of devising a market solution to solve it or making a reference to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Cynics have suggested that no reference will take place while the government
still wants to sell its 40 per cent stake in the generators. Yet a reference
remains a real possibility since market solutions will not be easy to find.
Those who are pencilling in a secondary share offer for next July may just
be in for a disappointment.

Wednesday's vote on the introduction of corporate capital is as close as
Lloyd's will get to a make-or-break decision. Rejection threatens the
resignation of Lloyd's management. Even a delay would scupper the
introduction of corporate membership for 1994. While that would give
disaffected Names time to press for settlement of legal claims, there is
little doubt that potential providers of corporate capital will look
elsewhere to take advantage of the turn in the cycle.
The immediate need for corporate capital looks less acute than earlier in
the year. Individual Names have not deserted in the numbers anticipated.
Capital from that source next year is likely to be only a little lower than
this. The spate of Bermuda reinsurance companies will also underwrite London
market risks.
It is possible that the introduction of Pounds 1bn in corporate capital will
contribute to a softening of rates in popular areas such as motor. But it is
difficult to argue that blocking corporate capital is the best way to tackle
the problem.
The 1991 underwriting year will bring further large losses for existing
Names. New Names may not come forward in future even if the present
generation keeps faith. In the long run Lloyd's needs new sources of capital
to maintain critical mass. The market's management should certainly reaffirm
its commitment to rationing the inflow of capital.
The onus is also on managing agents not to accept more capital than can be
profitably allocated to syndicates. Preventing periods of feast and famine
requires commercial discipline and increased professionalism. A vote in
favour of the introduction of corporate members would be a large step in
that direction.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Boeing 747 production faces cut as orders fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOEING, the world's largest commercial aircraft manufacturer, may be forced
to shut down one of its two 747 jumbo production lines in the face of the
deep recession in the airline business.
Although the company has just delivered its thousandth 747, to Singapore
Airlines, it has not won a single new order for its jumbos so far this year.
Production of 747s at the company's huge Everett facility outside Seattle
has already come down from seven a month two years ago to four a month and
will go down to three a month in January.
Boeing is slashing overall production rates from a peak of 39 1/2 aircraft a
month to 21 aircraft a month by the middle of next year.
Everett has inventory of Dollars 4bn aircraft, plant and equipment. The
Boeing group as a whole is carrying inventory worth between Dollars 10bn and
Dollars 12bn.
Mr Philip Condit, Boeing's president, said in an interview at the company's
Seattle headquarters that there were no plans at present for any further
production cuts but he could not rule these out in the future.
Boeing, the European Airbus consortium, and McDonnell Douglas are competing
for a Dollars 6bn order for up to 60 aircraft from Saudia, the Saudi Arabian
airline. The deal is likely to be the last big airline order for several
months in the deeply depressed market which has taken a heavy toll on all
manufacturers.
Mr Condit said there were some 'faint, positive signs' with US airlines
beginning to show improved profitability and continued growth in the
Asia-Pacific region where Boeing is actively seeking to sell its new 777
wide-body to Singapore Airlines.
The cut in production rates, which will see Boeing aircraft deliveries fall
from 446 airliners last year to about 350 this year and probably 258 next
year, coincides with heavy development spending on new products including
the wide-body 777 airliner due to fly for the first time next year.
Boeing expects to spend about Dollars 1.7bn on research and development this
year. Apart from the 777, the company will offer a new family of 737
twin-engine jets and is developing a cargo version of its 767 medium-sized
airliner.
Boeing is in the throes of extensive restructuring with employment falling
from 132,695 at its peak in 1992 to about 116,000 by the end of this year.

<TEXT>
Peter Bottomley, the Conservative MP and former Northern Ireland minister,
sniffs winds of change in Ulster. To help them along he now writes columns
for the Irish News, a Belfast daily aimed mainly at the Catholic community
in Northern Ireland. Tom Collins, the paper's editor, hopes to heal
sectarian divisions by employing a diverse bunch of columnists.
Bottomley's columns preach reconciliation between religious, political and
ethnic enemies, in Northern Ireland and elsewhere. He accepts that chances
of his writing having much impact on political extremists are slim. 'But you
always live in hope,' he says.
More hope than tact perhaps. For in one column he writes: 'Why is the
turnover among party leaders in Northern Ireland so infrequent?' and
continues that if there 'is seldom a change of leader, political change may
be more difficult'.
That sort of thing may not go down well with his fellow Irish News columnist
and Ulster politician, Ian Paisley.

The latest barricade behind which French politicians are mustering in the
interminable Gatt negotiations is not wheat but popcorn. They say French
cinema is being engulfed by Hollywood.
But they are drawing strength from Germinal, Claude Berri's newly released
film version of the tough novel by Emile Zola.
In its first week in Paris, Germinal shot straight to number one, attracting
an audience of 170,000. Its nearest rival - the Hollywood film The Fugitive
 -only managed 86,000. Germinal is now hailed as France's bulwark against US
invasion.
But the Parisian intelligentsia - regarded as prehistoric in some quarters -
faces a short-lived victory. Other dinosaurs - featuring in Jurassic Park,
the movie - arrive in Paris on Wednesday.

An Englishman's home is his castle. Keith and Mary Baker were determined to
defend theirs.
In April local councils across the UK introduced the replacement for the
much-hated poll tax, one of the then Mrs Thatcher's less successful ventures
into social engineering.
The new tax bears the rather anodyne name 'council tax'. It works simply;
the more valuable your house, the higher the level of tax you pay.
Many homeowners are protesting that their houses have been over-valued, and
that the tax they must pay is therefore excessive.
But from the Bakers' Hertfordshire battlements came the protestation that
they were paying too little.
They told the Journal of Public Finance that their appeal has a rational
basis. A low valuation for tax purposes might mean they won't be able to
sell their house for the sum they want. Result? Happiness all round. The
taxman gets an extra Pounds 100, money which the Bakers think is well spent.

Considerable cash is tied up in Lady Thatcher's memoirs; little of it went

Cold scribblers assembled outside the Press Association building in Fleet

They were greeted by a solitary young woman, whose job it was to hand them
out, check the orders, and then place the books into envelopes. Reviewers
kicked their heels outside for half an hour.
Impatient queue-jumpers were accorded appropriate Thatcherite treatment;
they were ejected back on to the street.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Observer: Wachsing lyrical at VW
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Otto Ferdinand Wachs has at last been awarded the label to accompany the job
he has been doing for the past three months.
Now named as head of public affairs at Volkswagen, Wachs has formally taken
over the role of Lutz Schilling, the ill-fated former group spokesman.
Schilling carries the can for the public relations catastrophes incurred in
the fumbled defence of both the group and production director Jose Ignacio
Lopez de Arriortua, against accusations from rival carmaker Adam Opel.
It was Schilling who sat at the side of Ferdinand Piech during the gruesome
summer press conference in Wolfsburg, at which the VW chairman's bellicosity
earned him public reproaches from Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Now Schilling will occupy himself with less strenuous matters, such as
corporate identity and motor sports. His toughest immediate task will be
steering next year's VW sponsorship of a European tour by the rock band,
Pink Floyd.
Wachs is former press chief for the VW car marque. His snappy dress and a
penchant for Italian wine bars - both rarities in VW country - have earned
him the soubriquet 'the Wolfsburg yuppie' in some quarters.
But Wachs is one of the few old-guard VW senior managers to survive and be
promoted by Piech. Moreover, during the recent lull in the Opel-Lopez affair
he has guided his fractious boss through a series of image-restoring
interviews.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROAD to the restoration of the British government's authority is still a
long and painful one. The next stage begins today, when Parliament returns.
The most that can be said so far is that the government has not fallen
apart. If it is to do better than that, it must hold its nerve and show that
it is possible to make its decisions stick. That requires unity on its own
benches. The Conservative party must decide whether it wants the
responsibility of office or the luxury of a period of opposition, in which
it might freely indulge its post-Thatcher propensity for ideological
bickering.
After the formal business of the cabinet was concluded last Thursday,
ministers congratulated themselves, and the prime minister, on what they saw
as a successful party conference. What actually happened at Blackpool was
that various threatened disasters did not take place. The publication of
Lady Thatcher's criticisms of Mr John Major did less damage to her successor
than had been feared. Mr Major himself survived unscathed; his leader's
speech, which relied heavily on nostalgia, was well-received by an audience
primed to be receptive. A facade of unity was erected on the flimsy
foundation of a number of speeches attacking various scapegoats for the
government's failures: criminals, unmarried mothers, pornographers, foreign
dependents on British social security and the like.
Deep hole
This may not leave a pleasant taste in the mouth, but it served its purpose,
which was to get the government through a difficult week. Mr Major remains,
however, in what the chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, has called a deep hole.
The man with the heaviest responsibility for the rescue operation is Mr
Clarke himself. As matters stand, he is in the deepest hole of all, Pounds
50bn deep. His Budget on November 30 will be judged in part by the extent to
which it reduces that deficit. Whatever he decides to do is likely to be
opposed by one lobby or another, as today's debate on defence is likely to
demonstrate.
A government that cannot withstand lobbies is no government at all. The
defence budget is already being reduced, under Options for Change, and the
defence secretary, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, appears likely to offer up
politically motivated 'unthinkable' cuts in an effort to protect his
department's bottom line from further raids.
There is a strong case for a further challenge to the defence budget, as the
wider review of public spending unfolds in the next three years. The
possibilities of merging Britain's defence responsibilities with those of
European allies have not been fully explored. The ambitions of the forces
chiefs are still attuned to an earlier age. There is a limit to what can be
afforded by a modest country like Britain, which still maintains tanks it
cannot keep in good repair and which it could not protect in wartime without
the assistance of allies.
Radical change
The defence secretary insists that spending must be tailored to the demands
on the forces deployed. He wants a review before any further deep cuts. The
chancellor might call Mr Rifkind's bluff. He could try setting a low figure
and asking the ministry to demonstrate what commitments it could meet with
that. This would be a radical but necessary change in the order of
determining the budget for the only high-spending department that is not
protected by election promises (health) or sheer numbers of genuine
dependents (social security).
Other politically difficult decisions remain to be taken before the Budget.
The government appears to be soft-pedalling on British Coal's pit closure
programme. This may buy a few doubtful weeks of political peace, at a cost
of larger stockpiles and lower coal sales later on. It seems to be wavering
on the details of rail privatisation, particularly the House of Lords
amendment allowing British Rail, the management that got the railways where
they are today, to bid for the privatised lines. This is government by
parliamentary rebels.
Mr Major needs to demonstrate that he and his colleagues can be as effective
with a majority of 17, plus nine Ulster Unionists, as his predecessor could
with majorities four and five times as large. The question is, will his
party allow him to do so?

FT  18 OCT 93 / Surrounded by the hungry pack: The London Stock Exchange
seems to have no clear strategy for resisting rivals and handling
technological change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the 23rd floor of the London Stock Exchange tower, the walls are lined
with portraits of former chairmen. From their ornate gilt frames, past
generations of grandees gaze down on the City with an air of haughty
self-assurance, untouched by doubts about the future.
When the present chairman, Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, sits for his portrait
ahead of his retirement next year, the artist is unlikely to capture such an
air of serene complacency. Like other stock exchanges round the world,
London's faces unprecedented commercial challenges. Unlike its overseas
rivals, however, the London Stock Exchange also faces a crisis of
confidence.
The people whose confidence matters most to the exchange - the marketmakers
and brokers who form its membership, and the investment institutions that
buy and sell the bulk of the shares traded - are happy with the day-to-day
work of the exchange. Their concerns cover just the area about which the
chairmen in the portraits were so sublimely confident: the future role of
the institution itself.
One incident crystallises these doubts: the ignominious failure, earlier
this year, of the stock exchange's ambitious Taurus project to computerise
the settlement of stock market bargains. Because of that failure, the
exchange lost its chief executive, Mr Peter Rawlins, and has all too
publicly failed to find a replacement.
Worse, Mr Rawlins's departure led to the abandonment of his elaborate vision
of the exchange's future - and, again, there is no substitute in sight. The
vision was abandoned partly because it offended the big marketmaking firms.
Tensions between them and the stock exchange's management also led to a row
over whether the exchange could be trusted to deliver its next big computer
project, rebuilding the Seaq trading system.
When City figures discuss the future of the stock exchange, the conversation
usually revolves around these unique local issues. But the biggest challenge
it faces is the problem it has in common with the rest of the world's stock
market bodies: the commercial threat from rival trading systems.
In London, these competitors include Reuters' Instinet system, Tradepoint
and Posit, all offering investors or marketmakers an alternative price
display mechanism.
It is the threat they pose that is the real issue at stake in the debate
over the future of the London Stock Exchange. And the exchange knows it.
Its counter-attack has already started. 'Those who provide marketplaces
ought to have regulatory obligations,' says Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman
of the stock exchange. The emerging competitors, Sir Andrew argues, could
not operate without the stock exchange's presence as the central bulletin
board for posting prices, and without its role as a reg-ulator. 'These
exchanges can't operate without a price formation system. They are
parasitic,' he says.
The stock exchange has asked the Securities and Investments Board to review
the regulatory oversight it gives to all exchanges operating in the UK. Sir
Andrew argues that the London Stock Exchange cannot compete on the same
commercial basis as the newcomers because they do not have the regulatory
duties, such as surveillance and maintenance of listing requirements, that
it has.
What particularly irks Sir Andrew is that, unlike his institution, which is
treated as a Regulated Investment Exchange under securities laws, Tradepoint
and other competitors only need to meet the much simpler requirements
applying to those defined as service companies. The stock exchange cannot
afford to have its most profitable activities 'cherry picked' by
competitors, he says.
Its complaints have not fallen on deaf ears. The SIB has appointed Mr
Jonathan Agnew, formerly chief executive of Kleinwort Benson, to prepare a
discussion docu-ment on the matter, among other issues.
So far, Sir Andrew says that the competing exchanges account for well under
5 per cent of all trading activity. But evidence from the US suggests the
London Stock Exchange is right to be worried. The New York Stock Exchange,
as of last year, found that more than a third of the trading volume in all
the stocks it lists actually occurs on a competing exchange, and its
revenues have suffered accordingly.
Like the New York Stock Exchange, the London exchange is building its case
on what it believes to be an issue of public interest: the desirability of a
unified, central marketplace for equities, rather than a proliferation of
rival markets. Only a single central market provides a guarantee that all
participants will know about - and get - the best possible price for their
share transactions.
Not everyone accepts this case. 'The exchange likes to say it is the central
marketplace for securities trading,' says one regulator. 'Arguably it does
no such thing.' Indeed, the exchange, through its Seaq International system,
is actively engaged in fragmenting the markets in other countries by
allowing marketmakers to post two-way prices there. The effect has been to
draw business away from domestic markets, particularly in Europe, and
attract the ire of local bourses. The exchange says that more than 90 per
cent of cross-border European trades are conducted on Seaq International.
'If central markets are so valuable, why are we promoting Seaq
International?' the regulator asked.
As well as issues of principle, there are also practical considerations. The
new rivals offer facilities the London exchange cannot currently match. Its
present Seaq system acts, in effect, as a bulletin board for marketmakers to
post the constantly changing prices at which they are prepared to buy and
sell securities in bulk. It is not interactive; it does not allow
marketmakers to communicate directly with each other, nor even to confirm
electronically that a bargain has been struck.
By contrast, Tradepoint, one of the exchange's emerging competitors, will
operate an order-driven system in which marketmakers or institutions will be
able to post prices anonymously. The system will be able to aggregate orders
and present them in bulk to users, and will offer automatic trade
confirmation. Mr Peter Bennett, chief executive, says that it is intended
that users will be charged roughly half of the 0.20 per cent fee now charged
on bargains effected through the stock exchange.
The growth of new technology and the growing institutionalisation of the
market mean that the bulk of the exchange's users could operate their own
mini-marketplaces from their desktops, combining feeds from several
competing trading systems.
If the stock exchange is worried about the costs of its regulatory duties,
should it not simply give them up, to compete more efficiently as a
commercial entity? That is not in anybody's interest, says Sir Andrew.
'Someone who is merely a regulator might make rules which harm the market,'
he says. And privately, exchange board members acknowledge that, without its
regulatory role, it could no longer confer such a valuable imprimatur on
companies listed on it and it would lose what is probably its most valuable
competitive advantage.
The stock exchange is getting little help from a UK government
philosophically committed to promoting competition. As a result, it has
surrendered its monopoly over the distribution of price-sensitive
information about companies it lists. Also, it has announced it will no
longer provide end-user terminals for information, in recognition of its
inability to compete commercially with other providers, such as Reuters.
The good news for the stock exchange is that, broadly speaking, its users
are emotionally committed to the maintenance of a central marketplace and
believe the exchange is the best suited to operate it. Also, they are happy
with the service it provides. Mr Geoffrey Lindey, vice-chairman of the
investment committee of the shareholders' group, the National Association of
Pension Funds, says: 'I can't think of any major change we would make.
'We don't care how the service is delivered; what we want is a well-ordered,
regulated market which provides liquidity and transparency. And liquidity is
number one.' But such satisfaction does not mean that the leading
institutional investors will never defect from the stock exchange to the new
technologies, if they perceive additional benefits to be gained there.
If this commercial challenge is the greatest long-term threat to the
exchange, the shorter-term problems loom at least as large in public
discussion.
The inability of the stock exchange to replace Mr Rawlins has given the
impression of an institution adrift. Sir Andrew is due to retire in November
1994, and leadership at the top remains a question.
When Mr Rawlins left, the exchange also abandoned his controversial vision
of the way forward for trading in London. He urged a three-tier market, with
large liquid European stocks traded using a marketmaking system in which
dealers agree to make two-way prices at all times. Large domestic stocks
would be traded in this fashion as well. Smaller stocks could be traded on
an 'order-driven' basis, where those wishing to buy or sell would post their
offers. Small illiquid stocks could be traded using a 'specialist' system
similar to that on the NYSE.
'There is no demand for the Rawlins vision,' Sir Andrew says. 'That does not
mean that 10 years from now there won't be.' But what vision the stock
exchange has of itself, as technology evolves and markets become more
international, remains unclear. Sir Andrew says the exchange's main function
is to provide a means of converting long-term savings into capital and to
help companies raise capital as cheaply as possible. That means running an
efficient and orderly market where 'we encourage investors to put up money
knowing they can get it back when they need it'.
And settlement is part of that, he says. The Bank of England is now heading
a project to produce a successor to Taurus. Sir Andrew believes that, in
spite of the Taurus debacle, the exchange should continue to have a role in
settlement, either through representation on the board of the entity that
emerges from the Bank's study or through partial ownership. Yet the Bank has
suggested there is no role for the stock exchange to play in settlements at
all.
Despite the Taurus affair, the exchange seems reluctant to give up the idea
that it should be in the business of building systems, not just operating
the commercial systems of others. Several board members revolted earlier
this year over the exchange's plans to build a successor to Seaq with the
help of Andersen Consulting. Instead, they wanted a cheaper option proposed
by Nasdaq, the US-based exchange which is also updating its technology.
Eventually, Sir Andrew, who championed the home-grown system to be known as
Seaquence, got a majority of board members to approve the home-grown system,
but not without deep misgivings on the part of several.
The new system, Sir Andrew says, will be adaptable to what may be the future
of the stock exchange: a bifurcated market with different terms and
different regulations for professional and retail investors. Privately,
several board members believe this is the route the exchange should be
pursuing. Yet it may suggest higher costs and poorer prices for retail
investors, and so may be politically unpalatable.
Amid these uncertainties, the exchange's vision of how it intends to adapt
itself to increasing competition and a technological revolution remains
unclear. If it fails to develop a coherent view of how it is to survive, it
risks the drift towards irrelevance which befell other once-glorious City
institutions, such as the discount houses, the Port of London Authority, and
Lloyd's. After all, they had walls full of portraits, too.

<TEXT>
WITH LESS than two months to go to the date almost everyone agrees must be
the ultimate deadline, the Uruguay Round multilateral trade negotiations
still look like shadow-boxing. As the talks on proposals to cut tariffs and
improve market access rumble on in Geneva, the heavyweight pugilists - the
US in one corner, Europe in the other - hover at the edge of the ring,
withholding their serious punches until just before the final bell on
December 15, when President Bill Clinton's 'fast-track' negotiating mandate
from Congress expires. Given the rising political heat on both sides, the
risk remains that the last bout will come too late to save the round from
collapse, with grave consequences not only for global free trade but also
for the future of the EC and of transatlantic relations.
It is hardly surprising in the circumstances that both the US and France -
the Community's main recalcitrant - are expending as much time and effort in
positioning themselves to blame the other for failure as they are putting
into substantive negotiations. France even suggested last week that some
form of interim agreement could be struck by December 15, leaving
controversial issues such as agriculture to be dealt with later. This is
even less likely to succeed than France's forlorn campaign to reopen the
Blair House farm trade accord with the US, and is so patently absurd that it
makes one wonder whether the government of Mr Edouard Balladur has a serious
strategy for escaping from the hole into which it has unnecessarily dug
itself over the Gatt. The whole point of the round is to achieve a balanced
package of agreements; any partial deal that excluded farm trade even
temporarily would have no attraction for many of the most important
potential signatories.
Regrettable posturing
Such posturing is all the more regrettable since the differences between the
US and the EC are now rather small, and the type of trade-off that will have
to be made is already evident: for example, between Europe maintaining some
restrictions on imported films and the US being permitted to preserve some
protection for its shipping industry. What is needed is the political
leadership to patch such compromises together, and the salesmanship to
trumpet them as a breakthrough.
Last summer, Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, set out a clear
timetable for resolving the remaining differences. Unfortunately, it is
already showing signs of slippage. By last Friday, for example, bilateral
negotiations on tariff levels for manufactured goods were supposed to have
been completed. Yet the US, Japan, Canada and the EC are still haggling over
the fine print of a tariff deal they supposedly struck in Tokyo last July,
and while the EC has promised to table a more generous tariff offer today,
there still seems some way to go before that will be acceptable to the US or
other trading partners.
Force the pace
On financial services, the deadline for agreement is the end of this month,
but there too success is far from assured, with east Asian countries
continuing to resist US pressure to open their markets. Formal negotiations
on market access in agriculture - a separate issue from those covered by
Blair House and a potential key to overcoming French recalcitrance - have
yet to begin.
All this matters deeply. It is essential for a successful conclusion to the
Round that rapid progress be achieved on these issues, both for its own sake
and to force the pace on farm trade. Only when the US, EC and other parties
have reached sufficient agreement in a sufficient range of other areas will
they be in a position to grapple plausibly with this problem.
At that point, Mr Balladur will need a ladder to climb down, and it will be
for his European partners to provide it - by warning France of the
consequences for the Community and in particular for Franco-German relations
if he fails to sign, and probably by furnishing further assistance for
French farmers from the EC budget. Faced with such sticks and carrots, it is
hard to believe that France would fail to grasp the wider benefits of a
Uruguay Round accord. It is in all the parties' interests to ensure that
this moment of truth is not much longer delayed.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: UK too zealous on safety regulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DARYL JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I see that Mr John Rimington, the director-general of the Health and
Safety Executive, is still referring to EC legislation as being
'unnecessarily prescriptive' (Letters, October 13).
I did an analysis of the Health and Safety Commission's 'six-pack'
regulations and the original six EC directives. I found that the UK was
over-zealous in its interpretations of EC directives.
For example, the Council directive on the minimum safety and health
requirements for work with display screen equipment (90/270/EEC) is only
five pages in length, including annexes. However, the UK regulation - Health
and Safety (Display Screen Equipment) Regulations 1992 - is 33 pages long.
Another five regulations put out by the HSC are equally prolix.
If Mr Rimington refers to the Department of Trade and Industry scrutiny team
report on the 'Review of the Implementation and Enforcement of EC Law in the
UK', he will see that health and safety issues are already under review
owing to unnecessary over-regulation, especially of small and medium-sized
businesses - the life blood of Britain's economy.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Tactics for smooth touchdown: Boeing's efforts to ride out
the downturn in the new aircraft market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The problems facing Boeing, the world's largest manufacturer of airliners,
are as big as its jumbo jets.
Although the company celebrated a landmark last week by delivering to
Singapore Airlines the 1,000th 747 jumbo to be built, so far this year it
has failed to win a single order for this, the biggest and most profitable
aircraft in its product range.
Mr Philip Condit, Boeing's president, says there are some 'faint positive
signs' in the market, but he does not expect any swift, sustained recovery
in new aircraft orders. 'I'm not holding my breath,' he adds.
The situation at Boeing's 1,000-acre facility at Everett, outside Seattle,
the world's largest manufacturing plant, illustrates the company's
predicament. Boeing has spent Dollars 2bn in the past two years expanding
its plant to start producing the 777, its new wide-bodied airliner. This has
increased production capacity at the plant - which already employs about
27,000 people and also assembles the 747 and 767 - from 14 to 21 aircraft a
month. At best, next year Everett will be turning out only nine of these
wide-bodied aircraft models a month.
The recession and financial turmoil in the airline industry have forced
Boeing to cut production rates for its entire family of airliners -
including the narrow-bodied 737 and 757, built at Renton, Seattle - from a
peak of 39 1/2 aircraft a month to 21 in the past 18 months.
The dearth of orders means production of the 747 alone has fallen from seven
aircraft a month to four a month and will drop to three in January. It could
fall still further, and the company will probably have to shut one of its
two 747 assembly lines next year.
At Everett alone, there are some Dollars 4bn worth of stocks. 'It's a hell
of an investment if you are not using it,' says another Boeing executive.
The company's problems have increased as a result of growing competition
from the European Airbus consortium. Boeing has responded by developing new
products to compete against the European group in one of the deepest
cyclical downturns in the industry's history.
Apart from the 777, which challenges the Airbus A330 and A340, Boeing is
planning a new family of 737 airliners to defend its position against the
A320 in the 150-seater airliner market. It is also developing a cargo
version of the 767.
This has pushed up research and development spending to about Dollars 1.7bn
this year, while new aircraft deliveries to customers have fallen from 446
last year to about 350 this year, and will fall further, perhaps to about
258, next year.
But Mr Condit, a 52-year-old engineer who joined Boeing 28 years ago and
worked his way up the ladder, becoming president last year, says he has seen
it all before. 'We were down to 1 1/2 747s a month in the mid-1970s and down
to two a month in the mid-1980s, when we could have built up to seven a
month,' he says.
Boeing, says Mr Condit - widely tipped to take over eventually from Mr Frank
Shrontz, Boeing's chairman - is also responding to market pressures by
radically changing the way it does business. 'What we are doing is the
re-engineering of Boeing,' he says.
In the past, Boeing was an engineering-led company with technology driving
its product strategy. Today, the company wants to be a market-driven company
with customer requirements dictating product strategy.
'We are now adopting a very strong customer focus to provide our customers
with value for money and speed in the way we respond to their needs,' Mr
Condit says, adding that in the competitive aviation business 'the race goes
to the one who keeps running'.
At all costs, Mr Condit wants to avoid the mistakes of the big US car
manufacturers. 'The US car companies spent a lot of time watching each other
and forgot to watch the customer. The result was to let the Japanese come in
and change the character of the US car industry,' he says, implying Boeing
will not make the same error with its European competitor.
Mr Condit's model is General Electric, the US conglomerate which has become
a growing force in the commercial aerospace business after its rescue of
GPA, the troubled Irish aircraft leasing company.
'GE has done well in recognising they needed to focus on customers, value
and speed of reaction,' says Mr Condit, who visited GE in August with other
senior Boeing executives.
The clearest sign of restructuring at Boeing is the depth of job cuts the
company has made to adapt employment to lower production levels. From a peak
of 148,672 employees in November 1989, the workforce is expected to fall to
about 116,000 by the end of this year.
But the company has managed to mitigate some of the shock of the
restructuring programme by slowing down its reduction of the huge backlog of
firm aircraft orders, which totalled Dollars 80.8bn at the end of June. 'In
the current cycle we did not increase our production rate as fast as we did
two decades ago. In the 1970s we worked off our backlog too fast, and when
the market stopped we fell off a cliff,' Mr Condit explains.
The drive to hold down costs and improve productivity has enabled Boeing to
maintain operating profit margins on commercial aircraft programmes despite
a reduction in output. The company, which has seen aircraft leasing and
financial support to customers increase sharply in the current downturn,
believes its restructuring efforts will help it exploit the next growth
cycle.
Operating profit margins have improved in Boeing's defence and space
business, which accounts for about 20 per cent of group sales. A few years
ago, Boeing considered moving out of the defence business, but Mr Condit now
sees good potential for the company in this sector.
With few indications of any short-term recovery in the commercial aircraft
market, Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas are chasing the last big
airliner order in the current cycle: for up to 60 aircraft worth about
Dollars 6bn from Saudia, the Saudi Arabian carrier.
Competition for the deal has led to a revival in the trade dispute between
the US and Europe over government subsidies for Airbus. But Mr Condit plays
down the issue, insisting 'trade wars are not beneficial to either side'.
He confirms Boeing is 'really interested' in working with the four Airbus
partners - Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace, British Aerospace and
Casa of Spain - on a new 600-800 seater super-jumbo.
But, while evaluating the market for what it calls a Very Large Capacity
Aircraft (VLCA) with the European companies, Boeing has, alone, been
considering a stretched derivative of the 747: it will be about 20 per cent
longer with two decks running the full length of the fuselage.
Mr Condit does not expect either programme to be launched before the next
century. Overcapacity in the airline market continues: about 1,000 new
aircraft lie idle in the Californian desert; the 747 and the new 777 already
provide aircraft with 400 seats or more; and a version of the 747 used on
some Japanese routes can carry 550 passengers.
The last thing Boeing wants is another costly development programme when
orders are falling and it is already having to spend heavily on other
aircraft projects. But the company is determined to defend its 60 per cent
share of the world airliner market and its monopoly in the jumbo sector.
The aerospace industry does not expect a rebound in commercial aircraft
ordering until 1995 or even 1996. Mr Condit says he is not interested in
forecasts but in getting his strategy right: 'We will be focusing more than
ever on our customers' requirements, and we don't want to be left behind to
allow someone else in.'

FT  18 OCT 93 / An inflation target is not enough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Can the level and amount of spending in an economy or group of economies be
so low as to lead to unnecessary unemployment and recession? Keynes gave a
resounding 'yes' to this question. The mistake made by post-war governments
that tried to follow his teachings was to suppose that monetary and fiscal
policy could be determined solely with an eye to output and jobs, without
taking prices into account - other than by controls or by jawboning. The
result was that inflation took off and one government after another found
its policies derailed. (It is sad that Michael Stewart cannot see this in
his new Penguin polemic, Keynes in the 1990s.)
The result was that by the end of the 1970s most countries were trying to
return to some sort of sound money policy. This was very necessary. What was
unfortunate was that they did not stop at throwing away the inflationary
bathwater; they threw away the commonsense baby as well. For it remains true
that total spending in an economy can be too low as well as too high.
British sound money policies took the form first of monetary targets and
then of exchange rate objectives, culminating in ERM membership. After both
these gods failed, the government announced an inflation target of 1 to 4
per cent, with the hope of eventually reaching the lower half of the range,
as its only macroeconomic goal. Most commentators were so relieved that
something had been saved from the wreckage that they did not realise that an
inflation target on its own was a retrograde step, which did indeed risk
throwing out the baby of sensible demand management with the bathwater of
inflationary finance.
Yet there were a few voices who had all along urged a form of demand
management that was in keeping with sound money, but also provided a safety
net against unnecessary recession. The headline of this policy had the
jargon-sounding name of Nominal GDP - a national cash-flow objective might
be a good translation. All it means is that governments and central banks
should try to maintain a level of spending low enough to prevent an
inflationary take-off, but high enough to secure adequate growth when pay
and prices are sufficiently restrained.
Interestingly enough, the original monetary targets, if they had worked,
would have been more helpful here than the new direct targets for inflation.
Monetary targets were supposed to stabilise a quantity known as PT, the
price level times the volume of current transactions. So once a tight money
policy had done its job of squeezing out inflation, P would fall, T would
rise, and output would automatically recover.
A price target on its own, however, contains no such safety net. If real
output were to fall by 10 per cent and inflation remained at 1 per cent,
everything would seem to be fine except for the blood on the streets.
The chart shows that these are far from hypothetical reflections. There is
no mistaking the trend. In the first couple of years of the Thatcher
government Nominal GDP was still rising at double-digit rates. So although I
was not a particular fan of the 1981 Budget, which raised taxes in a
recession, there was no way in which I could support the 364 protesting
economists or the self-proclaimed 'Tory wets'.
We are now in a changed universe. On the latest estimates UK Nominal GDP is
rising by 4 per cent per annum, compared with the rate of 6 or 7 per cent
consistent with moderate recovery and low inflation. These few percentage
points of shortfall can eventually amount to hundreds of thousands of jobs.
So the UK needs a tightening of policy like it does a hole in the head. The
same applies to most other Group of Seven countries for which similar charts
can be drawn. A Nominal GDP objective is easier to achieve for the world's
leading economies in concert - which is one reason to avoiding a unilateral
slashing of interest rates by the UK.
There will be ample opportunities for a concerted approach at the proposed
G7 'employment' summit as well as the EC summit on October 29. One low-key
proposal would be to ask the - already existing - staff of the European
Monetary Institute to map out, without committing their bosses, what a
sensible path of Nominal GDP for the Community might look like and
alternative methods of achieving it. But action in the spirit of the idea is
required earlier - and was indeed called for in the IMF Economic Outlook,
although wrapped up in the verbiage of that institution.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Patent law puts EC generic drugs
companies at disadvantage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GREG PERRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article, 'Cheap drugs attract the giants' (October 12), Paul
Abrahams stated that 'generic companies have proved increasingly aggressive
in their ability to market drugs from the day of their patent expiry'.
It should be pointed out that this situation has developed in the US because
quick access to the market for generic medicines has been encouraged by law.
Moreover, US patent law is markedly different from patent laws in the
European Community, which operate against quick market access for generic
medicines.
Under US federal law generic companies are given the right to make their
lengthy research and registration work (ie pre-market preparations) during
the patent period. The right to work during the patent was given to US
generic manufacturers as 'compensation' for the patent extension given to
the US research-based companies.
In most European Community countries, the right to work during the patent
has either been judged to be illegal or remains ambiguous. Moreover, a
recent EC regulation introducing extensions for EC pharmaceutical patents
failed to provide European generic manufacturers with rights similar to
those enjoyed by US generic companies. Consequently, it can take European
generic manufacturers up to three years after patent expiry before they can
market their products.
This imbalance in European Community law has two major consequences. First,
it undermines European health policy by delaying the marketing of less
costly generic medicines. Second, it leads to the absurd situation of giving
US generic companies (whether independent or owned by one of the 'giants')
the potential to launch their drugs on the EC market before European
companies.
The situation arises because on the day of patent expiry a US company could
be in the position of having legally completed its research work in the US;
while a European company will only have just been allowed to start its
research in the EC.
Europe's generic medicines industry has requested the European Commission to
propose measures to amend this imbalance. However, the industry is still
awaiting a reply.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Rate cut not a prudent way of
offsetting VAT rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof GEOFFREY E WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The proposal that tax increases in the November Budget be offset by a
base rate reduction is gaining wide acceptance. Its attractions may seem
obvious, but there are drawbacks which have not, at least in public,
received much attention.
First the effect on prices. If the tax increase is by means of VAT, this
affects the underlying rate of inflation; in contrast, an interest rate cut
affects only the headline rate.
Second, what of the effect on demand? A tax increase may reduce demand, and
an interest rate reduction increase it. But do they do so with the same time
lags? If not, carrying out the proposal could easily lead first to slowing
the economy when it is weak, and then stimulating it when recovery is again
under way.
And third, the interest rate is used to control money growth. A cut in
interest rates will make money growth higher than it would have been, in
principle forever, until the cut is reversed.
Output will be boosted first, but subsequent inflation will be increased.
The fiscal change will have, at most, only a one-off effect on demand. Is it
prudent to neglect the longer-run effects of monetary policy? It certainly
has not been in the past.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: The meaning of independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof LUCIO IZZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your Rome correspondent goes a long way ('Easier said than done',
October 12) in trying to lend weight and dignity to grossly unfair
criticisms which have been levied against the strategy of Prof Romano Prodi,
head of Iri, for moving ahead with the Comit and Credit privatisations. I do
not see any other alternative to Prof Prodi's strategy, do you?
Let me add a comment to your correspondent's assertion that Mediobanca is
independent. Independence should not imply being unaware of conflicts of
interest. However, this is probably its interpretation of the word
independence. Indeed, once upon a time its management (incidentally, still
running the same company) was part of a young syndicate of Mediobanca
shareholders whose existence was kept secret from other shareholders.
Shameless exploitation of asymmetry of information is obviously completely
different from independence, but I am not sure Mediobanca's management is of
the same opinion, at least from what can be understood from its behaviour.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Absurd to hold banks responsible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J C MUNNERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, You reported that Mr Tim Yeo, the environment minister, is to tell
leading banks that the government believes they have financial
responsibility when lending monies to companies that pollute the environment
('Banks face liability for pollution', October 13).
This seems absurd, unethical, and inequitable. How can the lender be held
responsible if he has no control over the purpose for which the asset is
used. He may have financed it, but the lender is no more than a supplier to
the customer of money and financial services. So why not hold accountable
those others who have supplied resources, like the utilities for power and
telecommunication, for example?
The assumption of responsibility appears too obscure to be maintained, and I
guess the purpose is to effect some form of tax from the private sector. If
so, the authorities should come clean and say so.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Arts: Mitridate, re di Ponto - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This performance caused the biggest uproar I have ever witnessed at Covent
Garden, when an eagle tethered to the ground fell over and was left upside
down flapping its wings through the opera's long opening aria. A pair of
parakeets due to come on later wisely cancelled their appearance.
By and large opera does not enflame emotions in Britain. I have been in an
audience in Germany which drowned the music with whistles and football
rattles; another in Italy drove the tenor off the stage before he had a
chance to sing the top C they were convinced he did not have. British
audiences, their laudable concern for birds and animals aside, are more
tolerant and two years ago welcomed the Royal Opera's adventurous staging of
Mozart's Mitridate, re di Ponto.
That was Mozart bicentenary year, when it was even possible to stage a
14-year-old's first try at an opera seria. On stage his early works tend to
look drily conventional these days, unless the production stamps its own
personality upon them.
The Royal Opera's production team - Graham Vick (producer) and Paul Brown
(designer) - did just that. It may be that this Mitridate will eventually
come to look typical of a passing fad for designer-label minimalist staging,
but for the moment it seems fresh and striking in its simplicity, its
perspectives, above all its magnificent blend of colours - deep glowing red,
shot through with blues and piercing yellows.
Vick has accepted that in Mozart's day the performance style would have been
stylised and, shunning a straight period copy, has sought a 1990s
equivalent. The result suggests Far-Eastern ritual. Arms are delicately
suspended, hands preciously clasped, in a style which can quickly become
irritating if it is overdone. When Lillian Watson is singing with bright
spontaneity, it is no help to have her and her attendents practising
slow-motion wrist exercises.
When it matters, however, the idea is quietly set aside. The first sign of
the great operatic master Mozart was to become occurs in the scene when
Mitridate returns home from war, a foreshadowing of Idomeneo's moving
homecoming. Helped by the production's ability to set a newly serious mood,
Bruce Ford sang of the 'beloved shores' with masterful poise. Of his two
(originally castrato) sons, Ann Murray's strong Sifare was more successful
at breaking the formal mould than the soft-grained Farnace of Jochen
Kowalski.
The main newcomer to the cast was Luba Orgonasova as Aspasia. A
perfectly-formed and delicate soprano voice, an extremely able technician,
all that is known from recordings already. On stage she unfortunately
sounded small-scale and unable to stir emotions with the voice. Paul Daniel
was perhaps insufficiently strong-minded at shaping her slow music, but in
everything that was fast he proved a positive, vital Mozart conductor. This
Mitridate deserves to come back again, although next time I imagine the only
birds on display will be the vocal canaries.
Further performances until 3 November

FT  18 OCT 93 / Arts: Twyla Tharp and Dancers - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For lovers of dancing, Garnier's palace - the Paris Opera - is now the best
place in the world. Of course, the Mariinsky Theatre will always be our
holiest shrine, but French government policies have, over the past decade,
made the Opera a dance-house without rival.
This season it will offer 10 different and richly varied programmes by its
ballet troupe, plus visits by five invited companies from round the world.
That I would not give certain of them house-room does not detract from the
wisdom of the principles involved.
Last week the first visitors arrived, billed as Twyla Tharp and Dancers, but
 -with Miss Tharp obliged to stay in New York - amounting to 'and dancers',
which proved to be her newest troupe of 16 tremendous performers.
The repertory comprised seven pieces, created during the past 20 years, and
across those years Tharp has established herself as the most imaginative and
free-ranging of dance-makers.
When she started out as a choreographer in 1965, she was embroiled - but
only for a brief span - in the deadly boring fashion of the period for
're-inventing' dance. This meant inaction as action, and the inexpert as
expert. This was not for Tharp. A fireball of a dancer, she soon revealed
the quality that has since marked her every work - her fascination with
movement. She has journeyed through modern and post-modern, through jazz and
show-biz, social dance and ballet, and in her travels she has taken ideas
from each, fusing, contrasting, linking (and rejecting) elements to create a
style that has spanned most forms of theatre, and has yet retained an
integrity that comes from Tharp's devotion to movement.
It has been an education conducted in public, which has fascinated her
audiences quite as much as it has fascinated Tharp. She has asserted both
innovation and continuity, grafting popular dance onto balletic stock,
freeing movement, re-thinking it, just as she dared to combine rag-time with
Haydn in Push comes to Shove, and showed the classically sublime Baryshnikov
as the best of jazz dancers.
Her choreography, as we saw in Paris last week, acquires an exhilarating
freshness from this liberated imagination. Tharp, herself a virtuoso with a
pugnacious and Cagney-ish air to her most daring feats, loves bravura. Her
present dancers are dazzlers all, and number such artists as Stacy Caddell
and Shawn Stevens from New York City Ballet, Petter Jacobsson (lately with
the Birmingham Royal Ballet) and Jamie Bishton, a favoured Tharpian for
several years. Thursday night's programme opened with last year's Sextet, a
minor piece which toys with South American dance and the classic vocabulary.
It comes as a shot of adrenaline to alert the public to what follows.
What follows is Tharp at her most stunning: this year's re-working of the
latter part of her masterly Brahms' Paganini from 1980. Jamie Bishton is in
white; two couples are in black. Brahms' variations coruscate around them,
and the dance responds magnificently. Movement catches ideas from the score,
transforms the prodigies of the pianism into a tremendous cut and thrust
through which Bishton slides, curves, rolls and races like the world's
greatest athlete, who is also the world's greatest dancer. Long swathes of
dynamics, sudden subtle turns and curves, mark his dancing, which is
glorious. So are his companions. So is the piece.
Then to Baker's Dozen, which has always seemed to me a view of the happiest
comradeship among its cast of six couples. They dance, buoyed up on Willie
'The Lion' Smith's enchanting piano music, and in their elegant white
outfits, joking with each other in easy converse, they suggest a constant in
Tharp's work: the need to make order out of chaos or disjunction. It is a
beautiful and irresistible work, which the present cast perform
irresistibly.
One may also trace certain subliminal links with the last, and major, piece
in this programme: In the Upper Room. Tharp here offers the contrast between
ballet shoes and trainers - and all that implies of gymnastic energy set
against formal dance, between sport and art, between popular forms and
academic disciplines. Not that she belabours the point. There is a flux of
movement, almost unendurably energetic - a fact dictated by the relentless
blare and grind of a Philip Glass score: vile though I found it, Tharp gives
it theatrical sense.
Loose, grey-striped outfits reveal traces of other, red garments, and these
are equated with differences in dance style. Jamie Bishton speaks (dances)
for athleticism. Petter Jacobsson, classically dazzling, incarnates the rule
of the academy, and magnificently so. But this analogy need not be pushed
too far: Tharp's choreography justifies and illuminates both styles, and
with increasing power as the work progresses. Its finale, in which
choreography hurtles in and out of the shafts of light that are the decor -
the activity emerging from nothingness - is a masterly exposition of Tharp's
command of dance in the theatre. How long before we see Twyla Tharp and
company in London?

FT  18 OCT 93 / Arts: Machinal - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scenes of violence have been breaking out in the London theatre. There was a
gratuitous act of cannibalism in Mike Leigh's It's a Great Big Shame at the
Theatre Royal, Stratford East, last week. More understandable, because it is
an integral part of the story, is the sustained brutality in the RSC's
production of Tamburlaine the Great at the Barbican.
The most intriguing example, however, is Sophie Treadwell's Machinal which
opened on the Royal National Theatre's Lyttelton's stage on Friday.
On the face of it, this is a bold choice. Not everyone, including myself,
had heard of Ms Treadwell before. She was an American journalist, part-time
revolutionary who also wrote plays. Her dates are 1885-1970. The Mexican
revolution, in particular, had an influence on her.
Machinal, written in 1928, was her one undoubted stage success. It had a
good run in New York and was shown in capitals around the world, including
London and Moscow. If the title sounds almost as obscure as the author, it
is because it is French, meaning 'mechanical' or 'machine-like'.
And that must be one of the reasons why the National Theatre has chosen to
stage it. Rarely can the RNT's mechanical resources have been deployed so
extensively.
The director is Stephen Daldry, who used to display his technical skills at
London's tiny Gate Theatre in Notting Hill and recently showed his ability
to expand with his direction of An Inspector Calls at the National. Here he
cuts loose. From the flies to the orchestra pit, no part of the Lyttelton
stage, which turns out to be more mobile than we had previously realised, is
neglected. Whether it's tenements, offices, hospital or court, this is New
York from the top to the bottom.
The mechanical climax is the electric chair. For Machinal is based on a
murder trial which Ms Treadwell covered as a journalist. After six years of
marriage to a man she never much liked, a woman of 29, played by Fiona Shaw,
kills her husband, is convicted and sentenced to death.
Previously there has been some restraint, both in the staging and the
writing. We do not see the murder. There is a moving scene when Ms Shaw is
liberated by finding a lover (Ciaran Hinds), though it is the lover - for
reasons unexplained - who turns in the decisive evidence against her.
The trial scene, with all the workings of American law, is undeniably
effective. Yet it is to the electrocution that the production, played
without an interval, has been deliberately moving. Ms Shaw strips to put on
the death-robe with some dignity. Only when it comes to the shaving of her
hair does she protest. There is a final, not very illuminating, exchange
with her mother, then it's the chair, flashing of lights, and that's it: end
of play.
Apart from showing off the RNT's technical resources and Daldry's skills as
a director, with Ian MacNeil doing the work on the settings, there is
another perfectly good reason for the revival: namely, curiosity value. You
will not often see a piece like it.
One should be more sceptical, however, about the claims in the programme
notes that it is all very relevant to the present day when, it is said,
women are still unfairly sentenced for killing their husbands or lovers
without account being taken of how far they were provoked. As a matter of
fact, the husband in Machinal (John Woodvine) may be pretty boorish, but
he's not that bad. There's no excuse for doing him in. Take this modern
apologia in the programme with a large pinch of salt. I also wonder whether
you do counter violence by showing so much of it on stage. Some of the
directing looks obsessional. As for Machinal, it's a play without hope.
In repertory, Lyttelton Theatre, (071 928 2252)

FT  18 OCT 93 / Arts: Rebuilding of the Reichstag - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a special poignancy about the choice of a British architect to
rebuild the home of German democracy in a Berlin that is united but still
scarred by the wounds of division and war. And it is was a remarkable
achievement of Sir Norman Foster and Partners to win the contract for
rebuilding the Reichstag in the face of fierce international competition. A
small, but scarcely adequate, tribute has been mounted by the Royal Fine Art
Commission, where an exhibition of his Reichstag designs can be seen for one
week (until October 22) in the basement of No. 7 St. James's Square, London.
German patrons of architecture are used to the competition system and in
recent years it has been very successful in providing some good, and a few
excellent, contemporary buildings. The new museums in the former West
Germany offer the most varied series of examples of international patronage.
This is going to continue, with the competition for the Museum Island in
Berlin offering an extraordinary opportunity for architects to build next to
the great Altes Museum by Schinkel.
Who can ever forget the sight, even if only seen on film, of the blazing
dome of the Reichstag in 1933? Hitler was on the rise and blamed the
communists, but no one was fooled and the fire was later seen as a Nazi deed
 -the first flames of the European terror.
The Reichstag was completed in 1894 to the designs of Paul Wallot. It was
opened by the Emperor and had taken 10 years to build. With its four
pylon-like corner towers and giant portico, it had a high level of florid
pomposity about it. Inscribed with the words 'Dem Deutschen Volke', the
Reichstag has always been a powerful national symbol.
Sir Norman Foster and Partners had to cope with the highest level of
international competition and the little London exhibition shows their
winning scheme alongside the two other entries that won the first stage, the
Dutch architects, Pi de Bruijn and the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava.
The competition was held in two stages. The first stage was open to all
German architects and an invited list of some 14 internationally
distinguished practices. Three schemes were then shortlisted and the brief
was substantially revised. The winner was then chosen. Architects of the
quality of Hans Hollein, Helmut Jahn, Fumihiko Maki, Jose Rafael Moneo and
Aldo Rossi all entered impressive schemes.
German competitions also involve much public consultation and discussion. A
major colloquium was held to discuss all aspects of the competition. The
public was divided about the retention of the old Reichstag buildings.
Parliament itself only voted by a very small majority to retain the major
surviving elements of the old building.
Sir Norman Foster's first stage winning scheme was very different from the
more modest scheme that finally won. The huge and marvellous roof that was
originally planned to cover the whole old building (and a great deal more
public space) has been abandoned; the present scheme encloses all the new
uses within the framework of the old walls. Courtyards are reinstated and
the formal nature of the old building is respected.
The seating arrangement of the main parliament hall is circular, based upon
the recently completed parliament in Bonn. A great deal of work is done in
committee rooms and these active areas all have to be visible and accessible
to the public. (Much of the brief for the new parliament had to do with the
need for democracy to be seen to be at work and for the whole parliamentary
area to be public and accessible.) In Foster's scheme, the central plenary
hall is a grand but naturally lit space. Glass lifts and glass floors in
light wells will ensure sparkle and light throughout the building.
Symbolism is very important in a public building of this standing, but
current contemporary architecture does not provide a very poetic or symbolic
language. The new design which discards the giant umbrella roof will be a
measured response to the powerful presence of the retained building.
His great roof for the Reichstag did imply that there there was more to
democracy in the newly united Germany that could be encompassed by the walls
of the old Reichstag. I expect the external profile to change as the plans
grow and that he will create a wonderful and beautiful building in Berlin .

By now most of you will surely have discovered the compulsive appeal of
Cracker (ITV, 9.00).
This series about Fitz, the burly criminal psychologist (Robbie Coltrane),
has it all - a flawless script, superb acting, and fine camera-work. There
is a touch too much gore for queasy stomachs but these days that appears to
be unavoidable.
Addressing the theme of evil, Panorama; The Sinful Messiah (BBC 1, 9.30)
investigates religious guru David Koresh and his cult of the Branch
Davidians in Waco, Texas, and the siege and subsequent tragic confrontation.
Tales from Borges (BBC2, 12.00) is a season of films based on short stories
by the great Argentinian writer, Jorge Luis Borges.
Will To Win: Out Of Africa (BBC2, 7.40) looks at the sporting achievement of
countries like Kenya and Uganda.
Sporting victories give a positive image to African peoples but successful
athletes often find they have to emigrate because of government corruption
and interference in sport.

FT  18 OCT 93 / People: MacDonald to head CWS funeral services
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alexander MacDonald has been made general manager of the Co-operative
Wholesale Society funeral services group which, with a Pounds 60m annual
turnover, now claims to be the largest wholly-owned UK funeral director.
Some 640,000 funerals take place each year in the UK, 55,000 of them
conducted by the CWS funeral services group.
MacDonald, 50, had been acting general manager of the group since May,
having moved from being the group's operations manager for Scotland and
Northern Ireland.
MacDonald joined the CWS funeral services group 10 years ago on secondment
from the Industrial Society, the charitable status organisation which serves
to provide managerial expertise and advice to its membership. Before joining
CWS, MacDonald had a variety of management stints with companies including
Distillers, Courtaulds and Cape Industries.
The CWS funeral services group is based in Glasgow, which MacDonald says
reflects the historical development of the co-operative society funeral
business.
Even today, 40 per cent of the Scottish funeral business is cornered by
co-operative societies - including the CWS - compared with 25 per cent in
the rest of the UK. There are 59 co-operative societies in the UK today, 25
of which operate their own funeral businesses, independent from that of the
CWS.
MacDonald says that it is not really a macabre business but is one of the
more important service industries: 'You are providing a service to families
at a time of considerable emotional stress, and it's only through the
quality of that service that the business thrives.'

beginning of August chief executive of Dobson Park Industries, the
industrial electronics and mining group. Poulson himself was the main board
director responsible for the industrial electronics division of Dobson Park
before moving to Volex.
According to Bill Goodall, Volex chairman, Poulson is 'a good strategic
thinker'; he describes his replacement as having 'considerable UK and
overseas experience which has been both at the operational and strategic
level'.
Ken Hooper, the finance director, adds that Volex's strategy remains the
same as it had done under Poulson, but that this year was one of
consolidation and settling in the the group's recent acquisitions,
particularly Icontec and Component Manufacturing Systems in the US, and
Mayor, the 60 per cent-owned Singapore-based maker of data and power cord
assemblies. He says the Volex board had been 'disappointed' when Poulson
left, but appreciated that he had moved to a group 'five times our size'.
Before the Dobson Park post, Chapple was group director of business
development at T&amp;N, and before that spent 20 years at Varity Corporation.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GARDINER &amp; THEOBALD has started work on two schools projects with a combined
value of Pounds 6.75m.
Work involves the refurbishment and extension of University College School
in Hampstead on behalf of the school development committee. Gardiner &amp;
Theobald Management Services is acting as project manager and Gardiner &amp;
Theobald is providing cost management advice.
The school is a listed building and the project is being constructed in two
phases. Phase one involves lowering the level of the playground to create
windows for the new classrooms at basement level. A changing block and
sports hall will also be built.
Phase two provides additional classrooms, a library and a music centre.
Phase two is due to begin at Christmas. Gardiner &amp; Theobald has also been
appointed by Haberdashers Aske's Girls School in Elstree, Hertfordshire to
build a new Pounds 750,000 music and art centre.
Gary Griffiths, partner at Gardiner &amp; Theobald said: 'The development of the
design to this point involved the detailed participation of the heads of
department. The demands of the national curriculum call for additional space
and as the design shows students will soon be able to study in an atmosphere
even more suitable for excellence.'
Construction work on the project is due to start in spring next year.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Economics: French interest rates under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A POOR figure for French manufacturing output in July and August this week,
may intensify pressure on the French authorities to relax interest rates.
The decline in industrial production this year has been the fastest for 10
years, yet the government has held interest rates high to protect the value
of the franc.
Falls in the car and household goods sectors have been mainly responsible
for the sharp drop in overall output, and in recent months there have been
signs that the deterioration of the two sectors is slowing. None the less, a
poor figure will reinforce the case for monetary easing.
Similarly significant is this week's release of German money supply figures.
The consensus puts the annualised rise of M3 in September at about 7 per
cent. In August, M3 rose an annualised 7.2 per cent, boosted by the
Bundesbank's foreign exchange interventions during the European exchange
rate mechanism crisis of late July. Since then, the central bank appears to
have made good progress in sterilising inflows of D-Marks by keeping
liquidity tight. Many analysts believe M3 will come back towards the upper
end of its 4.5 to 6.5 per cent target range by the end of the year.
Other highlights of the week follow. Figures in brackets are the median of
forecasts from City economists compiled by MMS International, the financial
information company.
Today: Japan, August industrial production, shipments; September trade
balance (Dollars 12bn surplus).
UK, Parliament returns from summer recess; CBI monthly distributive trades
survey; September PSBR (Pounds 5.3bn).
Canada, August manufacturing new orders (up 1.5 per cent), manufacturing
shipments (up 1.8 per cent), building permits (down 1.9 per cent).
Australia, August housing (down 5.25 per cent).
Sweden, September unemployment rate (9.6 per cent).
Belgium, national bank governor presents report on social pact.
Portugal, Leon Brittan talks on trade links between Europe and US in light
of GATT trade talks.
Tomorrow: US, Greenspan and FOMC voting members testify before House Banking
on Fed accountability; September housing starts (1.3m), building permits;
September Johnson Redbook week ending October 16.
Japan, September money supply M2+CD (up 2 per cent on year), broad
liquidity.
Germany, Bundesbank October monthly report released.
UK, Chancellor speaks at annual conference of National Housing and Town
Planning Council in Brighton.
Sweden, September trade balance (SKr3.7bn surplus).
Wednesday: France, July/ August industrial production (down 0.1 per cent on
month, down 4.1 per cent on year).

year), M4 (up 0.3 per cent on month, up 4.1 per cent on year), M4 lending

Results due
ON MONDAY, Farnell Electronics, the Harrogate-based electronic components
and equipment manufacturer and distributor, is expected to report interim
pre-tax profits of about Pounds 18.5m, against Pounds 15.4m before
exceptionals a year ago. The results will be the first for Mr Howard
Poulson, Farnell's new chief executive, who arrived in August from Volex.
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare group, reports
third-quarter profits on Tuesday. Analysts expect pre-tax profits of about
Pounds 300m, up 12 per cent on the Pounds 267m of the same period last year.
The results will reflect the sale of consumer products to Sara Lee and
restructuring charges. Underlying pharmaceuticals growth is expected at
between 8 and 10 per cent, but analysts will be looking at the impact of
reforms in Italy and Germany.
Also on Tuesday, Wolseley, the heating and plumbing distributor, is expected
to report preliminary pre-tax profits of about Pounds 110m for the year to
end July 31, up from Pounds 91.3m last year - a figure which surprised
analysts who had been expecting Pounds 70m.
Smiths Industries, the aerospace and specialist engineering group, is likely
on Wednesday to report annual profits only marginally increased from last
year's total of Pounds 102m. Once again, delays in defence procurement and
reductions in civilian aircraft programmes will be partly offset by the
strength of the group's medical products side.
Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution group, is expected on
Thursday to report a drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 48m (Pounds 52m) in
the year to August. Mr Stephen Walls replaced the group's founder, Mr Tony
Millar, as chairman last year after a traumatic year for the former stock
market favourite.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Management: When it's all in the name - Tips From The Top /
Clive Thompson, chief executive of Rentokil, offers advice on commissioning
a new corporate identity
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BY CLIVE THOMPSON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
I have often said that if I had to choose a company name today I would not
choose the name Rentokil. It is doubtful whether anyone in this
environmentally aware age would be brave enough to select a company with the
name 'Rent to Kill', let alone hope to become the world's largest provider
of tropical plants or develop flourishing healthcare and medical services
businesses.
Indeed one top design company (which we didn't employ) said that a change of
name was essential. But there is no doubt that names can be either silly or
apparently inappropriate and still remain world famous and popular. Have you
ever stopped to think about the food range called 'Birds Eye' or the
detergent called 'Fairy Liquid'?
There is no doubt that some names achieve that elite status which transcends
literal interpretation, and Rentokil in the UK, if not everywhere, has
achieved this level. Experts believe it can take up to 30 years, and even
after this time only a few companies ever achieve it.
So in commissioning a new corporate identity we applied one rule - no name
change.
In drawing up a brief we first had to be brutally honest in accepting the
weaknesses of the existing identity. Two harsh realities emerged: the
letters were heavy, awkward and old fashioned - someone rudely likened them
to the flared trousers of the 1970s; the reversing out of a red block gave a
tabloid newspaper feel and seemed to lack quality.
It is amazing how much difference type faces and letter styles can make. We
asked the designers to incorporate the fact that we are a company with many
different services. Each business was to be represented by a symbol, but
however hard you try it is difficult to find good symbols for all of our
services.
We gave up on this in favour of a modern, friendly, up-beat feel but we just
ended up resembling retail-type corporate identities.
We decided to explore other ideas. We thought that maybe a change from blood
red for Rentokil might be timely, and we considered a variety of different
colours. However, we eventually concluded that too much had been invested
over many years in Rentokil red and we didn't feel comfortable with any
other colours.
All this made us realise that we were after evolution not revolution, and we
searched for our core values. From this heart searching the words 'modern'
and 'quality' emerged, along with a very strong allegiance to the royal
warrant. We dropped all the other ideas in favour of these images and the
result suddenly began to appear before us.
We recognised evolution as the solution and that the strengths of our past
had to be continued, but with a fresher, smarter feel. The result was the
inclusion of the royal warrant, since we believe it is probably the best
recognised symbol of quality in the world, alongside the word Rentokil with
crisper, modern letters in an even stronger red.
We had originally expressed frustration at the number of occasions when
Rentokil was broken into the three words Rent-to-kill, so the designers
recommended an underline below the word to encourage the eye to read it as
one word.
A thinner red stripe than previously was then added on the same white
vehicles, with the addition of a black trim at the height of the bumper to
give extra visual weight.
The result is that the new design has a modern, quality feel which the old
design did not; at the same time the new one has enough resemblance to the
old logo to be clearly evolved from it.
In the end, with 18 months of sometimes hard and frustrating work, the
result was almost an anti-climax. We wondered: 'Is it really different
enough to reflect all that effort and money?'
The answer is a confident 'yes'. We learnt, like many others, that in the
end the right answer is the one that feels right for you, and it is amazing
how dated our old logo now appears.
Next Monday: Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy of Kingfisher on how to decide which
charities to support.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Management: Russian ups and downs / A look at Otis's joint
ventures in the former Soviet Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Russia may have its political problems, but there is no denying the
engineering skills of its workers, according to Rudolf Kunert, senior
vice-president at Otis Elevator International.
'They even found mistakes in our drawings - that shows how good they are,'
says Kunert of some of the liftmaker's new partners in its four Russian and
one Ukrainian joint ventures.
Assessing the skills of Russian workers is just one of many management tasks
facing a western company planning to move into the former Soviet Union.
Otis, part of United Technologies, is well ahead of the game - its ventures,
one of which started as early as 1990, already employ about 14,000.
The scale and breadth of these operations means that the company's
experiences in the former Soviet Union have a relevance that goes beyond the
lift industry.
Between them, the ventures - Shcherbinka Otis Lift near Moscow, Otis St
Petersburg, Rus Otis, Mos Otis and UKR Otis in Kiev - are doing everything
from manufacturing lifts and spare parts to servicing and refurbishing old
Soviet-designed lifts in provincial cities.
There is manufacturing on greenfield sites, as well as in existing factories
that have become part of a joint venture.
Otis first developed a presence in the former Soviet Union in 1990 when it
formed Shcherbinka Otis Lift with what was then a unit of the national
liftmaking agency. By 1991, it had two joint ventures, and was looking to
expand its presence, based on the vast market it saw for new lifts, and
refurbishing and servicing of existing lifts in apartment blocks, hospitals
and small offices.
Otis's thinking was that it was less likely to be affected by political
upheavals than companies selling less humdrum products. As George David,
then Otis chairman and chief executive, said in 1991: 'There are lots of
national events . . . but meanwhile people eat, sleep and ride in
elevators.'
This strategy remained intact through the failed coup of summer 1991, the
collapse of the old Soviet Union, and the recent upheaval in Russia
culminating in President Boris Yeltsin's bloody victory over rebel
parliamentarians.
The overriding messages to come out of Otis's experience are the importance
of recognising both the similarities and differences between western and
former Soviet workers, markets and customers and of being patient, rather
than trying to force the pace of change.
Otis did not see why it should treat Russia differently from other markets
in requiring the specialised approach to manufacturing that has been common
for two or three decades in the west. Having made commitments to invest in
Kiev, St Petersburg and Moscow, it wanted to avoid repetition, says Kunert.
Consequently, lifts are being put together in St Petersburg from electronic
parts made there, from driving machines made in Moscow and doors and other
parts produced in Kiev.
This is an alien concept for most of Russian industry, whose factories are
used to making everything themselves. Consequently, results cannot be
achieved overnight.
Now Otis has reached the point, says Kunert, where 'there's something real
and tangible at all five of the ventures.' At Shcherbinka, for example, the
first lift driving machine passed its quality test only a few weeks ago.
There are several reasons why western investors should have a realistic
timetable. Organising supplies of materials and components is difficult
because there are so few specialised subcontractors in Russia. 'The
factories have capacity, but don't have the ability to sell their capacity,'
says Kunert.
Producing the right mix of local and western skills in the joint ventures
also takes time. According to George Channin, Otis' area director for
eastern Europe, the Russians' engineering, scientific and maintenance skills
were excellent and thus the transfer of western technology into the ventures
went relatively smoothly.
'But people with skill weren't always provided with the right tools,' he
says. 'The skills gap is greatest in management, sales and marketing and
accounting.'
The Otis approach has been to appoint a general manager for each venture
from the staff of the local partner, and typically to have three expatriate
executives. These would be a financial expert, a generalist who can work
alongside the general manager and help with sales and marketing, and then -
depending on whether it is a manufacturing or service joint venture - a
technical or a marketing development expert. The 'twin concept', where the
Russian executives works with a partner/teacher, is also used. In one of the
companies, for example, there are two financial managers, one expatriate and
one Russian.
According to Kunert, expatriates are especially needed to help set up an
organisation that goes out to sell to the customer. 'In the past, having
something to distribute was a privilege - 'If you are nice to me, we'll give
you something' was the rule,' he says.
It clearly helps if western companies can draw on experience gained in other
parts of the world, where at least some of the circumstances may have been
similar. To help the joint ventures cope with inflation, for example, Otis
has brought in one of its expatriate financial managers from Latin America.
The pattern, says Channin, is for Otis to start reducing the expatriate team
at the end of the second year; in the longer term, he would expect each
venture to have only one foreign executive.
Already, there are encouraging signs indicating how the joint ventures are
coming of age. Kunert recalls how, in the early stages, Russian managers
were very keen to come to the west on training courses. 'Now they are saying
'Please don't put us on too many training courses, we also have to do our
job here'.' This self-sufficiency is being stimulated in turn by Otis. 'We
were a little gentle in the first year or two,' says Channin, 'but now the
local manager is responsible for the training costs and travel expenses in
his business plan, so he is more conscious of the costs and benefits, and
making decisions accordingly.'
Sometimes the similarities between the west and the former Soviet Union are
stronger than the differences. The first priority of customers outside the
big cities is still to ensure that Otis can deliver on time, and after that
they discuss the price. But you might find a similar attitude in a small
town in northern Canada, says Channin.
As for the lift industry people, you could put them in a room with their
western counterparts and they would share the same concerns, says Channin.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Strange brews herald a real ale renaissance: The changing
tastes of beer drinkers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is fast rediscovering a taste for real ale. Around the country
traditional brews with such thirst-satisfying names as Hop Back Summer
Lightning, Malton Old Bob, Oakhill Black Magic, and Felinfoel Double Dragon,
roll off the tongue in increasing numbers.
The Good Beer Guide, published today by the Campaign For Real Ale, says
there are more than 1,000 real ales on the market.
While the big brewers forecast more brewery closures, and some regionals
have quit the industry to become pub retailers, the revival of
cask-conditioned beers has encouraged a surge in micro-brewers.
More than 50 new brewers have come into the industry in the past couple of
years - an increase of more than 30 per cent in the numbers of independent
real ale suppliers.
Commercial brewing is returning to towns where the occupation had long been
abandoned. Beer is being made in Tring, Hertfordshire, and Lichfield,
Staffordshire, for the first time for 60 years. Casks of beer are rolling
out of the most unlikely places: former cowsheds in Devon, an old foundry in
Lancashire and a disused sawmill in Hereford.
The new brewers include several landlords who started producing beers for
sale in their own bars. Many supply 50 to 100 pubs in their localities.
The real ale renaissance is being driven by changing consumer tastes.
'British drinkers are undoubtedly undergoing a conversion,' says Mr Jeff
Evans, editor of the Good Beer Guide. 'Whereas fizzy, processed keg beers
and lagers have dominated the pub market for the last 20 years, drinkers are
now trading up to beers full of flavour and character. Keg beer is fading
fast and lager is past its peak.'
Camra's campaign to preserve the regional variety of traditional ales has
been helped by the freeing of thousands of pubs from their ties with
national brewers. Pub landlords could thus shop around for their beers.
As drinkers began to turn to real ales, the big brewers reinforced the trend
with increased spending on advertising their own brands of cask-conditioned
beers.
The result is that production of distinctive styles of beer, from the malty
brews of the Midlands to the fruity ales of East Anglia, is flourishing.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Recovery indicator falters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE financial health of British industry is showing renewed signs of
weakness, says a leading firm of risk assessors, Tony Jackson writes.
The setback adds to concerns about the strength of the economic recovery
raised by recent official statistics.
Syspas, the London-based consultants, said there was a sharp deterioration
in the position of quoted industrial companies in the three months to the
end of August.
The Syspas method is based on analysing published accounts to establish the
risk of financial failure. It first gave warning of recession at the start
of 1989. It first signalled recovery at the end of last year. The position
then remained static until the latest deterioration.
Mr Guenter Steinitz, Syspas's chief executive, said the distribution sector
and smaller unquoted companies continued to show improvement.
This was consistent with recent statistics showing growth in retail sales
and a reduction in the level of bankruptcies, which tend to be concentrated
among small companies.
'The same improvement has not been seen in the major industrial sector,' he
said.

FT  18 OCT 93 / CBI hits at EC 'tide of rules'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry has stepped up its opposition to 'the
tide of increasing EC regulation' which it says is seriously damaging
European competitiveness.
In its response to the European Commission's policy paper Growth,
Competitiveness and Employment, the CBI today calls for a package of
measures to improve European economic performance in the face of increasing
competition from newly industrialised countries.
Publication of the CBI's views follows last week's success by the British
government in winning a six-year opt-out from EC legislation intended to
protect young people at work. Ministers afterwards predicted the move could
encourage multinational companies to relocate European operations in the UK.
The CBI says EC policy initiatives must not be allowed to make Europe less
competitive by adding burdens on employers. EC regulations, it adds, should
aim at simplifying procedures and reducing compliance costs.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, calls on the commission to 'change
the way it sees the world'. He says that, despite the policy paper, his
organisation remains to be convinced that there has been a change of heart
in Brussels.
Mr Davies adds: 'The latest noises on social policy suggest that there has
not. That is why we are setting out clearly the scale of the problem.'
The CBI's response to the commission's paper, contained in a memorandum
which has been sent to Mr Jacques Delors, commission president, stresses
that the EC has lost a fifth of its share of world trade since 1980.
It claims that the position will continue to deteriorate without action to
reduce costs and bureaucracy.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Managers say recession still on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR managers believe that Britain's recession is not over, an Institute
of Management survey says today. It indicates that most managers do not
believe the recession will end next year.
'This is a disturbing survey,' Mr Roger Young, institute director-general,
said yesterday. 'It shows that managers have not registered recovery despite
the government's claims.'
As many as three out of four managers in the survey of 600 said they did not
believe the recession would end in 1994 while only 3 per cent said it would
be over by December this year. Sixty per cent added that they thought
Britain would dip into further recession during the course of next year.
While 60 per cent of the sample said they had cut jobs, 41 per cent added
they were giving top priority to keeping down the number of workers they
employed. Senior managers laid the blame for Britain's continuing economic
troubles on government policy while on in three blamed the banks, 14 per
cent the European Community and 4 per cent the unions.
Meanwhile, Unison, the public service union, said yesterday that its latest
Jobwatch survey suggested that as many as 20,000 jobs were at risk in the
health service and local government. 'All the signs are that the
government's much-vaunted myth of recovery has evaporated into thin air,'
said Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary.
A sharp decline in exports caused almost entirely by the downturn in
continental Europe has been offset by improving home markets, says a survey
of the third quarter of the year by the nine north-west England chambers of
commerce, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes.
The chambers warn, however, that any recovery is 'still quite delicate' and
next month's Budget must support it by avoiding 'any measures which might
put further economic improvement at risk'.
The fragility of the upturn is shown by the fact that only about 20 per cent
of companies are working at full capacity, the survey of 641 companies says.
The proportion of those working at three-quarters capacity improved, but
only from 74 per cent to 76 per cent.
With so much capacity to spare, the bulk of companies have little appetite
for investment, although there has been a steady upward trend in the last
four quarters from a low base. The balance of manufacturing investment - the
difference between companies increasing and those decreasing spending - was
22 per cent compared with 8 per cent a year ago. Trends in recruitment
showed a slow but steady pick-up in manufacturing in the third quarter.
Although the balance figure of manufacturers recruiting more staff was only
11 per cent, it is the third positive figure in a row after nine quarters of
net labour-shedding between 1990 and the beginning of this year.
Recruitment in the service sector produced a positive balance figure of 18
per cent from 11 per cent in the first and second quarters and 4 per cent in
the last quarter of 1992.
Optimism is increasing among companies in southern England, but their
counterparts in the north and Midlands are less hopeful, a survey released
today says.
Sixty per cent of companies in the south expect sales to increase over the
next three months compared with 53 per cent in the Midlands and 49 per cent
in the north, according to an Enterprise Barometer survey released by 3i,
the venture capital group.

The CBI points to rapidly rising labour and non-wage costs in Europe and
emphasises that productivity growth has been inferior to that of
competitors. It says that high public spending and taxation within the EC
have inhibited the community's ability to respond effectively to
competition.
The memorandum demands further development of the single market and adds
that all EC governments should set a long-term goal of cutting public
spending to less than 40 per cent of gross domestic product.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Tradition revived in W Sussex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REAL ALE enthusiasts Mr Stephen Lowson and Mr John Ryan have revived the
brewing tradition in Arundel, the picturesque West Sussex town, Philip
Rawstorne writes.
In 1992, 50 years after the closure of Arundel's last brewery, they started
commercial beer production at a site on a nearby industrial estate.
Mr Lowson says: 'Demand for real ale was growing, but nobody was making a
local brew. We saw the opportunity to get into a niche market and took it.'
They bought their equipment second-hand from a northern brewer. 'But
starting up was quite expensive,' Mr Lowson says. 'We spent Pounds 30,000 on
600 casks alone.' But he adds, 'We are now operating at about 75 per cent of
capacity, producing about 400 gallons a day, and supplying about 60 pubs in
the area.' The partners are now expanding into pub ownership.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Chambers reject BES abolition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE

<TEXT>
THE Business Expansion Scheme should be replaced, the British Chambers of
Commerce says today in its Budget submission to the chancellor.
The chambers accept that the 10-year-old scheme has offered 'little help for
potential start-up businesses'. But rather than being abolished with no
replacement - as the government intends - there should be new arrangements
which help to stimulate interest among small investors.
Chambers of commerce representatives will meet Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial
secretary to the Treasury, tomorrow and stress the need for next month's
Budget to demonstrate support for the small business sector.
The chambers' other specific proposals include improving the loan guarantee
scheme, lowering export guarantee scheme premiums and freezing mortgage tax
relief and personal allowances as part of the drive to control public
expenditure.
Its Budget submission argues that if value added tax is introduced on items
currently zero-rated, the change should be phased in. However, Ms Harriet
Harman, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, warned yesterday that the
extension of VAT would cost many thousands of jobs.
She said research showed that 22,000 jobs would disappear in the road
transport industry if VAT were imposed at the full 17.5 per cent rate, and
20,000 in printing and publishing. 'The gain to the Treasury from the
extension of VAT could be wiped out by the wider damage caused to the
economy,' she said.
The Catholic Housing Aid Society says in its Budget submission that mortgage
interest relief should be withdrawn from April 1995.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Rail privatisation proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Ulster Unionist party last night signalled that the government would
have to work hard to secure its MPs' help in shepherding rail privatisation
proposals through the Commons, David Owen writes.
Mr William Ross, the party's chief whip, said it had 'quite a number of
concerns' about the bill, although it was too early to say how the nine UUP
MPs would vote. He said the party was concerned about the possible
consequences if British Rail were prevented from bidding against the private
sector for franchises to operate passenger services. If BR were not allowed
to bid, it might open the door for 'some outsider', he said.
Ministers are considering how to respond to the threat of a backbench
rebellion when the bill returns to the Commons within the next four weeks
over a Lords amendment proposing BR be allowed to bid. Moderate nationalists
are now uneasy that the Unionists may be rewarded with changes such as a
cross-party Westminster select committee on Northern Ireland.
Mr John Major's speech at this month's Conservative party conference did
nothing to dispel these fears, with its strong emphasis on the government's
commitment to keeping Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom.

NCM, the Dutch insurance group that acquired the Export Credit Guarantee
Department's short-term credit insurance business after it was privatised in
1991, wants 70 of its 550-strong workforce in Britain to take early
retirement.
Mr Bryn Halliwell, negotiator for the civil service union CPSA, said: 'NCM
have been very good employers but it shows how the recession is biting now.'
He did not believe the company would have much trouble finding volunteers to
leave. 'The package being negotiated is very generous,' Mr Halliwell said.
'On average, staff can expect to secure three years' salary for going early.
NCM has put Pounds 1m on one side to finance this.'

FT  18 OCT 93 / 11 1/2 years not for turning into only 900 pages of memoirs:
Malcolm Rutherford finds omissions in Thatcher's book, which is published
today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOWNING STREET YEARS By Margaret Thatcher HarperCollins, Pounds 25, 914
pages
MARGARET THATCHER is a born-again Conservative in the same way that some
people are born-again Christians. She was converted by Lord Joseph, who told
her around 1974 that he had only recently become a Conservative himself. For
his first 20 years in politics, many of them at the top, he had been almost
a Fabian. Mrs Thatcher then saw the light and it never left her.
One of her first acts as prime minister was to abolish the Central Policy
Review Staff, or 'think tank', because 'a government with a firm
philosophical direction' had little time for 'detached speculations'.
There is another revealing comment in the early pages of Lady Thatcher's
memoirs. She drew a different lesson from the second world war than many of
her contemporaries, whether British or Continental, left or right. Mrs
Thatcher concluded that the war demonstrated the need for strong
nation-states. Her hostility to the European Community was there from the
start: some of it extends to personal dislike of those who think otherwise.
Detachment is not the book's strong point. It is not meant to be a mark of
disrespect to say that the volume it most reminds one of is Harold Wilson's
memoirs of his 1964-70 premiership, though without some of Wilson's
excellent set-pieces. Lord Wilson, like Thatcher, wrote rapidly after
leaving Downing Street. The impression he left of his stewardship was of
moving from one meeting, one subject, one crisis to another. Policies were
governed by events.
Lady Thatcher likes to think it was different in her period; she has not
demonstrated it. Possibly this is because the formula of the book is wrong.
After the mildly personal introduction, she simply rattles on in more or
less chronological order - from steel strike to coal strike through whatever
happened in between. At no stage is there an attempt to step back and look
at a subject as a whole: (say) British defence policy, Ireland or education.
Education indeed is the book's biggest gap, just as it was probably her
greatest failure in office. She had after all been education secretary, her
only previous cabinet post, before she became prime minister. Better
teaching, better training was essential to everything she wanted to do to
turn Britain round in the long term. Yet in the forming of her first
cabinet, the education post is not mentioned, and it is not much thereafter,
though we learn that she did once offer it to Lord Gowrie.
There is another fault in the formula. A book of over 900 pages may seem
long. In fact, it is very short to cover 11 1/2 years in Downing Street. The
result is that practically every episode is told in truncated fashion,
frequently omitting key details such as who gave advice. Many civil
servants, to whom Lady Thatcher has reason to be grateful, receive no
mention. Thus the tone becomes one of self-vindication: the message that she
was betrayed grows stronger as the book goes on.
Not all her comments are entirely accurate. I doubt if John Moore, once an
heir-apparent, would agree with her claim that he insisted on returning to
work too early after illness. He thought he was being harried back. Sir Leon
Brittan might also complain that he has been treated less than generously.
The prime minister strongly suggested there would be an early invitation to
return to the cabinet after his resignation over the Westland affair. The
suggestion has been written out of her history.
Other omissions may stem from pressure of time. It would be good to have had
more of her impressions of foreign leaders. When they come, as on Jimmy
Carter, they can be perceptive, but are desperately short. About Giulio
Andreotti she is not only short but plain rude. The foreign hero is Ronald
Reagan, whom Lady Thatcher thinks Britain failed to appreciate, but here
again one would have liked a bit more.
Lady Thatcher has always been a better speaker than writer and naturally she
required research assistance for these memoirs. Yet there are times when her
own distinctive voice comes through. For example, when she sacked Lord
Soames from the cabinet she had the impression he 'felt the natural order of
things was being violated and he was, in effect being dismissed by his
housemaid'. On former Labour leader Michael Foot she remarks: 'If I did not
think it would offend him, I would say he was a gentleman.'
These flashes, however, are rare. Many of the most savage are reserved for
Lord Howe and, to a lesser extent, Lord Lawson towards the end of the book.
Another volume is promised on her first 50 years. It should be more
interesting because less is known about the subject. One hopes that it will
also be more relaxed and less egocentric.
Lord Howe's review of Lady Thatcher's book will appear in next Saturday's
FT.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Virgin in talks on flights from City
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIRGIN Atlantic Airways said yesterday that it is negotiating with two
airlines that want to use its name and colours to run flights from London
City Airport.
The approaches from the two unnamed airlines come after the launch earlier
this year of a Virgin service between London's Gatwick airport and Athens.
The twice-daily flights are due to transfer to Heathrow airport next month.
The service is run by South East European Airlines, a Greek carrier, which
uses the Virgin name and colours and pays a royalty on each ticket sold.
Virgin said the proposed flights from City Airport would operate on the same
basis. The companies Virgin is talking to would lease the aircraft, employ
staff and pay all operating expenses.
Virgin would train the staff and offer the companies access to its ticket
reservation service and frequent-flyer programme. Virgin sales staff would
sell tickets for the flights, and the aircraft would be painted in its
colours.
Virgin would not identify the two companies but said one was an existing
operator and the other a start-up. The flights from City Airport would be to
Ireland and continental Europe.
The company dismissed as 'rubbish' suggestions that it might take a stake in
City Airport.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Cost cuts in NHS drugs bill sought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is targeting the Pounds 3.4bn National Health Service drugs
budget in its efforts to meet public spending targets for the next three
years.
Ministers see the fast-growing NHS drugs bill as a prime area in which
further savings could be made.
The government has a manifesto commitment to raise year by year the 'level
of real resources' committed to the NHS, but ministers privately admit that
the drive to reduce the Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement
means this year's increase is likely to be small.
The government has also said that savings generated through improved
efficiency will be ploughed back into the service.
Earlier this year it offered the drugs industry a new five-year agreement on
the prices of pharmaceuticals including a 2.5 per cent cut in prices for
three years. Most drugs groups - some of which had feared price cuts of up
to 7 per cent - greeted the proposals with relief. The NHS drugs bill grew
last year by 14 per cent.
Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, yesterday accused the government
of using 'sleight of hand' to give the impression it was meeting its
election spending pledges on health.
He said the government was 'using efficiency targets as a way of introducing
cuts in the NHS, but is offering the money back as though it is additional
spending'.
He said the government was introducing an accountancy sleight of hand which
counts private-sector investment as though it were extra expenditure.
'No one should be misled into believing that the government will fulfil its
pledge to increase health service spending.'
Talks aimed at setting departmental budgets until 1996-97 are to continue
this week in the cabinet's so-called EDX committee, with ministers aiming to
propose a settlement to cabinet before the end of the month.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Prescott tipped for shadow promotion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PRESCOTT, shadow transport secretary, is being widely tipped for
promotion to an important economic portfolio after the parliamentary Labour
party's annual election of members of the shadow cabinet on Wednesday.
Mr Prescott - fifth in last year's poll - is one of a number of front-bench
spokesmen from the party's soft left who are expected to attract more
support from their fellow MPs than in the last such election in July 1992.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, and Mr David Blunkett,
shadow health secretary, are also expected to win more votes. Mr Tom Clarke,
shadow Scottish secretary, Mr Ron Davies, shadow Welsh secretary, and Mr
David Clark, shadow defence secretary, are thought the most likely to be
voted out.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, is also expected to see a
decline in her support after a lacklustre year. But she stands to benefit
from a new requirement obliging MPs to include four women in their 18
nominations, up from three last year.
The 18 MPs securing the most votes in this week's ballot are each guaranteed
a shadow cabinet place, but Mr Smith has full authority in the allocation of
portfolios.
There is greater uncertainty than usual about the election outcome because
the 69 Labour MPs who entered parliament in 1992 will for the first time be
voting after prolonged exposure to those standing.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Molyneaux says Hume-Adams initiative 'lunacy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JAMES MOLYNEAUX, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, said yesterday that
if the IRA ends its military campaign, a 'quarantine' period of 'years
rather than months' would be necessary before the party would sit at the
same table as Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA.
Speaking in a BBC interview he described as 'sheer lunacy' the Hume-Adams
peace initiative, which he said has the objective of bringing about a
British withdrawal from Northern Ireland within 25 to 30 years.
Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, who
together with Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader, launched the peace
initiative three weeks ago, said that Mr Molyneaux had missed the point of
the initiative. He said its aim was 'a total cessation of all violence . . .
Mr Adams and I have not agreed a plan to impose upon anyone. It is a peace
process which will involve both governments and all parties . . . we have no
specific proposals for a solution.'
Divisions over the peace initiative emerged within the UUP at its party
conference in Craigavon at the weekend. The most contentious question was
whether there should be talks with the government of the Irish Republic,
which is supporting the initiative.
Mr Ken Maginnis, the deputy party leader, said: 'It is important that the
unionist position is very clearly articulated. If Dick Spring (the Irish
foreign minister) is willing to hear that, we are willing to give it to him
at first hand.'
Last week the Irish Foreign Ministry said it has extended invitations to
unionist leaders for discussions and was 'very much looking forward to a
meeting'.
But Mr Molyneaux said yesterday: 'It is not the appropriate time for
face-to-face meetings with Dublin.'
He said that for now he preferred 'quiet communications' through documents
and letters, and confirmed that 'updates on our posi-tion' have been
forwarded to Dublin.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Cash mountain haunts banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds Bank, argues that something
is one of 'the biggest destroyers of shareholder value' in his bank, one
might expect him to be taking steps to get rid of it. The trouble is that
the culprit is something that most people regard as retail banks' most
staple product - cash.
Mr Pitman's remarks at a conference - held this month by De La Rue, the
banknote printers, to discuss the costs of cash - indicate the size of the
problem for banks. The associated Boston Consulting Group study estimated
that cash distribution now costs the equivalent of 25 per cent of banks'
branch network costs.
The study is the first time for 20 years that the workings of the British
cash-handling system have been exposed. The costs break down into two forms:
the physical expense of moving notes and coins around, and the interest
forgone by people, businesses and banks in holding rather than investing
cash.
Individuals' Pounds 800m cost is calculated as forgone interest on the
Pounds 10.1bn cash they hold at any one time. This Pounds 10.1bn - Pounds
460 per household - is higher than the stocks held by other participants:
businesses hold Pounds 5.1bn, while bank branches hold only Pounds 3.1bn and
building society branches a mere Pounds 300m in total.
The only way individuals could gain such interest would be not to use cash,
a distant prospect despite the growth in credit and debit cards. Those with
most steps at their disposal are the banks, which incur only Pounds 300m in
lost interest on their cash holdings but pay a further Pounds 1.9bn a year
to move cash around.
A comparison with a 1973 study by the banks' Association for Payment and
Clearing Services shows that banks have made matters worse for themselves by
increasing access to cash. Banking cash transactions per year have fallen in
value from Pounds 180bn to Pounds 120bn, yet the number has risen from 650m
to 1.6bn.
The costs are even higher in France and Germany, in the latter case probably
because there has been less expansion of the use of credit and debit cards
which have staunched some of the growth in cash in the UK. This suggests
that banks can devise ways of altering the UK system, and so reduce their
own costs.
The Boston Consulting study argues that banks can reduce costs by cutting
the number of cash withdrawals through branches, and by managing their
stocks of cash more efficiently to avoid lost interest on excess stocks. One
Spanish bank is estimated to have saved 35 per cent on cash costs by
improved management.
However, the study suggests that banks also have motives to try to develop
new means of taking cash out of the banking system. One alternative to cash
now being considered is the use of 'smart cards' that can hold a nominal
cash amount. These could be used at retailers with the appropriate counter
technology.

year, Robert Taylor writes.
This gloomy message is contained in the Institute of Management's latest
survey of managerial opinion, published today.
Mr Roger Young, the institute's director-general, yesterday said: 'It shows
that managers have not registered recovery despite the government's claims.'
As many as three out of four managers in the survey of 600 said they did not
believe the recession would end in 1994 while only 3 per cent said it would
be over by December this year.
Sixty per cent said they thought Britain would dip into further recession
during the course of next year.
While 60 per cent of the sample said they had cut jobs, 41 per cent added
they were giving top priority to keeping down the number of workers they
employed.
Unison, the public service union , said its latest jobwatch survey suggested
as many as 20,000 jobs were at risk in the health service and local
government sector.

FT  18 OCT 93 / More companies follow Cadbury guidance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES are responding to calls for improved corporate governance,
according to a survey released today by ProNed, the organisation to promote
non-executive directors.
Only 13 of the biggest 100 companies surveyed were without a remuneration
committee and 12 without an audit committee. For companies below this level,
six times as many referred in their annual reports to the formation of board
committees in 1992 as in 1991.
The survey was based on an analysis of 1991 and 1992 annual reports and
accounts from the top 350 listed companies up to the end of May 1993.
Of the companies below the top 100, the number with a remuneration committee
more than doubled to 73 per cent and those with an audit committee rose from
31 per cent to 66 per cent.
Twenty of the top 100 companies and 16 per cent of the next largest 250 have
a combined chairman and chief executive, while the number of non-executives
on boards has been growing.
The figures seem to indicate growing compliance with some of the key
recommendations of the Cadbury report on the financial aspects of corporate
governance, published last December.
Just 28 of the top 100 companies and 11 per cent of the next 250 had a
nomination committee. This runs contrary to calls by ProNed for more
impartial selection of non-executive directors.
However, Mr Colin St Johnston, ProNed's managing director, stressed that the
proportion was rising.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Abolition of pay bodies urged
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PAY REVIEW bodies and Whitley Councils, which cover workers including nurses
and teachers, should be abolished so that a truly social market can operate,
says a pamphlet published today by the Social Market Foundation, an
independent think-tank.
Despite a decade of liberalisation in the private sector the pay of 90 per
cent of public employees is still determined centrally, it says. Mr Ron
Beadle, the author, said this had prevented rewards being linked to
performance in a way that would improve public services and increase
employment.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSUMER discontent with charges for public transport, telecommunications,
water and gas has grown over the past three years, says a survey for the
National Consumer Council published today.
British Rail suffered the steepest rise in dissatisfaction since the last
survey was held in 1990, with 59 per cent of rail users describing fares as
either very or fairly unreasonable. Three years ago the figure was 47 per
cent.
In industries already privatised, dissatisfaction with pricing has risen but
to a lesser extent: from 45 per cent to 55 per cent for British
Telecommunications, from 37 to 46 per cent for water, and from 25 to 29 per
cent for gas.
Dissatisfaction with electricity prices increased only marginally, from 38
to 39 per cent.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Gas price rise may broaden market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT gas companies say British Gas's decision last week to raise
prices by as much as 12.5 per cent to some large industrial customers could
open up limited opportunities in the interruptible market, which until now
has failed to attract competitors, Robert Corzine writes.
Interruptible consumers, which typically use gas for power generation at
large industrial sites, pay low prices but risk being cut off during periods
of peak demand, when many are able temporarily to use oil or other fuels.
Kinetica, a joint venture between PowerGen and Conoco, said it 'sees some
value in the interruptible market', while United Gas, the UK arm of
Utilicorp of the US, believes 'a handful of opportunities could arise'.
The British Gas price rises range from 2.1 per cent to 12.5 per cent,
depending on the volume of gas purchased, and cover three-year to 10-year
contracts signed on or after November 2. Existing contracts or companies
seeking shorter-term arrangements will not be affected.
The independent gas companies contend that true competition in the
interruptible segment will not occur until the full domestic market is
opened up. They will need to use it as British Gas does, as a way to shift
supplies quickly to smaller commercial and residential consumers at times of
peak demand.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Thatcher wades into defence budget debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARONESS THATCHER, the former prime minister, yesterday waded into the
heated debate over the defence budget, issuing a blunt warning against
further deep cuts in spending on the eve of a two-day Commons defence
debate.
Interviewed on BBC TV's Breakfast with Frost, Lady Thatcher steered clear of
specific references to the current cabinet dispute but argued that to
'weaken your defence below a certain level is very dangerous'.
'That after all is what we did between World War One and World War Two,' she
said. 'There are still aggressors in the world, we have seen it from
Serbia.' She continued: 'The only way to make certain that we can beat a
tyrant whenever he shows his hand is to keep your defences strong.
'The great thing about President Reagan, President Bush and myself was,
whatever we had to do, we never had to think 'have we got the equipment, the
trained men, or the latest missiles?' because wise foresight had seen to it
that we had.'
Her remarks came as Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Conservative chairman of the
cross-party Commons defence committee, wrote to Mr John Major, the prime
minister, saying that further cuts would put Britain's armed forces under an
unacceptable level of stress.
Such actions are part of a strong rearguard action launched by opponents of
further defence cuts in response to the Treasury's targeting of the Ministry
of Defence's Pounds 23.5bn budget in this year's public spending round.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, has demanded a full-scale review
of Britain's armed forces if the Treasury refuses to drop its demands for
more cuts.
Mr Rifkind is expected to use this week's debate - at which several Tory
backbenchers will voice their opposition to further cuts - to announce the
shelving of plans for a new nuclear missile for the Royal Air Force which
would have cost up to Pounds 3bn.
He is also expected to outline the government's views on the future of the
royal dockyards including moves towards private-sector ownership.
In her Frost interview, Lady Thatcher served notice that the rightwing tone
of the Conservative party conference had helped to put Mr Major back in her
good books.
His speech to the party conference this month had led to a 'sea change' in
her attitude towards him, she explained. 'Thatcherism is alive and well. I
believe that was confirmed very much by the prime minister's speech at the
party conference which was back to fundamental principles.'

FT  18 OCT 93 / Cautious support tempered by fear of over-capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY Names have expressed cautious support in the past few days as they make
up their minds on the proposals for corporate capital.
They see the introduction of limited liability capital as important for the
future of the market; but have voiced concerns that it might crowd out Names
who underwrite the market with unlimited liability.
Mr John Hindmarsh, a Name and chartered accountant who advises others, said:
'I am definitely for corporate capital, with the very big proviso that we
must not under any circumstances get too much capacity. Over-capacity will
lead to soft markets. It's got to be governed.'
He added: 'I'm staggered by the number of people who have complete
confidence in Middleton (Lloyd's chief executive) and Rowland (Lloyd's
chairman) and want to put more into the market. I think Lloyd's will get a
big majority (in the vote).'
Mr Nicholas Goodhart, a Name, said: 'I have given my proxy to the chairman
of Lloyd's. I am very supportive of Rowland and Middleton. My only hope is
that we don't derail the thing. But I think it's going to be quite a close
vote.'
Another Name said: 'I suppose approval of corporate capital is inevitable to
bail out the market. The only way forward for Lloyd's is to introduce it.
But it needs to have enough safeguards to protect Names' interests or
individuals will disappear.'
He expressed concerns that Names would find it difficult in future to gain
access to sufficient underwriting capacity given the number of syndicates
now withdrawing from the market and the growing amount of corporate capital
being planned. He also expressed scepticism at the returns being promised by
corporate-capital vehicles.
'It is flavour of the month but I think it is bound to burn its fingers at
some stage,' he said. 'I'll stay underwriting long enough to pay my losses
and then leave.'
Mr David Leighton, a Name, said: 'I am absolutely in favour of corporate
capital. I think it's essential provided there are safeguards on the
allocation of capacity and on voting rights. There are a lot of issues that
still need careful consideration.'
But he added that he would continue to underwrite as a Name and not
subscribe to any of the proposed new vehicles. 'I will continue on a bespoke
basis. There are still tax advantages in being a Name.'
Mr John Pincham, another Name, said: 'Having gone so far down the road I
think we've got to vote in favour. But I am not sure corporate capital is
necessary.'

<TEXT>
THE Department of Trade and Industry has launched a campaign to improve
British exporters' language skills after a survey found that a third of
small exporting companies had missed opportunities due to linguistic
barriers.
Only 4 per cent of Dutch companies had missed out for the same reason, while
in Spain, Germany and Denmark the figures were 18 per cent, 15 per cent and
14 per cent respectively, according to research by the Centre for
Information on Language Teaching and Research.
The campaign, launched by Sir Peter Parker, the former chairman of British
Rail, is setting up a National Business Language Information Service, which
will spread impartial information on language training and also offer advice
to companies that need help.
Other measures include a DTI-supported 'language audit' service to help
managers check their own linguistic capability; a British Overseas Trade
Board award for UK companies that show 'outstanding performance in the use
of languages for exports'; and a BBC television programme, to be broadcast
in April next year, which will be aimed at small and medium-sized
businesses.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Names step up campaign for compensation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of loss-making Names, individuals whose assets support the Lloyd's
insurance market, are stepping up their campaign for compensation before a
crucial vote this week on the admission of corporate members.
A positive result by the 31,607 Names eligible to vote would trigger schemes
by securities houses and banks to raise more than Pounds 1bn from
institutional and retail investors. But opposition from Names who have borne
the brunt of some Pounds 6bn in losses in the past five years could wreck
the plans.
Fewer than 2,000 Names are expected to attend Wednesday's extraordinary
general meeting, but loss-makers, organised into 37 separate action groups,
have been collecting proxy votes. Their leaders aim to use their voting
power to speed a settlement of more than a dozen legal actions, and have
threatened to veto the corporate capital plan if their demands are not met.
On paper the dissidents appear to have at least a chance of securing the
simple numerical majority needed to win the vote. Mr Christopher Stockwell,
chairman of the Lloyd's Names Association Working Party, has co-ordinated a
vigorous campaign among the 17,000 action group members. Some 12,000 of the
Lloyd's electorate are not underwriting, and are in the market through their
membership of syndicates which have 'open years' (whose accounts cannot be
closed because of uncertainty about future claims), or because they resigned
less than three years ago. Many of these 'trapped' Names are embittered and
seem to represent a natural constituency for the action group campaign.
Yet recent experience has indicated that Names tend to be naturally
conservative and despite their own problems resist calls for radical action.
Names voted by a majority of 2-1 in favour of motions welcoming corporate
capital after an earlier EGM during the summer, prompting the dissidents to
lament that the loss-makers 'deserved all they got'. A year earlier, Names
voted even more emphatically in favour of the Lloyd's Council, the market's
governing body.
Moreover, the market's management headed by Mr David Rowland, chairman, and
Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive, has a solid base of support. Some 5,000
working Names, who hold jobs at the market, are certain to vote for the
council's plans, as will many of the 9,000 Names represented by the
Association of Lloyd's Members.
Lloyd's has won over the association by its promises of a settlement later
this year via the loss-makers. Earlier this month Mr Neil Shaw, the
industrialist who heads the ALM, urged Names not to send proxy votes to
action group leaders. Mr Shaw said an independent report showed that the
entry of corporate capital would not disadvantage individual Names.
Many Names fear that voting down the corporate capital proposals outright
would throw the market into chaos, ending hopes of attracting new investment
and destroying its ability to fund a settlement.
Mr Robert Hiscox, the deputy chairman of Lloyd's, who has worked closely on
the corporate capital initiative, predicts that Names will simply lose their
business if they reject the council's plans.
'Corporate capital has met underwriting at Lloyd's and likes what it sees,'
Mr Hiscox said, pointing to the dozen or more investment trusts being formed
by banks and securities houses. He predicts that if Names refuse to accept
the plan, underwriters and corporate capital will simply join forces,
effectively creating new insurance companies.
He added: 'Many of the people who have been dancing together will just get
married. There is absolutely no dobut about that.'
Names deserted syndicates managed by the Merrett group this year, but Mr
Steven Merrett, the group's chairman, seems to have had little difficulty in
attracting new corporate investors to back his business. Marsh McLennan, the
world's biggest insurance broker, JP Morgan, the investment bank, and
Travellers, the US insurance company, are among the group's backers.
Mr Rowland and Mr Middleton have said they will resign their positions if
they lose the vote. Nor are they likely to look kindly on any move by Names
to postpone a decision on Wednesday. With a queue of blue chip financiers
seeing a positive vote by Names as a green light for their plans, they can
ill afford to prevaricate.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Market reforms of public services criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT reforms to introduce market forces into health, education,
housing and social services are struggling to achieve their goals, says a
report published today.
The study, backed by the government-funded Economic and Social Research
Council, found that schools and housing associations had become much more
competitive.
But the reforms have largely failed to introduce real competition into
health and social services. Instead they have created healthcare monopolies
in many parts of the country, with most contracts being placed with a few
large hospitals.
Where competition has been introduced, market reforms could work to the
detriment of the most disadvantaged, the report says. In education, schools
catering for disadvantaged children and those in poorer inner-city areas are
losing their share of funds.
The reforms are in danger of widening the gap between the 'haves' and the
'have-nots' in education, says the study.
Health, school education, low-cost housing and social services are no longer
provided by government agencies, but bought in from trust hospitals,
schools, housing associations and care organisations. In each case,
government agencies fund the service, but the money goes to those providers
which are most successful in winning customers.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Cable phones challenge BT, survey finds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AROUND HALF of all telephone users would change their telephone company if
they were offered free local calls, according to a Gallup survey carried out
for the big cable television companies.
The offer of free local calls was so strong a motivation that among the
respondents 48 per cent of cable TV subscribers, 50 per cent of a national
sample without cable and even 40 per cent of those who already have a cable
telephone said they would move to get such a concession.
The survey found that three quarters of subscribers to cable telephone
services - more than 200,000 homes now use cable telephony, mostly through
Mercury Communications - gave cost as their main reason for choosing cable.
Cable operators claim discounts of about 15 per cent on telephone bills,
although at least part of the difference comes from the fact that telephone
bills charge for time actually used while British Telecom charges in units.
There was also a widespread belief that BT's service had improved, with more
than 40 per cent saying it had improved 'considerably' or 'a fair amount'.
Cable television subscribers who have retained BT as their telephone company
say they have done so because the company is 'efficient', because they are
'used to it', because it is a 'large, reliable company' and because of
'consistency of service'.
The Gallup survey was based on interviews with more than 500 cable
television subscribers and more than 1,000 non-subscribers.

in Spain, Germany and Denmark the figures were 18, 15 and 14 per cent
respectively, according to research by the Centre for Information on
Language Teaching and Research.
The campaign, launched by Sir Peter Parker, the former chairman of British
Rail, is setting up a new National Business Language Information Service,
which will spread impartial information on language training, and also offer
advice to companies which need help.
Other measures include a DTI-supported 'language audit' service, to help
managers check their own linguistic capability, a new British Overseas Trade
Board award for UK companies which show 'outstanding performance in the use
of languages for exports', and a BBC television programme, to be broadcast
in April next year, which will be aimed at small and medium-sized
businesses.

THE Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), the country's largest
union grouping, has called a national strike for November 15 to protest
against the treatment of workers' rights in the draft constitution, writes
Philip Gawith in Johannesburg.
Its call surprised political observers as it did not appear to have been
discussed with Cosatu's partners, the African National Congress (ANC) and
South African Communist party. It would seem to indicate a determination by
Cosatu to continue as an independent voice for workers regardless of its
political ties.
The group called on negotiators at democracy talks to remove a clause in the
constitution guaranteeing the tenure of civil servants after the election
next April, and strike out a clause from the interim bill of rights enabling
employers to lock out striking workers.

FT  18 OCT 93 / In search of common cause: A challenge for the Commonwealth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Commonwealth's fox has been shot, its demise underlined by pictures of a
beaming Nelson Mandela and a jubilant President F W De Klerk, joint winners
of the Nobel peace prize.
The search for a new quarry begins in Cyprus on Wednesday, when leaders and
representatives of 50 nations gather in Limassol for the organisation's
biennial conference.
It will be the first time in more than two decades that South Africa need
not dominate the proceedings. How to end apartheid sharply divided the
Commonwealth (usually Britain from the rest); it also gave the association a
sense of purpose and power, whether illusory or not.
With sanctions lifted and a general election in the offing, the Commonwealth
has to refocus, say diplomats from within its ranks.
Efforts that began in Harare two years ago to find a raison d'etre must
produce results this week they warn, or the loose association of states with
little in common other than the English language and historical links with
Britain will become increasingly irrelevant.
As Australia's proposed move to republican status illustrates, Commonwealth
ties with the former colonial power are wearing thin. But as one senior
British official made clear last week, the reverse applies. In the run-up to
Limassol, British diplomats do not conceal their doubts about the wisdom of
allocating five days of Prime Minister John Major's time to a conference
whose merits 'are not entirely self-evident', as one put it.
Past acrimonious exchanges over South Africa sanctions, as far back as the
arms-to-Pretoria row in Singapore in 1971, are readily recalled. Not even
radical change in South Africa was enough to lay the sanctions issue to rest
in Harare in 1991.
Britain still bears the scars. At least one African high commissioner in
London detects irritation and impatience in the speech to the English
Speaking Union last week by Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary.
The South African issue had 'distorted' the Commonwealth, he said.
Since it 'is not an organisation with voting rights or international legal
authority, these differences never got us anywhere.' It only 'convinced many
people in Britain that the Commonwealth was an institution for lecturing
Britain, and its effectiveness suffered as a result'.
Commonwealth officials and delegates challenge that view, but none is likely
to pursue old scores this week.
Instead they will press for a substantial Commonwealth role in South
Africa's April election, assisting in the preparations and monitoring the
poll.
Mr Hurd, who pointedly noted that 'change lies in the hands of South
Africans, not their well-wishers', will want to ensure discussion of this
role does not divert attention from a broader objective for the
Commonwealth, say Foreign Office officials.
Other items on the agenda are important, they acknowledge, such as the state
of multilateral trade negotiations, the emergence of a 'global humanitarian
order', and the environment and development.
But the conference is not the best arena for action in these areas they
argue: what member states can do is to put the Commonwealth house in better
order. Mr Hurd himself says: 'A new task is staring it in the face. Good
governance and democracy cannot be imposed by imperial means.' It requires a
combination of persuasion and reward, and 'expressions of displeasure' if
democracy is undermined. 'These are all characteristics of the Commonwealth,
and that is where its task for the nineties could lie.'
Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the Commonwealth secretary-general, would not disagree.
Writing in the organisation's annual report, published this month, he sees
the 1991 Harare communique as a renewal of a commitment to 'fundamental
political values: democracy, the rule of law, just and honest government and
human rights.'
In the intervening two years there has been change for the better, and
Commonwealth observers have monitored the transition to multi-party states
in Kenya, Ghana and elsewhere.
Critics, however, note the continued reluctance to appoint a Commonwealth
group to monitor and publicise human rights abuses in member states and the
fact that two governments which have flouted democracy - Nigeria and Sierra
Leone - will take their seats on Wednesday.
The challenge at Cyprus will be to close the wide gap that remains between
the Harare principles and their practice.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Separatists put faith in Canada poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<DATELINE>
   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE presence of more than 50 Quebec separatists in Canada's House of Commons
after the October 25 general election will give the independence movement an
important lever to sway public opinion in the francophone province,
according to the leader of the pro-sovereignty Bloc Quebecois.
Mr Lucien Bouchard said in an interview with the Financial Times that a
referendum on independence would not be held in Quebec for at least two
years. But he predicted the BQ's expected success in next week's election
would give the separatist cause an advantage which it did not enjoy at the
time of the last referendum, in 1980.
'It's quite a difference in a referendum campaign to see 75 Quebec members
of the House of Commons come down and fight for federalism, and to have 50
to 55 members coming back to Quebec to fight for sovereignty,' he said.
An opinion poll published over the weekend indicated the BQ remains far
ahead of the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives in the province, with
the support of 52 per cent of decided voters.
In the country as a whole the Liberals, who are now in opposition, have
widened their lead over the Conservatives, with 40 per cent and 22 per cent
of the vote respectively. The Tories' sputtering campaign received another
setback on Friday when a torrent of complaints forced Prime Minister Kim
Campbell to withdraw a TV advertisement which played on the partial facial
paralysis of Mr Jean Chretien, Liberal leader.
The BQ is the federal equivalent of the Parti Quebecois, which has
campaigned within Quebec since the late 1960s for a loose form of
sovereignty. The Bloc was formed in 1988 by a small group of breakaway
Liberal and Conservative MPs angered by the unwillingness of their
colleagues to make more concessions to Quebec during one of Canada's
periodic constitutional wrangles.
The success of the party since then owes much to Mr Bouchard, who was a
lawyer in the eastern Quebec town of Chicoutimi before entering politics.
Prior to forming the BQ he was Canada's ambassador to France and a member of
former prime minister Brian Mulroney's cabinet.
Responding to a suggestion that much of the BQ's support reflects voters'
desire for a change after three years of tough economic times, Mr Bouchard
acknowledged there was 'no definitive evidence' that most Quebeckers
supported sovereignty at this stage.
But he outlined a two-pronged strategy to win them over. First, the BQ would
show 'that sovereignists can be very responsible even in the federal
parliament'. Second, Mr Bouchard said Quebeckers would come to realise that
they would never gain more constitutional powers within the federal system.
'The door has slammed on all reasonable possibility of renewing the
constitution,' he said.
Mr Bouchard said the separatist movement did not threaten democracy or
foreign investors' confidence in Quebec. 'Everything will have to be done
through the democratic process.' He noted Quebec was heading support for the
1989 free trade agreement between Canada and the US. 'One of the motivations
of the thrust towards sovereignty is the desire to open Quebec to the
world.'

<TEXT>
THE Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), the country's largest
union grouping, has called a national strike for November 15 to protest
against the treatment of workers' rights in the draft constitution.
The call surprised political observers as it did not appear to have been
discussed with Cosatu's partners, the African National Congress (ANC) and
South African Communist Party. It would seem to indicate a determination by
Cosatu, with 1.2m paid-up members, to continue as an independent voice for
workers regardless of its political ties.
Mr Sam Shilowa, the group's general secretary, said at the weekend the
strike would go ahead unless negotiators at the democracy talks agreed to
removed a clause in the constitution guaranteeing the tenure of civil
servants after the election next April, and removed a clause from the
interim bill of rights enabling employers to lock out striking workers.
Cosatu believes that entrenching the positions of existing civil servants -
aimed at quelling the fears of largely white incumbents - will impede
democratisation of the civil service. Namibia adopted a similar policy at
independence in 1990 and the large bureaucracy is proving an unmanageable
fiscal burden.
Mr Shilowa said the strike had been scheduled to be held a week before the
planned special sitting of parliament on November 22 which would formally
pass the constitution. The talks, however, remain far from complete with
important issues like regional powers, and how a government of national
unity will function, undecided. The conservative Freedom Alliance is also
continuing to stand outside the main negotiating process.
Mr Shilowa said the length of the strike had still to be decided.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Space agency lands ice cream deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S satellite launch and tracking control agency today fires itself into
a new business orbit: selling ice-cream.
While keeping one commercial eye on outer space, the agency has for some
time been tracking the advance of western consumer lifestyles into China. It
has already diversified into such down-to-earth activities as running hotels
and restaurants.
Now it has formed a joint venture with Allied-Lyons, the UK drinks, food and
retailing group, to treat the Chinese to the delights of Baskin-Robbins ice
cream.
The world's biggest ice cream chain today opens for business in Beijing
where Allied-Lyons is investing Dollars 1m in four stores. Mr Tony Hales,
Allied's chief executive, will perform the opening ceremony according to
Chinese custom.
Baskin-Robbins - recently voted 'America's Favorite Sweets Chain' for the
10th time - does not plan to commemorate the event by adding another exotic
flavour to its roster of 650 recipes, though Neil Armstrong's moon landing
in 1969 was celebrated with Lunar Cheesecake.
China is the 48th country in which Baskin-Robbins has landed since then  -
and the Chinese will have to be content, for the time being at least, with
the usual daily menu of 31 flavours to be found in any of the 3,600 shops
worldwide.
These include the 'sinfully rich' Kahlua 'n Cream, Jamoca Almond Fudge, and
Daiquiri Ice. It would not be surprising, however, if Beijing's customers
were also given a taste of Red Bean ice-cream that has been so successful in
Korea, or the Green Tea flavour that has gone down so well in Japan.
Allied's market research has shown that the usual aversion of the Chinese to
milk and other dairy products does not extend to ice cream. The group also
expects to benefit from the laws which restrict Chinese families to one
child. 'It tends to make parents very indulgent.'
If the stores succeed - and Allied is investing a lot of effort in staff
training to establish a service culture - the group plans to build an ice
cream factory in Beijing, capable of producing 2m gallons a year.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Reformers tread different roads to capitalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEIJING remains distinguished by bicycles, Moscow by dour Stalinist
architecture, but arrival of the market economy has produced a similar
atmosphere in the capitals of the two former communist superpowers. Central
streets of both cities are invariably congested with traffic, street
pavements are packed with unofficial market-sellers, while all around
construction teams work on sites of luxury hotels and office blocks.
Governments in both capitals seem, at least at first sight, to face similar
economic challenges. Both are trying to stabilise accelerating inflation by
reforms which claw back power from regions. Both know reform depends on
stopping the flow of central bank credits to loss-making state enterprises.
But outside the two cities these similarities in economic development fade.
Moscow is ahead of other cities in outward signs of transition to a market
economy. Regional centres, such as Volgograd, show little sign of private
entrepreneurship other than kiosks selling western cigarettes and alcohol.
Beijing, by contrast, is far from being China's most dynamic city. While
Shanghai and Guangzhou in the east and south make the capital look dour and
dowdy, other regional centres, such as Chengdu in the west or the northern
municipality of Tianjin, also rival Beijing for colour and market-oriented
activity.
Apparent similarities between economic tasks facing the Russian and Chinese
governments fade just as fast. Russia is trying to stabilise inflation of 20
per cent a month, fuelled by credits to collapsing state industries. Chinese
inflation is a little over 20 per cent a year because the non-state economy
is growing too fast.
The same factors which account for the different pattern of regional
development explain why China cannot be a role model for Russian reform,
according to two Chinese economists, Yingyi Qian and Chenggang Xu. The
reason, they argue, lies in very different political and economic structures
which characterised the planned economies of both countries.
Economic planning in the Soviet Union was highly centralised and
hierarchical. Regions specialised in particular industries, while
co-ordination and control were centred in Moscow. But China's experiment
with Stalinist central planning in the early 1950s was judged a failure,
while Beijing had less reason than Moscow to distrust its regional
governments. The result is that Chinese planning was much less centralised -
by 1978, fewer than half of state enterprises were controlled by the central
government.
This decentralisation explains why China's relatively autonomous provinces
have been the driving force behind reform. Freed from central controls, and
keen to find tax revenue, local governments have encouraged emergence of new
enterprises. The most dynamic growth has been in rural areas in the form of
collective enterprises controlled by town and village administrations. By
1990, these enterprises accounted for a third of industrial output and
almost 40 per cent of employment.
This growth has enabled China's economy to grow by an average 9 per cent a
year since market reforms began in 1978 without attempting to reform the
state industrial sector. This sector accounts for only half of output - and
is shrinking each year - compared to almost all non-agricultural production
in Russia. Meanwhile, decentralisation means China's remaining state
manufacturing enterprises are much smaller, averaging 145 employees in 1988
compared to 806 in Russia, and less regionally specialised.
After over a decade of growth, reform and partial closure of China's
remaining state enterprises look difficult but feasible. In Russia, size and
regional concentration of state industry make this task more difficult. But
Russia's inflation demonstrates state enterprises cannot be ignored.

ARMED Kashmiri separatists besieged the Hazrat Bal shrine in Srinagar for a
second day yesterday. Last night the militants and the Indian authorities
were still negotiating.
In Muzaffarabad, capital of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, crowds of
demonstrators yesterday protested in response to a raid by Indian troops on
the Moslem shrine. Young men and women shouting anti-Indian slogans marched
through the city, Pakistan's state-controlled television reported.
The Pakistani government condemned the Indian action and called it a 'grave
and provocative action on the holy shrine by Indian forces on fabricated
pretexts'.
A Foreign Office announcement in Islamabad said: 'This sacrilege committed
against the holiest shrine in Kashmir will be deplored by civilised opinion
throughout the world.'
Meanwhile, some religious leaders are expected to call upon their followers
today to hold peaceful demonstrations against the Hazrat Bal incident.
Security around Indian diplomats and diplomatic missions was expected to be
tightened last night, officials said.
The government is also monitoring the security around a small number of
Hindu temples, especially in southern Pakistan, which became the target of
attack by Moslem demonstrators after last year's demolition of the Babri
mosque in Ayodhya, India, by Hindu fanatics.
Army reinforcements were sent to the shrine after part of it was set on fire
on Saturday afternoon, to ensure that the holy relic, believed to be a lock
of the prophet Mohammed's hair, was safe.
The militants have demanded the withdrawal of the army from the area, and
asked for the curfew to be lifted, so that the shrine, along with the holy
relic, can be handed over to the care of the ulema, the Moslem theologians.
The government achieved a breakthough yesterday when Mr A K Suri, the
inspector general of police, and Mr Wajahat Habibullah, a senior
administrative official, established direct contact with the militants
inside the mosque.
One person was killed in an extended gun battle between militants and the
paramilitary after the area was cordoned off on Friday.
The security forces have been careful not to storm the mosque and chose to
wait it out, since the use of force could lead to bloody repercussions in
the valley, where an armed insurgency has been raging since 1989. The
Kashmir valley experienced its worst violence in decades in 1963, when the
holy relic was stolen. It was later returned.
Officials in India's Home Ministry are being particularly cautious about
future steps because they do not want to play into the hands of militants,
who may use religion to whip up more anti-India frenzy in the valley.
'We know how heavily India paid for Mrs Gandhi's decision to storm the
Golden Temple (in Amritsar) in 1984,' said a senior official. 'We cannot
afford a similar mistake in Kashmir.'
The prospect of Ms Benazir Bhutto becoming Pakistan's next prime minister
became more likely yesterday after her nominee, Mr Yusuf Raza Gillani, was
elected speaker of the lower house of the Pakistani parliament, the National
Assembly.

JAPANESE television, which broke with its tradition of supporting the ruling
party in the July general election, could be forced to return to its old
compliant ways with the launching of an investigation into alleged biased
coverage.
The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications last week started to
investigate TV Asahi, a national network, on charges of intentional bias in
its election coverage.
The network's executives are being questioned for violating the broadcasting
laws by instructing reporters to distort its campaign coverage in a way that
would help the popular reformist parties. Ministry officials say TV Asahi
could face up to three months' suspension from broadcasting if it has broken
the law.
The investigations come when the Japanese media, known for its cosy
relationships with bureaucrats and politicians, is being questioned over its
role in society. Recent coverage exposing political corruption by newspapers
and television seemed to represent a new, more western trend.
Although the Japanese constitution guarantees freedom of speech, the
telecommunications ministry, which controls broadcasting licences, points
out that broadcasting laws stipulating 'political fairness' come first.
TV Asahi denies the allegations, and says its coverage is fair. There has
been no public criticism over the government's probe, and the Japanese media
have even denounced TV Asahi for putting the freedom of reporting at risk.
Leaders of the LDP, who have been frustrated by recent political coverage,
have joined in the calls against TV Asahi.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Israel to free most Palestinian prisoners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S foreign minister Mr Shimon Peres said yesterday he expected most of
the 11,000 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons would be released, agencies
report.
PLO officials have said their release would help build Palestinian support
for the peace accord. Most of the prisoners are accused of taking part in
the six-year uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
'I think the large majority (of prisoners) will be released since
circumstances have changed, the reasons for their detention and arrest have
vanished or changed. Our position also needs a change,' Mr Peres said on
army radio.
The intention to release prisoners was confirmed by Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin. He told Israel radio: 'We certainly will come to the freeing of
prisoners. Not just one here and there, but big numbers.' The next round of
Middle East peace talks has been delayed after Syria threatened to stay
away, an Israeli official said yesterday. Syria, which reacted coolly to
last month's Israel-PLO peace deal, has complained the Palestinians are not
co-ordinating moves with Arab states and Israel is preoccupied with the
Palestinian issue.

THE nomination yesterday of Mr Yusuf Raza Gillani as speaker of the lower
house of the Pakistani parliament, the national assembly, has strengthened
Ms Benazir Bhutto's attempt to become prime minister again.
Her nominee won with a comfortable majority over his rival, Mr Gohar Ayub.
The voting confirmed Ms Bhutto's lead over Mr Nawaz Sharif, her arch rival,
whose PML (Pakistan Moslem League) party was backing Mr Khan. Ms Bhutto's
PPP (Pakistan People's Party) won the largest number of seats in the
elections, but needs support of independents to form a majority.
'The results of the prime minister's elections will be even better. We are
confident of carrying most of the parties with us,' said Mr Farooq Leghari,
secretary general of the PPP, after yesterday's results. The PPP is expected
to gain the support of independents affiliated to neither of the two
parties.
However, the two sides are still locked in battle for control of Punjab, the
biggest and wealthiest province.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Russians admit dumping N-waste
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S environment ministry yesterday admitted that a Russian tanker was
dumping nuclear waste into the ocean north of Japan. It said international
authorities had been informed in advance.
Deputy environment minister Mr Amirkhan Amirkhanov said interested
governments had been told about the dumping and the level of radiation in
the waste was very low.
Japan said it was concerned after Greenpeace revealed that the waste was
being dumped.
According to the environmental group, the Russian vessel started pumping
liquid waste directly into the sea west of Hokkaido, northern Japan,
yesterday morning.
The waste was mainly reactor coolant and cleaning water from the Russian
Pacific fleet's dilapidated nuclear submarines, said a Greenpeace ship
following the tanker. Greenpeace measured airborne radiation at around 10
times background levels around the Russian ship.
Sensitivity over environmental issues is increasing in Japan, where anxiety
is especially centred on pollution imported from neighbouring countries,
such as acid rain from Chinese nuclear power stations and seaborne nuclear
waste from Russia.
The dumping, in apparent violation of a 1983 international moratorium over
the dumping of nuclear waste at sea, could add fresh strain to sensitive
relations between Japan and Russia.
It comes just a week after relations had improved, thanks to a successful
visit to Tokyo by President Boris Yeltsin.
Mr Yeltsin and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, voiced
'serious concern' over the ocean dumping of radioactive waste, in a joint
declaration last week. They agreed to investigate nuclear dumping in the Sea
of Japan by the former Soviet Union.

FT  18 OCT 93 / UK warns US over unitary taxation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK has warned the US that it is not satisfied with the changes
California has made to its system of unitary taxation.
In a formal approach last week to the US State Department on behalf of the
EC and eight other countries Sir Robin Renwick, the British ambassador to
Washington, said new Californian legislation which in effect allows foreign
companies to opt out of the unitary system did not resolve the unitary tax
problem.
The EC countries, together with Australia, Austria, Canada, Finland, Japan,
Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, said they would not be satisfied unless the
normal arm's length system of taxation was established 'as the only
legitimate basis of taxing foreign companies in any state'.
The UK has asked the US Supreme Court to take up the issue, filing a brief
in support of a case brought by Barclays Bank of the UK against a tax
assessment made by California under the unitary system.
Barclays is appealing against a ruling by the California state supreme court
in favour of the state tax authorities, in a test case for suits by other
foreign-owned companies which could cost California Dollars 900m (Pounds
596m).
Foreign, and especially British, companies have long objected to
California's system of unitary taxation, which taxes a company on a
percentage of its worldwide income, rather than only on income earned in the
state.
The Clinton administration last week urged the Supreme Court to ignore
Barclays appeal, on the grounds that the new California legislation resolved
the issue.
But the UK's lawyers argue that the Supreme Court needs to resolve the
constitutional issues raised by unitary taxation, since 'foreign policy
issues are so directly implicated and lower state courts appear totally
confused by this Court's prior pronouncements'.

<TEXT>
MR Abdulrazaq Mulla Hussein has resigned as deputy chairman of the Kuwait
Petroleum Corporation, the group which owns the Gulf state's oil producing
and refining interests, over what appear to be differences on management
strategy with Mr Ali al-Baghli, the oil minister.
News of Mr Hussein's resignation emerged in articles yesterday in two
Kuwaiti dailies, and was confirmed by Kuwaitis close to the KPC.
Onepaper quoted Mr al-Baghli as saying that 'there was a difference in the
points of view about how to manage the oil sector'. Other Kuwaitis said
these differences had been festering for months within KPC, where Mr
al-Baghli's style had ruffled feathers among senior management.
Mr al-Baghli, a Shia and lawyer by background, took over the Oil Ministry
after last year's elections and is the first oil minister simultaneously to
hold a seat in the National Assembly.
Kuwaiti sources said that many within the state-owned KPC management had
felt uneasy about the way that Mr al-Baghli combined what they viewed as a
largely technocratic portfolio with his desire to sustain a high political
profile. Managers, including Mr Hussein, are understood to have been
particularly dismayed by several public criticisms by the minister of the
group's strategy.

THE US has not ruled out military intervention in Haiti to protect American
lives and restore democracy there, President Bill Clinton's ambassador to
the United Nations said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.
Ms Madeleine Albright said Washington was monitoring the situation closely
and was standing by to evacuate some 1,000 Americans if necessary.
'The protection of American lives is foremost in our minds,' she said. 'We
don't rule anything in or anything out. This is a very tense situation, but
one in which we have to maintain calmness about our response.'
Reports from Port-au-Prince said hundreds of foreigners fled Haiti yesterday
after a night of heavy gunfire in some of the capital's neighbourhoods.
The country's international airport was jammed with American and Canadian
citizens who were urged to leave Haiti or take security precautions ahead of
stringent UN trade sanctions which come into effect at midnight tonight New
York time.
On Saturday the US embassy flew in 30 additional Marine guards and set up a
telephone network to alert American citizens about potential violence.
The Canadian embassy has urged all 2,300 of its citizens to leave the
country immediately.
US warships and three Canadian vessels, some visible from the capital city,
will make sure that no fuel or arms are allowed to enter Haiti. The UN
sanctions also include freezing the foreign bank accounts of army chief
General Raoul Cedras and other military leaders.
Ms Albright said the US was still hoping that Gen Cedras would step aside
and allow democratically-elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to return
to power on October 30. Gen Cedras led the 1991 coup that ousted Mr
Aristide.
Gen Cedras refused to relinquish power on Friday, as had been scheduled
under a UN plan to return Mr Aristide to power.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Rocky road ahead for EC motor parts sector: A secret report
says drastic action is needed to fight off Japanese competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S automotive components industry must restructure in the 1990s to
close an 'alarming' competitive gap with Japan, according to a confidential
report prepared for the EC Commission.
The industry, which has a crucial role in shaping the fortunes of European
carmakers, is 'the weak link in the European motor industry's
competitiveness today', says the report. 'It will be under even greater
pressure in the future.' The industry employs around 940,000, and has annual
output worth Ecu92.7bn (Pounds 72bn).
Commissioned by the EC industry directorate from the Boston Consulting
Group, the study claims that 'unless drastic action is taken soon, the
competitive gap in components risks widening even further'.
The report says: Employment in the industry is likely to fall from just
below 1m to around 500,000 by 1999.
The fragmented industry will be forced to restructure and concentrate as
vehicle makers drastically reduce the number of direct suppliers - by around
two thirds between 1988 and 1997 - to a core of around 500 first-tier
suppliers across Europe. The number of remaining supplier companies is
likely to fall by a third. The productivity of Japanese vehicle makers is
around 30 per cent higher than their European rivals but in the components
sector Japanese productivity is 2.5 times greater.
The profitability of European components manufacturers has fallen between
1988 and 1991, reflecting 'the slowdown in demand, increases in capacity,
reduction in prices, and the fierce competition that is accompanying the
sector restructuring'.
The report says the European Commission can play 'a useful supporting role'
in facilitating restructuring of the industry, although the main efforts
must come from the companies themselves.
EC initiatives are called for in training and employment measures, in
harmonising standards, in encouraging co-operation in research and
development and technology, and in competition policy.
The upheaval now under way most critically in the German motor industry
among both vehicle makers and their components suppliers is central to the
restructuring of the entire industry.
Germany alone accounts for 47 per cent of the production of the EC
independent components industry (excluding production by the vehicle makers
themselves), for 53 per cent of the sector's added value and for 46 per cent
of employment. France accounts for 19 per cent of production, the UK for 12
per cent, Italy for 11 per cent and Spain for seven per cent.
Original equipment - components used in new vehicles - accounts for 77 per
cent of the total EC components market of Ecu88.8bn. Growth in demand of 21
per cent from 1988 to 1992 has come from a small increase in vehicle
production, but chiefly from moves by vehicle makers to buy more components
from outside suppliers to reduce their own in-house components
manufacturing, from the use of more sophisticated components in vehicles and
a shift to the production of higher value vehicles.
More job losses will follow those already announced this year, says the
report. Several leading European vehicle makers are already demanding cost
and price reductions of more than 10 per cent a year from their suppliers.
'Employment is likely to decline dramatically. . . as the growth of
consumption and production slows down and the rate of productivity by
necessity accelerates.'
If productivity continues to grow by 4 per cent a year as in recent years,
employment in the industry would be reduced by 11 per cent by the end of the
decade. 'However, this level of productivity growth would leave the industry
hopelessly unviable at the end of the period and in danger of collapse,'
says the report.
'If the European components industry were to reach, in 1999, the level of
productivity of the Japanese industry in 1992, then employment would be
reduced by 54 per cent, implying a 14 per cent per annum improvement.'
Even such a drastic cut in jobs, however, would not guarantee the EC
reaching parity with the Japanese industry, which has lifted productivity by
5-6 per cent a year in the last decade. The report says the productivity gap
must be at least halved as 'the absolute minimum necessary for the industry
to be in a position to survive after 1999'.
European components producers are turning over stock only 5-7 times a year
on average compared with nearly 19 for their Japanese rivals.
Concentration of ownership is one of the main structural changes facing the
sector. The process is being driven, says the report, by 'the lack of
competitiveness of many suppliers in an extremely fragmented industry', and
by changes in vehicle makers' policies towards: more outsourcing and the
transfer of design and development to the supplier industry; the sourcing of
components to single rather than multiple suppliers; the purchasing of
systems rather than individual components; and the formation of strategic
buying alliances.
As the industry restructures drastically, the report says it will be
transformed, having fewer but larger suppliers with a European presence;
assembling systems in factories near the car plants; subcontracting non-core
production to second- and third-tier suppliers, and enjoying supply
contracts for the life-time of vehicles and shared R&amp;D with vehicle makers.
From a structure based on confrontation between the vehicle makers and their
suppliers, the motor industry would have to move 'towards one based on
partnership where profit is shared among the different players in the value
chain'.

<TEXT>
MR Abdulrazaq Mulla Hussein has resigned as deputy chairman of the Kuwait
Petroleum Corporation, the group which owns the Gulf state's oil producing
and refining interests, over what appear to be differences on management
strategy with Mr Ali al-Baghli, the oil minister.
News of Mr Hussein's resignation emerged in articles yesterday in two
Kuwaiti dailies, Al-Qabbas and Al-Watan, and were confirmed by Kuwaitis
close to the KPC.
Al-Watan quoted Mr al-Baghli as saying that 'there was a difference in the
points of view about how to manage the oil sector'.
Other Kuwaiti sources said these differences had been festering for months
within KPC, where Mr al-Baghli's style had ruffled feathers among senior
management.
Mr al-Baghli, a Shia and lawyer by background, took over the Oil Ministry
after last year's elections and is the first oil minister simultaneously to
hold a seat in the National Assembly.
Kuwaiti sources said that many within the state-owned KPC management had
felt uneasy about the way that Mr al-Baghli combined what they viewed as a
largely technocratic portfolio with his desire to sustain a high political
profile.
Managers, including Mr Hussein, are understood to have been particularly
dismayed by several public criticisms by the minister of the group's
strategy.
The Kuwaiti sources said Mr Hussein's resignation was unrelated to reports
in the Financial Times about KPC's alleged role in the purchase of the Gulf
state's investment in BP in the late 1980s.
Leading candidates to succeed Mr Hussein are Mr Nader Sultan, former head of
Kuwait Petroleum International, and Ms Siham Rizouki, an undersecretary at
the oil ministry.

BOSNIAN Serbs, Croats and Moslems battled for territory across the republic
yesterday and accused each other of planning large offensives, Reuter
reports from Belgrade.
In Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, a crisis centre which monitors casualties
reported that 13 people had been killed and 78 wounded during the weekend.
Ten were killed in the city itself, which endured its worst shelling in
weeks on Saturday.
A Bosnian army commander said the artillery barrage could be a sign that
Bosnian Serbs were preparing an assault on the city. UN officials have
reported Serb troop movements around the city but are unsure whether the
Serbs plan an offensive. The Serbs said it was the Moslems who were trying
to push forward on fronts in central Bosnia.
There were also clashes around Gracanica in the north-east, Maglaj in
central Bosnia and Jablanica in the west.
In the north-western Bosnian enclave of Bihac, Bosnian Moslem government
troops clashed with rebel Moslems loyal to the enclave's leader, Mr Fikret
Abdic, during fighting in two villages.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO powerful electoral blocs to compete in Russian parliamentary elections
on December 12 were formed yesterday.
Russia's Choice, promptly dubbed 'the ruling party' by its critics, was
established in Moscow by supporters of President Boris Yeltsin. Deputy Prime
Minister Sergei Shakhrai set up a rival Party of Russian Unity and Accord in
the town of Novgorod. Both parties will be competing for the pro-reform
vote.
Under the slogan 'Stability, Family, Property and Motherland', Mr Shakhrai
is advocating market reforms devoid of radicalism, and the transformation of
Russia into a genuine federal state devolving economic power to the regions.
His main economic strategist, Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime
minister for foreign economic relations, said reforms had to give more
protection to Russian industry and the poorest members of society.
Mr Victor Prihodin, a local official from the Ryazan province, summed up the
mood of the delegates in Novgorod: 'The regional issue is the key issue now.
We are fed up with being dictated to by leaders in Moscow.'
Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister responsible for the economy who
is the leader of Russia's Choice - an electoral bloc grouping several
'democratic' parties and movements - promised a radical platform of
unpopular but vital economic reforms.
'Even on the eve of the elections we will take responsibility for tough
decisions needed so that the Russian economy does not collapse,' Mr Gaidar
told the Russia's Choice delegates.
Its trump cards include unrivalled access to state-controlled media and an
extensive provincial network run by Democratic Russia, the country's biggest
collection of anti-Communist parties.
Its symbol is Peter the Great, the great reformer whom President Yeltsin
likes to compare himself with. Its motto is 'Freedom, Property, and
Legality' - with an emphasis on the defence of private property rights.
Claiming that financial support came exclusively from the private business
sector, organisers denied suggestions that Russia's Choice would enjoy
unrivalled access to government funds.
But with the majority of the cabinet included in the movement and 11
ministers and presidential advisers leading its electoral list, it is
difficult to see how this cannot be the case.
'This is a criminal restoration of the idea of a ruling party, like the
Communist party,' complained Mr Konstantin Borovoi, an entrepreneur who is
leading an independent list put up by his liberal Economic Freedom party. A
fourth pro-reform bloc is being formed by Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the
prominent economist who has his eye on later presidential elections.
More conservative forces, including neo-communists and nationalists, are
also considering alliances in the run-up to the election.
Half the seats in the state Duma, or lower chamber in a new-look parliament,
will be elected on the basis of party lists and proportional representation.
The other half will be fought for on a first-past-the-post basis in local
constituencies where Russia's Choice and Mr Shakhrai's party are likely to
put up joint candidates.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Owner denies money scheme near collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUCHAREST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Ioan Stoica, the owner of a Romanian money multiplying scheme which has
sucked in about 3m investors and the equivalent of hundreds of millions of
dollars, yesterday denied reports the scheme was about to collapse, writes
Virginia Marsh in Bucharest.
'God has helped us. The circuit is strong and healthy. It will never
collapse,' Mr Stoica said. Several thousand people chanted their support for
the scheme at a sports stadium in Cluj, the Transylvanian town where the
venture is based.
Mr Stoica, who was accompanied by Mr Gheorghe Funar, the town's mayor and
leader of the Romanian parliament's largest nationalist party, said queues
had shortened in recent weeks because he had enlarged his computer system
and employed more cashiers.
Caritas, the largest of many similar unregulated schemes in post-communist
Romania, has become a national obsession since the summer. Then, tens of
thousands of Romanians, encouraged by tales of Caritas millionaires and Mr
Funar's backing of the scheme, descended on Cluj each week.
Mr Stoica, a former bookkeeper, blamed a computer error for the four days
when the scheme failed to pay out.
His profits from Caritas - believed to exceed Dollars 40m (Pounds 26.4m) -
would enable him to set up a bank and a supermarket chain and could give
other entrepreneurs similar opportunities, he said. 'I beg you to keep
investing because through Caritas we can create a middle class wealthy
enough to start real privatisation in Romania.'

FT  18 OCT 93 / Pyramids with giddy heights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LURED by the promise of multiplying their money eight-fold every three
months, Romanians have flocked to the Transylvanian town of Cluj to invest
their meagre savings in a scheme known as Caritas - a money-making 'pyramid'
scheme.
For 18 months, Caritas - run by Mr Ioan Stoica, economics graduate and
former bookkeeper - kept its promises, turning investors into lei
millionaires and drawing more people into its net. But in the last few weeks
Caritas has several times failed to pay out, hitting investor confidence.
Caritas appears to be a classic Ponzi scam, named after Mr Charles Ponzi, an
Italian immigrant operating in Boston just after the first world war. He
persuaded 40,000 investors to part with Dollars 15m by promising to double
their money every three months.
In theory, he was using their savings to take advantage of arbitrage
opportunities in international postal coupons. In practice, he was recycling
the savings of new investors to pay back the earlier investors. When the
scheme collapsed, Ponzi was sent to prison. He ended his days as a pauper in
Rio de Janeiro.
Such financial chain letters survive only as long as investment is attracted
at ever-increasing rates. In Ponzi's scheme, he had to double inflow of cash
every three months. With Caritas, the promise of an even more extravagant
eight-fold increase in three months implies a need to double inflow every
month.
Well-run Ponzi schemes can be kept going for months or even years. But all
are eventually doomed. The supply of funds cannot rise exponentially in
perpetuity. It is only a matter of time before funds dry up, investors panic
or authorities step in. The early investors, of course, get rich. The
laggards lose their savings.
Ponzi schemes have cropped up in many parts of the world. The UK's Barlow
Clowes scandal was effectively a Ponzi scam: the high dividends initial
investors received were paid not by shrewd investment but by later
investors' cash.
Many people in the industrialised world have the experience of being
recruited to join pyramid clubs, where they stand to receive large sums of
money if they can recruit yet more people to the club.
But recently there seems to have been a particularly strong appetite for
'double your money' schemes in some former east bloc countries. Caritas is
just the largest of a series in Romania. Serbia also appears to have spawned
several.
There are various theories why such countries might be vulnerable to such
schemes. One is economic deprivation, which has made people desperate to try
anything to enrich themselves or merely maintain living standards. In
Romania, where earnings have fallen by a third in the past three years,
there are tales of pensioners sinking cash into Caritas because they saw
that as the only way to meet heating and food bills.
Another theory is that societies in transition from communism to capitalism
may be susceptible because they have no tradition of discriminating between
sound investments and scams.
Given the size of the scheme in Romania in relation to its economy, there
are dangers that its collapse could have lasting damage. Investors could be
so badly burnt they lose faith in financial markets and go back to stuffing
cash under mattresses, so stifling the flows of investment necessary if the
economy is to grow.

EUROPEAN Commission President Jacques Delors said yesterday he feared the
European Community was drifting towards becoming a soulless free-trade area
and ultimately a slow break-up, Reuter reports from Paris.
Despite the ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European union, calling
for a common foreign policy and a single currency by 1999, a gloomy Mr
Delors saw no sign of a revival of the 12-nation Community.
'What I see is European construction drifting towards a free trade zone,
that is to say an English-style Europe, which I reject,' Mr Delors, a French
Socialist, said on Radio Luxembourg. 'If we do nothing, this drift will lead
in 15 years to a break-up (of the EC).'

RECENT pressure on the Belgian franc is due to 'false rumours' circulating
in the foreign exchange market, according to the governor of Belgium's
central bank.
Mr Alfons Verplaetse said at the weekend the franc - which last week slipped
to BFr21.99 against the D-Mark - was undervalued given the fundamental
strength of the Belgian economy.
Mr Verplaetse's comments were aimed at stabilising the currency at the
beginning of an important week for economic and monetary policy.
A committee he heads will present a report to Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime
minister, tomorrow, giving the outline of a 'social pact' between the
government, employers and unions - the first since 1944. The report is
understood to endorse the central bank's strict interest rate policy.
He again denied at the weekend that the franc might have to be devalued. He
also dismissed rumours that the 71-year-old currency association between
Belgium and Luxembourg was under threat, or that the central bank's reserves
were exhausted.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Berliners unimpressed by Kohl plan for 2001, the office
space odyssey: Developers do not yet believe chancellor's pledge to move the
government east
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl's announcement last week that the federal government
will complete the move from Bonn to Berlin this century should have been a
cause for celebration among the capital's property developers.
But enthusiasm is hard to detect among the city's property developers. They
do not take the chancellor's words seriously.
'I am very sceptical, to say the least,' says Mr Mark Palmer, who, in
partnership with Mr Roland Lauder, the US cosmetics heir, is investing DM1bn
(Pounds 406m) in building the American Business Centre, an office complex on
the site of the former Checkpoint Charlie border crossing which once divided
the city. Construction is due to start in January.
'The government announced in 1991 that it would move the government. Who's
to say it will not change its mind again? I am looking for some tangible
evidence that this time the government will stick to its words,' says Mr
Palmer, a former US ambassador to Hungary and now a property developer.
There is some evidence of movement. A dozen senior staff from the federal
Defence Ministry are already ensconced near the Landwekhkanal, near the
centre of Berlin and conveniently close to the Berlin Philharmonic. More
significantly, President Richard von Weizsacker, will move permanently to
Berlin on January 1. And the President's New Year's Ball will be held in
Berlin, much to the chagrin of the civil servants on the Rhine.
But before any move can take place, the Bundestag, or lower house of
parliament, has to pass the 'Berlin-Bonn Gesetz' - the legal approval. This
might take place over the next few weeks. Mr Frank Moller, who runs the
marketing arm of the American Business Centre, believes early passage of the
law is crucial.
'We got some clarity last week. But now we need the law legitimating the
timetable,' he says from his office overlooking the site which awaits the
bulldozers and the cranes.
If the government does stick to the timetable, property developers believe
it will speed up the city's building programme. Jones Lang Wootton, the UK
property consultants which opened offices in Berlin and Leipzig three years
ago, reckons a whole range of financial services, from banking to insurance
companies will accompany the move and they will need offices.
The new capital will inherit many of the old ministry buildings from the
former communist regime, but offices and accommodation will be for ancillary
and support staff moving to the new capital.
But Mr Sascha Hettrich, Jones Lang Wootton's Berlin manager, argues that
investors must not wait for the government. 'It makes no sense to wait for
something that is supposed to happen in the future,' he says, betraying his
own sense of scepticism about the government's commitment.
Jones Lang Wootton, and many other property consultants, rushed to Berlin in
the wake of German unification and snapped up prime locations in
anticipation of an early move. The expectations fuelled property prices,
which Mr Hettrich says increased from 'zero to 100' between 1990 and 1992,
its peak.
Renting a square metre of office space, without any services, cost about
DM90 by last year. The market has since fallen to about DM60. 'The prices
are now stable and they might well remain so for some time yet,' adds Mr
Hettrich.
Despite the hesitation in Bonn - or what Mr Palmer calls 'inertia by the
bureaucrats' - private investment of over DM11bn has been poured into
Friedrichstrasse. The street is a short walk from the future finance and
economics ministries. Mr Hettrich estimates that over the next dozen years,
demand will match supply, regardless of the move, if the recession ends
soon. 'Between 7m and 8m square metres of office space will be available
over this period.'
In the meantime, property developers fear that Mr Theo Waigel, the federal
finance minister, will try to postpone the move on the grounds of cost,
which swings between DM20bn and DM30bn. 'I don't understand the costs. Most
of the ministries are ready to move into,' says Mr Palmer.
Berliners cannot understand what all the fuss is about. 'I suppose the
Rhinelanders want to stay in a provincial town,' said Mr Heiner Konitz, a
computer programmer. 'But if the government does not come here, Berlin could
remain a provincial city in the heart of Europe. Who wins?'

Mr Dehaene is known for never setting deadlines for tough negotiations but
it is thought he may try to achieve a consensus by the end of the week on
how to improve Belgian companies' competitiveness, reduce labour costs and
cut the budget deficit.
Mr Verplaetse believes the employers and unions will either immediately sign
the outline pact or allow the government to push through legislation to
achieve the aims of the pact, without giving their formal approval.
He again denied at the weekend that the franc might have to be devalued. He
also dismissed rumours that the 71-year-old currency association between
Belgium and Luxembourg was under threat, or that the central bank's reserves
were exhausted.
Both the Belgian and the French franc have been the target of speculation in
recent weeks, because foreign exchange dealers believe the two countries'
strict policy of maintaining interest rates and shadowing the D-Mark is
unsustainable.

<TEXT>
MINISTERS from nine EC countries should decide today whether it will be safe
to scrap systematic passport controls at their internal frontiers from
December 1.
But France, which will chair today's meeting in Paris, still appears to be
uneasy about opening its borders and could block a decision, setting back
efforts to end frontier controls across the Community.
At their last meeting in June, the nine signatories to the Schengen
free-travel accord - all the EC members except Britain, Denmark and Ireland
 -agreed to abolish controls from December, if certain conditions were met.
The nine ministers must decide today whether the Schengen group has made
sufficient progress in three key areas: improving checks on people coming
from outside the free-travel zone; fighting drug trafficking; and linking
police and immigration authorities by computer.
On Friday, Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's European affairs minister, voiced
his government's continuing concern about certain elements, particularly
delays in linking computer systems and strengthening checks at external
frontiers.
He told the EC affairs committee of the French National Assembly that France
might delay a decision until next month's ministerial meeting. Other
alternatives include postponing the deadline for two months, or calling for
gradual application of the Schengen accord, which came into force on October
1.
The French parliament fears abolishing controls prematurely could lead to
'an increase in illegal immigration, an increase in drugs trafficking and a
general weakening of security in Europe'.
Schengen and European Commission officials hope Mr Lamassoure will bury his
doubts in the interests of achieving unanimous agreement under his
chairmanship.
Agreement would allow Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, the EC internal market
commissioner, to press ahead with attempts to persuade Britain, Ireland and
Denmark to abolish controls on travellers coming from other EC countries.
Brussels believes that was one of the clear objectives of the single market
programme, most of which came into force on January 1.
Most continental EC countries have already scrapped controls on people
crossing internal land borders by train or car, but passport checks are
still in place at most ports and airports, where intra-EC and international
travellers mingle. Large EC airports like Brussels and Amsterdam are
unlikely to meet the December 1 deadline, even if it is agreed today. They
will be given time to split immigration and baggage-handling facilities for
passengers from Schengen and non-Schengen countries.

FT  18 OCT 93 / EC bid to close enlargement gap: Brussels working on
formulas to allay applicants' doubts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission has started to produce what may prove workable
solutions to bridge the political gap between the 12 and the four Nordic and
Alpine countries seeking to join the EC, abating growing pessimism about
plans for completing enlargement by 1995.
The enlargement talks, begun in February with Austria, Sweden and Finland
and two months later with Norway, must be completed by early spring at the
latest to meet the January 1995 target.
Yet the real differences between the EC and the applicants - all of which
will put accession to a referendum among increasingly Euro-sceptical
populations - remain to be resolved.
But Brussels is now evolving formulas in sensitive areas such as
environmental and health and safety standards, and agricultural and regional
subsidies, which could herald a psychological breakthrough in what risked
becoming a dead-end process.
By the October 29 EC summit, substantial progress is expected on aligning
health and safety and veterinary standards, indirect taxation, and making
candidate countries' legislation compatible with the EC's single market. At
an extra ministerial meeting in Brussels on November 9, talks will start on
bringing the four - all except Norway formally neutral - into the Maastricht
treaty's common foreign and security arrangements, and into co-operation on
such issues as terrorism, drugs and immigration.
Senior EC negotiators expect compromise packages on the environment and the
single market by Christmas, and on agriculture and regional policy by the
end of February.
The environment - where all four applicants feel their deep green
populations will reject entry if the EC is seen to be lowering what they
consider higher standards in order to remove impediments to border-free
trade - 'may prove to be decisive for the successful conclusion of the
enlargement exercise', an internal Commission document says.
Brussels is advocating a three-pronged approach: refusing to budge, for
example on car emission standards, where standards are equivalent if
different; offering transitional exemptions where the EC has decided to
raise standards but not yet (for example on safety belts); and to deal with
the most difficult issues (such as health labelling on products or certain
pesticides) by granting transitional exemptions with a review after three
years - by when applicants which had persuaded their electorates would be
inside the EC.
Entrants would have a full voice and vote in the review, a mechanism
designed 'to keep everybody's aspirations alive' a senior Commission
official told the FT. In the interim they would not be allowed to use border
controls to keep EC products out.
Border controls, abolished by the EC's single market, loom large in the
crucial agriculture debate, where the four applicants want to continue
subsidising farmers at between 25 per cent (Austria) and 100 per cent
(Norway) above an already high EC average.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Curb on blood products may spark trade dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FRESH trade dispute is brewing as the European Community moves to restrict
and eventually ban US imports of blood plasma and related products worth
Dollars 650m (Pounds 430m) a year.
Plasma importers are lobbying hard in Brussels against the proposed
restrictions - and the US government is preparing to intervene on their side
if necessary.
The EC in 1989 adopted the goal of eventual 'self-sufficiency through
voluntary unpaid donations' after blood products, mainly from the US,
infected several thousand Europeans with the Aids virus, HIV. But until this
year, little had been done to implement the policy.
Europe uses 6.3m litres a year of plasma, the clear protein-rich fluid in
which blood cells float. Half of this comes from paid American donors.
Most is shipped as frozen plasma from which medical products such as Factor
VIII, immunoglobulins and albumin are extracted.
Prompted by resolutions in the European Parliament, the Commission is
backing measures to boost production from volunteer donors and phase out
imports. These will be considered at a meeting of EC health ministers in
December.
Three countries - Belgium, France and the Netherlands - are leading the way
with legislation to ban products from paid donors. They are already
self-sufficient or nearly so. Germany, Italy and Spain are far more
dependent on US imports and could not realistically phase them out for some
years.
Advocates of self-sufficiency and voluntary donation include the Red Cross
and most national blood collection agencies. They say paid donors are more
likely than volunteers to be infected with sexually transmitted and
blood-borne viruses - and that paid donation unfairly exploits poor and
vulnerable people.
On the other side are commercial manufacturers, which claim that procedures
for screening plasma and eliminating infection are superior in the US.
Mr Bob Reilly, executive director of the International Plasma Products
Industry Association, said: 'From our point of view, European
'self-sufficiency' is a trade barrier and any attempt to stop Dollars 650m
worth of US imports on 'safety' grounds is unjustified protectionism.'
Member companies of the IPPIA include Baxter International, the giant US
blood products group, as well as US subsidiaries of Germany's Bayer,
France's Rhone-Poulenc and Japan's Green Cross.
Caught in the middle are patient groups such as the European Haemophilia
Consortium, which supports self-sufficiency from unpaid donors as a
long-term objective but rejects 'any unrealistic timescale for
implementation' that would disrupt supplies of the clotting agent Factor
VIII.

FT  18 OCT 93 / BBC and Murdoch clash over news service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBC World Service Television has issued a writ against Mr Rupert Murdoch's
News Corporation in an increasingly bitter row between the two organisations
over the expansion of global television news.
The BBC acted after Mr Murdoch's lawyers threatened to terminate its 10-year
contract with the Murdoch-controlled Star TV system in Asia. Mr Murdoch's
lawyers threatened to cancel the deal if the BBC went ahead with plans to
launch an Arabic language television news service for the Middle East early
next year.
The legal clash reflects the intensifying battle in the growing market for
global satellite television.
Mr Murdoch plans to take Sky News, 50 per cent-owned by News Corp, around
the world particularly to Asia. He wants to blunt BBC television's ambitious
plans to launch television services in local languages around the world.
Mr Bob Phillis, chairman of World Service Television and deputy
director-general of the BBC, said last night: 'It is an essential part of
our future strategy to develop World Service Television as a global news and
information service.'
BBC World Service Television has agreed with a leading Middle East
industrial group to launch a 24-hours-a-day Arabic news service. The
service, which is likely to be worth about Pounds 200m over 10 years to the
BBC, would be carried on the Arabsat satellite and would be available
throughout north Africa and the Middle East.
It would operate separate London studios and newsrooms and draw on the
strengths of BBC World Service Radio's established Arabic service.
News Corporation's executives were unable to comment last night but the
company is likely to argue that the areas covered by Arabsat overlap with
the areas covered by Asiasat, the satellite that carries Star TV.
The BBC has taken legal action in the Chancery Division of the High Court in
London 'to clarify its relationship' with Star TV. The Corporation has
issued a writ seeking a formal declaration from the court that the contract
allows it to go ahead with the proposed Arabic channel.
BBC executives believe there is no connection between an English language
service for Asia and an Arabic language channel for north Africa and the
Middle East.
BBC World Service Television has also applied for an injunction preventing
Star terminating its contract. A hearing is expected in the High Court on
Thursday.
Star TV broadcasts five channels of television, including the BBC service,
to more than 30 countries in Asia. Independent research last January showed
it reached more than 11m homes.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Paying with cash costs UK consumers Pounds 800m a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT COSTS the British Pounds 800m a year in lost interest income to carry
around banknotes and coins in wallets and handbags, according to a study of
the costs of circulating cash around the economy.
The first detailed study for 20 years estimates that it costs Pounds 4.5bn
to lubricate the Pounds 250bn flow of cash payments made in Britain each
year.
Individuals pay Pounds 800m, with a further Pounds 800m from shops and
business, Pounds 700m from the Post Office and Pounds 2.2bn from the Bank of
England and commercial banks.
The study, carried out by the Boston Consulting Group for De La Rue, the
banknote printer, estimates that the use of cash costs each of Britain's 22m
households Pounds 210 a year in lost interest and handling expenses.
Each household holds an average of Pounds 460 in cash at any one time, it
estimates. The figure is thought to be so high because it is artificially
boosted by the 'black economy' of unregistered and criminal enterprises
which deal largely in cash.
The cost of the cash-handling system has quadrupled since the last detailed
analysis in 1973, when it was estimated at Pounds 540m at 1992 prices.
Handling cash now costs each commercial bank between Pounds 200m and Pounds
300m a year.
One reason for the rapid escalation in costs of cash handling is that
automated teller machines (ATMs) installed over the past two decades have
made it easier to obtain cash, and so increased the strain on the cash
distribution system. Since 1975, ATM cash withdrawals have quadrupled, while
bank counter withdrawals have declined only slightly.
Mr Simon Farmbrough, a Boston Consulting Group vice-president, said banks
could reduce costs by improved automation and analysis of cash handling.
'There is potential to drive down costs quite significantly.'
The finding that the average household held Pounds 460 in cash had been
checked with financial institutions because it appeared so high, he said.
'It is clear that some of that money is being carried around in suitcases,'
Mr Farmbrough said.
The study follows an analysis by the banks' Association for Payments and
Clearing Services earlier this year, which found that cheque and cash
clearing costs banks about Pounds 4.5bn a year, of which about half is the
cost of cash handling.
This agrees with the Boston Consulting study, which estimates the cost of
cash handling for banks at Pounds 1.9bn, with another Pounds 300m in forgone
interest. The Pounds 800m cost for businesses is half handling expenses, and
half forgone interest.
The study estimates, however, that in spite of the costs, Britain's
cash-handling system is cheaper than the system in either France or Germany.

FT  18 OCT 93 / Threat to 400,000 jobs in Europe's auto parts sector - Study
finds 'alarming' gap in productivity with Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 400,000 jobs are likely to be shed in the European Community's
automotive components industry by 2000, according to a confidential report
prepared for the European Commission.
EC producers have failed to close an 'alarming gap' in productivity in
recent years, says the study, which claims European components makers
achieve only a third of the productivity of Japan's industry.
The report, The Evolving Competitive Challenge for the European Automotive
Components Industry, has been prepared by the Boston Consulting Group for
the EC industry directorate.
It suggests employment in EC automotive components groups - now around
940,000 - 'is likely to decline by at least 40 per cent up to 1999'.
This would be the 'absolute minimum for the industry to be viable after
1999', says the report.
The study, which has been circulated among leading European components
producers, was ordered by the Commission as part of its investigation into
the competitiveness of the European auto industry. Its findings are due to
be presented to a meeting of the EC Council of Industry Ministers in
mid-November.
The European motor industry is already in turmoil, as vehicle makers and
components suppliers seek to restructure to cope with the deep recession and
the growing long-term challenge from producers in Japan and the US.
Many leading European vehicle makers such as Volkswagen, Peugeot and Fiat,
and components makers such as Robert Bosch, Mannesmann and Magneti Marelli
are in loss and are being forced to reduce their workforces.
The competitiveness of the components sector is vital to the future success
of European vehicle makers, as components bought from outside suppliers
often account for 60-70 per cent of a car's final cost.
The report says the structure of the EC components industry 'is likely to
change radically' with a clear movement to a tiered structure similar to
that in Japan.
'A concentration of first-tier suppliers to around 500 principal ones in
Europe is probable, with only between two and six main competitors in the EC
for most key sub-systems,' it says.
The number of companies operating as second- or third-tier suppliers may
fall by up to a third, warns the study.
Individual carmakers have already taken drastic action to cut the number of
their direct suppliers from around 1,250 on average in 1988 to 900 now, but
the number is expected to drop again to around 400 by 1997.
The greatest challenge to improve productivity in the industry lies among
the second-tier suppliers, often small and medium-sized companies 'where
awareness of means to improve competitiveness is least advanced', says the
report.
The Commission is monitoring the progress made by the European auto industry
in the seven-year transition period to the end of 1999, when all
restrictions on direct imports of Japanese cars and light commercial
vehicles from Japan are due to be removed.
EC carmakers are unhappy, however, with the Commission's handling of the
monitoring of vehicle imports from Japan, which came into operation at the
start of the year.
They say it is unacceptable for Japanese carmakers to be increasing their
share of the EC car market, when the industry is suffering its worst sales
decline since the second world war.
In the first nine months of this year the Japanese share of the west
European car market rose to 12.4 per cent from 11.9 per cent a year earlier.
In the same period, new car sales in west Europe have fallen 15.7 per cent
year-on-year, while truck sales fell by 26.5 per cent in the first six
months.

FT  16 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Dissident claims strong supportas row brews
up at Baldwin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHAREHOLDER row is brewing at Baldwin, the holidays, printing and
properties group, writes David Blackwell.
Mr Martin Moir, who is thought to hold about Pounds 100,000 of the stock,
has sent a letter to Mr Ong Beng Seng, the Singapore entrepreneur whose
Augsburg Investments has nearly 22 per cent of Baldwin.
The letter, dated October 18, and being circulated to shareholders, urges Mr
Ong Beng Seng 'to intervene and restore Baldwin plc's reputation and
institutional backing' or to sell his stake.
Mr Sandy Singh, Baldwin's chief executive, confirmed yesterday that he had
seen the letter to shareholders, but added: 'At the end of the day, the
board has no control over who buys and sells shares in Baldwin.'
Mr Moir could not be contacted yesterday. Mr Ong Beng Seng, who runs the Kuo
International trading group and owns the Halkin Hotel in London's Belgravia,
is travelling in the Far East until Wednesday.
Mr Moir claims to have received a large number of letters of support from
other shareholders. His main complaint appears to be the fall in value of
Baldwin's shares.
'In the five years before you became de facto controlling shareholder of
Baldwin plc, the share price rose from 10p to Pounds 1 or more,' he writes
in the letter.
'In the four or five years since you have been de facto controlling
shareholder the price had fallen from over Pounds 1 to around 73p per share
when I first wrote to you in August.' The shares closed yesterday at 89p, up
1p. Baldwin, which earlier this year acquired the Muswell's chain from
Allied-Lyons for Pounds 2.65m, reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.25m for
the half-year to April 30.

THE head of sales and distribution at Audi, the Volkswagen group's luxury
car division, has left the company after less than a year.
Mr Eckart Ramthun, recently hired from Daimler-Benz, left 'by mutual
agreement', Audi said. However, he appeared to be the latest victim of
relentless pressure within the group for a rapid return to profit.
Audi, formerly run by Mr Ferdinand Piech until he was installed as group
chairman in January, is believed to be heading for a substantial loss this
year.
Its sales in western Europe slumped 26 per cent between January and the end
of September, compared with falls of less than 20 per cent for Mercedes-Benz
and BMW. The overall car market is down around 16 per cent, while total VW
group deliveries have dropped 22 per cent.
Mr Ramthun was brought in by Mr Franz-Josef Kortum, a former regional sales
executive for Mercedes, who was chosen by Mr Piech as his successor at the
group's hitherto most successful subsidiary.
Mr Ramthun's departure follows the recent resignation of Mr Juan Antonio
Diaz Alvarez, chairman of the group's Spanish subsidiary, Seat, amid an
internal storm over looming Seat losses of DM1.25bn (Pounds 508m) this year.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Hungary privatisation bid to boost share ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY is to extend state shareholdings worth Ft100bn (Pounds 682m) in 70
companies on concessionary terms to small investors, in an effort to broaden
share ownership and privatisation.
The initial wave of sales, to be formally announced next week will see
shares worth Ft5bn in eight profitable companies floated on the Budapest
stock exchange in January.
First on the block are minority stakes in the Pannonia, Soproni and Borsodi
breweries, the Pannonia, Eravis and Hungaria hotel chains, plastics producer
Pannonplast and bottled gas distributor Primagaz.
Every adult Hungarian paying a nominal Ft2000 entrance fee will be entitled
to a Ft100,000 interest-free credit facility which can be used to subscribe
to the offerings.
The scheme, devised by Schroders, the UK investment bank, allows repayments
to be spread over five years and no security is required beyond the
purchased shares themselves.
The design of the programme may leave the government holding the risk and
ultimate ownership of shares that are sold, some observers fear. An OECD
report concluded that the new privatisation investment facility was
'seriously flawed.'
Nevertheless, the authorities hope the generous terms will attract 1m of
Hungary's 10m population.
Hungary's privatisation drive has until recently been heavily reliant on
foreign investors. General Electric's purchase of light producer Tungsram in
1990 led a host of big western multinationals into Hungary.
These acquisitions helped the government privatise 18 per cent of the state
enterprise sector by the end of last year and have taken foreign investment
to over Dollars 5.5bn (Pounds 3.6bn), more than half the total inflow into
eastern Europe.
But foreign interest in manufacturing investments has waned as the cherries
of Hungarian industry have been picked. At the same time, political
sensitivity about foreign domination and attacks against the privatisation
process have intensified.
The qualified success of the Czech voucher privatisation scheme has also
encouraged Hungary's more modest version of popular capitalism.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Mousse ado about nothing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I WAS called into the Treasury this week for another briefing by Britain's
best-known trencherman and voluptuary: the cube-shaped Kenneth Clarke,
chancellor of the exchequer and de facto prime minister. It is Mr Cube, not
John Major, who is now calling the shots in the highest cabinet echelons.
This was my second meeting with the chancellor, and it went just like the
first. We ate and drank enormously, and laughed until the tears ran.
'Help yourself to a groaning platter,' said the chancellor when I greeted
him, 'and don't spare the horses, hah hah hah hah hah.' As usual, there was
a huge walnut sideboard on each side of his desk, the first bearing an
extensive display of traditional English foodstuffs, the second buckling
under the weight of assembled ciders and ales.
'Only the best English fare,' shouted the chancellor cheerily. 'None of that
muck from Anton Mosimann. Pulses and grains? Organic protein? Meat-free
recipes? Spinach gnocchi? Shrimp and veggie couscous? Don't make me weep.
Have some of that hot-pot with a splodge of boiled tongue. There is
Christmas pud for afters. You haven't heard it's Christmas? It's always
Christmas here] Dear oh dear gorblimey] Get yourself stuck in, lad.'
After an hour of this fun, I tried to steer the chancellor towards a brief
chat about the economy. But you can't stir Mr Cube. Fire a toy gun at the
chancellor and he retaliates with ballistic missiles.
I said: 'Are you worried about the economy? What about those pundits who
reckon you have an easy escape route from your public deficit nightmare?'
'F'instance?'
'Well, Anatole Kaletsky, who wrote recently that release from the public
deficit nightmare - using the word ironically - was readily available, just
as it was from the 'nightmare' of the ERM. He recommends four things: 'Cut
interest rates sharply; raise taxes moderately, but in politically
uncontroversial ways; allow the pound to float; and keep down the growth of
unit wage costs.' Ideally, says Anatole, you should slash interest base
rates by three full points to take them back to levels last seen in the
1950s. Why don't you do that, chancellor? Are you a man or a mousse?'
'Kaletsky Smaletsky]' roared the chancellor. 'You're both as daft as pegs. I
have told you before, lad: the only things wrong with the economy are things
inside your head. You go around in a dream. I assume you're taking pills.
Double the dose at once, lad. There was a period of roughness. A breeze
across the millpond. But all of that's behind us. The economy is a success.
The country's in finest fettle, roaring away like the clappers. How many
times must I tell you?
'All these cut-and-run johnnies who are telling me to slash interest rates,
slash this, slash that, haven't an ounce of political nous or any traction
in the real world. Dear oh dear gorblimey] What is needed now, and for years
and years ahead, is stolidity and gumption. A firm hand on the tiller. No
one rocking the boat. Steady as she goes, lad. Try that orange custard. It's
one of Mrs Raffald's, from 1769. Yummie yummie yum-yum.'
Sveltely, I changed the subject. I said: 'Do you still expect us to believe
that John Major has your undiluted loyalty?'
The chancellor replied mock-gruffly: 'My position is perfectly clear. I
stand four-square behind John Major.'
'With a machete in your hand?'
'With a bottle of halibut oil.'
Given that Mr Cube is now the de facto prime minister, I sought to quiz him
on a number of other topics that ought to be close to a paramount leader's
heart. I said: 'How do you think the government is doing in terms of foreign
policy?'
'Absolutely splendidly,' he said. 'An unsung renaissance.'
'Defence?'
'Positively wonderfully.'
'Trade?'
'Quite brilliantly.'
'Social and welfare policy?'
'Nine out of 10.'
'Health?'
'Inexpressively marvellously.'
'Crime?'
'Undeniably promisingly.'
'Arts?'
'I believe we can say magnanimously.'
'Sport?'
'Without a doubt excitingly. Have you tried that shortcake? It's soaked in
peach liqueur.'
Vote Labour next election? I do not see how we could dare.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Private View: The man who put religion back in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE babushki peering through a picket fence at the rubble of a dynamited
church changed the life of Michael Bourdeaux. He was serving as an Anglican
curate in Middlesex when his former tutor passed him samizdat documents
obtained via Paris. The documents described how a group of Orthodox monks in
the Ukraine, branded by the Communist authorities as homosexual, drunk,
parasitic vagrants, had been evicted from the Pachaev Lavra monastery and
dumped in the forest.
The curate decided to investigate.
He was a Russophile who had learned the language as an 18-year-old national
serviceman. After modern languages and theology at Oxford he had spent a
year at Moscow University among the children of the Soviet elite, one the
first British students to profit from a cultural agreement between Nikita
Krushchev and Harold Macmillan.
'I had no agenda, no illusions,' he says of that time. 'Some of my very best
friends were members of the Komsomol. What I learned about Russia I did not
learn from books but from conversations with ordinary people - plus my own
two feet.'
One of the things he learned was that Krushchev, to appease hardliners upset
by his denunciation of Stalin, had instituted a campaign of religious
repression fiercer than anything since the 1930s.
So when the samizdat fell into his hands four years later, in 1964, he
sought out friends in Moscow. They directed him to the ruins of the church
of St Peter and Paul, blown up the previous week.
'The atmosphere on the square was appalling. Everyone was frightened. Around
the rubble there was a wooden fence and some old women were looking through.
I went up to one of them and asked: 'Can you tell me what's happened?'
'She jumped.' Canon Michael Bourdeaux threw his arms in the air to
illustrate. 'I said: 'I am a foreigner. If you're afraid, don't worry, I
won't talk to you.' She turned to me: 'Afraid? On the contrary, we need
you.' She put her arm on my shoulder and said 'Come with us.''
Keeping a discreet distance, Bourdeaux followed the women to a house in the
suburbs. They asked him why he had come to Russia. He said he was a
Christian who wanted to find out about the persecution. Pressed further, he
told them about the Ukrainian documents.
'They asked who wrote them. I named the three authors. They just collapsed
in tears and said: 'We wrote those documents.''
To discharge this personal commission, as he calls it, Canon Bordeaux
decided that, rather than campaign, he should set up an academic research
body to monitor religious freedom in what was then the Soviet bloc. He and
Keston Research are acknowledged experts and, although financially depleted
by the collapse of Communism, continue to watch developments.
But Bordeaux, who devoted his life to the cause of religious freedom, is
today disappointed to the point of bitterness by events in post-Communist
Russia.
'One of the great moments of human history has been missed,' he told me this
week. 'It was the great ecumenical opportunity of the 20th century and it's
been blown because of the hardness of the attitude of the Orthodox
hierarchy. They were quite unprepared for freedom.'
Is that because they were puppets of the old regime?
'Only a number, a very small number. But there was a kind of Soviet mind-set
within the hierarchy. When the system collapsed they felt the great moment
had arrived for re-establishing the unchallenged supremacy of Orthodoxy.
'That's not how it is, and it's not how it's going to be in the future
Russia. Russia is going to be a pluralistic society. I love deeply the
Orthodox church and its tradition but I do not love its attitude.'
The Russian Orthodox is at loggerheads with the Roman Catholics and alarmed
by the success of western evangelical sects - especially dollar-backed
American imports. Its leaders have been pressing Boris Yeltsin to sign a
statute passed by the demolished parliament that would re-create a state
watchdog body, require religions to re-register and restrict the proselytism
of the interlopers.
If the mediation of Patriarch Alexi II had not failed, and the tanks not
moved against the White House, that law might be in force.
Aren't some manifestations of the religious revival rather ugly: the
nationalism, for example?
'What you describe is the fringe of a fringe. That has nothing to do with
the heartbeat of Orthodoxy. Pamyat (the ultra-nationalist movement) uses
religion for its own purposes.'
What about anti-semitism?
'That has got slightly further into the churches. I have heard Russian
bishops come out with anti-semitic remarks which would be totally
unacceptable in a western society, and they are not even aware of what
they're saying. There is anti-semitism. It's there in Russian society.'
Is religion not a disruptive factor in a country trying to achieve
democratic stability?
'I couldn't agree with that. Because religion, at least potentially, is a
uniting factor rather than a divisive one. What one looks for, but at the
moment doesn't find, is a Christian leadership which says Christians are
going to be very positive.'
Isn't Russian Christianity rather primitive?
'I think the answer to that has to be a qualified 'yes'. This is not
entirely its own fault. There was a great element of superstition in it
before the Revolution, alongside a lot that was good. The ethics and morals
were admirable. Communism threw out the superstition and threw out the good
as well.
'Christianity actually led the way in the democratic process in Russia,' he
continued. 'It played a far greater role in keeping the flame of freedom
alight than you realise.'
Religious dissidents, including Jews, had helped inspire secular democrats
in and out of prison, he said. Lithuanian demonstrators shot on the streets
of Vilnius in 1991 were all Christians.
So the Kremlin was right to fear Christianity?
'I used to say Christians only wanted to improve things in society, not
overthrow it. I must have said that hundreds of times in public. Now I am
not quite sure I was right.'
What Bourdeaux fears most is an alliance between former communists - 'even
the best like Yeltsin' - and the would-be theocrats of the Orthodox Church.
'I would be terrified of that, a unity between church and state.'
You'd get a sort of fascism?
'Yes, you could have a kind of Russian nationalist fascism, backed by the
church. There are elements in the church that would welcome it.'
Do you believe that only religion can provide the moral basis for democracy?
'The human race has not evolved any more stable or satisfactory system of
governing a society than one where the basic social morality is based on the
Christian faith.
'There is a tremendous possibility for implementing precisely that in Russia
today. That is why I am so profoundly disturbed and shocked that the
different Christian groups are not able to work with each other.'
Do you mean atheism is not a moral position?
'I would say yes to that. Individual atheists have a strong individual
morality - I wouldn't dream of saying otherwise. But there is no
sufficiently common set of principles within humanism or atheism for society
as a whole.'
Does that mean our increasingly atheistic democracies in the West will fail?
'Don't ask me to analyse our own society,' the canon replied. 'But what
disturbs me is this tremendous instability. The Church - and I don't see
where else it's going to come from - has been unable to give young people a
kind of social cohesion. I don't see that our politicians are solving that
problem - and certainly our church leaders are not solving it either.'

FT  16 OCT 93 / Arts: 'Katya' in Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WEEK after we were told that the 'permissive society' has failed, it is
instructive to be reminded what life could be like before it. Janacek's
Katya Kabanova is set on the banks of the Volga in 19th-century Russia,
where moral rectitude is obsessively observed and any who transgress its
rules are ostracised, even hounded to death.
No opera composer has made more headway in public esteem since the war.
Every opera company in Britain wants to have some Janacek in its repertoire,
especially Katya Kabanova, of which Scottish Opera's new production is only
the most recent of quite a number. Clearly late 20th-century audiences
respond to the theme of a woman who suffers at the hands of the morally
righteous. Verdi's La traviata was a predecessor, Janacek's Katya is the
next down the line, more obviously modern and psychologically intense.
It is that sense of a mind under pressure, of nerve endings sensitive to the
touch, which gives Janacek's music its individual voice. The Glyndebourne
production of a few years ago caught that aspect particularly well by
combining a near expressionist visual style with keen, tense music-making.
At the Theatre Royal in Glasgow, the conductor Richard Armstrong prefers to
play the music in more conventionally dramatic terms.
In that, he was equally at one with his production, which is beautiful and
atmospheric, but the most traditional I have seen. The designer, Richard
Aylwin, sees the opera as taking place in a windswept, misty marshland,
where people thread their way through pools of water and clumps of
bullrushes. There is enough evidence to suggest that Janacek intended the
season to be spring. This production made it winter, but no matter. The
designs are distinctive and of high quality.
As they suggest, the story is to be taken simply, at face value. There can
be few British sopranos who are better suited to the role of the life-loving
Katya than Helen Field. Her voice is of the right scale and the personality
well suited, but much of what she could offer remains untapped in Mark
Brickman's production. At the key moments she is constantly asked to gaze
longingly at the sky or throw her arms out wide - not the wrong movements,
but so standard, so conventional, where Janacek's unique Katya is asking for
something new and fresh.
Between the two men in her life it was difficult to tell the difference.
Anthony Roden as her feeble husband and Richard Brunner as the man who
brings love briefly into her life were equally burly, nondescript figures,
though Brunner should be commended for managing the high tenor part of Boris
with so few difficulties. The younger couple of lovers was played with
delightful naturalness by Elizabeth McCormack and Iain Paton.
The moral majority is embodied by Kabanicha, the fearsome mother-in-law, who
says of poor adulterous Katya that 'women like that should be buried alive'.
Many sopranos turn her into a monster. Elizabeth Vaughan, still possessing a
voice of authority, underplayed her - just. The suggestion that she gives
her old suitor Dikoy a good whipping was only mildly over the top. The smile
of satisfaction as she pulled her son off his dead wife's body made one's
stomach sink.
Every word of her short address to the watching crowd at the scene of the
suicide was absolutely clear, but then so was most of Norman Tucker's
English translation. Whatever its shortcomings, this production tells the
story of Katya Kabanova very clearly. Any judgment on the issues it raises
is left to the audience.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Arts: A pilgrimage to Van Gogh - William Packer visits the
little cafe in Auvers-sur-Oise where the artist died
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUVERS-SUR-OISE is a village some 12 miles north-west of Paris strung out
along the road from Pontoise to the west, with the hills behind it and the
river before. The traffic apart, it still retains much of the character that
attracted such painters as Cezanne, Bernard, Pissarro and Daubigny, more
than 100 years ago. There, for two months in the summer of 1890, came
Vincent van Gogh: and there, towards the end of July, in the cornfields
above the village, close by the cemetery, he shot himself.
He had been staying at the Auberge Ravoux, a small cafe in the centre of the
village that let rooms to artists for a pittance. It was to there that he
was brought back from the fields, and there, after lying for two days in his
tiny room, that he died.
In 1985 the house was listed as an historic monument, since when its present
owner, a Belgian, Dominique-Charles Janssens, has set himself to its
restoration. It opened to the public in mid-September, its ground-floor
still a working restaurant, its upper floors converted to its purposes as,
in its way, a place of pilgrimage.
Van Gogh's own room, on the top floor at the corner of the back stairs, is
of course the focus of all interest. It is no more than a cell, truly tiny
with its only window high in the ceiling. It has been left entirely bare,
stripped down to the grey plaster marked only by the holes of nails long ago
knocked in to hold up pictures - the sense of the reliquary to the
credulously devout not altogether inappropriate. It is infinitely touching,
the judgment not to turn the place into a sort of tableau entirely right.
The room next door, which had been taken at the time by another painter, a
young Dutchman, Anton Hirschig, who nursed Van Gogh through those last days,
is furnished simply with chair and narrow bed to give a scale.
The visit ends with a slide-anthology of Van Gogh's Auvers paintings,
pointed with quotations from his letters to his brother, Theo. It is very
well done, but be warned - so small is the place that visitors are let in
only four or five at a time, and the show follows only when a score or so
are assembled, which does tend to hold up the queue waiting outside. It is a
system that needs radical rethinking.
But no visit to Auvers should be to the Auberge Ravoux alone. Entrance is
from the lane behind the house that leads on, by way of the wooden steps,
familiar from the painting - Vincent produced some 70 paintings during those
last two months - through the upper village to the great church of Our Lady
at the top. That is the subject of one of the most celebrated of all his
works, the monumental pile rearing up red and ochre against the deep
ultramarine of the sky. At the very point at which he worked the Commune has
put up a reproduction of the work itself, discreetly mounted, just as it has
at several such points about the place.
But the final object of pilgrimage must be Van Gogh's grave, which we reach
by following 'la route de la cortege,' on past the church and up the hill.
There on the open plain at the top is the cemetery, from the corner of which
we look back down and across the fields, just as Van Gogh did himself, to
the roofs of the cottages tucked in a fold in the hill.
Vincent lies hard against the far wall, with his brother beside him, who
died but six months later. Their graves could hardly be simpler, two low and
simple headstones, Ici reste Vincent Van Gogh, Ici reste Theo Van Gogh. And
over them both, as over a double-bed, is thrown what can only be described
as a dense duvet of ivy, neatly trimmed as though tucked in, grown from a
cutting taken long ago by Theo's widow from the garden of Vincent's friend
in the village, Doctor Gachet. She had brought her husband's body to France
in 1914, to lie beside that of his brother: and ivy is the symbol of
brotherly love.
Over the wall, the cornfields roll away and the crows hang in the wind, just
as they did a century ago.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Arts: Strange operatic affairs in New York - Paul Griffiths
finds an imp, an icon and a biblical story celebrating New York City Opera's
50th anniversary; meanwhile Boston Lyric Opera put on a spirited 'Puritani'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS

<TEXT>
ONE WOULD have to be a very loyal supporter of New York City Opera to get
excited about the three works it has just staged in celebration of its 50th
anniversary. This week-long event was billed as a 'World Premiere Festival',
though one of the pieces, Lukas foss's Griffelkin, had received its first
performance back in 1955, when it was a 50-minute television opera based on
a tale his German mother had told him - a boy devil is sent to earth to make
mischief, but discovers it is much more fun to be human and good. In that
form, as a musical entertainment for children, the piece might possibly have
had some usefulness, but expanded to double the length, and spread out over
three acts before an audience almost wholly of grown-ups, it turned into an
embarrassment.
Foss did not help his work's case by referring to it as 'American Mozart'.
Whatever that might be, this is not it: one might think rather of Bernstein
and Menotti, heavily diluted, since the revised score still has a distinctly
1950s sound. One might also think - given that this is the story of an
impish boy whose pranks turn sour on him - of L'enfant et les sortileges,
though this is to raise the stakes to a point where Griffelkin turns to
nothing. It has little charm and less wit, and its deficiencies could not be
disguised by the effort and skill in the presentation.
Susan Branch provided some cheerful costumes for the things brought to life
by Griffelkin's magic; a pair of stone lions, a letterbox, a teddy bear.
Diana Daniele did her stuff as hell's grandmother. And Robin Tabachnik gave
an outstandingly, sprightly performance as the fooling deamon, though the
effect of her bright and unaffected singing was to intensify the wish that
we had all been there for the Ravel.
Of the two truly new operas, Ezra Laderman's Marilyn had received most of
the advance publicity, which is just as well, since nobody is going to be
very interested in it afterwards. The libretto was by Norman Rosten, who
knew Monroe, and who supplied his composer with a morality play of
two-handed scenes in which the central character is seen with others who are
mostly types (Photographer, Psychiatrist, Mogul, Senator), mostly male, and,
with wearying inevitability, mostly exploitative.
Laderman's music slumbered along beneath all this, occasionally making the
effort - doomed - to kick itself into life with a ragtime dance or a
rhapsodic love duet: perhaps the intention was to convey the dulled senses
of one low on barbiturates and alcohol. Once again, a lot had to be supplied
by the performers. Hal France, conducting, gave every sign that he at least
thought this a great show. Kathryn Gamberoni, at the centre, was given
nothing interesting to sing in a long role, but she created a minor
sensation as a Monroe look-alike.
Set beside its two companions, Hugo Weisgall's Esther was something of a
triumph. It worked. It did what it set out to do, which was to project the
biblical story straightforwardly and vividly, with music used to give a high
definition to each of the characters, through scenes maintaining a decisive
musical-dramatic momentum from beginning to end of each of the three acts.
There was no pussy-footing about accessibility or eclecticism. Weisgall, at
the age of 81 and with nine other operas behind him, goes on writing
hard-edged, hard-nosed twelve-note music - the kind of music that maybe
Verdi would have written if he had had Schoenberg for a teacher. Charles
Kondek's libretto, worded with simple clarity and cunning only in its fluid
continuity from scene to scene, evidently had provided the composer with
stimulus and support.
With three new productions opening on successive nights, it was necessary
that all the operas be played on the same elementary set of a few platforms
and sliding panels, but the resulting reliance on costume and projection was
effective in the case of Esther. Lauren Flanigan was excellent in conveying
both dramatic fortitude and close maternal warmth in the title part -
'perhaps the only true heroine I have ever put on stage', according to the
composer.
But, as so often, much of the best music goes to the wicked. Vashti, the
vindictive queen whom Esther has replaced, has a violent solo scene in the
first act, backed by an orchestra of steel, and Robynne Redmon gave it a
thrilling go. Also excellent was Allan Glassman as the chief courtier and
plotter Haman, showing his strong, dark tenor like a sword.
While the Opera Company of Boston, long and famously run by Sarah Caldwell,
is in the doldrums, Boston Lyric Opera has taken up the torch, at least for
three bursts of activity spaced through the season. It shares a music
director with the Opera Theatre of Saint Louis - Stephen Lord - and seem
seems to have caught too the Saint Louis knack of finding excellent young
singers and the odd unexpected piece. Last spring it gave a new chance to
Carlisle Floyd's 1958 opera Wuthering Heights; and it has just performed,
for the first time in America, the version of I Puritani that Bellini
revised for a Naples production that never happened.
The point of the show - as surely it is the point of the piece - is the
singing. In Mika Shigematsu the company has an Elvira who, though slight of
stature, lacks nothing in presence as a voice. She is beautifully in tune,
and so expert in the vocal filigree as to be able to take risks in how she
phrases and slurs: most she wins; one or two (low-register upward glissandos
that slip from Bellini to Kurt Weill) are more surprising. In colour her
basic quality is cold and bright - aptly so for a character touched by the
moon - but the effect is softened by her musicality and by her restraint.
This is virtuosity at work, not virtuosity on display, and the effect is at
once touching and admirable.
There are also excellent performances from Paul Groves as Arturo and from
Raymond Aceto as Giorgio. Groves is a cultivated artist, with a
sophisticated tone that seems with him to have become natural; only very
rarely can a wide leap catch him off balance. Aceto is a real singing bass,
and projects the wise uncle as a singer, a man whose assuring balm is music.
This is strikingly right for the piece. None of these characters can be
imagined as other than vocal beings. Some imagining along those lines had,
however, been going on in Nicholas Muni's production, though thankfully not
much, and that generally only at the beginnings of scenes, which then
appeared to manage themselves with assistance only from the singers and from
Lord's spirited conducting.
On the virtues of the Neapolitan version, this production does not have a
lot to contribute: the biggest difference is that Riccardo is a tenor, not a
baritone, and here he is outshone by Groves's Arturo for the wrong reasons.
But with three outstanding and intelligent performers in the principal
roles, the opera itself is proudly vindicated.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Arts: More Brits abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FLAMENCO MUSIC plays as you enter the Arts theatre, and Viva Espana] is the
title. But, as the subtitle (The Ibiza Musical) hints, this musical is not
about Spain or Spaniards or Spanish culture - it's about Brits (18-30) on
holiday abroad, in this case in Spain. Funny: I came to the performance
after an arts committee meeting where one bigwig had said 'You must always
begin by understanding that the British are (a) philistine and (b)
xenophobic. Without mastering these two facts, we can make no progress.'
Viva Espana], written and directed by John Burrows and Rick Lloyd, agrees
with that all right.
Who cares about the Spaniards anyway? We're here for sex, sun, booze, and -
er - that's all. One character, already well plastered, actually yells at a
local: 'I fought Mrs Fatcher told you lot. If you're joinin' the Common
market, you've got to muck in. You're just poncin' about bein' Spanish.' One
man, deciding for a change to make it with someone outside his group, dances
with a local, only to discover rather late that his partner is a
transvestite: 'a spic poof]' Thank God for Wendy and Abby and Angie and Babs
and Sarah - you know where you are with them.
What makes all this acrid satire palatable is that Viva Espana] is a pop
musical with high spirits, generously sung and sharply delivered by the cast
of eight. While the words show you how callow and unreflective each of these
characters is, the music - in a variety of post-Presley pop styles - catches
their energy and freshness. Certain ensembles really capture the tribal,
atavistic, drive that young Brits show in large groups; and some solos show
the plaintive feelings of individuals at odds with the crowd.
In short, the show gets under the skins of its characters while also
standing outside them: a rarer and finer achievement in musicals these days
than you might suppose. Admittedly, Viva Espana] is not an important show.
Its tunes have no particular originality, some of its lyrics are repeated
too often, some of its satire could go deeper. But I like its spirit:
bright-eyed but double-edged.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Arts: Fiac, twenty years on - Nicholas Powell finds
optimistic sellers but low prices for contemporary art in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AGAINST THE background of unprecedented economic gloom Paris's contemporary
art fair, the Fiac, is celebrating its 20th anniversary in the Grand Palais.
One hundred and fifty dealers, 10 fewer than last year, are taking part in
the week-long fair which ends tomorrow night, and many big international
galleries have stayed away. Sales at the Fiac tumbled from FFr400m in 1989
to only FRr100m last year. One stallholder, the Banque de la Cite, which
holds the accounts of 530 Paris galleries, says it is owed FRr300m in
outstanding loans and that two-thirds of its gallery clients are in
financial difficulties.
Regularly inaugurated nowadays by government ministers, the Fiac began
quietly in 1974 when only 9,000 people attended. The following year's event
was marked by a 'happening' staged by Austrian artist Hermann Nitsch
involving a cow's carcase and lots of blood.
With such bohemian capers well behind them, organisers asked galleries this
year to stage shows illustrating major art movements of the past two
decades. Eighty have put on exhibitions of one or two artists, often of a
museum-like quality, although few have respected the 1974-1993 period.
Prices meanwhile are the lowest most people can remember.
Galerie Jan Krugier from Geneva is showing drawings by Picasso from the
early 1920s, during his so-called 'Ingres' period alongside drawings by
Ingres himself - a fascinating juxtaposition of high quality works. The
Florence gallery, the Vivita, has some very fine pieces by Picabia and
Galerie Gmurzynska from Cologne is showing costume designs, oil paintings,
photographic portraits and sculptures by Soviet 'suprematists' Alexander
Rodchenko and Varvara Stepanova, all but one of which featured on the Soviet
stand in the Universal Exhibition in Paris in 1925. Annely Juda Fine Art,
one of five British dealers at the Fiac, is showing works by the same
artists as well as by their suprematist colleagues, Malevich and Lissitsky.
Just a little more modern, Galerie Boulakia of Paris has a show of
surrealist works by Ernst, Matta and Lam while Parisian Marwan Hoss has
devoted his stand to paintings - stark urban scenes with stylised figures
and oppressive architecture - and sculptures of the past 10 years by the
Argentinian Antonio Segui priced at FFr45,000 to FFr250,000. 'They say we
are brave to put on one-man shows. But people enjoy them, and buy,' Hoss
said.
Others are doing good business. Galerie de France of Paris showing five
whimsical mechanical sculptures by German artist Rebecca Horn, priced at
FFr200,000-FRr300,000 and made especially for the Fiac, rapidly sold three
to museums and a private collector.
London's Crane Kalman Gallery, over for its second successive Fiac with a
display of classical British modern art including works by Graham
Sutherland, William Scott, Mary Newcomb, Jenny Franklin and Ray Richardson,
made a number of sales and received a range of offers from collectors.
There may be no 'happening' or cow's carcase in this year's Fiac. But to
keep silliness alive, Canadian gallery Olga Korper is selling reproductions
of the Mona Lisa's mouth. Video artist Suzanne Giroux claims Leonardo da
Vinci painted the lips to resemble the back and buttocks of a young man if
held vertically. Each reproduction costs FFr100,000 and there are only eight
for sale.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Arts: Applause for a modern work - Music in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SERIOUS new works are rarely greeted with such delight as the Festival hall
audience accorded this week to a new violin concerto by the British
composer, Nicholas Maw.
The work was premiered last month in America (where Maw more or less resides
now) and heard in Britain on Thursday. It seems that he has had such a
concerto vaguely in mind for many years, but was inspired to get on with it
only when the young American violinist Joshua Bell (much praised in these
pages since we first heard him) came upon the scene. That was a good idea.
The result was a lovely piece, and the audience loved it.
There are composers who break radical new ground, like (say) Harrison
Birtwistle, whilst others, like Maw, are content to sow new seeds in
familiar landscapes. The landscape where Maw has always found himself at
home is English and specifically English-lyrical, intimate rather than epic
(despite the scale of his recent orchestral Odyssey), a place for a humane
personality to flourish. Barely younger than Birtwistle, he matured in the
same late-1950s musical ferment, but radical novelties are never what mark
his music.
Instead it sings, on and on and on: Maw is notorious for underestimating the
time his latest piece will take to play. Tunes spring up everywhere,
sometimes reassuringly tonal and sometimes not. But not at random; most of
them will be close cousins to many of the others, stretching out new leaves
and altered contours in a cogent (though unforeseeable) order. Therein lies
the developing sense of the music. Maw is now so much a master of that
songful vein that it hardly matters which overall form he elects.
The shape of the Violin Concerto is traditional as could be: a gently
expository Prelude (composed last) is followed by a virtuoso Scherzo
(composed first) and a confessionally intense Romanza, and then a seemingly
lightweight Rondo with a racing coda. The forms, however, are mere frames
for the expressive life of Maw's music, which pursues its way in a much
closer focus than that, moment by singing moment. Though the solo role is
generous, it requires a violinist of exactly Bell's gifts: brilliantly
equipped but not distractingly showy, able to mask his art under a guise of
innocent straight-speaking.
The Philharmonia and their conductor Leonard Slatkin collaborated in perfect
sympathy (no less than his alter-ego soloist, Maw's orchestra speaks
poignantly). This work should reward repeated hearings in the friendliest
way; we may hope that an international star like Bell can get it onto a CD
soon.
Slatkin also conducted a sensational Rite of Spring, so taut that it
squeaked. He had his own devices for pointing up Stravinsky's score - here
an unwritten breath-pause, there a grinding portamento: always well-taken in
principle, but in practice too self-conscious for a score which can speak
thunderously for itself.
Sponsored by Automotive &amp; Financial Group; Nicholas Maw's Concerto will be
performed again tonight in Swansea's Brangwyn Hall

FT  16 OCT 93 / Arts: Poet's brutal tyrant - Marlowe's 'Tamburlaine'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a paradox in Christopher Marlowe's Tamburlaine the Great which is
very hard to overcome on stage. How can the central character speak such
beautiful verse, yet be such a total tyrant?
When the RSC's current production was first performed at Stratford last
year, Terry Hands as director seemed to play down the verse and emphasise
the violence. The production was on the small stage of the Swan Theatre. Now
that it has reached the huge stage of the Barbican, which is where it
belongs, some of the problems have been resolved.
Antony Sher's Tamburlaine is as brutal as ever. Far from resembling the
Scythian shepherd of his origins, this Tamburlaine deliberately looks like a
wolf. In one scene he enters swinging on a rope just like Tarzan, kicking
down his enemies on the way. The Barbican has a space to let this be done
dramatically, as it has for all the other scenes of carnage. If you want to
mount an epic, do it on the grand scale.
The verse is still an obstacle, but I now see that there is a strong case
for the way Sher stammers or lisps slightly over some of the more exotic
names, like Zenocrate, Persopolis or Samarcanda. The tyrant is still in awe
of his conquests. Samarcanda, his native city, he never reaches.
Where the production becomes human rather than swashbuckling is in Part 2,
which is not always performed, Marlowe having written it later in response,
it is said, to popular demand. Tamburlaine is older now, almost at peace,
with three grown up sons, but Zenocrate is ailing. For a while he seems more
like part of a bourgeois family than the scourge of Asia. When Zenocrate
dies, the ransacking resumes with even greater fury, but there is still
humanity in the shape of the one son who does not want to fight.
Taken all in all, over the two parts, Sher's performance is magnificent. So
are some breathtaking stage effects designed by Johan Engels. If there is
still one quibble, it is that Zenocrate should be more conventionally
beautiful, yet there is no greater pleasure in the London theatre than when
the Barbican is playing deservedly to capacity. Here, it is.
*****
All's Well that Ends Well is Shakespeare's most mixed up play, and one of
the least performed. Yet no one could ever dispute the authorship. Almost
every scene contains a reference to what he had written before or what he
would write in future, including the Sonnets. There is a throwback to Romeo
and Juliet, for example, and more than a hint of Falstaff in Parolles, the
French nobleman turned coward .
It is as if Shakespeare was at a turning point, uncertain whether to write
tragedy or comedy, and not quite mature enough for the dignity of his final
plays such as The Tempest and The Winter's Tale.
The piece is worth seeing for its rarity value alone. Sir Peter Hall's RSC
production, which has moved to the Pit from Stratford, seems to me a trifle
on the heavy side. He plays up the darker elements. Still there is a very
fine countess from Barbara Jefford, and a haunting Parolles from Michael
Siberry. As the text dictates, Richard Johnson's King of France gets off to
a shaky start. Then he develops into the thoroughly experienced
Shakespearean actor we know him to be and almost holds the play together.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Arts: The British lead a merry dance - Sophie Constanti
witnesses some bad behaviour and great performances at the FIND in Montreal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SOPHIE CONSTANTI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH are famous for behaving badly when abroad. Consider the mob of
neo-Nazi football hooligans running riot this week in Amsterdam. Montreal is
not on the average British trouble-maker's list of Top 10 destinations; too
cold, too cultural, reluctantly bilingual and much too far from home. But at
the city's recent Festival International de Nouvelle Danse (FIND), some of
the invited British guests - dancers, choreographers, producers, promoters -
appeared hell-bent on being ill-mannered, unreliable, churlish and, on
occasion, thoroughly disagreeable. After a week of British impropriety and
contentiousness during a festival which lasts just 11 days, people began to
ask: 'What's wrong with the British? Why are they so rude?'
This year, FIND - initiated as a biannual event in 1985 but, since 1991,
presented every autumn - decided to turn the spotlight on British
choreographers. The programming committee, led by president Chantal
Pontbriand, secured an impressive, state-of-the-art quartet - Michael Clark,
DV8 Physical Theatre, Shobana Jeyasingh and Jonathan Burrows - and announced
the sixth Festival as 'an explosion of British dance.'
The first instance of this back-firing occurred on the opening night of the
festival when Michael Clark brought the curtain down on his own show,
Michael Clark's Modern Masterpiece, soon after the interval. An act of both
self-destruction and self-empowerment, it left Clark's audience baffled,
then quietly angered. But Montreal's dancegoers are an optimistic, tolerant
lot, and a small crowd turned up the morning after for Clark's
meet-the-choreographer session.
Clark then used the public platform as an opportunity to give an informative
and entertaining (if disjointed) lecture-demonstration. He talked about his
Royal Ballet School days and his first choreographic works, such as Do You
Me? I Did, and New Puritans; and he articulated the principles behind the
'pelvic technique' which he has developed and which now underpins his whole
philosophy of dance classicism. Out came the costume box, Clark casually
strapping on a dildo underneath his small apron and explaining the
significance of this attire whilst standing in arabesque.
It was a great performance and by the time he had finished all was forgiven.
But how did Pontbriand react to Clark pulling the plug on his own show? With
calm dignity, accepting without judgment his decision to stop the
performance because 'it felt like the right thing to do at the time.'
The following evening, DV8 Physical Theatre premiered its latest work, MSM,
a 90-minute play about cottaging, ie sex between men in public toilets, and
about the married, apparently heterosexual men who, according to statistical
evidence, are more inclined than gay men to go cottaging. Lloyd Newson,
DV8's founder and artistic director, had told the festival organisers that
MSM (socialogical shorthand for Men Seeking Men) was going to be a
text-based rather than movement-informed theatre piece. Pontbriand, quite
rightly, remained willing to present MSM, whatever its eventual shape or
form.
Audiences who had heard so much about Newson's more overtly-physical works,
such as Dead Dreams of Monochrome Men and If Only . . ., were divided after
the show. Some felt let down by the fact that MSM was a play, others were
further divided as to whether it was good or bad theatre. Having
acknowledged Newson's right to choose his medium, many found the perfect
complement to MSM a few blocks down the road at Cinema ONF, where film
adaptation of DV8's Strange Fish (another FIND coup) was being screened.
One thing that did seem to bother people was both DV8 and Clark's refusal to
take curtain-calls. At home, this convention has taken root without anyone
paying much attention. But in Montreal it deeply offended some members of
the public. One can respect Clark and Newson's decision to keep their
performers in the wings once the show is over - Clark admits that he has
never felt comfortable with the sound of applause. One must also, in trying
to make some sense of Clark's first-night party tricks, take note of the
fact that the choreographer was not really satisfied with the show he
brought to Montreal, having had to re-stage Modern Masterpiece in just a few
weeks with an almost entirely new cast.
But I am still searching for the logic behind John Ashford's vituperative
outbursts at a round-table discussion entitled 'The British New Dance:
Development and Perspectives'. Ashford, director of The Place Theatre,
London's most dance-dedicated venue, gave a speech tinged with loathing for
almost everyone and everything outside his own Eurodance network. It was an
odd mixture of paranoid specifics and sweeping generalisations which amused
some of the Canadian dance students in the audience, but served only to
alienate many of his British colleagues who were present. His comment that
'ballet is at the heart of all dance critics' interest' (he later changed
'all' to 'most') was delivered as if it were an indisputable truth, its
offensiveness exacerbated by a barrage of unprovoked verbal attacks mainly
directed towards one member of the panel.
Ashford, who later flew back to London to collect the Pounds 30,000 Digital
Premier Award, has done much to promote new and independent dance in Britain
and has forged important connections with the rest of Europe. In his April
in Paris and Turning World seasons, contemporary dance from across the globe
has been brought to our doorstep. But in his rude and public dismissal of
the views of other dance professionals, Ashford does neither himself nor
British dance any favours. He is a thorn in his own flesh. Ashford, however,
claims that there is a conspiracy to undermine contemporary dance in Britain
which threatens the proposed increase in Arts Council funding towards
contemporary dance. His main complaint is that even those people supposedly
sympathetic to contemporary dance have done nothing to retaliate against the
likes of government ministers and the ballet establishment. Indeed, Ashford
has a case, but his attitude is hardly conducive to building a united front.
Maybe the FIND got what it deserved. In 1989, when British dance was less
faction-ridden and more visionary, the festival refused to take a serious
interest, turning instead to the rest of Europe. Until this year, Pontbriand
had showcased only two British companies - Second Stride and Laurie Booth.
These days, many British choreographers, even established artists like Clark
and Newson, are more worried about their financial security and artistic
development than they were in pre-recession times. Intent upon looking after
Number One, their survival tactics are neither based upon nor seem to allow
room for good manners. British dance seems to have become an incurably
arrogant, desperate, badly-behaved animal - especially when it is abroad.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Arts: New organ put through its paces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ALLISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEWLY-opened organ in St John's, Smith Square is the first concert organ
to be built in London for four decades - the last was the Royal Festival
Hall monster - and on Thursday evening several notable organists swelled the
audience to hear Gillian Weir put it through its paces.
Her recital provided the first real test of the instrument's versatility. In
last week's gala inauguration concert the organ had featured only as part of
the celebration; and Simon Preston's recital the day after was an all-Bach
affair. By contrast, Weir's pot-pourri programme covered the spectrum from
Bach and his slightly senior contemporaries to Messiaen and some younger
20th-century composers.
There is no doubting the instrument's capabilities: in all areas of the
repertory it sounded eloquent, and the Bonn organ building firm of Klais has
matched it perfectly to the scale of the building. It is bright but not
strident in Baroque music; the action is alive to the demands of modern
works, and the stops are colourful. The fiery reeds are not too rough for
the Romantic repertory, but here the tracker action produces an intrusive
'chiff' in quieter passages and at times the pedal department seemed
underpowered.
The evening got off to a worrying start, with a dull Bruhns E minor Prelude
and Fugue. None of the threads of its rather disjointed structure was tied
together, and Miss Weir never allowed the music to take flight. Her account
of the Bach Passacaglia was unworthy - the playing messy, even frantic, the
registration unrelenting. For once there was no poetry or majesty in this
towering masterpiece.
But she more than redeemed herself with a dazzling account of the Belgian
Joseph Jongen's rhapsodic Sonata Eroica, making light of its virtuoso
demands. Most of the second half was devoted to post-1945 pieces, and all
were dispatched with ease and sensitivity. The organ responded equally well
to her incisively played set of Calvin Hampton dances and to the ethereal
bird-calls of Messiaen's 'Les Oiseaux et les sources' (from the Messe de la
pentecote). A highlight was the exhilarating Salamanca by Guy Bovet,
exotically coloured.
Saint-Saens's 'Echo' Fantaisie, a rousing finale, gave the audience another
chance to admire Miss Weir's dexterity at the console - St John's have even
installed an innovative projection screen which allowed us to witness it in
close-up. Indeed, the whole project blends state-of-the-art modern

FT  16 OCT 93 / Books: Thrills from the courtroom - Scott Turow and a new
genre of thriller
</HEADLINE>

PLEADING GUILTY
by Scott Turow
Viking Pounds 15.99, 386 pages
IN BRITAIN we have dear old Rumpole and John Mortimer's convivial,
best-selling, TV-mounted intrigues at the Old Bailey. From America we have a
very different kettle of fish - the eruption of a new genre of
lawyer-procedural thrillers.
There have of course been innumerable police-procedurals and private
eye-procedurals and spy-procedurals: the thriller seems to need a bedrock of
expert and ostensibly realistic detail on which to build its fantasies. But
the latest fashion has swept aside all rivals. The best-seller lists on both
sides of the Atlantic have recently been dominated by John Grisham and his
master, Scott Turow.
Both Grisham and Turow are, or were, practising American lawyers. They write
about what they know about, and they are not particularly interested in
writing, that is to say in the precise alignment of words so as to achieve a
higher end than a memorandum. But they are both convinced that their subject
and their expertise - the procedures of the American courtroom and the
investigations that precede those court hearings - are dramatically
compelling. If their sales figures are anything to judge by, they are right.
No doubt they benefit from the American awareness of the drama of the law,
established on the small screen from Perry Mason to LA Law. That is not a
British tradition, where cameras are denied entry to the courtroom.
Scott Turow showed the way with his 1987 novel Presumed Innocent. This
brilliantly-achieved thriller takes off from the extreme detail of the daily
workload of a deputy prosecuting attorney in a Midwest city who is
investigating the murder of a female colleague; suddenly, the hunter becomes
the hunted and finds himself charged with that same murder, a classic
reversal which produces a truly suspenseful denouement and an ingenious
final twist.
Turow followed this three years later with The Burden of Proof (also
available in Penguin paperback) in which he extended the legal thriller into
the murkier areas of the financial world. The plot revolved around
jiggery-pokery in the Futures markets: although not an entirely successful
book, it became an impassioned assault on the nonsenses of this particular
world and was a warning that Turow had messages to put across.
Another lawyer, John Grisham, had meanwhile entered the field. He now has
four books to his name; the best-known is The Firm, currently doing the
rounds as a successful film. Grisham is to Turow like a mere Follett to Le
Carre: Turow can write well when he wishes, Grisham never tries, though both
are good at dialogue (it is startling to observe how rarely Grisham attempts
a descriptive passage). The Firm has an ambitious young lawyer joining a
small Memphis law firm which he discovers to be working for the Mob: his
dilemma is one of conscience.
With The Pelican Brief Grisham discovered, like Turow, that law naturally
interlinks with big business, and in this case with investigative
journalism, Watergate-style. Again, the apparently realistic detail is
all-important, the novelist's traditional skills are discounted. But it
cannot be denied that both these novelists have a superb narrative gift in
the old-fashioned sense that you simply have to keep turning the page. Hence
their well-deserved success.
Turow's latest, Pleading Guilty, is a good example of his qualities and also
of his superiority over Grisham. It is an over-long and complicated story
about a middle-aged lawyer's investigation into the corruption that he
discovers inside his own respectable firm. A partner is on the run; Dollars
5m has been siphoned off to a Yucatan tax shelter; the firm is nervous
because it has secretly made a Dollars 20m profit out of a big air-crash
case; a bookie has been murdered, ball-games have been fixed, the missing
partner turns out to be gay; there is a trio of smooth senior partners, a
tough girlfriend, a tougher black woman in the Accounts Department, a
dangerous cop called Pigeyes, a vivid portrait of the ethnic mix of the
American Midwest.
The higher achievement of Pleading Guilty lies in its portrait of the
protagonist, Mack Malloy (the device of framing the narrative as his
dictation is a mistake, but no matter). Here is a memorably credible
burnt-out case of an ex-policeman, a fading lawyer pushing 50, an alcoholic
still prone to fall off the wagon, a failed husband, a despairing father of
a useless teenager ('Children are savages - egocentric little brutes who by
the age of three master every form of misconduct, including violence, fraud,
and bribery, in order to get what they want. The one who lived in my house
never improved'.)
Malloy is assigned to track down the missing money and his missing
colleague. He is a mess of a man who is trying to behave honourably while
discovering that he is operating in an utterly immoral environment: what is
he to do? Turow, unlike Grisham, is interested in the big issues: 'What kind
of ethical social system takes as its fundamental precepts the words 'I',
'me' and 'mine'?'
The drama at the end is not whether Mack Malloy will find the money but what
he will do with it. Like Grisham, Turow shows us a world of ferocious greed
in which the lawyers (surely unlike our own Rumpole]) are obsessed with
their take. And Turow has a nightmare of a brave new world run by the
multinationals: 'Your corporate types are soon going to be a stateless
superclass, people who live for deals and golf dates and care a lot more
about where you got your MBA than the country you were raised in. It's the
Middle Ages all over again, these little unaffiliated duchies and fiefdoms,
flying their own flags and ready to take on any vassal who will pledge his
life to the manor . . . '
Turow is an ambitious writer and deserves to be read. Grisham is a good
read. They are a phenomenon.

THE ROBBER BRIDE
by Margaret Atwood
Bloomsbury Pounds 15.99, 470 pages
MILLROY THE MAGICIAN
by Paul Theroux
Hamish Hamilton Pounds 15.99, 440 pages
AUTOBIOPSY
by Bernice Rubens
Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 14.99, 231 pages
WE LIVE in a credulous age, seeking miracles, so it is little wonder when
serious, sensible, novelists look to the supernatural, the magical, the
other-worldly for their plots. In Margaret Atwood's The Robber Bride it is
the return from the dead of a she-devil to haunt the lives of three middle
aged women. In Paul Theroux's Millroy the Magician, conjuror develops into a
miracle-working Messiah. And in Bernice Rubens' Autobiopsy (Sinclair
Stevenson), a blocked writer literally squeezes inspiration for a novel from
the refrigerated brain of his former mentor. What happened to social
realism?
Atwood takes us among women. Tony, a (female) medievalist specialising in
warfare; Roz, a successful venture capitalist; and Charis, an unrepentant
hippie, are drawn together by their hatred of Zenia, the Toronto college
chum who successively seduced and destroyed their men. Zenia's death in
Lebanon is cause for much relief, celebrated at a monthly lunch. Their
re-patched lives are threatened when Zenia walks into the restaurant.
This is Daphne du Maurier territory, lightly dusted with feminism. The men
are insubstantial background figures, but Atwood is astonishingly skilled in
developing intriguingly quirky characters and detailed backgrounds for her
heroines. Three times Zenia exploits men and wrecks their women; and three
times we follow with dread. This is escapist stuff, meat and drink for an
American TV mini drama, with enough tension, enough silliness, and enough
sympathy in the perhaps too carefully contrasted trio to appeal to the
broadest audience.
It is Atwood stripped of intellectual pretension, but writing fluidly and at
ease. Zenia is a credible monster, a wheedling liar who sent shivers down my
spine and yet is surprisingly accepted into the Sisterhood at the end.
Atwood could have made more of the mystery. Instead she settles for an
adventure, a surprising jeu d'esprit from Canada's most uncompromising
novelist, and an unreservedly recommended read for an escapist winter break.
Theroux is much more ambitious - well, pretentious really - in Millroy the
Magician. It begins with promise as 14-year-old waif Jilly is spirited away
by Millroy, the magic man at a New England travelling circus. He gives her
security; chaste friendship; and an initiation into his tricks. You settle
back for a picaresque tale of life on the American road: JB Priestley meets
Jack Kerouac.
But not all Millroy's stunts are tricks. He can work miracles and he
certainly manages to carry Theroux off into a farrago of symbolism. Jilly,
disguised as a boy, introduces Millroy to the power of television, and after
easy success as a magic-making uncle on breakfast TV he exploits the medium
to establish himself as a modern Messiah, aiming to convert not the souls,
but the bodies of the American public. If they would only eat the food
mentioned in the Bible and pay strict attention to their bowels they would
achieve moral perfection and live to be 200. Theroux is spot on in homing in
on the most likely medium as well as the most persuasive message to convert
health obsessed Americans.
But as Millroy recruits his outcast disciples to run a chain of Day One high
fibre food outlets and faces the inevitable official hostility and eventual
treachery from his followers, the parallels with Jesus become facile. You
wait in dread for the Last Supper - and here it comes, Millroy chopping off
his finger, with an appropriate benediction, before sharing it around his
little band as they flee across the country in a trailer. The ending manages
to be both mystical and trite, not a bad description of a book which seems
to have escaped from the control of its author.
Both Atwood and Theroux write with gusto and conviction. In Autobiopsy
Bernice Rubens seems to have been over-whelmed with an idea and forced it
unconvincingly into a novel. Martin Peabody is as pathetic as his name but
hopes that draining off the genius of dead novelist Walter Berry will
stimulate a new creativity. Instead it leads to a convoluted but predictable
plot in which Peabody builds up a biography for Berry from the few random
comments of his decaying brain. At the same time Peabody grapples with his
own rather tedious family life and that of Berry's widow and step daughter.
Parallel lines run into each other, to general confusion, but it is hard to
raise the enthusiasm to work out which theme is being pursued at any
particular time. It is also dangerous to have a poor novelist as your
storyteller.

DR JOHNSON AND MR SAVAGE
by Richard Holmes
Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 19.99, 260 pages
THE LAST we heard of Richard Holmes was that he was engaged on a massive
life of Coleridge. The first volume - Coleridge: Early Visions - appeared a
couple of years ago to a bevy of appreciative reviews including the one in
this newspaper by the present reviewer. Having got Coleridge poised in
mid-career, Holmes seems to have temporarily deserted him to take a little
holiday. Holmes's idea of a holiday being to write a book, a shorter book
that required much less research - and the result is Dr Johnson &amp; Mr Savage.
One might be tempted to call it a quickie, but like everything Holmes does,
it is carefully written and argued.
The material mainly comes from printed sources, the chief being Dr Johnson's
Life of Richard Savage. In popular editions of Johnson's Lives of the Poets,
such as the Worlds Classics, this Life appears as one among many. The bulk
of them were written on commission by Johnson when he was famous as prefaces
for an edition of the English poets' works in several volumes. But the Life
of Savage was written and published more than 30 years earlier than the
others, in 1744.
Johnson wrote it the year after Savage died - at the behest of Edward Cave,
the editor of the Gentleman's Magazine, the journal that printed work by
both Johnson and Savage. It was in Cave's office above the medieval arch at
St John's Gate in Clerkenwell (still there) that Johnson and Savage probably
met. Johnson was then an obscure young man of letters recently married;
Savage at 41 an established poet, capable at short notice of turning out
ringing panegyrics in rhyming couplets on anything under the sun. A bond of
friendship soon formed.
Both were penniless. They were so poor that they would spend the night
pacing the streets of London in animated literary discussion until dawn.
Savage also had more disreputable friends with whom he would go
pub-crawling. On one of his late-night visits to a tavern in the their
company, Savage became involved in a brawl in which a man was killed during
a sword-fight. Johnson was not present but gives an account of this in the
Life.
Savage was subsequently tried at the Old Bailey and convicted of murder. It
was only after a vigorous campaign by his friends in high places that a
royal pardon was obtained. And it was after his release from prison that
Savage's career really took off with poems like 'The Bastard' - Savage
claimed he was the illegitimate son of the Countess of Macclesfield - and
'The Wanderer', enshrining his basic fantasies about himself. Then after a
period of glory his life took a turn for the worse again and he died
disgraced.
Savage was one of those impossible people who possess enormous, irresistible
charm until they become completely stoned when they turn into colossally
aggressive bores. He emerges in Holmes's account as a singular instance of
the Poet as both Charmer and Sponger, a kind of 18th century Dylan Thomas.
And Holmes reveals how thoroughly the young Johnson surrendered to Savage's
appeal.
Disappointed at not being made poet laureate by George II, Savage appointed
himself what he called 'Volunteer Laureat' to Queen Caroline and wrote an
annual poem in her honour - a splendid example of Savage's chutzpah, in
reward for which the Queen, who had a weakness for poets and flattery,
granted him an annual sum. But on her death this was discontinued, and
Savage was on his uppers again. A group of well-wishers and poets led by
Pope, generous in his private dealings, banded together to make up the
deficit on condition Savage left London for good and took up residence in
rural Wales where - they vainly hoped - he would keep out of mischief.
Exhibit B in Holmes's exhumation of the relations between Johnson and Savage
is Johnson's 'London: A Poem' (printed by Cave in 1738, the poem with which
Johnson first began to make a name for himself among the literati). In it
the poet laments the departure of a friend - one Thales - from London to
Wales: 'Tho' Grief and Fondness in my Breast rebel/ When injur'd Thales bids
the Town farewell . . .'
Much scholarly ink has been expended on the question of whether the hero of
the poem may be interpreted as being Savage. Holmes thinks he is and he sees
the poem as the forerunner of the Life of Savage. But in his Life of
Johnson, Boswell denied that Savage was Thales. The Boswellians point to the
poem's Latin original - the Third Satire of Juvenal. The original contains a
figure called Umbricius who leaves Rome in disgust at its mores to reside in
the country and Thales, they say, is merely a fictitious equivalent.
Holmes sees this as an attempt by the Boswellians to cover up Johnson's
early friendship with the scapegrace bard. Johnson had studiously not
revealed that he was the indigent nocturnal friend in his Life of Savage. It
was a youthful episode now best forgotten, incompatible with Johnson as the
stern moralist, the judgmental father-figure. John Wain endorses the lasting
influence of Savage on the young Johnson, in his biography of Johnson, but
says he 'cannot see that 'London' would have been any different if Johnson
had never met Savage'.
Holmes does us a double-service - firstly by reviving interest in the
raffish yet attractive figure of Savage who died in 1743 in Bristol's
Newgate jail; and secondly in positing a rather different, a more radical
and bohemian Dr Johnson, to complement the traditional figure of the Great
Tory Cham. But in his final claim that Johnson's Life of Savage also makes
him the founding father of the modern literary biographer, Holmes presses
his case a little too far.
Unlike those contemporary biographers who are able to set aside years of
their lives to complete their tasks, accumulating overwhelming detail,
Johnson was a literary journalist working severly against the clock. He
relied heavily on the 18th century tradition of anecdotes and is on record
as saying: 'I wrote forty-eight of the printed octavo pages of the Life of
Savage at a sitting; but then I sat up all night'. With respect - the
correct lineage is not Johnson, Holroyd, Holmes, Glendinning; but Johnson,
Sainte-Beuve, Strachey, Nicolson, Connolly.

CHAMBERLAIN AND APPEASEMENT: BRITISH POLICY AND THE COMING OF THE
SECOND WORLD WAR
by RAC Parker
Macmillans Pounds 35, 388 pages
THIS VIGOROUS and vividly written attack on Neville Chamberlain's
appeasement policies by an Oxford don is sure to set the cat among the
pigeons. Ignoring the historical battleground littered with so many corpses,
RAC Parker goes back to the manuscript sources to raise and answer
fundamental questions.
Against the currently benign interpretations of appeasement, Parker argues
that other choices could have been made that might have deterred or stopped
Hitler before war broke out. From the opening chapter, with its entertaining
and shrewd pen portrait of Chamberlain to the telling indictment of his
post-Munich policies, this book centres on a figure who by virtue of
ability, hard work and determination must be seen as one of the strongest
prime ministers in our century. Chamberlain's self-confidence, like his
prestige, was of Thatcher-like proportions. His cabinet colleagues waited on
his judgments. 'When I am silent,' he reported, 'everyone else is also.'
Thanks to over 1,200 weekly letters to his two sisters, Parker is able to
round out an assessment of Chamberlains's motives and actions based on a
wide reading in the official records and private papers of the period.
Chamberlains's motives were of the highest. He passionately hoped to avoid
war and the policies he advocated were dedicated to this end. He thought
Hitler could be persuaded by finding solutions to his grievances to limit
his aims, renounce aggression and abandon German rearmament. Chamberlain was
convinced that Hitler, or at least the German people, would see that Britain
and Germany could co-exist peacefully as prosperous and great nations.
Appeasement was not a policy of 'peace at any price'. Whatever his faith in
concession and conciliation, Chamberlain did not skimp on the measures
thought necessary for the defence of Britain. Nor was he willing to yield to
Hitler a position in Europe that would threaten British independence or
security.
Parker accepts that appeasement was a perfectly rational and reasonable
policy that until Godesberg commanded general support. His real indictment
of the prime minister begins with Munich when he insists Chamberlain became
the victim of his own self-confidence and obstinacy. In the months that
followed, the prime minister remained convinced that his policies were
actually succeeding. Persuasion continued to have priority over coercion
despite mounting pressure for an anti-Hitler coalition. The prime minister
remained cool towards the idea of a close Anglo-French alliance in 1938. He
opposed and then delayed negotiations with the Soviet Union which he
regarded as unnecessary and dangerous. He would not consider restructurings
of the cabinet that would have signalled the government's determination to
stand up to Hitler. In the summer of 1939, he resorted to private and
unofficial channels to keep open possibilities for peace which he knew ran
against the popular current.
Parker does not ignore the pre-Chamberlainite roots of appeasement. The
treatment of such complex questions as reparations and disarmament is
concise and to the point. The diplomatic crises of the early 1930s are
analysed in sufficient depth to make intelligible the claim that appeasement
was a sensible, moral and even courageous policy. Nor are the many
constraints within which Chamberlain and his ministers had to operate left
unexplored. Parker is particularly good on the financial and industrial
background to re-armament and gives full weight to the political
calculations that were such an important factor in the prime minister's
pursuit of peace. But he sharply contests the revisionist view that foreign
policy was determined by a realistic assessment of economic and military
weakness and by public opinion. It was foreign policy that dictated the
scale of rearmament and not the other way round. If Chamberlain had so
wished, moreover, he could have rallied opinion behind and anti-German front
in 1938. He chose not to do so. The option he preferred and privately
pursued lost all official and popular backing during 1939.
Again against prevailing historical winds, Parker argues that there was an
acceptable alternative to appeasement. Chamberlain might have gone for
armaments and allies, 'the language of the mailed fist'. There existed in
1938-39 a divided but far from negligible opposition to his policies.
Chamberlain took that opposition seriously enough to keep both Eden and
Churchill out of the cabinet. The latter was not easily ignored. He was
already a massive public figure identified with opposition to Hitler and the
advocacy of the 'grand alliance.' Chamberlain could not take him into the
cabinet if there was to be any hope of reviving the 'Munich spirit'. As it
was. after March 1939 even this powerful prime minister had to adopt
publicly at least much of the opposition's programme. It was too little and
too late.
Chamberlain's view of Hitler and expectations of the German people's
resistance to war was fatally flawed. His policies, and Parker provides
abundant evidence, were wildly over-ambitious and ultimately disastrous. He
never had the influence over Hitler he claimed. It was well beyond Britain's
capacity, in my view, to establish an acceptable balance of power in Europe
by itself. I am more sceptical than Parker that given Hitler's goals and
pathologies, any alternative to war was possible. Even had Stalin been
convinced to join the Anglo-French pact, would this have done more than
postponed a European war that Hitler's policies made inevitable? This is not
to argue that Chamberlain's policies were right but to suggest that no other
course of action could have prevented the catastrophe.
You will want to read this book. It is intelligently provocative. Parker
writes with clarity, concision, and conviction. The scholarly apparatus is
impressive without being overwhelming. It forces one to look again at
Neville Chamberlains's premiership and to reconsider the real issues
involved in the ongoing debate about appeasement, a controversy that has
neither lost its historical importance nor its contemporary relevance.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Property: For those who want to buy in France - Anthony
Blond finds much to commend in a new guide to acquiring property over the
Channel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY BLOND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HER Britannic Majesty's consuls-general would save pain, misery, tears and
woe for their subjects - and much repetition of information by themselves -
were they to give a copy of an excellent little guide to every British
householder registered with them in France. (A less benign precedent exists
in the gift to German newlyweds of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf during his
tenure of the chancellery; but that was a boring and incomprehensible work,
which this is not).
The guide is by Elizabeth Morgan, who begins with a husband but ends up as a
single parent with two grown-up daughters. She is an actress and writer who
is also a practical, lucid and experienced setter-up of houses (or, rather,
holiday homes) in France, having been through three in 20 years.
Sensibly, she has stayed in the same neighbourhood on the ground that French
neighbours, once acquired, should not be shed lightly.
This is not difficult because the provincial French, unlike the gipsy-footed
Brits, tend to stay put, sometimes for centuries. But they do die,
eventually, and their children will have skipped to a town or to Paris, the
great maw feared and disliked by the rest of France but lived in, or around,
by a quarter of the population.
This means that there are thousands of houses, including some of the 40,000
chateaux, for vacant possession at a quarter to a fifth of the price in
overcrowded England.
Many need rewiring, re-roofing, connecting to the mains and furbishing but,
mostly, these vieilles pierres are not about to fall down. The French,
however, do not like these old stones, preferring the detached pavillon,
ordered from a brochure, with thermostatic central heating, satellite
television, a wodge of cypresses and a double garage.
The obtrusive signs of estate agents have not reached deepest France, and
seeing a small yellow sticker saying 'A Vendre' and noting the name and
number of a notaire - often, the only one in the town - is the first move.
He will have other properties to offer, in a very unpushy way, for the
notaire's chief interest is to clear the estate and his money comes from the
fees: say, 17.5 per cent on a house costing FFr200,000 (Pounds 23,300).
The compromis is the agreement to purchase and an agreed price from which
you, but not the vendor, can back out - albeit with forfeiture of the
deposit. The acte is (for once) what it sounds like and Morgan describes
how, at some moment in the transaction, the notaire might have to make an
urgent telephone call or visit the lavatory for a prolonged period.
At this point, a wad of notes changes hands; for although the French are the
most regulated and obedient nation in Europe, a few anarchic, ancient,
habits survive.
Morgan is efficient about curtain poles (brilliant in France), junk and
antiques, giving details of every market; the danger of sun oil; un-itemised
telephone bills; sub-letting (don't); amorous workmen (this is very much a
woman's book); ironing boards, (buy in France), and irons (buy in England).
She even tells us the worthwhile radio and television programmes.
She advises against importing British labour, bouncing a cheque, or
confronting the French bureaucracy with anything but the humblest of miens.
A real vade mecum.

<TEXT>
MANY French agents were keen enough when it came to finding properties for
British buyers in the heady days of the late 1980s, but few showed much
enthusiasm for marketing them when, bitten by recession, so many owners
wanted to sell. That is the opinion of London estate agent Maurice Lazarus.
He wonders how many hundreds of British owners must have French properties
they would like to sell but whose particulars are getting dog-eared on a
French agent's files because he does nothing to promote them
Lazarus, who runs Domus Abroad, suggests part of the problem is that the
smaller French agencies do not usually present re-sale properties in a way
that attracts British buyers. They do not, for instance, produce a spread of
colour photographs, as do many British agents, relying instead on a
photo-copied sheet.
Referring to properties in square metres, instead of sizing them by by the
number of bedrooms in the British way, might be a good system but confuses
UK buyers, says Lazarus. So does the practice of referring to 'habitable
areas.'
Lazarus's main criticism, however, is that many French agents wait for
buyers to come to them and do not seek purchasers actively in the way that
many British agents do. Yet, he feels there is a market - albeit small -
that is worth attracting.
One possibility is that people getting little on investments elsewhere might
be prepared to put money in a holiday home or something bringing in rental
income. 'Such properties are getting a good return just now,' he says.
Lazarus suggests that re-sales put on the French market by other Britons
might suit very well in such cases, adding that his agency would be happy to
try selling properties in France for UK owners who have been unable to find
a purchaser through a French agent.
He stresses he is not criticising French agents, some of whom work very hard
and drive long distances to show people property. Indeed, he would be
offering his service in co-operation with agents and notaries in France. But
his agency's approach would be very different.
'By working closely with the seller, we are able to produce a simple but
comprehensive brochure with colour photographs, and the essential
information always sought - but rarely found - by prospective buyers looking
for property in France,' he says.
Lazarus stresses that his agency can take on only properties that it
considers to be priced sensibly, with a reasonable chance of selling. Such
properties would be offered to potential buyers already on the agency's file
and would be included in its corporate programme of exhibitions, advertising
and public relations activity. An individual marketing programme could be
organised if a seller wished.
Domus Abroad (071-431 4692) charges a commission of 5 per cent, or a minimum
of Pounds 2,300 - but only if a sale results.

SITED conveniently for a business family with racing interests, Chateau de
la Chausee (pictured left) is 27 miles from Paris, 12 from Charles de Gaulle
airport and little more than a mile from Chantilly, venue of the French
Derby and a renowned training centre. The property, which has a British
owner, overlooks the river Nonette. Parts date from the 18th century and the
main structure was retained when the house was rebuilt by the Masson family
in 1860.
Accommodation includes drawing room, dining room and library, master bedroom
suite and five other bedrooms. In the five-acre grounds are a staff lodge,
two unmodernised cottages, a former chapel, tennis court, stables, garaging
and paddocks. The gardens are a particular feature.
London agent Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (071-629 8171) suggests a guide price of
Pounds 2.2m.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Property: Life amid the vineyards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHATEAU Laborie, at Laborie in the Tarn, is five minutes from Gaillac and 35
minutes from Toulouse international airport. It looks out over a courtyard
in which two rows of buildings are being converted into mews-type homes on
either side of a rectangle.
The chateau was the home of the Gaillac region's principal wine grower when
it was built in the 1800s. Eventually, the estate was divided into smaller
vineyards, while the chateau and courtyard were bought by a French army
captain.
He renovated the chateau and this, along with the courtyard buildings, were
acquired about three years ago by a businessman who formed Trojan Toulouse,
the present development company.
All its directors are British and they include Andrew Pugh, a building
engineer with a background of restoration work. One of his projects in
Surrey has been nominated for a conservation award. His bilingual wife,
Michelle, is a former personal assistant to Cartier's managing director in
London.
There will be 14 homes in the courtyard, ranging from a one-bedroom
apartment to three-bedroom houses. Most are being converted from old
buildings such as the wine press, cart shed, hay barn and stables. But five
are newly-built and, for these, the French architect has devised first-floor
terraces cut into the houses, rather like rooms without a roof.
They are priced from Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 95,000 and seven have been
sold, all to British buyers. The four-bedroom chateau is also available, at
Pounds 125,000.
There is to be a boules area in the courtyard between the properties, and a
large swimming pool has been built behind the chateau amid fig, almond,
cherry, plum and apple trees. There will also be a tennis court and car
parking there. The development, to be finished by March, is surrounded by
vineyards.
Further information from Andrew Pugh at Laborie (tel. 63 57 21 62). In the
UK, contact Edna Calder (0737-778 829).

FT  16 OCT 93 / Gardening: The sure way to extended growth - Feed your
plants regularly and they will last right through into the autumn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NON-ENTHUSIASTS sometimes complain that gardens are two-month wonders which
look fine in April when hundreds of narcissi have been tipped out into the
grass, and even better late in June when the old roses are in full spate.
Those same roses soon lose their leaves and look wretched. By autumn,
gardeners already are talking of autumn colour; but it can be seen in woods
and hedgerows without the need to worry over staking a young parrotia.
Non-gardeners have to be unjust: otherwise, they might surrender to what
they recognise. My aspirations are exactly contrary to theirs: I want to
prolong and extend by extracting as many weeks as possible out of the year.
Long seasons are a work of art, combined with cunning.
This year, I am particularly conscious of an under-used weapon in our
seasonal armoury: if you want to extend it, feed it.
The wet autumn might have helped them, but artful feeders should still be
enjoying sweet peas, swathes of flower on penstemons, a second flicker on
phloxes, an afterglow on several delphiniums, and a willingness in anything
half-hardy to flower flat out until the frost. If your season has tailed
off, you gave up the battle too soon: you also need the gadget which I
acquired, belatedly, at this July's Hampton Court show.
Feeding is no longer a matter of lugging watering cans to and fro and trying
to drench a border with the right dose. Nowadays, you can do it all by hose,
as I have been far too slow to realise. Fertiliser firms sell a special
spray attachment with a glass which can be filled with the right measure of
their product. It locks on to the hose and can be pulled round the garden,
fertilising while you spray water through its adjustable head.
No longer do we need to wonder how many litres the old gallon can will hold,
or how many grams and fluid ounces amount to an old British tablespoon. The
hose head is filled with fertiliser to the level of the arrow marked on its
side; it sticks on the hose, and the water flow will take up the fertiliser
and add it to the evening watering.
We all talk as if plants like to eat: in fact, they can only drink,
absorbing their chemicals through moisture in or around the soil. Spray
feeding is a drenching which is true to a plant's needs.
All summer, I have found it a therapeutic business, walking round the garden
with a spraying hose which is said to be doing good. Over-keen gardeners are
prone to a natural mistake: impatience. Wanting quick returns, they increase
the dose, step up the volume, and think they are forcing their plants to put
on far more growth in a year.
Their natural modern ally is the high-nitrogen fertiliser called Miracle
Gro, the darling of front gardens. This modern Miracle certainly puts a bomb
under anything with green growth but, in my view, it is an extra, not a
staple. Heavily-miracled plants end up with more green growth than flowers,
more greenfly, and less of a solid base with which to face the winter. They
are over-forced.
For the garden's enduring backbone, I continue to swear by Phostrogen.
Little and often is the Phostrogen principle and, as a result, my Pounds 12
bucket of the stuff has lasted since mid-summer and prolonged almost
anything it has touched. It remains excellent value.
Phostrogen's makers now sell a hose-head fitting which is the ideal
Christmas present for gardeners who have everything except a garden with as
many late flowers as mine in mid-October. The simple head will lock on to
any diameter of hose and, if you are quick to work out the open, close and
fill positions on the grip above the glass, you will not end up with such a
heavily-fertilised pair of gardening trousers as I contrived in the first
two weeks of operation.
I write about it now because I have seen the evidence. Earlier this summer,
I picked on the advice of a leading female head gardener who advised that we
should all feed our plants in urns and big pots very heavily in order to
prolong them throughout the winter.
Having obeyed her, I can confirm that she is right. After two months'
regular Phostrogening, I still have huge sprays of flower all over the
scented heliotropes, a steady glow on the dark blue salvias, and a
continuing crop on the dark pelargoniums.
When you begin to spray little and often, you will naturally start to wonder
if it is really worthwhile. I am writing this article with the answer before
my eyes. Plants which have been fed steadily are still flowering freely:
those which were not fed have packed up.
I am not so concerned with the doubting gardeners: I am more interested by
doubting scientists. Some of them argue that spray feeding is ineffective
because it aims at the plant's leaves. Some of the spray evaporates and much
more of it misses the target.
In absolute terms, they may be right, but much of what misses hits the earth
and reaches the roots and, in the right conditions, it is not wasted.
Those conditions are two: the earth itself must be damp so as to absorb the
spray, and there should not be such a strong heat that the fertiliser
disappears in a haze. The moral of the scientists' case is that we should
spray in the evening when the sun is low and the ground already is damp, if
necessary from an earlier watering.
When philosophers were arguing that matter existed only in the mind, Dr
Johnson simply kicked a stone and remarked that he 'refuted them thus.' I
think the experts are wrong because they have not watched my fuchsias. Since
early July, I have drenched them in Phostrogen and, since August, I have not
drenched my trousers at the same time.
They set two crops of buds and then, as standard bushes in pots, they have
set and opened a third now. They love fertiliser and a damp atmosphere,
especially over those leaves that greenflies otherwise adore. This autumn
has provided the damp - but I have provided the fertiliser.
My postscript to this season's flowering is that next year you, too, should
equip yourself to fertilise while you water by hose. October, I promise you,
will not look the same again.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Gardening: You'll never look at a lawn the same way again -
Bridget Bloom discovers that mowing your patch of green, green grass can be
positively harmful
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIDGET BLOOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FLY OVER the suburbs of any American city and what do you see? Swimming
pools, perhaps, in the more affluent, but the most common sight surely is
the green of countless well-mown lawns abutting pavements and paths. No
hedges there, and few flower beds.
In Britain, home of the herbaceous border, the pattern is somewhat
different, for the garden hedge still marks many a surburban boundary. But
lawns are still important, as the hum of the mower attests in any surburban
street at virtually any weekend hour. But should they be?
Grassy spaces may rest the eyes or assuage the spirit, but what they do to
the environment might be positively harmful. That, at least, is the
challenging thesis of three American academics who, in a refreshingly
non-polemical 150 pages, argue that in their efforts to make lawns 'a
constant companion of surburban development,' American gardeners
'unnecessarily contribute to some of the most severe problems facing the
world today.'
According to professors Bormann, Balmori and Geballe, authors of Redesigning
the American Lawn (Yale University Press, Pounds 16, 295 pages), irrigating
lawns depletes water resources while mowing them using aerators, leaf
blowers, weed whackers and edgers 'all add to pollution and eventually to
global warming.'
Excess fertilisers and pesticides run off into streams and lakes. Even lawn
clippings swell household waste vastly.
The professors quote some impressive statistics to show how the 'lawn care'
industry - at Dollars 25bn a year equal in size, apparently, to the
pesticide market world-wide - wastes precious resources. In one hour, it
seems, the average power mower emits pollutants equivalent to a car driving
350 miles. Indeed, California's Air Resources Board claims that annual
pollutant emissions from 'lawn utility machines' in that state are
'equivalent to the emissions of 3.5m 1991-model automobiles driven 16,000
miles each.'
Across the US, lawns cover 25m acres, making grass the country's largest
single crop, Lawn owners use up to 10 times more chemical pesticides an acre
than do farmers, while lawn watering has become so common that, in western
states, it can account for 60 per cent of urban water use.
Britons are not, perhaps, so fanatical and thus are more likely to be open
to the less radical of the professors' suggestions - use fewer chemicals,
and mow and water less often. The most far-reaching proposal, however, is
revolutionary in the US context: re-design gardens to suit the natural
ecology; rockeries, not greensward, in Arizona; scrub and shrub, not lawn,
in Nebraska.
Such basic change is difficult to envisage in the US, but could it happen in
Britain? Dr Philip Gates, a botanist at Durham University, believes UK
gardeners will have to change their habits, not so much because of what they
do wrong now but because change will be forced on them by fundamental
alterations in our climate.
In Spring Fever (Fontana, Pounds 5.99), Gates rues a thesis propounded late
in the 1980s when British summers suddenly seemed hotter and winters milder.
Gates believes UK gardeners will have to get used to a new calendar. No
longer will they be able to count on putting up their feet for four or five
months of the year, lulled into inactivity by a roaring fire and the seed
catalogues. A milder and probably drier climate will extend the growing
season, allowing little respite from pruning, planting or mowing, if they
are to maintain today's type of garden.
Most British gardeners will find this unwelcome, Gates surmises, and not
just because they like to be idle in the winter. He believes many people
will 'recoil in horror' at the onset of a Mediterranean-type climate, since
it could mean the disappearance of beloved landscapes. Gates' remedies
accord with those of the American professors: respect natural ecology, do
not fight it, and conserve or adapt precious habitats carefully to the
changing climate.
It is rather less clear where the message of Building Green, published by
the London Ecology Unit at Pounds 12.95 (and with a foreword by the Prince
of Wales), fits in. Authors Jacklyn Johnston and John Newton would have city
dwellers plant much more greenery, and tell us how to do it.
In the city of tomorrow, not only would they have more trees alongside
buildings and more vegetation in courtyards and on balconies and terraces -
they also would create meadows and lawns on the roofs of houses, factories
and offices.
Many of the ideas are obvious and some are fun, but they do come with a
'health warning': check with a professional - and, perhaps more to the
point, your insurance broker - before you follow the authors' advice.

FT  16 OCT 93 / How To Spend It: The in-crowd Out of Africa - Lucia van der
Post picks the best to beat the bush
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GREAT FT elephant safari is back and all of us who were lucky enough to
wander through the wild spaces of Kenya and Tanzania with Iain and Oria
Douglas-Hamilton as our guides felt that we found something of the Africa we
had dreamt of in the months before.
We could not escape the Land Rovers or the small aircraft that flew us
about, but in our remote tented camps we could nurture the illusion that we
were alone with all Africa around us. We could get to know a small portion
of Africa: its soil, its plants, its wildlife, its birds and its people.
Day after day we set out to find elephants, to see the chimps with our
expert, Roland Purcell, to walk along rivers and up ridges with our Masaai
guides, to picnic under trees, to look for cheetah and lion, and we found
enough and did enough for us all to feel that we had had a privileged
glimpse of a world that has been hugely threatened but seems now to be
fighting back.
We learned to adjust to African time and that lunch and dinners could wait
when there were herds of elephant or flights of spoon-billed storks to be
gazed at. And some of us learned the hard way that when you head for the
bush it is surprising how little you need, but what you need you cannot do
without.
Times have changed since the necessities required by a young man setting out
for Africa (as Tricia Foley tells us in her beautiful book Colonial Style)
comprised 40 different objects including khaki ties, a wool bush shirt,
leather leggings, a green canvas bucket, a folding chair of green canvas
with leg rests, a compact chair bath and wash-stand that fits into a bag, a
fitted cook's case, a steel helmet case and two hurricane lamps.
Victorian ladies, too, had their own necessities. Agnes and Cecily Herbert,
for instance, in their African venture, wore 'knickerbockers, gaiters, stout
English shooting boots and khaki safari jackets, the wide pockets busy with
string, knives and other handy aids. When particularly delicate stalking was
required, Mary would remove her boots and hunt in her stockinged feet.'
These days our needs are simpler but it is still possible to get it wrong.
The classic mistakes are to dress as if going to a theme party. This means,
in my experience, avoiding anything with the label 'safari' attached to it.
Khaki and shades of green and beige are to my mind the most attractive
colours to wear in the bush, and there is nothing to beat proper cotton. The
Gap stores, for instance, now stock sand-washed khaki trousers at Pounds 30
for men and Pounds 28 for women, as well as good dark khaki shirts at Pounds
32.
Those who want to pay more and like a fancier label can browse through the
Polo Range at Ralph Lauren. Marks and Spencer often has good khaki cotton
shirts and sweaters and Blazer has yielded some wonderful, if pricey,
goodies.
When it comes to women, forget Meryl Streep - keep your Out of Africa gear
for looking glamorous on the patio. What you need are well-cut beige or
khaki shorts - most of the middle-market labels such Stefanel, Liz Claiborne
and Marks and Spencer do them in the summer. I also have a pair from Banana
Republic - sadly not what it was in its idiosyncratic heyday but still worth
visiting whenever you are in the US.
Good khaki shirts are harder to find so buy them when you see them. Good
khaki T-shirts are easier - the best-wearing I found were by Jil Sander at
the surprisingly good price of Pounds 15. If you keep your eyes skinned in
everyday chain stores you will be able to buy yourself a perfectly
satisfactory wardrobe at comfortable prices.
The new breed of mail order companies, such as Racing Green (tel:
0345-331177 for a catalogue, or visit the new flagship store at 193-197
Regent Street, London W1) and Lands' End (tel: 0800-220106), which
specialise in classy basics, are good sources.
You need at least one really warm sweater and, ideally, a wind-cheater. The
fleecy jackets from Patagonia (dubbed Patagucci because of its cult status
and vertiginous prices) are marvellously soft and warm, but they look less
at home to me in Africa than they do in the Alps.
Hats, for us ozone-phobic Northerners, are essential. About hats there lurks
a special culture - as the travel writer Jan Morris has pointed out, real
travellers need a certain touch of loucheness about their dress. This can
most satisfactorily be provided by a hat.
Felt hats, Saba Douglas-Hamilton, Ian and Oria's 23-year-old daughter, tells
me are the thing. As one of the quirky old Banana Republic catalogues put
it: 'The point of owning a fur felt is to use it over a lifetime - as the
years go by, it grows softer and softer, takes on more and more of your
personality. Your fur felt hat will still be sitting rakishly on your head
when your old favourite jeans have long since gone to denim heaven.'
A good felt hat can be bought at The Survival Shop, 11 Western Colonnade,
Euston Station, London, NW1 for Pounds 59.95, though to pass the Saba test I
dare say you should duff it up a bit.
For the young set 23-year-old Saba Douglas-Hamilton provided me with some
insider tips on what the Kenya kids consider proper gear.
The first thing to remember is that the way the Kenya kids or the Kenya
cowboys dress has evolved around a cult of toughness. Short shorts of heavy
duty cotton khaki and short-sleeved khaki shirts are standard gear. The
guides in the camps never, ever, don a sweater. Only cissies, it seems, feel
the cold.
Feet, they would like you to think, have been hardened by years in the bush
so the old game department shoes called chapleys or 'thousand milers' (made
out of bits of old tyres and worn by the Masaai, who like them best if the
bit of tyre at the back still has the number on it) are the chicest way to
clad your feet.
Chapleys cost about Pounds 10 from Patambacoda in Nairobi. They are made
from two pieces of leather crossed at the front, leaving much of the foot
exposed to scratches, mosquito and tsetse fly bites, not to mention
snake-bites - and anybody who has read Kuki Gallmann's beautiful saga of
Kenyan life, I Dreamed of Africa, will remember that this is a matter in
which Saba is well-versed. On no account wear socks. If you cannot quite
match up to these levels of toughness then safari boots from a Bata shoe
shop will do.
Women should wear battered straw hats which they can customise with scarves
wound round them (though not leopard-spotted ones). A good plain leather
belt or a beaded Masaai one (Pounds 9.99 from Africraft in the Africa
Centre, 38, King Street, London WC2) holds up the shorts and on it you hang
a Leatherman knife.
Kenyan kids wear leather thongs around the neck, sometimes with little
pendants, twisted copper bracelets or Masaai beaded ones round the wrists,
all found in the Nairobi markets.
In the evenings, no matter how remote the camp, Kenyan kids shine. Saba
would wear something long, simple and slinky that came out of her little
holdall, wrap a shawl around her shoulders, put on some zany ear-rings and
look a million dollars.
Zoe Fuller at Roland Purcell's camp was wondrously clever with kikois, the
traditional multi-purpose bright cotton wrap that is found all over East
Africa. It is well worth packing two or three. Pounds 22.50 from Davies, 10
Great Newport Street, London WC2 or Pounds 11.99 from Africraft in the
Africa Centre. Shawls are the quickest, most glamorous way to wrap up in the
evening and can, if you choose the right one, do double duty in the chilly
early mornings. Chaps either wear shorts and cotton shirts or also do clever
things with kikois.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Fashion: The scent of success for an innovative German - The
inspiration behind Wolfgang Joop's collections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD RAWLINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN HIS native Germany, 48-year-old designer Wolfgang Joop (pronounced yope)
is as famous as Helmut Kohl and Boris Becker. Like any national treasure he
is hounded by tabloid gossip columnists.
He is either hailed as the Prussian designer or accused of being a spy for
the Stasi, the hated former secret police, simply because he was born in
Potsdam, East Germany. Both attributions are far-fetched since his family
moved to the west when he was eight.
On the face of it, Joop's celebrity status seems remarkable in a country
notably devoid of fashion stars. But in fact, it is his novelty value that
is the key to his success. Joop's decision to pose in his own scent
advertisements was an ingenious, if vainglorious, marketing ploy. It made
him a household face, a personality behind a label, someone with whom people
could identify and call their own.
While Karl Lagerfeld turned his back on the fatherland to rejuvenate Chanel,
Joop won respect for showing his collections from his headquarters in
Hamburg.
While most German fashion houses employ anonymous stylists and give brands
British or Italian-sounding names in order to have export appeal, Joop
stands proudly by his surname (ironically of Dutch origin), adding an
exclamation mark to it on his label as if to emphasise his uniqueness as a
bone fide, hometown designer.
Since setting up the Joop] label in 1980, with plans to specialise
exclusively in furs, he has built an empire embracing womenswear, menswear,
scent, a jeans collection and ranges of shoes, leather goods, hosiery,
eyewear and furs.
Next year, he is introducing childrenswear and underwear ranges but he is
axeing his fur collection because of decline in demand.
The manufacture of each collection is licensed to large German companies -
Jobis for womenswear, Windsor for menswear, Mustang for jeans - meaning the
Joop] company remains free of the financial burden of factory production. It
allows Joop] to focus on product design and marketing. At a time when other
luxury goods companies from Dunill to Louis Vuitton are feeling the pinch of
recession, Joop] sales rose 33 per cent last year to Dollars 167m (Pounds
110.50m).
Like a fish that has outgrown its pond, Joop knows that continued expansion
depends on his acceptance in the international fashion arena. He has just
set plans in motion aimed at establishing himself as a major European
designer.
Last year, he launched his scent in the US and the UK. in the UK it is
stocked by 500 Boots chemists and leading department stores. He also
introduced his menswear to selected stores including Liberty and Harrods in
London, Christopher Scotney in Leicester, Norton Barrie in Wilmslow,
Cheshire, and Smiths in Edinburgh and Glasgow.
He plans to increase his menswear presence to 50 stores nationwide next
year, starting with London's Harvey Nichols. He is also opening a store on
Madison Avenue in New York next year and will show his collections on the
New York catwalks for the first time.
However, in the immediate future, readers of glossy magazine advertisements
are more likely to associate Joop's well-groomed, tanned and beaming visage
with fragrances, not clothes.
While Coco Chanel was already a legendary couturier when Chanel No 5 arrived
in the market place, Joop, is reversing fashion's traditional order of doing
things.
Joop sees himself as an innovative designer, someone who, 'not only gives
people what they want, but gives people what they did not know they wanted'.
He purports to be a pioneer of bright colours in menswear and his vivid red
jackets bedeck the backs of many television chat show hosts. His
autumn/winter 93 collection includes dandified red and white striped
blazers, scarlet velvet frock coats, bold yellow check suits, baggy
overcoats in outsized checks, a preponderence of black leather jeans and
black, felt cowboy hats.
But if discreet British taste has trouble relating to such extrovert
dressing, flamboyant styles are only half the story. Joop is sufficiently
commercially-minded to realise that Rupert Bear suits keep cat-walk
photographers happy but grey suits, denim jackets and white shirts keep the
bank manager friendly.
Like the UK's Paul Smith, he describes his designs as 'quality classics with
a twist. He admires traditional English menswear but likes to combine
country and city styles, heavy-looking, rough-textured tweeds and chunky
knitwear with smooth silks, fine lightweight wools, cottons and leather. He
may accessorise a tweed sports coat and a pair of corduroy trousers with a
bright waistcoat and a loud, patterned kipper tie.
Joop] costs more than Hugo Boss but less than Cerruti and Giorgio Armani,
with a suit retailing from Pounds 390 to Pounds 495, a jacket from Pounds
250 to Pounds 325 and a shirt from Pounds 65 upwards.
When approaching womenswear, Joop adheres to the 'less is more' school of
thought. He is disparaging about Escada - 'for nouveau-riche Arab princesses
 -and the showbusiness element of the Paris catwalks.
'Lagerfeld may have made Chanel fun, but l cannot believe that many women
want to be wrapped in gold chains from top to toe and wear men's underwear
with a tweed jacket,' he says.
Joop's womenswear for this autumn is inspired by the Berlin of the 1920s
with an emphasis on a streamlined silhouette achieved by softly-tailored,
long, A-line overcoats, little cloche hats, hemlines stopping just above or
below the knee and a liberal use of floaty chiffon in eveningwear.
He has also concentrated on trouser suits consisting of flared or cigarette
pants and tweed box jackets, often with velvet lapels.
Mink and fox stoles are very much in evidence, although real fur will be
replaced by synthetic versions next year. 'I have come to the conclusion
that fur is no longer relevant in the 90s,' he says. 'Contemporary chic is a
woman in a pretty, floral dress and tailored jacket or a man in a suit and a
simple T-shirt. The mood is casual and young-spirited. Fur does not fit in
with modern life.'
As the Joop] collections are rolled out across the US and the UK
(womenswear, though, is not destined to reach the UK before next year), the
designer is unlikely to miss revenue from fur sales.
Joop will retire from the star role in his own advertisements. 'I was
beginning to feel like Marlene Dietrich,' he says. We may not see his face
as much in future, but the increasing availability of his clothes should
prevent us from forgetting that he is around.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Despatches: From Russia with stitches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS a moment one never believes will actually happen. On my left a
Russian nurse, sporting outrageous green eyeshadow, was trying to push a
huge needle into my arm. On my right, another nurse was fiddling with a
1950s-style machine, with shiny dials and ominous steel levers.
Above me, as I lay on the operating table, a bearded surgeon was asking, in
sign language, if I had any allergy to medicines. 'No - but do you have any
disposable needles?' I squeaked nervously, as I tried to remember the
Russian for 'blood transfusion.'
Ever since I had first arrived in Russia, I had regarded its medical system
with horrified awe. I had heard the aprocryphal rumours of equipment-starved
hospitals, where conditions were suspect and hygiene was minimal. Indeed, in
central Asia I had once made an anthropological study of a village hospital,
which had left me relieved that I had never been ill there.
I had never expected that I would be thrown on to the mercy of a Russian
operating table myself, let alone in the remote town of Chelyabinsk in the
Urals. I had not even arrived under any politically dramatic pretext.
Earlier that evening, while visiting the dacha of a local political leader,
I had mistakenly opened the cellar door looking for the toilet - and tumbled
12ft down into the darkness, slicing my leg in gory fashion.
As we later sped through the night to Chelyabinsk's best - or it seemed,
only - hospital, I breezily declared that all I needed was a few quick
stitches.
But 'quick stitches' were not, it seemed, something the Russian medical
system was geared for. In spite of being one of the most industrial regions
in Russia, with 3.6m inhabitants, Chelyabinsk's hospital did not have any
local anaesthetic. Nor did it appear to have an x-ray machine, or, as I
later discovered, any elasticated bandages.
What about disposable needles? my companions asked. I reflected that at
least he had never heard of press reports of hepatitis or Aids in the Urals.
'Sadly, we don't have any,' murmured the surgeon, as he made a great show of
sterilising everything in sight.
'Well, I don't want anyone else's blood under any circumstances,' was my
final plea, as the general anaesthetic took hold.
Four hours later I came around, dizzy and thirsty. As the hospital's first
Western visitor I had been assigned the best suite - a single room, with a
wash basin, iron-sprung bed, two broken radios and a mysteriously locked
fridge. A young medical assistant popped in, sloshed iodine everywhere, and
solemnly informed me that I had 20 stitches, sewn with thread that looked
like gardening twine.
Hours later I was woken again, this time by a sturdy dezhurnaya, the
legendary caretaker women who control the keys to every institution in
Russia, wielding God-like power. 'Breakfast is ready in the restaurant. Sit
in your correct place - Number 5,' she barked.
I limped shakily down the dimly lit corridor, decorated - I later noticed -
with posters warning of the dangers of industrial electrocution. Just when I
had found place Number 5, another dezhurnaya popped up. 'It's too early]'
she shouted, ignoring my leg.
I obediently limped back. My surgeon reappeared, looking exhausted.
He daubed thick black liquid on my leg, turning itinto something from a
horror film set.
As I attempted to engage him in small talk, he told me that most of the
doctors in the hospital were Jewish or German. The surgeon - who I was later
told by Western doctors had done an extremely good job - had seen his salary
slashed by economic reform, and earned the equivalent of Dollars 40 (Pounds
26.40) a month. Meanwhile, he told me, I would have to stay in the hospital
for several days.
Horrified, I hopped back to the restaurant, where the rest of the patients
had been rounded up by the dezhurnayas. They all looked remarkably healthy,
but on closer questioning it transpired that many had already been in the
hospital for weeks, reluctant to relinquish the free treatment, food and
gossip - the two main topics that day, I discovered, was my own arrival and
the 'terrible events' that had been happening in Moscow.
A mug of tea, with a ration of sugar - a luxury that I alone was given,
apparently because I was a foreigner - was plonked in front of me. Then came
a tin bowl of cold kasha, buckwheat porridge. I ignored it. But the
dezhurnayas were determined. 'You've got to eat your kasha,' one said,
chasing me down the corridor. Defeated, I limped into my room with the kasha
and hid it in a drawer.
Hours later, to my huge relief, a cheerful American journalist from the
Christian Science Monitor appeared, clutching bars of chocolate and a
doctor's white coat. In accordance with the 'hygiene regime' in the
hospital, he had been ordered to wear it before entering my room.
Tickets had been obtained, he said, for the next flight to Moscow. And
although Aeroflot was officially banned from carrying sick passengers, a
Finnish doctor had advised drinking vodka so that I could play drunk if
there were any questions.
The release forms were finally produced, the dezhurnayas gave me two more
bowls of kasha and then finally, to my relief, I was free to go.
'We are hoping to introduce all kinds of new equipment, although these
economic reforms have made things very difficult. So of course we would like
some Western aid,' said one of the doctors as he gave me a final check. 'I
do hope that this hospital can see you again,' he added.
It was not a sentiment I could truthfully share.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Chess: Short's last-ditch stand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEONARD BARDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIGEL SHORT'S stubborn resistance against Gary Kasparov at London's Savoy
Theatre is approaching its long since inevitable end. Short has improved his
score from a derisory 2-7 after nine games to a very respectable 6-11 after
17 but, with only seven games left, Kasparov is likely to claim The Times's
winner's purse of Pounds 1.06m some time next week.
In its wider aspects, the match leaves a mixed impression, confounding both
optimists and pessimists. Short lost three of the first four games and
sacked his coach, while Savoy seat prices plummeted from an average of
Pounds 80 to Pounds 20. But then, theatre audiences stabilised at 400-700
daily, Channel 4 and BBC2 reported impressive viewing figures, and sales of
chess books, sets and computers doubled. The match has sparked a far greater
interest among the uncommitted, non-chess playing public than any previous
event in the UK.
The Times, with overall costs estimated at Pounds 3m-Pounds 5m, paid too
much for an event which failed in terms of sporting tension. But, for a
future sponsor - perhaps considering a more realistic prize fund for a 1998
challenge by Britain's No 2, Michael Adams, who has just reached the world
top 10 at the age of 21 - there is every encouragement.
The action will now switch to the rival world championship in Jakarta where
Anatoly Karpov of Russia, leading 7-5, resumes tomorrow against Jan Timman
of the Netherlands after an adjournment caused by the sudden withdrawal of
Oman and a Pounds 900,000 prize fund, followed by a frantic search for a new
sponsor.
The Indonesian match is organised by the long-established International
Chess Federation (FIDE), the 149 affiliated federations of which are
confronted by the Kasparov-Short breakaway Professional Chess Association
(PCA). The war is still in its early stages, and promises to be bitter.
FIDE is committed to a SFr1m (Pounds 400,000) minimum prize fund. If that is
not forthcoming, Karpov and Timman will sue. If it is provided from capital
reserves, FIDE will be stretched financially - particularly since its funds
include a SFr500,000 deposit from Intermark, a Californian group which
attempted to raise funds for a 1993 title match but failed because of the
Los Angeles riots. Intermark is now asking for its money back, alleging that
its contract was only for a match involving Kasparov.
FIDE hopes that Bob Hassan, the Indonesian CF president and a lumber
millionaire who is close politically to Indonesia's President Suharto, will
sponsor the Jakarta prize fund. If so, the FIDE-PCA war is likely to
continue with two separate world champions, until at least 1995 when both
organisations stage their next title matches.
Meanwhile, the grandmasters, TV pundits, organisers and writers at the Savoy
are planning their post-match moves. The immediate aftermath will include
two instant books of the games, one by Raymond Keene of The Times (for
Batsford) and the other by Daniel King of Channel 4 and Donald Trelford for
Cadogan, both announced at Pounds 7.99. But the best revelations are likely
to come from Dominic Lawson's Macmillan book, planned for December, aimed at
the general reader and written by an insider in the Short camp.

FT  16 OCT 93 / I believe in Winston Churchill: Simon Hollington ponders the
star deities of Cao Diasm, Asia's fastest growing religion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLLINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUILDING jumps out at you from the lush Vietnamese vegetation. Ablaze
with dragons, rearing serpents and fantastic birds, the church - or is it a
temple, or a mosque? - is a Disneyland of world religions. The
all-encompassing eclecticism of Cao Diasm, perhaps Asia's fastest-growing
religion, assaults the senses. Adding to the variegated colours are Cao
Dia's many star deities, the likes of Winston Churchill and Victor Hugo, who
regularly hand down their wisdom through seances to priestly mediums.
Our bus had left Ho Chi Minh city with too little in the way of suspension
and too much in the way of faith - including the belief that there was room
for just one more farmer, his wife and umpteen chickens. After four hours
uncomfortable travel it was a relief when Tay Ninh, the capital of Cao
Diasm, came into view.
Graham Greene had made this journey in 1953. Intriguingly, he had once
actually considered converting to this eccentric faith. In the end, however,
Greene had written in an article in The Times: 'What on my first two visits
has seemed gay and bizarre (was) now like a game that gone on too long.'
A 'game' though, that many still want to play. After a decade of
suppression, today Cao Diasm claims 4m faithful and through its overseas
missions is attracting converts from Korea and Singapore.
The appeal of Cao Dia's eclecticism and mysticism through seances, which
regularly invoke the spirits of such luminaries as Hugo, Churchill, Joan of
Arc and Lenin, must have been attractive to Greene, given his own prophetic
instinct. He made good use of the experience, using the Cao Dia sect as a
foil in his own portentous novel, The Quiet American.
Founded in 1926, following a series of visions by Ngo Van Chieu, a retired
civil servant, Cao Diasm attempted to create an ideal faith through the
synthesis of secular and religious philosophies of East and West. Cao Dia -
which means 'high palace', signifying God - caught the imagination of the
Vietnamese and by the early 1950s had attracted one in eight of the
population of the south. By the middle of the decade, Cao Diasm had
established a virtually independent feudal state in Tay Ninh Province, which
is bordered on three sides by Cambodia and is only 80km from Saigon.
The Cao Dia's had their own 25,000-strong army, incorporated into the South
Vietnamese army during the Franco-Vietnamese War. They were characterised by
Greene in The Quiet American as the Third Force, which mirrored Washington's
wish that they would somehow resolve the Franco Vietnamese conflict.
In the struggle that was to follow, the Cao Dia reviled both the communist
guerrilla groups and the government of President Ngo Dinh Diem. Refusing to
support the Viet Cong during the US conflict, after the communist takeover
of the South, they were violently suppressed and their lands confiscated.
Cao Diasm has now re-emerged, indeed blossomed, under a more sympathetic
attitude by the communist ruling party. There is today much talk of
'universal peace' around Tay Ninh, where the faithful, in flowing white
robes, flutter around visitors like butterflies searching out pollen.
On the day of my arrival a busload of awed converts from Korea and Singapore
was kneeling on the marble floor of the pink and green ice-cream-parlour
interior of the temple. Wandering around the village-sized compound, with
its pink pagoda architecture, entrepreneurial Cao Dia children and would-be
guides swarm around, eager to practice their English. However, it takes six
of them to convince me that the elaborate fairyland tower infested with
decorative green snakes and adorned with pagodas and bells is in fact the
public toilet.
A middle-aged women with sparkling brown eyes and the complexion of a child
takes me to one side. The Cao Dias are the healthiest and wealthiest-looking
people to be found in a country full of hollowed cheeks and stick-thin legs.
Luong radiates an understated peace normally associated with absolute
personal conviction or controlled use of narcotics.
'Winston Churchill, a wise spirit,' says Luong, shaking her head with a
wide, white smile. I very much wanted to know what the great man's spirit
had communicated, but this Luong explains, to my disappointment, is privy to
the Cao Dia Pope and his inner circle of cardinals.
Cao Dia takes its hierarchical structure from the Roman Catholic Church and
combines Confucianism, Taoism, Hinduism, native Vietnamese spiritualism,
Christianity, and Islam. But it is the tenets of Mahayana Buddhism that form
the core philosophy, with the ultimate aim of breaking the cycle of constant
rebirth.
Ingeniously, the Cao Dia founder, although believing in one God, divided
history into three major periods of revelation. First came Moses and his
Hindu/Buddhist/Muslim equivalents and contemporaries. The human agents of
revelation during the second period were Buddha, Confucius, Jesus and
Mohammed, whose messages were, the Cao Dia thinkers say, applicable only to
their age and have subsequently been corrupted. The Cao Dia's see themselves
as embodying the third and final revelation, an alliance between man and
God.
This neat stacking of religious development is topped off by the
masterstroke of invoking the spirits of past Cao Dia leaders, as well as the
likes of Rene Descartes, William Shakespeare and Joan of Arc, who all serve
as messengers of salvation. However, for some reason it is Victor Hugo who
puts in the most regular spiritual appearance, and who has posthumously been
named the chief spirit of foreign missionaries.
'Ah yes, Shakespeare, he wrote many times a long document, a very long
document,' Luong explains. A new play, perhaps? Luong maintains her beatific
calm. The time to reveal the wisdom of the great spirits, she explains, has
not yet arrived.
The seances are held in what looks like a football stadium and involve a
medium holding a long calligraphy brush, which jerks and scribbles out its
message to the privileged few. Sometimes, by way of a change, a blank piece
of paper is placed in an envelope behind the Divine Eye altar. When removed,
there inside is a message from the superstars of yore.
Luong led me to the entrance of the Divine Temple, or Vatican, keen to show
off the plaster relief of Victor Hugo and the Chinese poet, Sun Yat-Sen, who
are jointly painting a scroll which reads: 'Dieu and Humanite Amour and
Justice.'
'A Walt Disney fantasia of the East' was Graham Greene's description of the
Cao Dia Vatican. Norman Lewis called it a marriage between a pagoda and a
southern baroque church. The concept is certainly worthy of California, but
perhaps Cao Diasm has more commercial appeal than most. The pop star Michael
Jackson came to my mind: he, I felt, would love the religion's Christmas
cake architecture and its message, oft repeated in my ear, of universal
peace and happiness.
It is noon and the faithful are arriving on bicycles to pray at one of four
ceremonies held during the day. The white beards and robes of elderly
sage-like men provide an atmosphere of an ancient theological university,
lending credence to the durability of Cao Dia philosophy.
But my attempts to penetrate the higher echelons of the Cao Dia priesthood
proved fruitless. Questions about the religion's funds, and of its apparent
wealth, produces more beatific but impenetrable smiles.
Cao Dia temples observe an odd protocol whereby the male and female
disciples enter on opposite sides. Women, who may belong to the clergy
except at the highest levels, travel only clockwise around the left hand
aisle, and men anti-clockwise around the right.
The 30-minute service consists of harmonic chanting, with ceremonial
offerings of tea and alcohol which are laid at the foot of the Cao Dia
altar, above which is the large and unnerving 'Divine Eye', set within a
huge globe. Below the eye is a pulpit entwined with a cobra. The stunning
colours of the clerical robes, blue, yellow, and white, with attendant funny
hats, are colour coded according to priestly rank.
As a finale to the mid-day service a priest in a peacock robe burns a
message at the altar, perhaps a memo to Churchill or Lenin, asking them to
drop by when the spirit moves them. At least they do not have to come by
bus.

FT  16 OCT 93 / As They Say in Europe: Villain of the piece
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERE IS a thought: the only people really interested in the Maastricht
treaty, and what is known traditionally as the 'construction of Europe,' are
the British. That they do not much like it does not nullify the point. The
EC occupies centre stage in political debate, or successfully plays the part
of stage villain.
In his speech to the Conservative party conference in Blackpool, the social
security secretary, Peter Lilley, used the word 'foreigners' several times
to describe the inhabitants of the community. He managed to give the word
the same twist that some Germans achieve when having a go at Auslander (And
he committed what the French would regard as a capital offence against their
language.) Brussels, Maastricht and Europe are terms of abuse in Britain
even though, as I shall attempt to demonstrate, they are not what matter
now.
As noted here on other occasions, each nation has its own private vision of
the community. The Germans see it as a school for disciplining others to
behave properly; the French believe it is there solely to pursue the
interests of France. The British seem still to view Brussels as some kind of
Hitler, dominated by a mad jealousy of the independence of the island nation
which it has to eliminate in the interests of a new Volksgemeinschaft, or
National community.
But that community is no longer the main pre-occupation of these jealous
foreigners. The pursuit of a narrow European union has become notably less
pressing just as Germany's highest court gave the green light to the
Maastricht treaty (in the face, British Euro-sceptics should note, of
opponents' arguments that it was not federal enough.)
In a speech that was ignored outside France, President Mitterrand suggested
last week that there should now be a confederation of Europe. It is not a
new idea, but the view is becoming steadily more persuasive. Le Monde noted
that the countries of central Europe were fed up with their inability to get
themselves accepted as part of a wider European partnership.
In Berlin, similar thoughts are taking shape. Der Tagesspiegel wrote last
Monday that there was a need for a 'partnership signal' to the east. The
failure to provide one was a cause of the attempted putsch in Moscow. 'The
rejection of this wider strategy,' wrote the paper, 'would mean the retreat
to the little Europe of 1989 and the sure way back to the division of the
continent.'
If there is such a thing as 'European policy,' it has to confront two
issues. The first is what to do about Germany. The Maastricht treaty
represented a not wholly successful attempt to tackle that problem. One
underlying premise was that the community's largest, and apparently most
energetic, nation was not going to provide forever the compliant leadership
that has been around since 1948. The next century, if not this decade, will
see a revival of a normal self-assertiveness.
The French are always the most vocal in making the point that Germany has to
be 'anchored in Europe.' (This sometimes sounds like a demand to tether a
mad dog, an image the Germans find offensive.) Maastricht provides a
makeshift anchor.
The second question is what is to be done about present and potential
instability in eastern Europe. In other words, the problem today is about
the same as it was 100 years ago: containing Germany and making sure it does
not attempt to control an unruly east all by itself.
The British cannot move beyond the view that there is nothing wrong with
Europe that a bit of free trade will not cure. This is based on hostility to
all grands projets which imply an unacceptable limitation of national
sovereignty (which, in the British case, is thought to operate best when
untrammelled by any considerations other than national interest, even though
that interest is never defined).
What the British rarely have grasped is the possibility of ghastly events
taking place on the continent of Europe which could affect them. Even
relatively recent experience of such events has not cured this
self-inflicted myopia. But we could well see, in the next few years, a new
Germany taking action to defend its perceived interests on its eastern
borders and that, in turn, leading to the exercise of long-dormant muscles
by its western neighbours.
In the eyes of the Conservative conference, 'Europe' presented a truly
worrying menace in the form of those described by Lilley as 'benefit
tourists' - layabouts and drug addicts who enter the UK to take advantage of
certain social security provisions. It must - at least partly - be thanks to
the existence of the European Community that this is among the worst
nightmares with which Britons are confronted. For the moment.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Food &amp; Drink: I'll have the elk - Giles MacDonogh samples a
slice of food and life in Norway
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE mention of the 'social-democratic chicken' I was all ears and I
pressed Eivind Hellstrom to describe the beast to me. I imagined a chicken
designed by committee; some sort of ostrich, but no, it was a deep-frozen,
800 gram standardised fowl. And it was the only chicken available in Norway.
The 'social democratic chicken' is not the only hardship suffered by
Norwegian chefs. The country which outrages the sensibilities of millions by
its stubborn insistance on eating whales and seals, will not tolerate the
importation of foie gras.
Naturally there is no Bresse poultry, Angus beef, pre-sale lamb, Challans or
Barbarie ducks; and unpasteurised cheese is deeply frowned on. On the other
hand there are consolations of sorts. Game is plentiful: wild duck, grouse,
pheasant, elk and reindeer. There is plenty of fish and sea food.
Eivind Hellstrom is Scandanavia's top chef. His Bagatelle restaurant was
awarded its second Michelin star earlier this year. It might come as a
surprise that he should work in Oslo, which is a far less exciting city than
Stockholm or (by all reports) Copenhagen; but Hellstrom is not alone: there
are a number of talented chefs juggling for second place in the Norwegian
capital at restaurants such as De Fem Stuer at the Holmenkollen Park Hotel,
Annen Etage at the Continental, Feinschmecker, D'Artagnan and Babette.
When I was in Oslo last month there was gloom among the chefs about the
result of the general election, which had increased the vote of the anti-EC
farmers' party. The vast majority of people in Oslo are in favour of the
Common Market, and this includes the cooks, who see it as the only means of
bringing down the puritanical state monopoly which controls food and drink.
But I should not give the impression that one eats badly in Oslo, certainly
not at the Bagatelle. I was particularly impressed by a dish of scallops on
a cake of tagliatelle which was got up with tomato and basil to look like a
pizza; or the smoked and baked halibut in a frothy caviar sauce; the lobster
tart on a buttery cognac and coral sauce; or the wild duck with its appley
sauce.
Hellstrom trained with some of the best chefs in France and La Bagatelle is
an unabashed 'French embassy'. Up above the city, at the picturesque
Holmenkollen Park Hotel, is the De Fem Stuer restaurant. The chef is Bent
Stiansen, the first Norwegian to win the Bocuse d'Or trophy in France.
His cooking pays more lip-service to Norwegian models than that of his
friend Hellstrom. I ate a variation of his winning menu: creamy crabmeat
with bleak roe; turbot stuffed with crayfish and fennel; reindeer with a
sauce of lingonberries (mountain cranberries); and mixed wild berries with a
cardomon ice. De Fem Stuer is a popular business dining room and the prices
reflect this.
De Fem Stuer's is still quite high-flown stuff compared to the daily diet of
ordinary Norwegians. With just half an hour for lunch most people take a
couple of open sandwiches to work.
Excellent lamb, smoked reindeer and elk sausage form a part of the farmer's
diet, just as the fisherman gorges himself with herrings. Something of this
will be found at the restaurant Maud in the centre of Oslo, between the town
hall and the trendy, Akers Brygge dockside development.
One highly recommended place, if you just want to see how Oslo ticks, is the
Theatercafeen, which was built at the time when Norway became a nation
state; and retains its resplendent art nouveau interior. There is hot food
but most people eat the open sandwiches.
Bergen, on Norway's west coast, is a fiercely independent city. Hans Inge
Bruaroy points out that it is easier to buy large goods in Newcastle or
Aberdeen than Oslo, given the problems of negotiating the fjords to Bergen.
Bruaroy is one of Bergen's most well-rounded personalities. He runs the
Hotel Neptun with its collections of modern art and the best table in the
city.
The local theatre director eats there after the evening performance and
downstairs his cast drinks into the early hours. The food is good too, if a
tiny bit marred by the the chef's fondness for sweet sauces. It was nice to
eat baby cod there: the fish which made the city's fortune, with a jazzy,
orange and coriander sauce; and some excellent local lamb with thyme on a
(sugary) aubergine puree.
At the Fiskekrogen on the quay you eat a less ambitious sort of meal: some
of the city's homely specialities such as a creamy fish soup and cod boiled
with potatoes. The Fiskekrogen draws much of its trade from visitors to the
famous quayside market and the old merchant houses of Brygge. In season
venison, elk and reindeer are also on the menu; but there is no sign of that
Norwegian mutant: the social democratic chicken.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Let's rock around the bocks - Frank McGurty
finds that American beer drinkers are turning to smaller breweries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMID the hubbub of a crowded City of London pub, an American expatriate
stood at the bar, quietly considering his impending return to the US.
Suddenly, as he raised a pint of Fuller's London Pride to his lips, the
hoppy aroma triggered a thought that filled him with apprehension - soon
there will be nothing to drink except sudsy, soulless American beer.
Not long ago, the US's reputation for boring brew had been well-deserved,
but as our home-bound tippler was to discover this month at the Greater New
York Beer Expo, that image has become a bit dated.
The genre was once defined by the likes of Bud, Miller High Life and Coors -
bland, characterless lagers produced in vast quantities by a few big brewing
groups. In the past five years, however, a host of small, independent
'microbreweries' has sprung up around the country, introducing a receptive
niche market to porter, stout, and ales of all descriptions. The
ever-restless American imagination has even managed to spin out some rather
eccentric inventions of its own. (Have you tried Cerveza Caliente, a
chilli-flavoured lager?)
The variety is just what one would expect in an overheated consumer culture
with an unslakeable thirst for choice. The mystery is why the brewing
industry took so long to tap the latent demand.
If anything, choosing among the plethora of beers is daunting. This helps
explain a parallel phenomenon - a proliferation of beer festivals, at which
the curious imbiber can spend an evening sampling the offerings of dozens of
brewers.
The trend began on the west coast, home of the greatest concentration of
microbreweries and 'brew-pubs', an unfortunate term for bars and eateries
that produce their own specialty beers. Curiously, the festival concept was
slow to arrive in New York city.
The first, and surely not the last, was held in a hanger-like convention
hall at the Jacob Javits Convention Center on Manhattan's far west side. It
featured about 50 vendors representing the entire spectrum of American brews
and a few imports as well.
In contrast to English real ale festivals, at which punters pay a small
admission fee and buy pints a la carte, the expo was an all-you-can-drink
affair. For Dollars 25 at the door, the sturdy drinker could work his way
around the room, trying an ounce or two of everything on tap.
First stop was a timid one, although there is nothing timid about Royal Oak,
a classic English bottled ale made by Dorchester's Eldrige Pope. After
reassuring the palate with a familiar benchmark, it was time to become
better acquainted with the domestic fare.
A good place to start was with Anchor, the long-established San Francisco
brewer, which has arguably done more than any other American beer maker to
inspire the recent renaissance.
Anchor Steam, made in unusually shallow fermenting vessels, combines the
smooth characteristics of lager with the assertiveness of ales made with
top-fermenting yeast. Because its bold taste stands up so well to chilling,
Anchor Steam is well-suited both to the American summertime climate, and to
the American inclination to ice every brew as if it were a can of Budweiser
(the US variety) even in the dead of winter.
Amid the continued dominance of pale, watery lagers, a surprising number of
US brewers are now making porters, one of the darkest and most full-bodied
of brews. Anchor Porter, milder and more creamy than its English
counterpart, is one of the best. Regrettably, Sierra Nevada, which produces
an excellent porter of its own, was not represented at the event.
Bock beer is another dark beer that stands more in the centre of the
American brewing tradition. Like lager, bock (meaning 'strong beer' in
German) is made with bottom-fermenting yeast, but unlike its paler cousin,
it has a nuttier, roasted malt taste, which also stands up to colder
temperatures better than more traditional top-fermenting ales.
Latrobe Brewing's Rolling Rock Bock won plaudits from several expo-goers.
With a taste very reminiscent of light, crisp Rolling Rock lager (also
brewed under licence in the UK), this is hardly surprising. Zip City, a New
York city brew-pub, also featured a bock. But its tap ran dry early in the
evening so the raves the beer won from some drinkers had to be taken on
faith.
By contrast, there were resonances of Anchor Liberty Ale, with its strong
hoppy aroma and burgundy hues, across the exposition floor. A good examples
was Pete's Wicked Ale, an especially robust drink with hints of caramel
around the edges. An English friend who has lived in New York for several
years lauded Pete's as 'a typical American ale', which in itself speaks well
for the quality.
Samuel Adams Boston Stock Ale, made by the upstart Boston Beer Co and
distributed widely, might have evoked similar praise if it had not been
by-passed in favour of more exotic fare. A cluster of beefy lads, whose
expansive girths suggested the breadth of their expertise, pointed the way.
'I love this Big-Nosed Blonde,' said one, referring to one of fancifully
named creations of McNeill's Brewery of Brattleboro, Vermont.
These included a concoction called Duck's Breath, a mild ale with herbal
undertones and such a smooth finish that it almost tickled the tongue. The
sweetish Slopbucket Brown Ale was immediately identifiable as such by an
Englishman who claimed to have grown up with a bottle of Newcastle Brown in
his hand. Dead Horse Ale was more full-bodied with a chocolatey edge.
New Haven Brewing of Connecticut took a more staid approach to naming its
products, but shared McNeill's determination to distinguish itself from the
crowd. Indeed, its Elm City Golden Ale takes the prize as the most
distinctive beer at the expo, according to one highly subjective view.
With its mild maltiness, the exceptional smoothness of a Czech pilsner and a
delicious buttery texture, Elm City seemed to capture the spirit of the new
American brews. It gave a respectful nod to European traditions so long
ignored in the US, while asserting an individual character that refuses to
be ignored in its own right.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Food &amp; Drink: The open secrets of a top chef - US food star
Cindy Pawlcyn talks to Nicholas Lander
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT SNOWED so heavily during the winter of 1980 that Chicago lost one of its
best chefs. Cindy Pawlcyn's car was buried under the snow for four and a
half months, and after that she headed west, for warmer climes, with two
friends, Bill Higgins and Bill Upson.
Thirteen years later they are still friends and partners. They control the
Real Restaurants Group which has six restaurants - Mustards and Tra Vigne in
the Napa Valley, the Fog City Diner, Bistro Roti and Bix in San Francisco
and the Buckeye Roadhouse in Mill Valley - a bakery (Painorama), 430 staff
and an annual turnover of more than Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.80m).
Pawlcyn came to London for a busy visit last week. She cooked lunch for 40
British chefs and restaurateurs and dinner for 300 at the American
Ambassador's residence in Regent's Park and in between gave a demonstration
at Le Cordon Bleu.
In between all this I had 10 minutes to find out the reasons for her
success. By the time we sat down I had one apercu into her distinctive
approach to cooking.
It was not just what we had eaten - lobster tamales with tomato salsa,
smoked duck with 100 almond sauce, herb and spice-coated lamb chops and a
stunning goat cheese tart with figs - but the fact that attached to each
menu were the recipes and quantities, enough for 40. When I said that such
details would be treated as trade secrets by British chefs she smiled and
said that was not her approach.
The first answer she gave me to explain her success modestly passed the
credit back to her suppliers. She said the fertile Napa Valley was blessed
with farmers, many organic, keen to grow, breed and pick to her
specifications. Lambs were specially fed a heavy acorn diet to give the meat
a nutty flavour and the ducks for her kitchens were raised two weeks longer
than normal to reduce the fat content.
Over the summer her chefs cooked with 15 different varieties of tomato
including black, green grape, Marvel stripe and vine tomatoes. When she
needs fresh grape juice she just calls up a neighbouring winery. And the 200
wineries in the Napa infuse the air so thickly with wild yeasts from the
fermenting vats that there is never any problem with her bread dough
fermenting.
Fresh ingredients have to be skilfully transformed and California cuisine,
drawing on an extensive source of culinary influences from Asia, Mexico and,
increasingly, the rural US, requires a strong organisation behind the swing
door. Pawlcyn leads by example as executive chef but corporate policy is to
promote general managers and head chefs to become partners in each
restaurant.
Such attention to detail is vital because each restaurant handles an
enormous daily volume of diners - numbers that would be the envy of European
restaurateurs. The Fog City Diner seats 90 but serves 600 to 700 between
11.30 am and 11.30 pm; Mustards with 80 seats feeds 800 and Tra Vigne with
86 covers feeds 1,000, sometimes 1,500 a day at the weekend.
Americans flock to Pawlcyn's restaurants because of the quality of the food
and the value for money. But in the rather more relaxed California setting
they are prepared to eat when they can get a booking and work the rest of
the day around what appears to many in Europe as a late lunch or an early
supper.
Here is one of the restaurant's most popular dishes.
RED CURRY MUSSEL STEW Serves six
2 1/2 lb small black mussels, 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, 2 large cloves
garlic, minced, 1 tablespoon peeled and grated ginger, 2 oz peeled and diced
tomato, 1 tablespoon Red Curry Paste (from Asian supermarkets) 4 cups canned
coconut milk, 1 tablespoon chopped coriander, 6 sprigs coriander for
garnish.
Scrub the mussels well and trim off the beards.
Melt the butter in a large saucepan and saute the garlic, ginger and tomato
for 2 minutes.
Add the curry paste and coconut milk, stirring until the paste dissolves.
Add the mussels, cover and steam until open, 3-6 minutes (discard mussels
that do not open).
Add the chopped coriander; divide the mussels and broth between the bowls
and garnish with the sprigs of coriander.
The Fog City Diner Cookbook (Pounds 19.99, 240 pages) is available from
Airlift Books (Tel: 071-607-5792).

FT  16 OCT 93 / Cookery: The renaissance of Britain's apples - Succumb to
the onslaught of imported Golden Delicious? Never
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OCTOBER in Wiltshire
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
a soggy place this year - features an abundance of hedgerow and garden
fruits: blackberries, rowanberries, elderberries, damsons, apples and pears.
Apples, above all else.
My own trees are sulking, but neighbours complain of being kept awake by the
soft and monotonous tom-tom of their apples thudding to the orchard floor.
In this house, the apple thud comes through the letterbox in the form of
press releases as the high street multiples fall over themselves trying to
out-apple each other.
Competition is healthy, of course, and it is right to celebrate the
renaissance of growing, selling and eating more of Britain's native apples.
Heaven forbid that we should succumb completely to the onslaught of imported
Golden Delicious, or that we should allow the thousands of home-grown
varieties to be whittled down to little more than Cox and Bramley.
I wonder, though, if we are becoming so obsessed by the number of varieties
available that quality is in danger of being overlooked - or, at any rate,
relegated to second place?
Egremont Russets, Ellison's Orange Reds and Ashmead's Kernels may be on sale
in name, but how often are they the real thing? When did you last buy a Cox
and hear the pips rattle inside it? Fruit that has been ripened properly on
the tree is, alas, not easy to buy.
Commercially, almost all apples are pulled prematurely from the tree before
the sugars and flavours have had a chance to develop. Some of the commercial
crop goes straight to the shops. The rest is put to sleep in cold storage, a
limbo from which it can emerge into the market place months later as dull
and uninteresting as it went in. Mediocrity is the price of maximum shelf
life.
Why also, I wonder, do most people think of cooking with apples only in
terms of puddings and cakes? We all know such recipes can be delicious but,
as one who is not particularly sweet-toothed, I favour promoting more
savoury uses of the fruit.
Apples make excellent soups. Try them in partnership with parsnip, fennel,
beetroot or cumin. They also go well with celeriac, chopped and fried
roughly to serve with poultry, or poached and whipped up into a light,
creamy mousse studded with toasted walnuts.
I like the Scandinavian trick of mixing apple sauce with mayonnaise to serve
with pork and ham. Let the apple dominate, or the mayonnaise, depending on
whether the meat is to be served hot or cold.
Apples go well with sausage meat, pheasant and prawns. Recently, at the Lou
Calel in Pujols, near Agen, I was served a wonderful saute of foie gras
garnished with fried apple.
Apple and cheese is another good combination. Here is a recipe that bridges
the gap between sweet and savoury.
SAVOURY APPLE TART (serves 4) Although I have used Cheddar here, this is a
recipe that invites many variations on the theme, using other cheeses both
mild and pungent. Try, for example, Mrs Kirkham's lovely fresh Lancashire
cheese; Mendip goat cheese or traditional French log; or ewe's cheese such
as Ticklemore or pecorino sardo.
Some cheeses take longer to become molten than others, of course, and may
benefit from being added to the tart earlier in the cooking process than I
have specified for Cheddar.
Ingredients: 6-7 oz ready-made puff pastry; 12 oz sharp and aromatic dessert
apples (at this time of year, Charles Ross is a good choice); 1 dozen fennel
seeds; about 2 oz mature farm Cheddar cheese (Keen's would be my first
choice);  1/2 oz flaked almonds, just as they are or toasted lightly; beaten
egg to glaze the pastry.
Method: Roll out the pastry and cut it with a sharp knife to an oblong 8 x
12 inches or slightly more. Trace an inner oblong  1/2 - 3/4 inch from the
edges of the first, taking care not to cut the pastry right through.
Score the pastry borders lightly with a pattern, and knock up the sides with
the back of the knife to encourage the pastry to rise well in baking. Fold
the pastry gently in two, lift it onto a baking tray and unfurl. Chill
briefly.
Peel, quarter, core and slice the apples thinly. Crush the fennel seeds and
sprinkle them over the inner oblong of pastry. Add a grinding of black
pepper and half the almonds.
Lay the apples on top, taking care to keep them within the confines of the
inner oblong. Some cooks might urge you to marshal the apple slices in
military rows but higgledy-piggledy is quicker and looks just as effective.
Chill for 20 minutes or until ready to cook.
Brush the pastry borders with beaten egg (taking care to avoid dribbles down
the sides or the egg will glue the layers together and so prevent a proper
puffing up).
Bake on a preheated baking sheet at 400-425`F/200-220`C (gas mark 6-7) for
20-25 minutes until the pastry is coloured richly, well risen and crisp, and
the fruit is tender.
Grind a little more pepper quickly over the apples, add the grated Cheddar
and then the rest of the almonds. Return the tart to the oven for a just a
few minutes until the cheese is molten.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Travel Focus - Caribbean &amp; South America: Next stop: the
world's end - Andrew Anderson explores the wild remoteness of Tierra del
Fuego
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ANDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU KNOW you are headed somewhere special as soon as you begin the descent
into Ushuaia, the toytown capital of Argentinian Tierra del Fuego.
The aircraft swoops down the Beagle channel, skimming over snowy peaks
peeping through the clouds, stands suddenly on a wingtip to bank left, whips
to the right and judders to a halt on the runway, a few feet from the icy
waters of Ushuaia bay. Those first-time passengers who are still conscious
break into applause. Old hands merely yawn: these Argentinian pilots always
fly the way they drive . . .
The airport setting soon soothes shattered nerves. Jagged peaks soar above
the bay and encircle the town in a snowy embrace. The neat, prefabricated
houses curve round the harbour, each with its little front garden filled
with lupins and poppies, a Sussex vicarage scene with added glaciers.
Fishing boats and yachts ride at anchor. The air is so crisp and clean you
can take bites out of it. As yet there is no sign saying: 'THIS IS IT - THE
END OF THE WORLD', but there is no mistaking the 'last frontier' feel: step
off the harbour wall and it is next stop Antarctica.
Tierra del Fuego, a jumble of islands at the very end of South America now
split roughly equally between Argentina and Chile, deserves its place in
travel mythology. Like the Silk Road or Easter Island, it conjures up its
own image: wild, remote, mysterious.
Any schoolboy knows the history of the name. Ferdinand Magellan, the
Portuguese explorer, first found the Ireland-sized archipelago in 1520 as he
travelled through the nightmarish seas of the straits which now bear his
name. He spotted the campfires of the Yahgan Indian inhabitants and named it
Tierra del Humo: the Land of Smoke. Later his patron, Charles V, king of
Spain, reasoned that there could be no smoke without fire, so the Land of
Fire it became.
Magellan had found the western route to Asia, but the discovery and
subsequent stampede of foreign ships brought no joy to the Indians, who had
scraped a living from the harshest of landscapes for thousands of years.
Charles Darwin, who came this way on the Beagle in 1834, wrote that the
difference between the Fuegians - 'among the most abject and miserable
creatures I ever saw' - and the Europeans was 'greater than that between
wild and domestic animals.'
Those Indians who did not succumb immediately to imported smallpox or
measles were forced to prey on the livestock of the settlers who had
summarily taken their land. The settlers put a bounty on each Indian head,
hunted them down and shot them like animals. By the early 20th century they
were all dead. Ushuaia's small but excellent museum on the waterfront tells
the sorry tale well.
The Argentine government made Ushuaia a duty free port in an effort to boost
its economy. Today it is a semi-boom town of some 30,000 souls who race
around in huge tax-free Jeeps and, together with the wealthy cruise ship
passengers passing through on their way to Antarctica, do a roaring trade in
the bars and liquor shops. There is also a strong naval presence. Ushuaia
played its part in the Falklands war, and there are many sad memorials to
those who fell in the 'Malvinas conflict.'
Being so far south does strange things to the summer nights, roughly
November-February. Outside those months the cold sweeps in with a vengeance.
At midnight one can read a paperback by natural light and the town is just
beginning to bop. At 2.30am, when most of the cruise ship passengers are
long since asleep, the light fades only slowly amid a cacophony of car horns
and carousing along the narrow strip of Ushuaia's main street. Bedtime is
around 4am.
It is a good town in which to indulge in one of Argentina's gastronomic
highlights, the parrillada - a selection of meat grilled over an open fire.
The Argentinians are carnivores on the scale of Tyrannosaurus Rex; if it has
red blood and moves, they eat it.
In the Cafeteria Ideal, where you can stuff yourself for Dollars 12, there
was cold starters, sliced beef, chicken legs, pasta, potatos, haunches of
lamb, fields of salad, followed by the parrillada itself: black sausage,
white sausage, fried intestines, more chicken and a beef steak so large that
it came with a leg at each corner. I measured it: 7in x 3in x 1 1/2 in deep.
'Eat it before it jumps over the moon,' advised my wife.
You can walk off a parrillada in the mountains behind Ushuaia. The tarmac
road soon peters out at the foot of a chair lift (skiing is a growing
industry) and becomes a rough track winding past the tin shacks of local
crab fishermen and newly-built holiday chalets. There is a glacier on the
peak at the back of the town, the path to it strewn with alpine flowers:
saxifrage, house leeks, tiny yellow drumstick primulas, nodding Icelandic
poppies.
From the Martial glacier there is a splendid view of the Beagle channel,
millpond still, reflecting its encircling peaks. Cape Horn lies on the
horizon; only those with cast-iron stomachs should attempt the boat trip to
this storm-lashed rock.
Hardy souls, who must possess their own tent and a decent sleeping bag, can
take a two-hour minibus trip into Tierra del Fuego national park, a
wilderness of mountains and lakes reminiscent of the Scottish highlands  -
and just as wet. There is a cosy cafe and a well-run campsite by the shores
of Lago Roca, and some splendid walks amid the smaller peaks and lakes, up
to the border with Chilean Tierra del Fuego.
One walk that is not recommended is the five-hour slog up the peak behind
Lago Negra, an inky-black pool surrounded by a sphagnum moss bog. The view
from the top is stunning, but it involves trekking through a forest of
lenga, a type of beech that grows, dies, rots and grows again until it forms
a near-imprenetrable barrier of semi-rotten wood. On and on we blundered,
crashing through foot-thick trunks that snapped like twigs, sinking
knee-deep in a puff of sawdust into seemingly solid logs. Down and down came
the rain.
The slog back was even worse: a stray branch snapped my precious telescopic
trout rod even as I hove in sight of Lago Negra, boiling with feeding fish.
I threw the rod down in a furious fit of pique, cursing and stamping through
the bog. 'Don't worry, darling,' soothed my wife, fixing the rod with a
twist of dental floss and a couple of matchsticks.
I snatched it from her and cast; the water heaved; I struck; a 5lb rainbow
trout virtually leapt into my arms. 'I love you]', I told my wife.
'You prat,' she said.
Getting there: Ushuaia has frequent air connections to Buenos Aires; the
five-hour flight costs approximately Dollars 500. By land, buses take about
two days from BA to Rio Gallegos in the far south of Pategonia, from where
it is an hour's flight to Ushuaia. From Chile, there is an arduous route
from Punta Arenas in the far south of that country, a ferry across the
Straits of Magellan to Porvenir, and then a 10-hour bus ride to Ushuaia. A
good hotel in Ushuaia, such as the Hotel Canal Beagle, which caters mainly
for cruise passengers, will cost upwards of Dollars 50 for a double room.
Staying at a casa de familia, a family B &amp; B, is cheaper and much more fun;
ask at the information office on Avenida Maipu.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Travel Focus - Caribbean &amp; South America: Pirates of
pleasure in pursuit of Virgins - James Henderson cruises the British Virgin
Islands in search of beaches, beer, and blondes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

IT WAS as though the yachts in the Sir Francis Drake Channel were
choreographed. Suddenly, from their haphazard headings, they all went about
and converged on Cooper Island, a scrubby spit of land where there is
nothing but a trendy beach bar.
Word had just gone out on the VHF that the yacht Sea Breeze was putting in
at Cooper Island for lunch. Supposedly on board there was the Swedish
women's volleyball team, enjoying a bit of R&amp;R in the British Virgin
Islands. The idea of 10 sleek 6ft blondes had sent the hot-blooded boys of
the BVI yachting fraternity into a frenzy.
A friend had brought me along for the ride and I was enjoying every
priceless minute of it. We waited in vain. But Cooper Island is no bad place
to pass a couple of lazy hours when the sun is at its height. It has a
palm-fronted strand and a bar, peopled by straw-haired yachties and
nut-brown beach-goers. The only unsettling thing about Cooper Island is
Jazz, a despotic dog who roams self-importantly over his territory.
The rumours shifted with the wind. It was not a volleyball squad after all,
but a team of models - even better - on a photographic shoot. Crest-fallen
heads perked up and moments later the yachts were off again, this time
seeking a catamaran, the name of which none of them knew. They had no luck
on that score, either. Late in the day they all headed for the good ship
William Thornton.
The William Thornton stands in the Bight off Norman Island, a popular
overnight anchorage. The ship is an elegant old Baltic trader, built in
Denmark in 1915. Despite its curious-looking superstructure, its graceful
wooden lines are still visible in the hull. Its days of hauling coal are
long gone; instead the William Thornton does a roaring trade as a floating
bar and restaurant. We ate on board, at hatch covers turned into tables.
Pirates do not carouse in the Virgin Islands any longer, but the Willy T, as
it is familiarly known, sells itself as a bit of a pirate ship. The bar in
the poop deck (which takes its name from the early Spanish habit of lining
the deck with puppet-like models of saints) has pictures of pirates and
their flags. Things soon began to liven up.
Noise travels well over water, and soon the yachtsmen came beetling across
in their dinghies, attracted by the sound of a party. There were no Swedish
girls on board, real or imitation, but there was a crowd of mad Californians
around the deck (no saints these, either). As the evening progressed, and
the gentle swaying of the ship began to compensate for my irregular
movements, so it all became more and more boisterous.
A 'bodyshot' is a rude version of a tequila shot, in which the salt, lemon
and tequila are located in different places on a Californian girl, supine on
the bar. There are more beach bars in the BVIs than anywhere else in the
Caribbean and they have a life of their own, spontaneously bursting into
activity as yachts materialise. Some have musical instruments lying around;
people pick them up and play.
But life, even in the BVIs, is not only beach bars, so next day I left the
yachties scouring the waterways for their flock of Amazons - no mean search
because there are 50-odd islands, rocks and cays in the BVIs, with scores of
isolated coves where you can hide yourself away.
If it is peaceful land-bound isolation that you prefer, then there are
plenty of hotels and villas in which to maroon yourself. Many offer
top-notch comfort; some are islands given over to a single resort. Guana
Island is little-known by British visitors: it takes just 30 guests in
deceptively simple rooms built of stone and scattered across the breezy
hillside, all with superb views. In a typically easy Caribbean manner, the
guests gather for drinks after a day on the beach and then eat with one
another at dinner.
Richard Branson's Necker Island can also be hired by parties of up to 20. It
has a huge open-sided main house built in Balinese style, decorated with
palms, oriental and Amerindian statues, an outsize snooker table and an
excellent selection of CDs. The 20-seat dining table weighs three tons.
Perhaps the best-known hotel among British visitors is Biras Creek, which
stands at the head of the North Sound in Virgin Gorda. Here, rooms are
ranged on the ocean-front. There is a rarified and elegant air about the
place. As I stumbled off the launch I realised that it was time to be on my
best behaviour.
Easier said than done. Three days on a yacht had played havoc with my middle
ear, and around me the land was rising and falling as though I was in a 3ft
swell. Conversation was confusing. Anyone sitting opposite me would rock and
sway as they spoke, pause, tilt and then sweep off as though in a
boatswain's chair. Cycling around the grounds was little more than a joke.
Presumably I gave an impression of being slightly adrift.
As soon as the dizzy swell subsided it was time to get back on to the water.
The Virgin Islands offer the best sailing holiday in the Caribbean. The
sailing is relatively easy, the winds constant and there are isolated coves,
elegant restaurants and endless beach bars, all within a couple of hours'
sail of one another. The islands are not that cheap and they have lost
almost any natural West Indian feel, but there is an easy mix of locals and
visitors.
I find that I am struck by the physical beauty of so many places in the
world, but islands have a special attraction. There are places in the BVIs
where the views carry over 20 or 30 miles and the islands, jumbled on one
another, fade to grey in the haze. The distant peaks are no more than a
faint outline scratched on the horizon. One of the beauties of sailing in
the BVIs is to be completely surrounded by islands. They lie like animals
around you, some curled asleep, others tense, ready to pounce.
Cooper Island and Norman Island are two small islands in a line of peaks
buried to their necks in water. They stand opposite Tortola, the capital
island, across the Sir Francis Drake Channel, where most of the sailing
takes place. But there are other areas to explore, so I headed for the other
side of Tortola, to Jost van Dyke, perhaps the most natural of the main
Virgin Islands. Electricity has just reached the place and the only visible
industry is the mining of sand, of which there is plenty.
True to form, it has its fair share of beach bars. On one beach, the
mile-long stretch of Great Harbour, there are six. The proprietors lie in
the sun waiting for custom. Jost van Dyke is so laid back that it can
properly be described as comatose. Except at New Year, that is, when it
collects as many as 2,500 sailors for a huge beach party.
People come from all over the world. They drink, dance, nail their business
cards to the rafters and, by midday next day, are gone; so the island
returns to its slumber.
White Bay, the next bay along, is a perfect Caribbean beach. The
fluorescence of the windsurfers is matched by the intense turquoise of the
water; the sand is so bright it hurts your eyes. It is also a good anchorage
and so we hove to, ordered dinner over the VHF - 'That'll be two lobsters, a
shrimp and a swordfish, please, over' - and slithered off into the sea to
wallow in the shallow water.
I don't know if the yachties ever did run their blonde quarry to ground,
whatever it turned out to be. But it made me laugh when I came across a
fearsome game of beach volleyball taking place at an out-of-the-way beach
bar. I was roaring past on a motorboat, but I could see that the players
were all blonde females. I nearly put it out over the VHF, but the sailors
would never have got there in time.
Sunsail (tel: 0705-219848) charters skippered yachts and bare boats, singly
and in flotillas, for two to 10 people, in the British Virgin Islands and
other Caribbean centres. In London, the BVI Tourist Board is on 071-240
4259.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Travel Focus - Caribbean &amp; South America: Relax: it's just a
pelican crossing - James Henderson enjoys the lazy lifestyle on undisturbed
Barbuda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BARBUDA is a little-known coral outcrop, lost, as its name suggests,
somewhere between Barbados and Bermuda. Barbuda is a sister island to
Antigua and lies some 30 miles to its north. It is mostly scrub and a few
superb, incredibly long beaches (there is so much sand that Barbuda actually
exports it); and a couple of incongruously smart and expensive hotels.
The island's highest point is 120ft, jokingly referred to as the Highlands
by the 900 locals. Over the centuries development has bypassed Barbuda. For
many years it was a private farm rented from the British king at an annual
rent of 'one fat sheep, if demanded.'
In fact, were it not for the abandoned cars all over the place (a common
feature of Caribbean islands), most of Barbuda would be recognisable to the
American Indians who lived there 500 years ago.
The Amerindians - the first Caribbean island-hoppers - certainly stole a
march on 20th century travellers. They lived within the rhythms of nature,
enjoying the benign climate, spending much of their time in hammocks,
fishing as need be and grilling their catch over open fires on the beach.
The Amerindian idyll can still be found in Barbuda, but you must be prepared
to pay a thoroughly 20th century price. Both the main hotels charge about
Dollars 1,000 (about Pounds 660) a night for two.
After my arrival, I took a bumpy ride along the island's only road. Like so
many West Indian roads it was pitted and pot-holed; the traffic simply
swings left and right through the path of least resistance.
Suddenly we emerged into the calm, manicured environs of the K Club. Either
side of its breezy white main house, the K Club has about 20 villas strung
out along one of the Caribbean's finest beaches - about five miles of it.
The K Club is the chic design child of Milanese fashion empress Mariuccia
Marinelli, known in the trade as Krizia.
Krizia's symbol, a simple K in the world of fashion, has sprouted palm
fronds on its left-hand stalk in the tropics and this logo appears all over
the club, on plates, pens and on the bottom of the pool.
As you would expect, the K Club has real style. With an acreage of white
wood and tiles, offset with jade fittings, it appears effortlessly simple,
but the simplicity is cleverly crafted. The design takes old Caribbean
themes like louvred windows, wicker furniture and gently-sloping roofs and
turns them to 20th century comfort. Fans overhead whip up the tropical heat;
even the showers have a view, through the garden to the sea.
The flight from Europe, following the sun across the Atlantic, helps you
relax into the rhythms of tropical life. After a long day's travelling you
flake out early in the evening, but then you wake with the sun (about 9am UK
time), and dawn is perhaps the best part of the Caribbean day.
The air is fresh and calm. Even the noises are different, unaffected by the
midday heat. I walked the whole beach on the first morning in a slightly
surreal state of mind after a heavy sleep, testing the sand between my toes.
Ahead of me was a little band of sandpipers trotting along, dodging the
frothy fingers of the breaking waves.
Breakfast was served on the veranda and I watched the gathering blue of the
sea; it strengthened steadily to turquoise as the sun climbed slowly higher
and higher.
There is little to do on Barbuda. I found myself reclining, happy to watch
the beach. It is still a living beach. Seven pelicans make it their beat,
sometimes arriving in formation, at other times cruising in alone, then
wheeling like a bomber on outstretched wings and dropping with a distant
flump in the water.
High above them is the occasional dark streak of a frigatebird. These
scissor-tailed birds are magnificent creatures. They have 6ft wingspans and
can fly at 100mph. Only when they are mating are they not so sleek; males
display ridiculously unwieldy scarlet pouches the size of a football on
their gullets. Their nest on Barbuda can be visited easily.
Snorkelling is also a great pleasure on an island as undisturbed as Barbuda.
You don't need to dive here because the best of the corals are so close to
the surface. The reefs shimmer with thousands of tiny silvery fish, all
facing into the current and twitching in unison.
Swim among them and they scatter in momentary chaos, but soon they come back
into line and the cloud re-forms around you. Elsewhere angel fish swim
singly and in pairs, coloured a luxurious deep blue, like velvet; rock
beauties loiter around the corals, pouting; lobsters lie in little stacks in
their crevices.
It comes as a bit of a surprise to find that there is a hotel bang next door
to the K Club (well, a couple of miles down the beach, to be fair). Even
more surprising, it has been there about 30 years. Coco Point Lodge has a
magnificent setting in a coconut garden, on a tapering spit of land rimmed
with very fine sand.
The sunset view takes in a string of islands from Antigua to Nevis. It is
very exclusive and it now sees generations of returning visitors. Newcomers
may not get in. Walk-in writers get short shrift.
The story runs that Krizia herself was refused entry and so she decided to
build her own hotel. Certainly the owner of Coco Point did not go a bundle
on the K Club. Guests there are not allowed to use his private airstrip.
There are few places around the Caribbean that I haven't managed to talk my
way in to. But it is surprising what you can see from below the high-water
mark if you use a long lens.
Coco Point is clearly smart. Some of the older rooms look small but there
are some superb villas, very finely decorated, overlooking an expanse of
sumptuous, golden sand.
James Henderson flew with BWIA, which operates twice-weekly flights to
Antigua from Heathrow. Current return fares: Pounds 804-Pounds 3,490.
From Antigua connections can be made to Barbuda on LIAT or the K Club's
private aircraft. It is possible to visit the K Club for the day from
Antigua (tel: 809-460-0300, fax: 460-0305).

FT  16 OCT 93 / Travel Focus - Caribbean &amp; South America: Capitalism comes
quietly to the Brazilian jungle - Christina Lamb takes to the trees on an
eco-tour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MY FIRST encounter with jungle wildlife on my first day as an ecotourist in
Brazil consisted of 60 rosy-cheeked Dutch guzzling a hearty breakfast of
tapioca pudding and scrambled eggs, watched intently by a family of monkeys
clinging to the netting surrounding the restaurant.
The bizarre role reversal presented a hilarious spectacle, though it was not
quite how I had envisaged a stay at the Amazon's only treetop hotel. Having
visited the jungle on several occasions as a journalist on the trail of a
story, I had been looking forward to returning more leisurely as a tourist.
I had imagined being overwhelmed by the splendour of the rainforest,
silenced by the majesty of trees thousands of years old. I had pictured
waking gently to the splash of fish, chatter of monkeys and whoop of exotic
birds, perhaps peering out from my hammock in the night into the eyes of
some passing wild cat. I had not expected to be brutally awoken by the sound
of a tour party of hefty Dutchmen trampling through the jungle and zooming
around on jetskis and ultralites.
Reached by a leisurely four-hour boat ride up the River Negro from the
jungle capital of Manaus, the Ariau Jungle Tower Hotel looms out of the
black water like an alien landing craft. A collection of wooden towers
shrouded in green netting and connected by a series of suspended catwalks
and interlocking passageways, it resembles one of those Escher sketches that
students often hang on their walls.
The concept behind Ariau was a good one. Most of the action in the Amazon
takes place out of sight, high in the trees, and many visitors leave
disappointed at the lack of visible wildlife. At Ariau, which is built
entirely from local wood and mounted 12 metres above water level, monkeys
are liable to leap on to your neck while walking along the catwalks, toucans
incline their beaks politely from branches conveniently situated at
eye-level, and pointy-nosed racoon-like animals follow at heel like dogs to
snuggle up with guests in the hammocks in reception.
Moreover, this is jungle travel made easy. A stay at Ariau involves none of
the irritations of adventure tourism that become funny only after the event,
such as being feasted upon by mosquitos, packed into splintering boats amid
the great unwashed, or bitten by giant ants while in the process of
relieving oneself.
But assigned luxury status by the Brazilian Tourist Authority, the Ariau
management has gone overboard in its desire to offer 'facilities.' Do people
really visit an Amazon getaway to ride jetskis, watch videos, make
international telephone calls or buy gemstones?
And catering for the mass market with 90 rooms (plus 100 under construction)
means that life at Ariau is highly regimented. A blackboard in reception
sets the day's agenda. 6am: Watch Sunrise. 6.30am: Watch Birds. 7.30am:
Breakfast. 9am: Visit Native House. I tried to imagine what the natives had
made of 60 hefty Dutch appearing for morning coffee. Maybe they appreciated
some tips on clog-making and tulip-growing.
Watching the Dutch party arriving back from the natives' house sporting seed
necklaces as evidence that capitalism has come to the jungle, I concluded
that Ariau was a convincing argument against mass market eco-tourism.
That was until I set off with a small party in a canoe. Gliding down inlets
on the black water amid half-submerged trees and giant lilies, we watched
pink dolphins frolicking round the boat, sullen natives spear-fishing in the
reeds and wild geese practising formation flying against a deep azure sky.
This was the kind of bliss that makes one doubt the value of progress.
The afternoon was again spent drifting lazily and fishing for piranhas with
raw meat. Apparently, the best way to attract them is by splashing and the
smell of fresh blood, but as none of our party offered to slash themselves
with a knife and jump in, our haul was small. Mercifully so, I thought,
watching the razor-sharp teeth of our victims snapping viciously as they
writhed on the floor of the boat. Successful catches could be taken to the
hotel to be dried, mounted and fashioned into an interesting conversation
piece.
Arriving back at sunset, I climbed the hotel's rickety Blue Sky Tower which,
at 40m, claims to be the world's highest wooden tower. From this vantage
point I watched the sky flame over the endless trees and water of the
Anavilhanas archipelago, the world's largest group of floating islands and
the subject of extensive research by Jacques Cousteau. After so much
excitement I was quite ready for my buffet dinner of exotic fruit and fish
the size of men, served by effeminate waiters in flowery shirts calling each
other 'darling'. The cook told me he was always receiving offers of marriage
from young Parisians. Adding to the surreality, the maitre d' confessed that
he was an out-of-work pornographic model who prefers dressing as a woman.
With the monkeys looking on from outside, I began to wonder if I had been
slipped some of the Amazon's hallucinogenic drugs.
Feeling sated, we took to our canoes again, paddling amid the stars
reflected in jet black water. This time we were hunting for alligators,
using flashlights to search out their red eyes. They are caught by the
guides and brought into the boat, so that brave tourists can hold them.
Jungle luxury meant small hard beds in rabbit-hutch rooms instead of
hammocks gently swaying under the stars. What sounded like the combined
snoring of 60 Dutch was the only decipherable animal noise. Those with a few
hundred dollars extra to spare could stay in the far more spacious Tarzan
House (at 36m high, the world's highest treehouse, according to the blurb)
or the Imperial Suite.
I began to feel converted to eco-tourism. Presented with my very own jungle
survival certificate at the end of the trip, I suddenly found myself
qualified in basic jungle survival techniques, navigation of the River Negro
and reconnaissance of the forest lowlands. Mine is on the wall above the
mounted piranha.
Christina Lamb travelled to Ariau Jungle Towers with Varig Airlines which
flies directly to Manaus from the US and via Rio from Europe.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Travel Focus - Caribbean &amp; South America: So much forest, so
few people, that's Guyana - Michael J. Woods explores a country of tropical
mystery and spectacular scenery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO PAIRS of bright red rear lamps glowed from the depths of the dense reed
bed bordering Guyana's Kamuni river. They were visible only when I shone the
torch at eye level from beside my head; then, they glinted back without
blinking.
We paddled the boat closer, drifting almost silently on the mirror of black
water. But even as the nosing bows rustled among the stems, the cayman
continued to lie motionless, its yellow-green body submerged and its bulging
eyes protruding from the surface, their redness reflected perfectly in the
water as four vermilion orbs.
We must have counted half-a-dozen of these reptiles in a cruise of less than
a mile, the largest over 4 1/2 ft long and probably as big as they grow in
these parts.
But, even at that size, these fish-eaters pose no threat to humans; and when
we returned to the steps of the landing stage, the camp staff were plunging
about in the river, enjoying a midnight swim.
At Timberhead, Tropical Adventures' jungle retreat, Amerindian-style houses
lie on the boundary between some of Guyana's all-enveloping rain forest and
what is known locally as the savannah, an area of dense, marshy grassland
and scrub which grew up after a disastrous fire burnt down the trees on
either side of the river some decades ago.
The roofs of Timberhead's stilt houses are thatched with fronds from the
troolie palm, and there is no need for windows or doors in an atmosphere
which remains constantly warm even when it pours with rain - which it did,
with disconcerting regularity, when I was there. Not for nothing is Guyana
known as the land of many waters, and a dry T-shirt is a useful accessory.
The inviting hammocks which hang across the living area, and bottles of
deliciously cold Banks beer, are almost more than even the most hyperactive
can resist. But resist I did from time to time so as to swim in the Kamuni
river, the translucent black water of which turns the sky red when viewed
from beneath the surface; to canoe in the early morning in silent search of
the giant otter; and to walk in the rain forest.
Without leeches, and with remarkably few biting insects, the jungle is
comparatively benign. But, like such forests everywhere, most of the action
takes place in the canopy, so we were lucky to spot a troop of bamboo
monkeys as they crashed through the tree-tops after spying us from high
above.
Birds were easier to admire on the bird table adjacent to the dining/kitchen
annexe and, here, a whole range of tanagers came to feast on banana. Even a
neighbouring tarantula had the grace to stay well away from the houses while
it posed obligingly on the light grey background of a palm frond, like a
many-fingered black, furry hand.
At night. the jungle becomes a place of mystery; and our night walk, in
total darkness and linked to one another only by short lengths of dry twig,
led us along a black corridor surrounded by strange cries, buzzes, whoops
and zips.
The Mississippi pontoon boat which had brought us here took us back
downstream to the Demerara river, an opaque, mushroom soup of silt stirred
up by storms far away in the hills. After half an hour pushing upstream, we
landed during another torrential storm and piled into three jeeps for a
two-hour slither through the jungle to Shanklands, a riverside resort.
Here, a number of white colonial houses stud 10 acres of emerald lawns on a
promontory above the Essequibo river, a waterway of enormous proportions and
the third-largest in South America; the biggest of the three islands at its
mouth is bigger than Barbados. Even at Shanklands, 30 miles from the sea,
the river is tidal and almost two miles across. Tramp steamers ply up and
down.
The grassy expanse on the red granite headland has been reclaimed from the
jungle over the past 10 years in a plan executed by Joanne Jardim, whose
father left her several hundred acres of forest. She started by sleeping in
a hammock under a plastic sheet before moving into an old bus.
Now, with elegant houses on the land, she was able to welcome us in style
and ushered us to a lunch table at which every setting was embellished with
a hibiscus flower.
Joanne has left some large trees for shade and, uncluttered by rain forest,
it is possible to appreciate their soaring height. There is forest walking
here, too; water sports on the river; and visits to the local towns and
villages. But, most exciting of all, it is possible to fly from an airstrip
some 20 minutes away to Kaieteur falls.
Throughout the 90-minute flight, the habitat beneath changes rarely, and
then only in small patches. For the most part it is endless, dark green rain
forest, relentless in all directions, spotted by the odd clearing for a gold
or diamond mine and lined very occasionally by a jungle track, the existence
of which is only betrayed by the faintest of traces in the canopy below. It
is easy to appreciate the analogy, quoted often to me during my visit, that
Guyana is the same size as Britain with a population of less than 1m - and
almost all of them living north of Inverness.
Below, as we flew, a gorge cut through the mountains, its bed filled with a
foaming river. And then there was Kaieteur, a clear fall of 741 ft throwing
a great plume of cloud into the air as if the falling water was pouring from
the spout of a boiling kettle.
The aircraft banked steeply and slipped down into the gorge below the falls
before flying up-river and over the very lip of the falls. If it is
possible, the walk to see them is even more spectacular. The path lies over
over sheets of bed-rock and dark, moss-filled crevasses before, finally,
running through a cavernous hollow between enormous boulders to arrive
abruptly on a natural rock terrace placed ideally for viewing.
From here, a steady stream of Guinness apparently plummets downwards to
burst in an endless flume on the rocks far below.
On the flight back to Georgetown, I pondered the apparently endless rain
forest. Logging is in its infancy here; but the temptations to plunder this
valuable resource, in a country where three-quarters of any income
disappears to feed its foreign debt, must be almost overwhelming. Both
Guyana and its forest need visitors from overseas. Better still, both are
worth the visit.
Michael Woods travelled to Guyana with British West Indian Airways; his
visit was hosted by Forte Hotels and Tropical Adventures.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Motoring: Big car, bigger bumps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS and senior managers not only drive bigger and better company cars
than the troops in their Escorts and Cavaliers; their accidents are bigger
and costlier and, alarmingly, more frequent, too.
According to a survey, the MD in his Pounds 25,000-plus car has an accident
costing an average Pounds 914 to repair every 9,500 business driving miles
(15,300 km) compared with sales executives (12,000 miles/19,300 km and
Pounds 445) and office-bound staff (15,000 miles/24,150 km and Pounds 511).
Lack of concentration and faulty judgment caused by stress and tiredness are
blamed by Fleet Management Services for the top managers' failings.
It analysed two years of insurance claims on the thousands of cars it
provides for companies. A rhetorical question, really, because of course
they should. But the easier cars become to drive, the less attention busy,
perhaps preoccupied people, feel they need give them.
Driving may be an essential chore to many of us but, if it is to be safe and
accident-free, it is still a craft.
If only the techniques taught by bodies such as the Institute of Advanced
Motorists could be put into practice. This would do more to make driving
safe for all road users - not least pedestrians - and slow the rise in
insurance premiums than all the high technology built-into the modern car.
It is a question of attitude.
Every driver, whether top executive or financially hard-pressed family man,
has to share the highway with millions of other people. Ideally, this would
imply general observance of laws which exist for the general good. But does
it?
Let us take insurance, which is exclusively a problem for the non-company
car driver. Protection agains third party claims has long been compulsory.
Years ago, when motoring was still a minority activity, the courts used to
be very tough on people who drove uninsured cars.
The penalty was disqualification. And if a disqualified motorist put two
fingers up to the law and carried on driving, he went to prison if caught.
There was no argument. A few weeks inside was as automatic a penalty as
disqualification is today for drink driving. Understandably, 30 years or so
ago very few people risked driving without insurance or when disqualified.
Compare the situation today. Driving an untaxed, uninsured car that could be
dangerously unfit because it has not had an MoT examination is seen by many
a motorist (including quite a few who have lost their licences anyway) as a
cheap alternative to buying insurance.
The Association of British Insurers reckons about 5 per cent of vehicles -
that means more than 1m cars, vans and lorries - on British roads are
currently uninsured.
Officialdom seems to look the other way. How many new age travellers tax,
insure and submit their vehicles for inspection; and how many even have
driving licences?
Who cares? Yet a collision with an uninsured vehicle can be financially
unpleasant for the innocent party. Like Paul Mitchell, of Coleford,
Gloucestershire, who was waiting to enter a roundabout when his car was
struck from behind.
Writing to Care on the Road, a journal of the Royal Society for the
Prevention of Accidents, Mitchell said he was comprehensively insured and
stood to lose some of his no-claims discount. The other driver, unlicenced
as well as uninsured, was taken to court, given 13 penalty points on his
non-existent licence and fined Pounds 60 under the discredited means-related
scheme.
'Effectively, he got off scot free,' said a predictably peeved Mitchell. Am
I alone in thinking this rather disgraceful? If uninsured, unlicenced
driving, and driving while disqualified, really are seriously anti-social
offences, what about changing the law to allow courts to seize and sell
offenders' cars? Does anyone agree?

The biennial motoringfest at Earls Court is no longer Motorfair but the
London Motor Show. It has been taken under the wing of the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders, which also runs the British International Motor
Show at the National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham. London Motor Show, which
opens next Thursday for a public preview day and closes on Sunday week, will
alternate with the Birmingham event.
Unfortunately, it clashes this time with the Tokyo Motor Show, which will
steal some of its thunder. Also, a number of the new-to-Britain exhibits
will already have been seen at the Frankfurt Show in September.
But never mind. There will be something for everyone interested in cars at
Earls Court, which has been transformed from a gloomy old arena guarded by
fierce ex-drill sergeant commissionaires into a modern exhibition hall.
Admission is Pounds 12 on preview day (October 21), Pounds 7.50 on all other
days (Pounds 5 after 5 pm).
There are parking spaces for 1,800 cars on site at Pounds 1.50 an hour,
Pounds 10 a day if booked in advance (tel: 071-370-8390) or Pounds 15
overnight. Visitors, say the show organisers, are advised to travel by Tube.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Sport: Phillies wreck the game plan - World Series re-match
is foiled as outsiders beat the odds / Baseball
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR A MUG, we did not do too badly this year. We predicted when the season
began that the Toronto Blue Jays, last year's World Series baseball
champion, were still the class act of the American League while the pitching
of the Atlanta Braves ought to give them the National League pennant and a
re-match with the Canadian club.
And so it should have come to pass - except for the inexplicable grittiness
of the Philadelphia Phillies, a team which nobody, even itself, picked to do
much this year at all. On Wednesday, victory over Atlanta gave Philadelphia
the National League title and today they will meet the Blue Jays in Toronto
in the opening game of this year's World Series.
Our wish list was also generally only half fulfilled. On the field, Fernando
Valenzuela won eight, not 15, games for the Baltimore Orioles but, at least
in July, was his old devious self again. Bo Jackson hit 15, not 30, home
runs for the Chicago White Sox (and flopped horribly in the play-offs
against Toronto); but even to perform at the top level with an artificial
hip is an achievement in itself. Nolan Ryan's last season was marked by
injury, not a no-hitter but, aged 46, he could still pitch at 95 mph.
Off the field, Marge Schott, suspended owner of the Cincinnati Reds, was
mercifully quiet but George Steinbrenner, restored to the New York Yankee
helm, could not in the end contain himself and began musing about vacating
Yankee Stadium. Baseball did not get its desired new commissioner while the
owners, desperate for the television dollar, infuriated traditionalists by
announcing that both leagues would be split into three divisions, not two,
next year with 'wild cards' (ie, non-champions) eligible for an extra round
of play-offs. With more teams losing money than making it, the fire sale of
the higher-paid players on the San Diego Padres could be a grim harbinger.
This summary of developments might be read to imply a predictable, even
depressing, season. New Yorkers probably believe it was both, for the
once-beloved Mets played abominably and behaved worse. The Yankees flattered
only to deceive.
In many respects, though, this was a wondrous year. It featured, given next
year's re-alignment, what many consider probably to have been the last great
divisional race - in the National League West between Atlanta and the San
Francisco Giants. This was decided only on the last day of the regular
season when the Giants lost to their old nemesis, the Los Angeles Dodgers,
thus missing the play-offs.
The Giants, who last took the World Series 39 years ago when still in New
York, deserve sympathy. They won 103 games, a total higher than any other
team except the Braves and more than enough to have won a pennant in the
25-year history of divisional play. At the start of August they were 10
games ahead and, apart from an early September swoon, did not fold. They
were managed expertly by Dusty Baker, and Barry Bonds - he of the Dollars
42m, six-year contract - had another colossal year.
The Braves, however, simply were irresistible. Their record after the
mid-season All Star break was a staggering 51-17. The starting pitching  -
Glavine, Maddux, Avery and Smoltz - was all it was expected to be; but the
key probably was the acquisition in July from San Diego of Fred McGriff, the
slugging first baseman.
The American League East had its moments, too, until September. Then,
Toronto suddenly started winning and the Yankees, Orioles, Detroit Tigers
and Boston Red Sox all began losing, even to the weaker teams. The Orioles'
Cal Ripken played every game and is now only a season and a half away from
passing Lou Gehrig's record for indestructibility.
Undoubtedly, the surprise packet was Philadelphia, who went from bottom of
the National League East last year to an easy first. This is a team of
hairy, burly men (noteably Dykstra, Kruk, Incaviglia and Daulton among the
hitters; Schilling, Greene and Williams among the pitchers) who revel in
their unkemptness and, mostly, played well above all known form.
Perhaps, though, the season was most memorable for the coming of age of a
new generation of authentic young superstars, all aged about 25: Juan
Gonzales of Texas, Ken Griffey in Seattle, Frank Thomas of the White Sox,
Mike Piazza of the Dodgers, Carlos Baerga of the Cleveland Indians, and
Roberto Alomar and John Olerud of the Blue Jays.
Alex Fernandez and Wilson Alvarez helped give the White Sox a pitching staff
worthy of comparison (not always fanciful) with that of Atlanta. Add Jose
Canseco of Texas, Mark McGwire of Oakland and Mike Mussina of Baltimore, all
beset by injury this year, and baseball's playing future seems in excellent
hands.
The same goes for Toronto, the defending king of the hill. The Blue Jays
sometimes are described as a 'rent-a-team' paying top (therefore, not
Canadian) dollars to the better mercenaries but using them well. They
compensated for off-season departures by picking up some venerable
warhorses: Paul Molitor, 15 years a Milwaukee Brewer, and Dave Stewart and
Rickey Henderson, who found great success with Oakland.
Molitor, 37, merely batted in 100 runs for the first time in his career and
became the oldest player to hit 20 homers and steal 20 bases in a season.
Pitcher Stewart, still fiercely competitive at 36, was undefeated in
September and took his team to two wins in the play-off with the White Sox.
He has now passed Jim 'Catfish' Hunter for most wins, starts and innings in
championship play.
In reality, the Blue Jay pitching remains spotty. But the first six of its
batting line-up - Henderson, Devon White, Molitor, Joe Carter, Olerud and
Alomar - are the best in the game while the ninth in the order, Pat Borders,
was the most valuable player (for his hitting more than his catching) in
last year's World Series.
So, the mug must make his choice - the bat against the arm. Contrary to our
long-standing personal conviction (bolstered by the serious prophets in
baseball) that great pitching will usually beat great hitting, the imported
Canadian timber gets the nod this year. The World Series is too short for it
to be denied.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Sport: Taylor: a hard man to replace - Soccer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAHAM TAYLOR, England's soccer manager, is not without tactical acumen. Nor
does he lack courage. On Wednesday night, soon after his team had lost 2-0
to Holland in their World Cup qualifying match, he strode into a crowded
press conference, sat behind the microphone and went straight on to the
attack. 'I have never been a person to make excuses,' he began. (Actually,
that is not quite true but let it pass). 'But . . .'
He then began a detailed complaint about the serious incidents that turned
the game against England: Ronald Koeman should have been sent off for
fouling David Platt in a scoring position; Jan Wouters should have been
punished for encroaching at the subsequent free kick. Taylor pointed out
that when, a minute later, the Dutch were given a free kick in a similar
position, Tony Adams was punished for a similar offence and Koeman, 'who
should not have been on the field,' scored from the re-taken kick.
Taylor listed England's string of near misses when shots twice hit the post
and two others were cleared off the line. Unprompted, he showed his
fair-mindedness by saying he thought Frank Rijkaard was not offside, as the
referee ruled, when he put the ball in England's net in the first half. He
stressed that the game was 'not about team selection' and 'not about
formations' - the two areas where he had been criticised beforehand - but
about 'incidents.'
It was a strong, coherent, eloquent performance - indeed, one of the reasons
Taylor was picked for the job in the first place was his ability to talk to
the press - but, like that of his team, it was largely in vain. Most of his
critics were not even there. Many were still in the press box struggling to
meet the deadlines imposed by the game's 8.15 pm kick-off. A few had already
made their way to the bar.
In truth, Taylor's post-match press conferences normally are brief, polite
affairs, especially when there is no Paul Gascoigne to discuss. Perhaps it
is the English dread of creating a scene, especially in front of foreigners.
On Wednesday night, he was asked only one question: would he 'soldier on? -
a polite way of asking if he would resign. With rising emotion, Taylor said
he would not quit although, typically, it took him five minutes to make the
point. Then, he stood up. As his back disappeared through the door, it was
almost possible to see the daggers quivering between his shoulder blades.
Taylor's England contract runs to the end of this season and his team can
still qualify for the World Cup although, as he admitted on Wednesday, it
would take a 'major miracle.' If that does not happen, the Football
Association will be tempted to look around for a replacement.
The scars of the traumatic relations between successive England managers and
the press will shape the decision, as they helped to shape the selection of
Taylor and the likeable Bobby Robson before him. Robson was at the match as
an analyst for Dutch television; white-haired, seemingly healthy and happy,
his familiar figure brought a pang of nostalgia for the long years of his
timid managership. Terror of being humiliated by the press has distorted the
way the FA treats the job of England manager.
The simple answer to the FA's dilemma is to pick a manager who will win
every game - but no one believes that any of the leading candidates is
capable of such witchcraft.
Furthermore, the sight of Rijkaard, Koeman, Dennis Bergkamp, Bryan Roy and
Marc Overmars tearing into England on Wednesday was a reminder that Taylor
did not have a world-class player in his squad.
It is possible to succeed at international level without a Bergkamp or a
Rijkaard; Norway has shown that. But Egil Olsen, the Norwegian manager, has
said he does not think his team's rigorously workmanlike approach would be
tolerated by English fans and press. The England team must succeed by
expressing the national genius. If it falters, its failures are read as
symptoms of national decay. It must assert the English virtues of heart,
stomach and sinew in the face of foreign cunning and sophistication.
Taylor has made mistakes. He has failed to grasp that international players
need to be nurtured. He was too willing to discard members of the 1990 World
Cup semi-final team: Des Walker, Chris Waddle and, until this week, Paul
Parker. Taylor also helped drive Gary Lineker into premature exile. He
failed to cultivate replacements. His selections were inconsistent.
Yes, Wednesday's game was one of 'incident.' Yes, England had the chances to
steal it. But if Taylor's team had taken more than one point from Norway
earlier, it would not have been in that position.
Taylor has not been a good England manager. But, on Wednesday, as he made
his excuses to the journalists and left, it was difficult not to respect his
courage. He has taken the relentless personal criticism, although not always
with dignity, and kept coming back for more. For that reason, he will be
difficult to replace.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Success in a fragile market -
Stephen Court meets a glass-etcher who carved a niche in new areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN COURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIP BRADBURY'S glass-etching business began in the sedate world of
reproduction Victorian door panels. But he has had some bizarre and
high-profile orders too, such as a glass map of the world made for the pop
star Tina Turner. The map, measuring 8ft by 4ft, had electric lighting and
cost Pounds 10,000. It showed all the places where the singer had given
concerts during a recent international tour.
Then there was the ship-in-a-glass for a beer advert. As the pint was
downed, so the ship appeared to sink. Bradbury has also decorated glass for
the sets of the period British television series, The House of Eliott and
Lipstick On Your Collar.
Although much of his bread-and-butter trade comes from the private housing
market, Bradbury's business kept growing during the recession. Yet he wears
the mantle of entrepreneur with diffidence. He says his main failing is
that: 'I approach business like an artist, and I don't use the tools
available to business people, such as a marketing strategy.'
The key, he finds, is in producing designs which are aesthetically pleasing,
for a reasonable price. 'I know what designs I like, and I think I am no
different to most other people. We try to tune in to what the individual
customer wants.'
Allied to this is a lean business operation. Bradbury took a mortgage on his
house to start the company. 'Since then it has been self-financed. We
haven't had to borrow a penny from the bank.' He has between two and four
employees, according to demand, and tries to keep a tight rein on employment
costs.
Bradbury has been in the glass business for 17 years. He set up Philip
Bradbury Glass seven years ago. 'I was very interested in the technical
challenge of etching glass, and was pleasantly surprised by the demand for
it.' He did not have a mortgage for his home, and borrowed Pounds 100,000 on
the property.
Most of that went into buying the leasehold of a shop in Finsbury Park,
which doubles as showroom and workshop. The remaining Pounds 20,000 was put
into equipment, such as a machine for sandblasting, which is the main
technique he uses for etching glass. Turnover hit Pounds 83,000 in 1990-91
and exceeded Pounds 200,000 for the financial year to July 1993.
The Victorian reproduction work includes making panels of two panes and a
fanlight - for exterior doors, costing under Pounds 200. The glass panels
for star, or Oxford, frame interior doors are more complex but smaller, and
cost up to Pounds 130. These have nine panes, with cobalt blue or ruby
coloured glass in the sides and corners.
The amount of 'new' work done by the company has been growing. The current
ratio of 'new' to 'restoration' work is about 60:40. Signs, corporate
awards, logos, gifts, advertising designs - the scope for etched glass is
reassuringly wide.
Corporate customers have included British Telecom, Pepsi, Hertz and EMI.
Much of the growth has been by word of mouth. In spite of the diffidence
about conventional business techniques, Philip Bradbury Glass is in the
Yellow Pages business directory and the Building Conservation Directory, and
advertises in magazines catering for the period housing market. He has just
introduced a work station for computer-aided design work and is planning to
extend the workshop into the yard at the back of his shop to increase
working space and improve the reception area.
One of Bradbury's most significant customers has been the JD Wetherspoon
chain of pubs. The period Victorian style fits in well with Bradbury's
designs. 'There has been a return to traditional styling in pubs,' he says.
'People feel at home in a Victorian atmosphere.'
Pub contracts have shown the robustness of the glass business - and its
fragility. The work Bradbury is most proud of is the decoration for the
windows and mirrors of the Oueen's Head, in Acton Street, near London's
King's Cross station.
The centrepiece is a large etching of Queen Victoria, beautifully reproduced
from a Penny Black stamp. The night after the pub was opened the windows
were smashed. As with the glaziers still engaged in repairing the
bomb-shattered City of London after the second major IRA attack, the whole
project had to start again.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Unaccustomed as I am to software
. . . - Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN BROOKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU have ever had to make a speech, write a report, or write an article
you will know that it is not as easy as it first appears. The first three
sentences of what you say are vital: in less than 20 seconds, your audience
will either tune in to you or put their mind to some other thing.
The other problem is to get those jewels of wisdom down on paper - and in
the right order. A new software import from the US, a program called
Thoughtline, can help to resolve both these dilemmas.
I know that when I sit down to write I need all the help that new technology
can give. Some computer programs can help in overcoming the problem of
writers' block. In the past I have used many of them. In general, they take
the form of outliners. With outliners you type in thoughts and ideas in any
sequence and later reorder them to make the various connections. None is
interactive like Thoughtline, nor does any of them go as far as organising
your thoughts for you.
Using the thoughts you type in, it asks questions to focus your ideas and
then asks for elaboration of ideas it does not understand. Thoughtline's
data base is built around a set of key words. When it encounters those words
in your typing it generates a particular type of question. Thoughtline
focuses your thinking.
It probes at your idea. The program keeps asking questions; it prompts you
to address the subject at hand. Thoughtline challenges the user to think
more deeply about the topic. Thoughtline is a piece of software that helps
develop your ideas. It helps you focus on the key points of the issue. It is
different from other programs of its genre.
The program organises ideas and generates new ways of addressing the idea -
but it cannot solve other problems. Presented with the problem: 'What is the
best way of marketing this product?' it appears to go round in circles. It
cannot get to the point of asking you the correct questions for you to focus
your ideas.
Thoughtline is irritatingly friendly. But, then it is an American program.
Opening with 'Buenos dias Robin. What's on your mind?' does not generate a
great deal of confidence. Sometimes Thoughtline comes up with ludicrous
questions. You can pass over these questions without answering them. At
other times it is merely the syntax of the question that is wrong. But, I am
interested more in its ability to solve problems rather its syntactical
deficiencies.
In a broad sense it is using the fledgling principles of artificial
intelligence. An article has a different fundamental structure than a report
or speech, but the program organises what you have typed into a draft for
each situation and generates a printed copy that is reasonably well laid
out.
In its own particular way, it does overcome problems of writing articles,
speeches and reports. The program's manual proclaims 'Thoughtline - For
Great First Drafts' and that is what it gives you. Although it could not be
easier to use, it takes time before you are able to get the best out of it.
A little perseverance goes a long way.
Thoughtline is available from CABC, PO Box 162, Newbury, Berks. Tel:
0635-255300, Fax: 0635255148. The price is Pounds 83 + VAT.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: A classic example - Directors'
transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN ROGERS, The Inside Track
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW CAN one avoid talking about Steel Burrill Jones, the insurance broker?
It is such a classic example of just how accurate an indicator directors can
prove, particularly when they deal in unison.
Back in April, a total of nine directors sold more than 1m shares at 234p.
Of these, the largest sales were executed by directors who had received SBJ
shares in consideration of their shares in an acquired company.
Interim results in September came as a nasty surprise to the market and,
with the company slipping into the red, the shares were hit hard.
Nevertheless, directors wanted to buy the shares again. In all, 10 directors
purchased a total of 125,000 at 144p.
John Saville is chairman of J. Saville Gordon, a property investment
company. One might expect him to have pinpoint accuracy when it comes to
buying and selling his own shares. But history suggests that his timing
could be a little less than perfect.
His most obvious aberration was to sell 1m shares at 32.5p in August last
year - just before the price began to rise. Now, he has sold 500,000 at 60p
each.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: The art of thinking small - Neil
Moore sets out some ground rules for investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALLER companies are firmly back on the investment agenda. The theory is
that the green shoots of recovery have appeared and that niche operations
and short lines of communication, which became vices during the recession,
have recovered their virtue. Restricted share marketability, which magnified
investors' losses during four years of underperformance, could now sharply
magnify the gains.
Well, perhaps. But investing in smaller companies is an art as much as a
science. More accurately, it calls for an exercise of judgment beyond
analysts' conventional number-crunching. Nonetheless, there are some useful
rules.
Investment in any company begins with a look at the products and/or services
that it offers. The smaller the company, the fewer the areas of activity and
the more specific one's questions. Is demand for the product sufficiently
large and growing? Will it continue to grow? What is the bargaining power of
the supplier vis-a-vis the customer? How high are the barriers to entry for
would-be competitors (for example, heavy capital investment, technical
know-how)?
An ideal situation would be a company making an advanced component, the
reliability of which is essential for the customer's end-product while
forming only a small proportion of its total cost. That leads to wide and
sustainable margins.
You then look at the company's financial position. Unfortunately, this is
not as straightforward as you might think. Accountants have been described
as people who would rather be precisely wrong than roughly right and this
portrayal, while unkind, is not without foundation. A generation of creative
accountants, pursued by successive exposure drafts and accounting standards,
has left the ordinary investor bewildered.
Naturally, you look for balance sheet strength, hoping (or rather checking)
that all the debts and similar obligations have been shown properly. And you
look, too, for a progressive earnings-per-share growth record through all
stages of the economic cycle - with comfortable (and ideally expanding)
margins. But it is especially important to look at cash balances and cash
flow.
Pay particular attention to the 'Source and Application of Funds' statement
and check that the company, having serviced its debt, paid its taxes and
distributed dividends, has generated sufficient cash to replenish its
capital and invest for future growth.
You can, of course, bend or break these rules - for example, if looking for
recovery or turn-round situations. But, while the potential rewards may be
great, so are the risks.
The next stage, appraising the quality of management, is the most tricky. A
professional investor will visit the company, have face-to-face discussions
with key staff, check internal reporting systems and financial controls, and
ensure that the business plan is sound and that there are contingency
arrangements. This is obviously impracticable for a private investor but it
is a crucial part of the appraisal process.
Accordingly, as with any steps for which you lack the resources or the time,
make the professionals work for you. Consult your stockbroker or other
financial adviser and read the stock market commentators in the press.
Decide the points that you wish answered and be sure the pundits have at
least satisfied themselves on those scores.
So much for company analysis - how about stock market prospects? The main
yardstick here is the price/earnings ratio. I have a personal rule of thumb.
To avoid being carried along by extremes of fashion or exposed to
unrealistic expectations, you should not buy a share with a p/e more than
three-quarters the percentage annual earnings growth rate. This is no more
infallible than any other yardstick but it could help to keep your feet on
the ground.
One particular merit of smaller companies is that directors often have
significant share stakes, ensuring a community of interest between
management and investors. Thus, it is important to monitor directors' share
dealings. Be wary if you see them selling: there might well be a humdrum
explanation in an individual case (say, a tax bill) but sales from more than
one director in the same company are a definite amber light.
Another word of caution - take any profits setback seriously , especially if
apparently unexpected. The first piece of bad news is rarely the last. It is
painful to sell after a significant fall in the share price, but it can be
even more painful to hold on in such circumstances.
Finally, back to the question of risk. Individually, smaller companies are
more risky than larger ones although, historically at least, not when in
groups of sufficient number to provide adequate diversification. If you wish
to hold shares in just one or two smaller companies, recognise that, while
not quite on a par with putting your stake on the favourite in the 2.30 at
Epsom, you are doing it as much for the interest and excitement as for the
reward.
If you want a diversified portfolio and lack the means or opportunity to
manage it yourself, study the form and choose a specialist smaller companies
unit trust or investment trust from a stable of established pedigree.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Sharesave options
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE two questions concerning sharesave schemes.
1. If the company becomes subject to a takeover, are the sharesave scheme
shares included in the bid?
2. For capital gains tax purposes, are you deemed to have purchased the
shares at the beginning or the end of the scheme?
1. Not necessarily. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlets IR97 (SAYE
share options) and IR98 (SAYE share option schemes: explanatory notes).
2. The shares are deemed to be acquired on the day on which the options are
exercised. The cost of the options themselves (which is usually fairly
small) is indexable from the day they were granted; the cost of exercising
the options is indexable from the day they are exercised. Ask your tax
office for the free pamphlet CGT13 (The indexation allowance for quoted
shares); the pamphlet CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an introduction) might also
be useful.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Swiss miss?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE Weekend FT of September 11/12, Peter Martin says of enhanced scrip
dividends: '. . . This is one of those wheezes from which everyone gains,
except the tax man and investment trusts . . .'
I live in Switzerland. As I understand it, such dividends are treated for UK
residents as being net of a 20 per cent tax charge, while for foreign
residents the dividend is effectively gross, as the nominal 20 per cent tax
charge is not recognised in the same way as the tax credit associated with a
normal dividend payment. Am I missing something, or am I effectively
disadvantaged relative to a UK resident shareholder?
A UK-resident shareholder pays no tax on scrip in lieu of a dividend unless
125 per cent of the 'appropriate amount in cash' (the market value of the
scrip, broadly speaking), when added to his other income, brings him into
the scope of either higher rate tax or age surcharge - in which case, the
effective rate of tax on the 'appropriate amount in cash' is 25 per cent (20
per cent on 125 per cent) or, in a simple case, 12.5 per cent (10 per cent
on 125 per cent), respectively. The 'appropriate amount in cash' is treated,
for capital gains tax purposes, in much the same way as the cost of taking
up a rights issue.
A non-resident shareholder similarly pays no UK tax on scrip in lieu of a
dividend unless 125 per cent of the 'appropriate amount in cash' brings him
into the scope of higher rate tax or age surcharge (if he is a Commonwealth
citizen or is otherwise entitled to age relief).
Under article 10(3)(a)(iv) of the Switzerland-UK double taxation convention,
however, you would be exempt from higher rate tax on such a scrip issue so,
to that extent, you have an advantage over a shareholder resident in the UK.
As you say, the notional 20 per cent tax deduction from 125 per cent of the
'appropriate amount in cash' is not treated like the one-quarter tax credit
associated with a real dividend: this is true for residents and
non-residents alike.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Can pay, won't pay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE AN endowment policy soon to mature. It was taken out on my life and
was issued in trust for my four (now adult) children. The life company will
pay out to me. I asked if it would pay out to my four children but, as I am
alive, it said no.
Since the policy does not form part of my estate, I feel I can divide it
between them with no restrictions. But my accountant tells me I cannot do
this as it will be over the Pounds 3,000 I can give away in a year as an
inheritance gift. Who is right?
It would appear from your letter that the proceeds of the policy will be
payable to you. But the policy contains life assurance so that, should you
die during its term, your children would receive the benefit of the
insurance cover. Once you survive the redemption term, the proceeds will be
payable to you. As regards the amount which can be gifted, you are able to
give Pounds 3,000 during the year to April 5 1994. This will be a
fully-exempt gift if you have made no others in the year. If you made none
in the previous tax year, then you can give Pounds 6,000 from the proceeds
of the policy.
If the proceeds exceed Pounds 6,000, then the balance will be potentially
exempt on any gift you make and will become taxable only if you die within
seven years from the date of the gift. Even then, however, the gift might
fall within your nil rate band. Therefore, it is quite possible that no tax
would be payable on the gift.
But if you do not survive for seven years, then, assuming that the gift
falls within the nil rate band, the remainder of your estate could become
taxable if it exceeds the nil rate band of Pounds 150,000.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Legal battle over loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO repossession cases, expected to reach court by the end of this month,
are to be contested using a previously untried defence. The lender in the
cases, believed to be National Home Loans, is seeking to recover properties
on which the deferred interest mortgages it granted fell into arrears.
Trethowans of Salisbury, the legal firm representing the borrowers, intends
to claim that the mortgages cannot be enforced because the deferred interest
element in effect constituted a separate loan which should have been subject
to the Consumer Credit Act.
Paul McDonnell-Staff, an Australian lawyer acting as consultant to
Trethowans on these and other similar cases, said lenders generally claimed
mortgages were exempt from the act under section 16 and various statutory
instruments. But section 16 was notoriously complicated and difficult to
interpret.
'In our view, it is limited to money loaned for the purpose of buying land
and buildings or for home improvements,' he explained, 'We say you cannot
apply that to cover a general purpose loan, which is what deferred interest
mortgages often were.'
McDonnell-Staff said Trethowans already had filed defences on this basis in
about 20 county court cases involving home income plans where the deferred
interest loans had been used to buy investment bonds. None has yet come to
full trial, but he said many other solicitors and barristers had contacted
the firm to support its view, and added: 'If we are successful in using this
defence, it will open Pandora's box.'
He forecast that people who had been struggling to keep up payments on
deferred interest mortgages might stop doing so if they saw a legally viable
exit.
Because deferred interest mortgages were marketed most heavily late in the
1980s, many borrowers faced a steep rise in interest rates - sometimes, a
doubling - after the period of deferment, typically five years. They also
saw the market value of their property drop just when rolled-up interest
increased their debt.
Centralised lenders - of which National Home Loans is one - and smaller
building societies were the main sources of deferred interest loans. At NHL,
where about 15 per cent of mortgages are deferred interest, spokesman James
Fuller said the company was aware of the cases. 'It would not be appropriate
to say anything at the moment,' he added.
At Mortgage Express, a spokesman said the company was quite comfortable with
its position on deferred interest loans but would not reveal what percentage
of its total book they represented.
At UCB Home Loans, marketing director Roy Battison said that up to half the
company's Pounds 3bn mortgage book was in deferred rate lending.
'We are probably one of the biggest in the market for that sort of thing,'
he said, 'But we have not been challenged and don't perceive we would have a
problem if we were,'

FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Mercury puts its faith in blue chips
 -Unit trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NAME British Blue Chip conveys an air of solidity. That is certainly the
aim of Mercury Fund Managers, which sees the fund as the flagship of its
unit trust range.
The trust has been run by Barry Woolf, the investment director of MFM (a
division of Mercury Asset Management), since June 1992. He stresses that
investment at MFM is a team effort, and adds: 'The record of the trust is
75-80 per cent due to the team and 20-25 cent to the individual.'
Woolf says the effective launch of the trust was in May 1987 when the merger
of the various components of the Mercury group led to the conversion of the
old Colemco trust into a blue chip fund.
To Mercury, 'blue chip' means companies with a market capitalisation of
Pounds 1bn and above. Accordingly, around 90 per cent of the portfolio tends
to be invested in stocks in the FT-SE 100 index. 'Since any UK investor
would want to hold the bulk of their investment in such stocks, we see this
as a core equity fund for private investors,' says Woolf.
The fund is relatively concentrated, typically holding around 45-50 stocks.
Since it is invested in large company stocks, there is no liquidity
constraint; the portfolio could easily grow sharply from its present Pounds
200m without Mercury having any problems in buying the shares it wants.
Investment strategy flows from a group overview about the prospects for
various individual sectors; stocks are then selected within that sector
framework. 'We are prepared to take quite significant bets on individual
sectors,' says Woolf.
As of October 1, the sector breakdown was: consumer groups (38 per cent),
financials (22 per cent), others (16 per cent), capital goods (15 per cent),
cash (5 per cent) and oil &amp; gas (4 per cent).
'We take the view that the recovery in the UK is going to be a slow
process,' says Woolf. So, although the trust is overweight in capital goods,
it is invested mainly in 'solid/high-quality companies' with a diversified
range of products, such as GEC, BTR and RTZ.
Another sector which the trust has favoured is financials, because of the
sensitivity to low interest rates of banks, insurance and property
companies. Financials should also see the benefit of cost cutting
programmes, and of a reduction in their bad debt problems.
Among the consumer stocks, the trust has stepped back from the high street
stores and food retailers and has invested heavily in media and leisure
groups. Woolf says he is encouraged by the number of UK companies which are
demerging in order to enhance shareholder value, citing examples such as
Rothmans International and Pearson (which owns the Financial Times).
In addition, he says the fund looks for companies with an above average
dividend yield, where the dividend is well covered. 'High-yielding shares
with a low level of dividend cover may effectively be fixed interest stocks
over the next few years,' he argues; that is because of the minimal
prospects for dividend growth.
The 10 largest holdings in the portfolio as of October 1 were: Zeneca,
Shell, BTR, GUS, Pearson, Prudential, Glaxo, Sun Alliance, Rothmans
International and TSB.
The trust has an excellent long term performance record, with growth of 87.9
per cent over the five years to October 1 (offer-to-bid with income
re-invested: source Micropal). That places it eighth out of 118 funds in the
UK equity growth sector over the period; as the graph shows, the fund has
also outperformed the FT-A All-Share index over the same period.
Over three years, the fund is above average, ranking 54th out of 137. Only
over the past year does the fund's relative performance slip, with the trust
finishing 133rd out of 145 funds.
Woolf points out that this period saw a sharp rebound in small company
shares with the All-Share Index outstripping the performance of the Footsie.
'The principle that I want to instil into the unit trust team is one which
has led to the strength of our pension fund business,' Woolf says. 'If we
can perform a bit above average on a consistent long term basis, we will
always end up in the right part of the league table.'
He believes the tide is turning once more in favour of blue chip stocks, and
feels the market was undiscriminating in its race to buy smaller company and
cyclical stocks. Now, it will become more choosy and start looking for
quality companies.
Charges. The initial charge is 5 per cent and the annual is 1.5 per cent. At
present, the bid-offer spread is around 6 per cent. Both accumulation and
distribution units are available. Distributions are paid twice a year and
the present yield is around 3.1 per cent.
Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000, or Pounds 50 a month via the savings
scheme. British Blue Chip can be bought via a Mercury Pep with no additional
charge, and the same minimum investment levels.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: S&amp;P fund offers 4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAVE &amp; Prosper is launching a monthly income personal equity plan designed
to offer investors a tax-free yield of 4 per cent a year. It will invest in
four of S&amp;P's unit trusts: Scotyields (30 per cent), Income (25 per cent),
High Return (20 per cent), and Smaller Companies Income (20 per cent).
The remaining 5 per cent of investors' money will be kept in a cash fund,
which will earn interest. Distributions from the unit trusts will be fed
into this fund, which will then pay out income in a series of 12 level
payments. Each year, the amount of income will be reviewed.
Obviously, the maximum tax-free income investors can earn through this plan
is limited by the Pep regulations, which allow only Pounds 6,000 to be
invested in a plan in any tax year. A 4 per cent yield on an investment of
Pounds 6,000 implies a monthly income of just Pounds 20. But since the plan
is an equity investment, savers should expect the level of income (and
indeed the value of their capital) to grow over time.
How much growth the plan can produce is open to question, given the less
than impressive performance record of the four trusts concerned. Both High
Return and Scotyields had a below-average performance in the UK equity
income sector over the one, three five and 10 year periods to October 1.
(Indeed, High Return was next to last in the sector over the three and five
year periods.)
Smaller Companies Income has an above-average record in its sector over 10
years (10th out of 25 funds) but is below average over one, three and five.
The Income fund has done well in its sector (UK Balanced) over the past
year, finishing third out of 36 funds. But over the three, five and 10 year
periods, it is close to the bottom of the sector. So, investors need to take
on trust that S&amp;P can improve the performance of the funds.
Julian Tregoning, S&amp;P's investment division director, points out that he
appointed a new head of the UK equity desk, Michael Ashbridge, last October
with the target of ensuring that 50 per cent of the group's UK equity funds
were above the median. Tregoning says Ashbridge has met the target, and all
but one of the group's UK funds have outperformed the All Share over the
period.
The minimum investment in the plan is Pounds 3,000. The initial charge on
each fund is 5.5 per cent (there is a 1 per cent discount until November 5)
and a 1.25 per cent annual charge.
The plan is also available in non-Pep form, allowing investors to put in
more than Pounds 6,000. For amounts above that level, a 2 per cent discount
applies until November 5.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: What to do if you're flooded
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ASSOCIATION of British Insurers has published some guidelines on how to
cope with floods, minimise the damage, and ensure your insurance claim can
be processed smoothly.
If a flood seems imminent, move as much as possible to upper floors
including food, clothing, drinking water, battery radio and torch.
Put sandbags in front of doors and air bricks.
Do not use gas, electricity or tap water until you are told it is safe.
Once the water has subsided, leave windows, doors and cupboards open and
lift one or two floorboards to allow air to cirulate. Pull furniture away
from walls and keep rooms heated. Check the building for new cracks.
If temporary repairs could prevent further damage, go ahead as soon as
possible, rather than waiting for the insurer to approve.
Do not throw away anything damaged irreparably for which you might need to
claim: the insurer could want to see it.
Keep all receipts for repairs, temporary accommodation and so on. These also
will help to back up a claim.
Many insurers have emergency telephone helplines. Check your policy
documents for a number.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: New issues get wider airing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE investors often are keen to invest in new issues, writes Philip
Coggan. Apart from getting in on the ground floor of a developing company,
there is the chance to make a quick profit if the shares move to a premium.
Often, though, it is difficult to find out about new issues in time. Many
companies come to the stock market via a placing, with only institutions or
the selected clients of a few brokers getting the chance to buy shares. By
the time small investors hear about it, the shares have moved to a premium
in the after-market.
Earlier this year, we reported on one scheme, the New Issue Register, which
was designed to get round this problem. Now Sharelink, the Birmingham-based
stockbroker, is launching Sharefinder, a service which will include a New
Issues Bulletin published six times a year with details of present and
future new issues. A telephone hotline and special application service will
also be available for those who want to buy shares in the issues covered.
The package costs Pounds 25 a year. For details, ring 021-236 2126.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: After the deluge, the shocks -
Inadequate insurance could cause companies to scale down damage claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUTUMN HAS once again proved to be the season not of mists but of storms,
floods and insurance claims. But a number of the people now mopping up and
inspecting the damage ruefully after this week's deluge could get an
unpleasant surprise when it comes to having their claim assessed.
If the company decides you have been under-insured - that is, you have not
been paying enough to cover all your possessions - it can scale back the
amount it pays, or pay out only on an indemnity basis rather than
new-for-old.
Most companies now offer a choice between 'sum insured' and bedroom-rated
policies. A sum insured policy means you have to calculate how much your
possessions are worth altogether, and insure for that amount. But many
people use only a rough estimate, which can be very inaccurate.
Unfortunately, working out if you are insured for the right amount is a
time-consuming business. You must go through each room, making a list of
every item and how much it is worth (whether at replacement or new-for-old
levels).
With some items, such as jewellery and antiques, it could pay you to obtain
a professional valuation, but that sort of service rarely is free. Expect to
pay 1 or 2 per cent of the value of the items, and there is usually a
minimum of Pounds 20 or Pounds 30.
With a bedroom-rated policy, the company fixes a standard maximum sum
insured for your type of home and number of bedrooms, based on its
experience of typical home contents.
An average three-bed semi-detached house would usually have a maximum of
about Pounds 30,000. Both types of policy will have a limit for single
valuable items such as jewellery or antiques.
Bedroom-rated policies have been popular recently. They save people the
bother of valuing everything they own, and the standard figure should mean
most people are not under-insured. But it is still worth making a rough
assessment of your own; you could be surprised by the figure you reach.
Insurance is intended to cover the cost of replacing everything in your home
if it should be destroyed - from carpets and furniture to bed linen and
crockery and not just the obviously valuable stereos and silver which are
most likely to be stolen.
If you calculate that replacing what you have would cost more than the fixed
limit, you should think about getting a sum-insured policy instead or, if
you have valuable antiques or artworks, a specialist high-value policy.
A bedroom-rated policy could be money wasted if you have few possessions,
because you pay the same premiums as someone owning far more. Some insurers
now offer minimalist policies with a low sum insured. These cater
particularly for people in small, inner-city flats, which can be difficult
to insure, or for elderly people in sheltered housing.
Insuring too high or too low also can be a problem with buildings cover.
Your sum insured for buildings is based on the cost of re-building the
property, not its market value.
This means that old or unusual buildings may have to be insured for more
than those of a standard type, even if their market values are the same. You
might not re-build such a property identically, but repairs to old or listed
buildings can be more expensive than normal.
The Association of British Insurers produces an annual guide to re-building
costs for property in England and Wales.
While this gives a reasonable estimate for the most common types of house,
it does not cover stone, wooden, thatched or prefabricated houses; houses
with more than two stories; or flats. You would need to get a surveyor to
estimate the re-building costs for such properties.
If you think the buildings sum insured for your house is too high or too
low, contact your insurer, who should be able to adjust it.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Elderly face costs blow for home
care - Your lifetime's savings could be in danger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEOPLE ARE living longer these days, but increasing numbers need to spend
their last few years in nursing or residential homes. Such accommodation is
expensive, and, at Pounds 400 or more a week for nursing home care, can
quickly eat up a lifetime's savings, including the capital tied up in a
house.
A letter in our Q &amp; A Briefcase column two weeks ago touched on this
subject, since when we have received many letters. The Care in the Community
Act, which came into force in the UK in April this year, requires that
anyone needing residential or nursing home care must contribute to its cost
if they are able to. If the person has more than Pounds 8,000 in savings or
capital, they are obliged to meet the full cost until the savings have been
reduced to Pounds 8,000, and then a proportion of the costs until they have
only Pounds 3,000 left. Anyone with less than Pounds 3,000 does not have to
contribute.
There has been much confusion since the act came into force over the
treatment of the value of a person's home. If the person going into care
owns his or her own home, its value will be assessed as capital. Local
authorities cannot force the sale of the house, but they can have a legal
charge put on the property, so that when it is eventually sold they can
claim some or all of the proceeds.
However, the regulations lay down that if the spouse or another relative
aged over 60 or incapacitated lives in the property, its value has to be
disregarded. Age Concern is worried that some local authorities appear to be
applying this wrongly and are including the home in the assessment whether
or not the spouse still lives there. If this happens, you should first make
a formal complaint to the council, then contact the local government
ombudsman.
Many elderly people wonder about transferring ownership of the property to
the children so that its value cannot be eroded by care fees. However, if a
local authority suspects that assets have been disposed with the intention
of avoiding charges, they can pursue both the person who disposed of the
assets and the person or people who received them, with no time limit. A
court would decide what the intention was.
Some local authorities are also automatically including the spouse's
separately owned assets and savings in the assessment for the partner
needing to go into a home. This is not allowed under the act. A 'liable
relative' provision allows for a spouse to be asked to agree to contribute.
If they do not agree, they could be taken to court for it to assess what a
reasonable contribution would be.
The partner who is not in care does not have to fill in a form when his or
her partner is assessed. Partners should also be wary of signing
declarations of liability for their spouse. Unmarried couples have no
liability for each other, but again some councils have been using forms
which refer simply to a 'partner's' savings or income.
Age Concern says that the misapplication of the rules may be partly because
some council employees carrying out assessments have not received adequate
training, and have not had access to the Department of Health's guidance.
Another area of difficulty is that for many couples, their main income is
the husband's occupational pension. If he needs to go into a nursing home,
the entire pension is assessed as his, with no allowance for the fact that
his wife also depends on it. Unfortunately, this is correct according to the
law.
However, local authorities do have discretion to increase the amount of
personal allowance deducted from a person's income before the rest is used
to pay fees. This discretion could be used to allow the husband to support
his wife at home while he is in care.
Some of our readers have expressed concern that other relatives, such as
sons and daughters, could find their own income, savings and property being
taken into account to support elderly relatives in residential care. Under
the act, relatives are not obliged to contribute towards nursing home fees,
even if they were sharing their homes with the person going into care. They
cannot be means-tested.
However, before a person can be admitted to a home under the Care in the
Community Act, the local authority has to assess their needs. If it feels
that someone is being adequately looked after where he is, it can refuse to
assess him as needing nursing home care, even if the carers feel they can no
longer cope. This may give carers no alternative but to pay nursing home
fees.
Also, the local authority is not obliged to pay in full for a person in a
home which charges more than its 'usual fee' - the amount it would normally
expect to pay for a place in a home with a standard of care appropriate for
a person with those needs.
If you choose a home which charges more than the usual fee, when a cheaper
place was available, you are obliged to find some way of making up the
shortfall. This often involves asking relatives to pay the difference. The
local authority's 'usual fee' has to be set in relation to actual fees in
its area; if you think it is unreasonably low, you can complain.
A survey of pensioners published by Eagle Star this week found that 70 per
cent had made no financial provision for care they might need in future.
Fewer than a third had any idea how much it would cost to be cared for in
their own home or in a private nursing home.
Many insurance companies now offer long term care insurance, which will
cover the cost of nursing home care once you become incapacitated, but this
is not available to the people in most imminent need. The market for such
insurance is likely to grow as more people see their parents or other
relatives experience the financial consequences of needing nursing home or
residential home care.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Rally goes on - International bond
funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS in international bond funds have had a terrific year. As the table
shows, the average bond fund returned 19.7 per cent over the 12 months to
October 1 (offer-to-bid with net income re-invested), streets ahead of even
the best building society account.
And the last year was only a continuation of a three-year rally which has
allowed international bond fund investors to earn an average return of 59.2
per cent.
Substantial falls in inflation, and in short-term interest rates, have
helped. But the performance of international bond funds has also been
boosted by sterling's decline against most major currencies.
Anyone contemplating an investment in an international bond fund should be
aware that the combination of favourable factors seen so far in the 1990s
might not continue. Inflation and interest rates could rise again; the pound
could rebound in value.
One factor which could keep attracting investors to international bond
funds, however, is that yields are only marginally below those available on
UK funds. The average for the international sector is 5.56 per cent; for the
UK, 5.85 per cent.
Investors should not assume automatically that the higher the yield, the
more attractive the fund; income could be in the process of being bought at
the expense of capital growth. The highest yielding fund in the sector on
October 1 was Guinness Flight EMU; but, in terms of total return, it ranked
just 22nd (out of 25) over the year.
Another Guinness Flight fund, Global High Income, was top of the sector over
the past year. Manager Philip Saunders says the fund, which invests in
high-yielding government debt, has benefited from its substantial holdings
of Italian and Spanish government bonds.
Charges vary between 1.5 and 3.5 per cent initially (depending on size of
investment) and are 0.75 per cent annually. The minimum investment is Pounds
1,000.
CU PPT Global Bond trust (the CU stands for Commercial Union), while eighth
over the one-year period, is top of the sector over both three and five
years, with returns of 72.7 per cent and 76.1 per cent respectively.
The charges are 6 per cent initially and 0.75 per cent annually; minimum
investment is Pounds 500.
Since, over the long term, equities tend to outperform bonds, these funds
should be considered primarily by income-seeking investors. Over the past 10
years, the average international fixed-interest fund was up 182.3 per cent;
UK equity general funds rose an average 308.4 per cent.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Star turn for the BES
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTRESS Serena Scott Thomas, known best for her recent portrayal of the
princess of Wales in Diana: Her True Story, is expected to take the role of
a drug-addicted aristocrat pursued by a baseball bat-wielding gangster in a
new film to be financed by a business expansion scheme.
Moor Street Films is seeking to raise Pounds 750,000 from private investors
to make the film, which has a total budget of Pounds 1.2m and is to be
promoted by Movie Screen Entertainment. The company hopes to generate extra
money by making an original soundtrack album, to be released through
PolyGram.
There is no guarantee or cash backing attached to the scheme; once the net
revenue is sufficient to cover investors' original subscription, revenue
will be used to make deferred payments for expenses incurred during the
production process. Once these have been met, investors will receive 35 per
cent of further net revenue.
The directors intend to wind up the company after five years and distribute
its assets. The offer closes on November 12 and the minimum investment is
Pounds 500. Those who invest at least Pounds 1,000 will be invited to a
special screening of the film and a VIP reception.
Johnson Fry is sponsoring another entrepreneurial assured tenancy BES -
Capital Prime Properties Plus II, which aims to raise Pounds 5m to invest in
residential property in central London.
Johnson Fry estimates that the gross annual yield on the property portfolio
should be more than 11 per cent. There is no arranged exit; alternative exit
routes may be selling the company as a going concern, amalgamating it with
other companies, or liquidating its assets.
Those who invest before October 29 can buy shares at 96p, while those who
get in before November 30 will pay 98p. Thereafter, purchasers must pay the
full price of 100p. The minimum investment is Pounds 3,000.
Cavendish Kerrington is a similar assured tenancy BES, sponsored by Smith &amp;
Williamson Securities, using the Kerrington Team of property managers which
has been involved in four other BES companies.
The new scheme aims to raise up to Pounds 5m to buy and refurbish small
blocks of residential properties, mainly in the north and west of London, to
be let under assured tenancies. There is no arranged exit. Subscribers
before October 29 will pay 96p per share rather than 100p. The minimum
investment is for 1,000 shares.
Nucare is a trading company BES which is trying to raise Pounds 750,000 to
establish itself as a support company to help independent pharmacies in bulk
buying, marketing and developing own-brand products. It will be on similar
lines to organisations such as NISA and Costcutter, which operate in the
independent grocery market. There is no arranged exit and the minimum
investment is Pounds 2,000.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Society to pay compensation - News
in brief
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIANCE &amp; Leicester is to pay compensation to 50 investors following a
ruling by the building societies ombudsman. All had money in obsolete Gold
Plus accounts between October 1990 and March 1991 when they could have been
earning higher returns in other accounts with the society.
The ombudsman found that the investors had no way of telling their accounts
had been closed to new investors, and interest rates up to 1.4 percentage
points higher were available on similar accounts. The society has now agreed
to pay compensation based on the difference in interest for those six
months.
The ombudsman recommends that societies should let savers know about changes
to accounts, new products and the interest rates available through a
combination of personal notification to investors, notices in branches,
advertisements in the press, individual notification by branch tellers, or
inclusion of information with account statements.
The Alliance &amp; Leicester now posts notices about account changes in
branches, and puts advertisements in newspapers, but does not notify savers
directly because of the cost.
The Nationwide society was the subject of a similar ruling last year. Most
societies have now complied with the ombudsman's minimum recommendations for
informing customers of new accounts, but few notify customers directly if
their account has been made obsolete. Building society savers should keep a
sharp eye out for notices when they visit a branch.
*****
Northern Rock building society has launched a guaranteed equity bond which
offers basic-rate taxpayers 108.75 per cent of the rise in the FT-SE 100
index, or their money back. Higher-rate taxpayers will receive 87 per cent
of the rise in the Footsie; non-taxpayers will receive 145 per cent. As is
usual with these products, investors will get no credit for the dividend
yield on Footsie. Withdrawals are allowed after three or four years, with a
lower return. Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000.
*****
The Nationwide has revamped its range of fixed-rate mortgages.  Rates range
from 5.99 per cent (apr 8.0) for two years for first-time buyers, to 8.95
per cent (apr 9.3) fixed for 10 years. Mortgages are available on an
endowment or repayment basis, and borrowers do not have to buy any insurance
products, except for first-timers borrowing more than 90 per cent who must
purchase mortgage payment cover. Maximum available loans vary from 85 to 95
per cent and booking fees are between Pounds 95-Pounds 300. Early redemption
penalties vary from three to 10 months' interest.
*****
Applicants for shares in the recently launched Fleming Chinese investment
irust will receive fewer than they had hoped because the issue was 2.7 times
oversubscribed. It raised the planned total of Pounds 60m through placements
and the public offer.
All applications in the public offer have been scaled back: investors who
wanted to buy the minimum 1,500 shares will receive 1,000, while those who
wanted between 10,000 and 25,000 will get 2,900. Applicants for more than
30,000 have been allotted between 10 per cent and 4.6 per cent of what they
wanted. Share and warrant certificates, and return cheques, will be posted
to investors on October 18. Dealing in the trust starts the following day.
The article on futures funds in the 'Speculator' series will appear next
week.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ON MONDAY Farnell Electronics, the Harrogate-based electronic components and
equipment manufacturer and distributor, is expected to report interim
pre-tax profits of about Pounds 18.5m, against Pounds 15.4m before
exceptionals in the year-ago period. The results will be the first for
Howard Poulson, Farnell's new chief executive, who arrived in August from
Volex.
SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare group, reports
third-quarter profits on Tuesday. Analysts expect pre-tax profits of about
Pounds 300m, up 12 per cent on the Pounds 267m achieved during the same
period last year. The results will be affected by the sale of consumer
products to Sara Lee and restructuring charges. Underlying pharmaceuticals
growth is expected at between 8 and 10 per cent, but analysts will be
looking carefully at the impact of reforms in Italy and Germany.
Also on Tuesday, Wolseley, the heating and plumbing distributor, is expected
to report preliminary pre-tax profits of about Pounds 110m for the year to
end July 31, up from Pounds 91.3m last year - a figure which surprised
analysts who had been expecting Pounds 70m.
Smiths Industries, the aerospace and specialist engineering group, is likely
on Wednesday to report annual profits only marginally increased from last
year's total of Pounds 102m. Once again, delays in defence procurement and
reductions in civilian aircraft programmes will be partly offset by the
strength of the group's medical products side.
Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution group, is expected on
Thursday to report a drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 52m to about Pounds
48 in the year to August. Stephen Walls replaced the group's founder, Tony
Millar, as chairman last year after a traumatic year for the former stock
market favourite. Walls will be quizzed about the state of the fresh produce
market in Europe and the US, as well as any plans for disposals or
acquisitions.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Trusts aim to tap zest for equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO NEW investment trusts are being launched as evidence continues to grow
of private investor enthusiasm for equities. Johnson Fry is producing a
second version of the utilities trust it floated earlier this year, while
Abtrust is the latest group to offer an emerging markets fund.
The Johson Fry Second Utilities trust will, like its predecessor, have a
split capital structure and will invest in companies in the fields of gas,
electricity, telecommunications and so on. It will have two classes of
share; ordinary and zeros. The zeros will earn no income but will receive a
fixed rate of capital growth; the gross redemption yield has yet to be
decided but will be around 8.25 per cent.
The ordinary shares will receive all the trust's income and the capital
growth after the zeros have been repaid. The initial gross dividend yield
will be 8 per cent, paid quarterly; and the shares will be available in
personal equity plan form. The annual charge on the Pep will be Pounds 30
(including VAT); this reduces the gross yield to 7.5 per cent on a full
Pounds 6,000 investment.
If the assets and income of the trust fail to grow over its 10-year life,
the ordinary shareholders will face a capital loss; that will reduce the
gross yield to 1.8 per cent. But if assets and income grow by 5 per cent a
year, the yield will be 10.7 per cent.
Up to 102m ordinary shares and 48m zeros are available at 100p each. The
initial expenses of the offer will be 4.2 per cent and the annual management

FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: It's simple sense to make a will -
Two-thirds of UK adults haven't made one. Bethan Hutton explains why they
should
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONDAY IS the start of Make a Will Week, a Law Society promotion now in its
third year. In spite of the publicity generated by solicitors posing in
Superman outfits as the character Will Power, the society still estimates
that at least two-thirds of adults in the UK have not made a will.
The message of the campaign is that while failing to make a will can leave
your family a legacy of legal costs, complications and disappointment,
making one is easy and inexpensive. Too many people think they still have
plenty of time, or they do not own enough to make it worthwhile, or that it
will all go to their husband or wife, anyway.
The campaign this year is being targeted particularly at unmarried couples
who live together. They have no rights in law when their partner dies unless
property, such as a house, is owned jointly or they can prove to a court
that they depended on the partner. Even then, they may be awarded only a
small part of the estate.
Make a Will Week is not necessarily a time for those who have already made
one to feel smug. How long ago was it written? If it was more than a couple
of years, your circumstances may have changed: you could have married or
re-married, bought or sold property, acquired children or grand-children, or
even received an inheritance yourself.
Wills need to be reviewed every few years, or whenever there is an important
change in your financial or personal circumstances. If amendments are
necessary, you can write an entirely new will or add a codicil to your
existing one.
In England and Wales, marriage automatically revokes all previous wills, so
see your solicitor as soon as possible after the wedding or draw up new
wills to be signed on the day. Divorce will invalidate clauses involving
your former spouse. In Scotland, neither marriage nor divorce invalidates a
will.
Deciding who should inherit the bulk of your property is usually easy. You
might also decide to make a few small cash bequests to friends or relatives,
or distribute a few pieces of jewellery or collectors' items to people you
feel will appreciate them.
Many charities offer guidance on will-writing as a way of encouraging people
to make charitable bequests - often, these are an important source of
funding. If you have no worries about leaving your dependants in need,
providing small sums to a handful of favourite charities can be a nice
gesture.
The other essential element of a will is choosing executors - the people who
carry out your wishes. You should choose several, and they can be
beneficiaries. If they are professionals, such as solicitors, you should
make provision in the will for them to be paid their normal fees. Be wary of
appointing a bank as your executor, though, as charges can be high and
service slow. Allow for alternate executors in case any should die before
you or be unable or unwilling to act.
A will is not just about who gets what after you die. It also lets you
express your intentions for your children, other dependants or pets, and
what should be done with your body.
Those with young children should name guardians who could take charge of
them if both parents should die in quick succession. Obviously, you should
seek the agreement of the person or people, as guardianship is a serious
commitment.
Some people are driven to make a will only by the thought of what might
happen to a pet if they died. You might not want to leave your entire estate
to support your labrador in its customary lifestyle, but you could want to
specify who should look after it and set aside some money for its upkeep.
But if you leave all your worldly goods to your dog, and make no provision
for your human dependants, they could go to court and make a claim on the
estate.
Executors are not obliged legally to act upon wishes that have nothing to do
with with the disposal of your property (for example, where you want to be
buried and what the gravestone should say), but usually they will honour
them unless there is an overriding reason against doing so.
Richard Bark-Jones, a probate practioner with the Liverpool firm of
Moorecroft, Dawson and Garnetts, recalls a will for which his father, also a
lawyer, was executor. The deceased had always been afraid of being buried
alive and, in his will, asked to be pierced through the heart before being
interred. Bark-Jones senior found this idea distasteful, not to say macabre,
but felt himself morally obliged to carry out the request. So, he arranged
for a surgeon to perform the task with the executors as witnesses.
Unusual or illegal conditions attached to bequests can be overruled. For
example, a statement that a child can receive a bequest only if he is
brought up in a certain religion could be ignored.
Making a will is a good occasion to think about inheritance tax and whether
there is any way you can lessen its impact. IHT of 40 per cent must be paid
on estates over Pounds 150,000; for many people in the south of England,
especially, the family house alone pushes the estate over the limit. There
are some exemptions, such as transfers between spouses, but the children can
be landed with a large tax bill when the second parent dies unless prior
action is taken.
IFA Promotion, an organisation representing independent financial advisers
(IFAs), says Britons pay Pounds 665m in unnecessary IHT every year. Some of
this could be avoided with very simple measures, such as writing insurance
policies in trust so that the money is not paid to the estate but to the
survivors. Other avoidance measures include giving money away before you
die, changing the basis of ownership of the home, or setting up
discretionary trusts.
An IFA should be able to tailor arrangements to your needs. IHT planning
should also be reviewed regularly to take account of any change in your
circumstances or the tax laws.
Insurance companies often are eager to offer advice or assistance with
wills, as a person in the mood to ponder his own mortality could easily be
persuaded to buy a life policy. These can be useful for IHT planning, but it
is best to take independent advice.
The obvious person to consult when you make a will is a solicitor. If you
have never needed to see a solicitor, or do not know one locally, ask
friends or neighbours for recommendations or consult the Citizens Advice
Bureau.
Solicitors charge around Pounds 50 for a straightforward will; if your
partner has a similar one drawn up at the same time, that will add perhaps
half as much again. Solicitors usually charge by the hour for drawing up
more complicated wills involving trusts and so on. It is perfectly
acceptable to ask a few solicitors for quotes before making your choice.
Another option is to use a will-writing service. These often are franchise
operations, and the training given to franchisees sometimes is not very
extensive. Check first on the qualifications of the person who will actually
write the will - they might not be able to cope with unusual or complex
situations - as well as the price. It might not be any less than using a
solicitor.
It is possible to buy a simple form from a stationer and write your own
will. It is, however, easy to make mistakes or oversights that are unlikely
to be discovered until too late. Even if your wishes are very simple - say,
to leave everything to your spouse - what would happen if you both died in
the same accident?
Wording can be a problem, too. If your will says that you leave all your
money to your husband, this might be interpreted as just cash or money in
bank accounts, building societies, national savings etc - not shares or
other investments. Remember also that a will must be signed in front of two
witnesses - who must not be beneficiaries.
Bark-Jones says the most common mistake in do-it-yourself wills is failing
to make a residuary bequest. People itemise their main assets and specify
who is to get the house, cash and certain treasured items, but do not say
who should get the rest. Failure to appoint executors, or guardians for
children, is also frequent with do-it-yourself wills. 'They tend to cost the
family a lot more money than it would have cost them to go to a solicitor in
the first place,' says Bark-Jones.
Finally, remember that it makes things easier for everyone if you keep the
will somewhere secure but where it can be found easily, and destroy
out-of-date wills to avoid confusion. Keeping a list of bank and building
society accounts, insurance policies and investments somewhere accessible is
also a good idea.

*****
WHO GETS WHAT
IF YOU DIE without a will, who gets your money and your property? For those
living in England and Wales, the situation is this if you are:
Single (including divorced, widowed or co-habiting) with no children
If one or both parents are alive, they inherit. If both are dead, then
brothers and sisters or their children inherit. If there are none, then
half-siblings followed by grandparents, aunts or uncles, then any other
relatives. If no close relatives can be found, efforts will be made to find
more distant ones but, if this fails, the estate goes to the state.
Unmarried partners and friends do not get anything if you die without a
will. If you die before a divorce has been finalised, your spouse still has
a claim on your estate.
Single with children
The estate goes in equal shares to your children or, if any are dead, their
children in equal shares.
Married without children
At present, the spouse will receive the first Pounds 125,000 of the net
estate, plus one half of the rest. The other half goes to the parents or
siblings, or other relatives as above.
Married with children
The spouse gets the first Pounds 75,000 and a life interest in half the
rest, which passes to the children when he or she dies. The children get the
other half.
Earlier this year, the Lord Chancellor announced that the portion of the
estate kept by the spouse would be increased to Pounds 200,000 for childless
couples, and Pounds 125,000 for couples with children. But no date has been
set for this.
Children are in the same legal position whether legitimate, illegitimate or
adopted, but step-children are not counted as yours for inheritance purposes
unless you have adopted them legally or named them in a will.
The rules for Northern Ireland are similar to those for England and Wales,
with Pounds 75,000 and Pounds 125,000 going to the spouse depending on
whether there are children. But if there are children, rather than the
spouse receiving a life interest in half the residue, all of this is divided
up equally between the surviving spouse and the children. There are other
minor differences.
The situation in Scotland is markedly different, as various elements of the
estate are categorised separately and the spouse has an entitlement to these
up to various limits. Children may inherit a greater share of the estate.

Fidelity has added an emerging markets fund to its Luxembourg-based range of
offshore funds. Emerging markets is the catch-all term for developing
countries where economic growth (and therefore stock market returns) are
expected to be higher than in the developed world. The initial asset
allocation is likely to be Asia (52 per cent), Latin America (40 per cent)
and Europe/Middle East (8 per cent). The minimum investment in the fund will
be Pounds 1,500. The initial charge will be 5.25 per cent. There is a 1 per
cent discount until November 8 and the annual management charge will be 1.5
per cent.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: High times in Hong Kong - At a
glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index has been hitting new highs for the last
fortnight, in spite of the lack of progress in talks between Britain and
China over the colony's future. There has been strong demand from foreign
investors, chiefly US mutual fund managers, who have recently increased
their weighting for Hong Kong. UK fund managers have also been enthusiastic
about Hong Kong's potential.
Price earnings ratios make the Hong Kong market seem good value to US
investors, even given the political risk. Cooling-down measures being
implemented in China do not yet appear to have had a negative impact;
general opinion seems to be that the Chinese economy will have a soft
landing.

 -At a glance

Eurotunnel confirmed this week that it would need to raise at least another
Pounds 1bn from banks and shareholders by mid-May 1994. At least half the
additional funds will come from a rights issue. The company has reduced its
initial revenue estimates because of start-up delays and price competition
from the ferry companies. On current estimates, it will not be until 1998
that the company breaks even on a cash basis.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Markets: In case of stagflation, dig out my flares - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST AS the Paris fashion shows were abandoning 1970s nostalgia this week,
the markets seemed to be rediscovering it. The coincidence of two sets of
statistics - falling manufacturing output and slightly rising inflation -
brought back memories of one of the 1970s' ugliest coinages: stagflation.
When, simultaneously, prices are rising and economic activity stagnant, the
government is hog-tied, able neither to ease monetary policy (because of
inflation fears) or to tighten it (because that could turn stagnation back
into recession).
Of course, in the 1970s the level of inflation was much higher. Still, the
markets saw enough of a worry in the figures to push the FT-SE 100 index
down, and long-term interest rates up, immediately the figures were
announced.
By the end of the day, however, nostalgia had run its course. The FT-SE 100
closed down only 13.8 points, to 3,071.2, and the yield on 15-year gilts
rose from 7.13 per cent to 7.15 per cent. Investors had decided that a
government as unpopular as this one would have no problem solving the
stagflation conundrum: easier money would win out over fears of inflation,
giving the markets the further cut in base rates they are expecting by the
end of the year.
By the end of the week, stagflation appeared even less of a threat. Thursday
brought fresh figures, this time showing a continuation of the six-month
trend of falling unemployment. Although they were accompanied by threatened
job cuts at British Aerospace and other engineering firms, the figures
seemed, on balance, to paint a picture of a hesitant recovery rather than
one than switching into reverse.
On Friday, as blue skies appeared over the City for the first time in weeks,
the stock market finally cast off its mid-week fears, although they lingered
still at the long end of the gilt market. The FT-SE 100 index closed at
3,120.8, a new peak. The FT-Actuaries All-Share index, which has been
lagging behind recently, also achieved a new closing record, 1541.91. But
the yield on 15-year gilts edged up further, closing at 7.17 per cent, up
from last week's 7.13 per cent.
There is another lesson to be drawn from the week's statistics. The chart
compares unemployment and stock market performance in this recession and the
one at the beginning of the 1980s. It illustrates the way the economy
appears to have undergone structural changes in the past decade. The
unemployment figures rose more quickly this time round but, once they had
peaked, they fell much more decisively. In the early 1980s, unemployment
levelled off; the sustained fall came much later in the cycle.
A decade ago, the stock market made a brisker move upwards once the markets
started anticipating recovery: the FT-Actuaries All-Share index nearly
doubled between 1981 and 1983. This time, the rise in equities was capped
initially by Britain's membership of the ERM; once that was over, a
sustained rally set in, taking the index up by something less than half.
The question is whether the stock market rally has fully run its course, now
that the trend in unemployment is clearly on the way down, or if there is
much further to go, as in the early 1980s.
That will, partly, be decided by the speed with which companies are able to
rebuild their profit margins now that the worst of the domestic pressures
are behind them. Here, Ian Harnett, of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull,
offers an interesting insight. He points out that part of the recent worry
about a faltering recovery stems from the slowing volume of retail sales, a
trend likely to show up again in next Wednesday's figures.
People have paid much less attention, he says, to the fact that the value of
retail sales has continued to accelerate. 'What has happened is that
retailers, after seeing rises of close to 6 per cent in turnover, have
decided that fighting for market share at the expense of their margins is
pointless.'
One industry where the tension between volume and margin has been most
pronounced was in the news this week: the drinks business. There was
disconcerting news from two of Britain's leading spirits houses: United
Distillers, owned by Guinness, and International Distillers &amp; Vintners,
owned by Grand Metropolitan.
The news from UD was that Crispin Davis, its managing director, was
departing by mutual agreement; the news from IDV was that it was losing US
distribution rights to one of the most successful brands of recent years,
Absolut premium vodka.
Behind each story lies a common theme. Because people are, by and large,
drinking less, the industry's salvation lies in making them drink better,
wooing consumers to posher brands at much fatter margins.
The policy at has been a roaring success at Guinness, contributing to the
company's role as stock market darling in the late 1980s.
Still, such a strategy is arguably harder to sustain in a recession when
consumers lose their enthusiasm for premium pricing. At UD, Crispin Davies -
who has a background in fast-moving consumer goods at Procter and Gamble -
appears to have had less faith in the strategy's inviolate nature than his
boss, Tony Greener, Guinness's chairman and chief executive. UD recently has
been cutting some prices, a policy clash that seems to have prompted Davis's
departure.
At IDV, there has been no such disagreement, merely a struggle with Seagram
over the rights to Absolut - a sign of how serious the battle for premium
brands has become. Investors certainly took the announcement seriously: the
Absolut contract is thought to be worth Pounds 30-40m a year in profits and
the group's shares dropped 4 per cent on the day, closing on Friday at 400p,
down 20p on the week before.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Markets: Life funds link-up worries investors - Serious
Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROPOSED merger of the life funds of Friends Provident and UK Provident
has caused some disquiet among Weekend FT readers, who feel that the
policyholders of the latter company are not getting a fair deal.
The deal marks the end of a long process. An operational merger between the
two companies was announced in 1986. A scheme of arrangement followed in
1988 which fully merged the businesses but kept the life funds separate.
According to Friends Provident, there are a number of reasons why the fund
merger is needed now:
No new policies have been sold by the UK Provident fund for several years,
and thus no new cash is coming in. Accordingly, when benefits are paid, the
fund has to sell investments. This has led to reduced returns because shares
may have to be sold at depressed prices and more of the fund needs to be
invested in fixed interest securities.
There is little scope for management expenses to be cut further. As the fund
shrinks, the fixed costs have a proportionately greater impact on returns.
UK Provident fundholders will benefit from the savings gained by eliminating
the need for separate accounting for each fund and from savings in
management time.
So why are some readers upset? One key reason is a clause in the circular
which says 'it would be equitable to expect the UKP fund policyholders to
make some contribution to strengthen the financial position of the single
fund arising as a result of the amalgamation in return for this benefit. It
is proposed to implement this by reducing the rate of investment return used
to calculate the asset shares (against which bonus policy will be
determined) of UKP Fund policyholders by 0.25 per cent in each future year.'
This is hardly an incentive to agree to the merger; after all, investors
expect to be paid a premium for agreeing to a takeover, not to suffer a
penalty. Friends Provident argues, however, that UKP policyholders will
benefit from enhanced investment returns in the merged fund (because of the
greater investment freedom). This factor, Friends Provident believes, will
be worth around 1 per cent a year, more than outweighing the 0.25 per cent
charge.
This does not convince some readers. One writes that 'there seem to be few,
if any, details on costs, bonuses, relative performance etc to back up the
proposal.' Another dismisses the argument about the shrinking UKP fund,
pointing out that the fund still has some Pounds 1.86bn of assets. 'It ought
to be perfectly possible to run a fund of that size economically,' he
contends.
The arguments are complex. Some might say that closed funds are better for
investors, since they are not bearing the costs (commissions etc) of
acquiring new business.
One reader was hoping to take advantage of the 'tontine effect' whereby as
the fund shrinks, the biggest returns go to the last investors left within
it. Friends Provident argues that the tontine effect only occurs if
early-exiting investors are inadequately compensated; something they intend
to avoid.
A more fundamental complaint is that policyholders will not have a vote on
the merger. Instead, an application has been made to approve the scheme in
the High Court. This, argues a reader, makes it difficult for individual
policyholders to oppose the deal, short of hiring a barrister.
Friends Provident says a vote was taken in 1988, when it was made clear that
the merger of the funds was a long term aim. A further vote would be too
costly.
The merger proposals have received the approval of an independent actuary.
Nevertheless, it is at least arguable that the owners of a Pounds 1.86bn
fund ought to have more time, and more consultation rights, about such a
fundamental change. Policyholders who object to the scheme can write to the
company secretary of Friends Provident, who will lodge all objections with
the Court. Friends Provident has a helpline on 0722-413366.
* * * How should unit trusts earn their annual management charge? The
subject this week was brought into focus by a Securities and Investments
Board consultation paper which suggested that the annual charge must be
deducted from the income account.
The paper was prompted by a Foster &amp; Braithwaite trust which planned, after
agreement with the trustees, to deduct the charge from the capital account.
Such a proposal was within the rules; but SIB saw some dangers.
With current 6 per cent base rates, investors are eager to find any source
of a high level of income. At the moment, if fund X buys bonds yielding 7
per cent and its annual charge (and other expenses) are 1 per cent, the
yield to the investor will be 6 per cent. But if fund Y deducted its annual
charge from capital, it could advertise a yield of 7 per cent. To the unwary
investor, fund Y might seem more attractive, even though he would be no
better off.
The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds wants its members to be
able to deduct the annual charge from capital, provided investors are made
fully aware of what is happening.
My own view is that such trusts should not be permitted to advertise a yield
which did not allow for the impact of the charge. Anything else would give
too much scope to mislead investors.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Markets: Urge to merge keeps dealers on their toes - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WHILE THEY might not have reached frenzy proportions yet, the Wall Street
investment bankers feeding at the takeover trough must be smacking their
lips in anticipation of more appetising deals to come. Not only is the surge
in mergers and acquisitions making Wall Street very happy but, for the first
time since the late 1980s, the M&amp;A business has energised the stock markets,
sending investors in a frantic and speculative search for the next potential
bid target.
M&amp;A activity has been picking up rapidly for more than a year, but it was
always going to take a huge deal to really get the juices flowing and spark
a wider market rally. That deal came on Wednesday when Bell Atlantic, the
regional telecommunications group, announced it had agreed terms on an
all-stock acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc., the country's largest
cable service company - a deal worth at least Dollars 20bn.
The Bell-TCI transaction is typical of the deals that have been struck this
past year in the telecommunications, broadcasting, entertainment, healthcare
and banking industries. Typical, because equity is being used to finance
much or all of the deal; and typical because the manoeuvre is motivated by a
desire to build a new company equipped to prosper in a business environment
that is being re-shaped dramatically by regulatory and technological change.
The merger mania of the 1980s was, primarily, financially-driven and about
earning short-term profits for the deal-makers. The merger mania of 1992-93
has been strategically-driven and is mostly about building long-term
prosperity.
If there is one thing that has not changed much from the 1980s, however, it
is the way stock markets have reacted to the deal-making. It might have
taken a long time to awaken them, but investors are now alert to the
possibilities opened up by the revival in M&amp;A activity. They have been
buying up stocks in a variety of sectors which they believe are ripe for
further re-structuring and consolidation, and that demand has helped propel
stock indices to new highs.
All indices, that is, except the Dow Dow Jones Industrial Average. While it
has remained strong, the Dow has failed to match the performance of other,
broader and secondary indices.
This is mainly because, in the industries which have been the focus of the
recent deal-making, the most obvious potential merger/takeover targets are
not part of the blue chip corporate community. Many are either hi-tech or
fast-growing telecommunications stocks. This means they are probably listed
on the over-the-counter Nasdaq market or they are mid-size companies like
banks and cable groups, which are usually either components of the
broad-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index or listed on the American Stock
Exchange.
So, the Dow has risen 'only' 1.3 per cent this week to around 3,630, and
still remains some 30 points short of its all-time high. Yet, the S&amp;P 500
has climbed 2 per cent to a new high of about 470; the American Stock
Exchange composite index has risen 4.2 per cent to an all-time peak of just
over 484; and the Nasdaq composite has advanced 3.1 per cent to a record
788.18.
There is more to this pattern than just merger mania, though. Secondary
indices have been outperforming the Dow because, with the economy still
struggling and the bull market looking overstretched, the stocks with the
'upside' potential attractive to investors are most likely to be found in
the equity market's undergrowth - the small or mid-sized companies that have
been overlooked in equities' long rally.
If this is the unexciting story of today's markets, the glamour can be found
with the telecoms: cable and entertainment stocks which are on the threshold
of a new information age. Stocks like Transcontinental Realty Investors,
which jumped 15 per cent on Thursday when the Bell-TCI deal was announced.
Transcontinental Realty Investors? What could a Dallas-based property
investment trust possibly have to do with a billion-dollar multi-media
communications merger? Nothing, apparently. When the news of the Bell-TCI
deal broke on Wednesday morning, many investors rushed to the 'phone to
order their brokers to buy shares with the stock symbol TCI, hoping to cash
in on the positive feedback to the day's big story.
TCI, however, is not the stock symbol for TCI, the cable company. It is
Transcontinental Realty's stock symbol (the real TCI's symbol is TCOMA).
Before anyone had noticed the mistake, trigger-happy investors bought 55,000
shares worth about Dollars 1m, lifting the company's price Dollars 2 3/8 to
Dollars 17 7/8 in the process. So much for the information age.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Markets: A tauter, leaner Body Shop - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Body Shop Bounces Back, was how the company headlined its interim
results press release. Pre-tax profits announced on Thursday had indeed
recovered from the Pounds 8.3m recorded in 1992 to Pounds 10m, for the six
months to end August, bouncing above the Pounds 9.2m made in the first half
of 1991.
Forecasts for full year pre-tax profits also suggest a bounce, from the
Pounds 21.5m in the year to end February to Pounds 25m or Pounds 26m,
probably beating the previous record of Pounds 25.2m.
But the real question is: has Body Shop bounced back sufficiently from the
string of disappointments and poor publicity which has hounded it over the
last year or two to return to its former glamour stock market rating?
In May last year Channel 4 showed a television programme questioning the
commitment of Body Shop - which makes and sells natural cosmetics and
toiletries - to not testing its products on animals. In August this year the
company and its chairman and managing director Gordon and Anita Roddick won
libel damages. A US TV company planning a programme in a similar vein has
since dropped the idea.
In September 1992 Body Shop fell foul of the stock market when it warned
that interim profits would fall because UK sales had been disappointing. The
shares, which had peaked early in 1992 at over 350p, fell 108p in a day to
158p. That was followed in January by a downbeat statement on Christmas
trading, and the shares fell 15p that day to 153p.
To outsiders the group's most obvious problem has been in the UK, where
comparable store sales were falling by as much as 10 per cent a year ago and
8 per cent over the last Christmas period. Sceptics point to the progress
rival retailers have made in selling 'me-too' products at lower prices.
Gordon Roddick dismisses the fear of competition, saying he would be more
concerned if no one was copying the Body Shop idea. He believes that its
premium-priced products are premium quality and its target market is
different. The sales trend has been reversing; by the end of the half year
period same-store sales were down 3 per cent and by this Christmas the group
expects to have at least halted the decline.
But Body Shop's more fundamental problem has been that, having grown rapidly
from small beginnings, it has perhaps lost some control of parts of its
empire and has lacked the professional management to apply the best
disciplines. Independent directors are being sought to bring the board more
into line with current corporate practice.
The good news is that the company itself is well aware of this. New
management has been brought in and is already having a dynamic effect on the
business. It recognises that Body Shop has reached maturity in terms of shop
numbers in the UK, but that does not mean it cannot improve profits.
Applying tighter retail disciplines alone should improve margins. In any
case, the UK, although the core business, contributed only 36 per cent of
interim profits.
The group has a more impressive record internationally than most other UK
retailers and it is barely reaching critical mass, let alone maturity, in
its most developed area, the US. In other places, such as Europe, Australia
and the Far East Body Shop is still in its early stages. Its aim is to
become the world's best-known retailer, a target it is some way to
achieving.
Body Shop has worked hard on its production side and now manufactures 55 to
60 per cent of its volume itself, up from 25 per cent a few years ago. A
tighter grip has been taken on finances. Gearing is down to 24 per cent, the
big capital expenditure hump has been passed, and excessive working capital
has been cut.
The company has matured in more ways than one. The rapid growth of the late
1980s is past and multiples of 30 or more will not be seen again. However,
the shares - which have risen 23p to 198p since the results were announced -
are on a prospective p/e of 22.
That is high, even against the sector, and requires profit growth of perhaps
20 per cent a year to sustain. But that is by no means impossible.

FT  16 OCT 93 / The Long View: Gold prospecting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE DAY this week a generous gentleman from the London bullion market handed
me a standard 400oz bar of gold. It was worth, he said, Pounds 95,000. As it
happens, gold is quite cheap at the moment in historical terms. As recently
as late 1987 the same bar would have been worth Pounds 155,000, adjusted for
inflation. At the time of the record high for the gold price back in early
1980, when the price hit Dollars 835 an ounce, it would have been fetched
more like Pounds 340,000, again expressed in terms of present-day purchasing
power.
What might it be worth in five years' time? I can't answer that question,
but the gold bulls are getting restless again. Thirteen years is an awfully
long time for a bear market to run. The price hit a low of Dollars 285 in
1985 and staged a very decent rally to hit just over Dollars 500 in the
panicky aftermath of the 1987 stock market crash, but it has subsequently
drifted. It has really followed the declining pattern of commodities in
general, with production rising and costs falling, while demand remains
fairly flat.
Earlier this year those two veteran speculators George Soros and Sir James
Goldsmith decided to stir things up. At their prompting all sorts of other
gold bugs reappeared from the woodwork and the price of the metal jumped
from Dollars 326 in March to Dollars 405 at the end of July.
Unfortunately the fragility of this move was soon demonstrated as the price
tumbled back again to Dollars 344 in September. This week it has showed just
a flicker of life and has been trading above Dollars 360. The chartists say
that it has bottomed out after its prolonged downtrend, though that does not
imply that a big further rise is imminent.
As the ultimate in speculative investments gold has strong and distinctive
financial characteristics. It is best known as an inflation hedge, and for
that reason its price moves in opposite directions to the stock market
(equities do not go up with inflation, at least in the short to medium
term).
Since 1980 gold has been disastrously outpaced by the stock market: while
the bullion price has been tumbling since 1980 the FT-Actuaries All-Share
Index, for example, has risen from 230 to over 1,500. In non-inflationary
currencies the picture is worse: from the Japanese point of view the price
of gold in yen has come down consistently from a 1980 high of 200,000 yen to
under 40,000 yen at present.
Whatever the temptation to find dramatic statistics, however, too many
comparisons with the freak high attained at the end of the inflationary
1970s can be misleading. In fact it is little more than 20 years since gold
was freed from its fixed rate of Dollars 35 an ounce under the postwar
Bretton Woods monetary system. The tenfold rise in the dollar price since
then leaves it well ahead of inflation over this period.
Studies over the very long term suggest that gold maintains its real value,
that is, it produces a zero real return. For investors in advanced economies
this is a turn-off because British pension funds, for instance, expect to
get a 6 per cent annual real return from equities (and in practice have
achieved about twice that figure since 1980).
Nevertheless there is a theoretical case for holding gold in a portfolio if
you want to stabilise the overall returns, because the price of the yellow
metal moves in opposite directions to those of stocks and bonds and
therefore smooths out the fluctuations.
Yet institutional investors tend to have other ways of handling volatility,
and gold can prove very hot to handle: there are still vivid memories in the
City of London of how Rothschilds, the merchant bank, bought gold for its
client pension funds in 1974.
It performed extremely well that year as the stock market crashed, but was
left spectacularly stranded when share prices rocketed up again early in
1975. The long-term investors in gold tend to be wealthy private individuals
in unstable jurisdictions who are more interested in preserving wealth than
investing it for a return.
Equities do not appeal at any price, however. After a long period of rising
share prices, even the staidest institutional investors are casting around
for better value. US pension fund managers are dubious of the value in Wall
Street's blue chips and have been pushing capital overseas, for instance
into emerging market stocks.
Gold and other commodities are also being touted at present as possible
beneficiaries of this move to diversify away from overpriced core
investments. The conditions of the 1970s bull market in gold are not
present, however.
Then, a world economy growing at 6 per cent a year collided with supply
constraints in commodities, and most Western governments tried to inflate
their way out of trouble as domestic real incomes were squeezed.
Today the advanced economies are limping along at an average growth rate of
maybe 1 per cent and although shortages will predictably develop eventually
 -notably in energy - the problem scarcely appears to be imminent or
general.
In the 1990s the gold bugs are focusing on a rather different challenge.
Economic weakness resulting primarily from excessive private sector
indebtedness is pushing governments into heavy fiscal deficits. The US
Federal Reserve, in particular, is adopting a brave but some would say
dangerous strategy of pumping liquidity into the banking system.
If the US economy is not stimulated into self-financing expansion the next
step just might be a loss of control of monetary growth and a lurch into
serious inflation. The gold price over the next few months will be best
viewed as an important indicator of underlying international investor
sentiment as the long global bull market in stocks and bonds reaches a
highly mature stage.
As for my own block of gold, in case of any possible misunderstandings I
should add that the bullion dealer had a guard in attendance and insisted
that the bar should be returned safely to the vaults whence it came.

FT  16 OCT 93 / What's so funny about jewish humour?: Jewish comedians have
hijacked America and the world. But what shapes them? Nigel Andrews goes to
the fountainhead for answers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMEDY, next to sex, is the great human imponderable. Like sex, it is
international, but everyone does it differently. And, like sex, its body
language would be incomprehensible to a being from outer space. 'What are
all these creatures doing heaving their shoulders and making loud, staccato,
whinnying noises?' the alien would say, if stumbling on a comedy audience
anywhere from Ohio to Osaka.
There is, however, one form of humour to which we earthlings all seem to
respond and which we would surely try out on a Martian if we wanted to
lighten him up or persuade him that comedy can be a common language, making
merry with common grievances. It is Jewish humour.
Mel Brooks, Woody Allen, Neil Simon, Mort Sahl, Jack Benny, Jackie Mason,
Lenny Bruce, Jerry Lewis, Billy Crystal - Jewish comedians have hijacked
American humour in the second half of this century. And since American
comedy, in turn, has hijacked the world via television and cinema, Jewish
humour could now be the most widely exposed on earth. Glance at those names
again and then give me nine French comic writers or performers you know. Or
nine Germans. Or even - staying in same-language America - nine Hispanic or
black or white non-ethnic comedians of world fame.
But if Jewish comedy has become a concept with brand recognition across the
globe - as familiar as Greek tragedy or French cooking - what shaped it? And
how much do today's Jewish comics recognise a kinship or common culture?
During years of sleuthing round Hollywood and New York - moonlighting from
official interview schedules, when given the chance, to buttonhole experts
on the topic - I have uncovered two piquant facts. One: nearly all the
Jewish humorists who rose after the war served their apprenticeship in the
same early-1950s' live television era, and nearly all of them in the same
show - the weekly comedy revue starring Sid Caesar. Two: these
writers/actors/directors speak today as if they were brought up in the same
family. Chatting about rivals' styles, or psycho-analysing each other from
afar, they assume not just a shared folk history but shared hang-ups,
foibles and phobias.
For the first great property of Jewish humour is flamboyant complaint: the
'Oi vey' tradition. It is there in Woody Allen's fervent soliloquies of
sexual or psychological failure. It is there in Simon's rueful microscope
placed on life's daily accidents and frustrations. It is even there, if you
listen, in the fevered spoof-defeatism of Brooks' account to me of how
Jewish comics first colonised east coast America.
'There are two mountain ranges in New York state' (Brooks is behind his
Hollywood desk, making big pictures with his hands and voice). 'One is the
Adirondacks, but they were too high, too hard to climb. The Jews, who were
unfit, couldn't get up them to build their big resort hotels. So, they
climbed the smaller range - the Catskills - and built their hotels there. We
comics would go there and perform, year in year out, and it became known as
the Borscht Belt. It's how we all got started.' And it was. For further
research, check Billy Crystal's brilliant Borscht Belt mock-biopic, Mr
Saturday Night.
We could, however, date the start of modern American-Jewish comedy earlier:
to a time of historical crisis even more testing than climbing the
Catskills. The Jewish comics all had their family roots in early-century
eastern Europe. Although raised on a history and set of traditions that have
nothing to do with comedy - pogroms, the Holocaust, mass emigration,
religious dogma - they ended up sharing in a perverse collective will to be
funny.
Brooks claims the instinct is in their blood. 'In the old West, when the Red
Indians attacked the cowboys, that night the cowboys would tell stories to
amuse each other, to ward off anxiety. The same is true of any situation
where there are hostile forces on the perimeter. In eastern Europe, there
were these little shtetls - villages, ghettoes - and all around there were
anti-Semites: Poles, Russians, later Nazis. The Jews would make jokes to
keep up their spirits, to ward off the lunatic fears that would come at
night.'
No surprise, then, that Jewish humour is tinged with complaint, raillery and
mock despair. Or that Allen, its greatest one-man band today, has kept
turning out dark dramas between the comedies. For him, comedy and tragedy
are 'two faces of the same thing. When something terrible happens, the comic
muse will keep it at arm's length and deflect it, whereas the tragic muse
will embrace it and work it through. But they're both about survival.
They're both about coping with the unbearable.'
This sense of laughter in the dark was audible in Jewish humour even when
Allen began as a 21-year-old gag writer - on the Sid Caesar show. Round the
table with him: fellow joke-spinners Brooks, Carl Reiner, Simon and Larry
Gelbart, all unknown, all with nothing in common save an ancestral history
of outrunning political persecutions. (Not many years before, their families
would have tuned their radios to horror news from Dachau and Auschwitz).
Caesar himself, now 70 and retired in Beverly Hills, says one feature of his
show's humour - put together in semi-chaotic 'jam sessions' during which the
Jewish wits swapped ideas over an NBC studio table - was its blithe relish
for human calamity. 'One of our popular sketches was about an old couple who
have a star in their window 'cos their son's in the service. There's a knock
on the door; a telegram. 'We regret to inform you your son has been killed .
. .'
'The woman starts to go upstairs, then she falls down, the old man tries to
pick her up, he falls down' (Caesar's voice shifts into the husky,
Brooklyn-accented comic overdrive of 40 years ago). 'The dog runs out the
door and starts barking, a car hits it, people rush in. 'What can we do?'
'Pick hoir up'. 'No, pick him up'. 'No, you hold him and I'll pick hoir up'.
'No, you put hoir under him' . . . So, from a terrible dramatic situation,
you have farce. He adds: 'I always say crying and laughing are the same
emotion. You laugh too hard, you start to cry. You cry too hard, you get
hysterical and start to laugh.'
Caesar, though, belongs to a generation that resists the phrase itself -
'Jewish comedy' - perhaps for its whiff of the cultural ghetto. 'We'd do
parodies of Thai movies or German movies in the show. We'd do a sketch in
which my wife wrecks a car. Is that Jewish? Do only Jewish women wreck
cars?"
Another Jewish-born comedy veteran who rejects the label is Walter Matthau.
'I think it's 'Mexican' humour] No: what is Jewish humour? It's like saying
'Oh, you Italians are all the same, or you French.' How are they all the
same?' And even Allen, the man who strews his movies with funny rabbis and
verbal swipes at Hitler, suddenly seems seized with embarrassment or
resentment when I ask him about 'Jewish' comedy.
It is different with younger comics. The actor and film maker Albert Brooks,
who has pushed his pixillated-paranoid heroes into comedies like Broadcast
News (anxiety-prone anchorman) and Defending Your Life (car crash victim en
route to next world), is convinced that his racial heritage - and its grim
lessons in survival - underscore his stories.
'There's something in the Jewish experience, where more than half the
population was incinerated, that goes straight into your genes,' says
Brooks. 'Humour has become a way of living through that experience and
defying it. Woody Allen and Mel Brooks, who are older than me and closer to
that time, make jokes explicitly about Hitler. But even for someone like me
who was born far from the war, you know - you know - that if, God forbid, it
happened again and you're Jewish, you'd get it. You never forget that.'
For the new generation of comics, godfathered by the extrovert shamelessness
of Mel Brooks (the man whose original title for Spaceballs was 'Jews In
Space'), to call themselves 'Jewish comedians' is a form of racial
self-authentication. They rejoice that words like schtik have entered the
common language: that scarce-translatable term for a pile-it-on,
laugh-at-all-costs style of verbal humour that Brooks sees as central to
Jewish comedy.
'Jewish people are very brave in their humour,' he says. 'There are no
taboos. Even back in the shtetls, Jews would make jokes about anything.
Typical gags would be to poke fun at people who stammered or were
hunchbacks. There was no such thing as bad taste. If something was in bad
taste, it just meant it was funnier than something in good taste.'
So, if complaint is the bass line or ostinato of Jewish humour, its high
notes and fortissimos are its acts of defiance in the face of taboo. Mel
Brooks himself has led by example: witness the Nazi production number,
'Springtime for Hitler,' in The Producers that scandalised happy audiences
back in the 1960s.
But if we know - or think we know - what Jewish humour is about, where did
it get the proselytising panache that pushed it round the world? From the
same source, undoubtedly, from which Jewish history has drawn its energy for
3000 years.
The Diaspora is the story of a race that, ever since the pharaohs, has been
going out into the world to doorstep every other race ('Let me into your
home and we can rail at life together'). Once the foot is over the
threshold, pleas for hospitality are mixed with busking demands for a
showcase for their talents. (One of those showcases became Hollywood). To
get the showcase, let alone the hospitality, that talent has to combine its
own special flavour with an ability to be all things to all men.
No other race or nation has had this experience or imperative. Most national
comedy is insular, even siege-minded: the geo-cultural equivalent of an
in-joke between friends. The British go in for jokes about class, or hug the
coast of parochial political satire, or betray their puritan heritage with
nervous gigglings about sex or bodily functions (the Carry On films). The
Germans, reared on bierkeller knockabout, seem incapable of making an
exportable stage or screen comedy.
Even the French have been guffawing for the past year at a film that, while
smashing all domestic box-office records, has found almost no interested
buyer in any other country. This is Les Visiteurs - I saw it in Paris last
month - and on its whimsical tale of two medieval warriors time-crashing a
modern town are pegged jokes about Relais-style restaurants, French shopping
habits, provincial gendarmeries, and other matters likely to induce stony
faces in a foreign audience.
The success of Jewish comedy is down to the colonising zeal of Jewish
culture. Even the rising black comics of America, Jewish comedy's closest
modern rival, have yet to close the gap between a self-absorbed militancy
that puts their racial grievances first, and a wide-appeal populism that
risks going to the other extreme, tipping them into white man's territory.
Try mentally re-casting any Eddie Murphy film with a white star and see if
there is any significant difference.
Jewish humour travels everywhere while keeping its genetic identity. In
America, its adopted land, it has done so by an inspired, almost invisible
colonising zeal. Yiddish theatres - of which New York has had its own
English-speaking variant; Matthau began there - recreated and perpetuated
shtetl life and types. And one of those types - the badkhn, or jester, who
held forth irreverently at solemn occasions from weddings to funerals - is a
direct ancestor of the Borscht Belt comedian, hired to abuse the rich and
spread comic dismay at big Jewish hotels.
At its sharp end, this American-Yiddish tradition of puncturing pomp and
enthroning iconoclastic chaos begat Bruce and Sahl: satirical gadflies with
no respect for the taboo subjects of their day (sex, death, politics,
religion).
However, at its broader end, it has produced the universal-passport Jewish
comedy we know today. That of the Mel Brookses and Allens: people who turn
'Life is terrible' into a series of banana-skin encounters between man and
his historical moment (Brooks) or man and his social or sexual auto-destruct
tendencies (Allen).
It is the comedy of satiric retaliation versus the comedy of masochism - a
poignant echo of the choice of responses that have faced the Jewish people
in this century. Is it better to fight the unfightable or capitulate to the
inevitable? Jews are not the only people to find laughter in adversity, but
Jewish history has made their comic response that much sharper, more
omnivorous - and woe betide any 'tragic' subject that thinks itself too
lofty to be caught by comedy's snapping teeth.
As Simon says: 'I can't think of a humorous situation that does not involve
some pain. I used to ask: 'What is a funny situation?' Now I ask: 'What is a
sad situation and how can I make it funny'?'

FT  16 OCT 93 / Resignation blow to engineers' plans for CBI link-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS by the Confederation of British Industry and the Engineering Employers
Federation to join forces were thrown into doubt yesterday after the
surprise announcement that Mr Neil Johnson is to quit as EEF
director-general.
In a short statement, the federation said Mr Johnson would be leaving
towards the end of the year for 'personal reasons'. However, the unexpected
departure of Mr Johnson, a driving force behind plans to create the UK's
biggest manufacturing lobby group, immediately raised questions about the
future of the initiative.
Neither organisation appeared to be prepared for Mr Johnson's abrupt
decision, although they both expressed the hope that their plans, which were
well advanced, could still progress.
The two bodies announced in April that they were trying to work together
more closely to create stronger and more effective links between industry
and government.
Yesterday the federation revealed it had been talking in detail to the CBI
about merging some of the central activities of both organisations. The EEF
said they both remained 'committed to the principle of collaborating to
strengthen the representation of manufacturing'. The CBI's ruling council
was next week due to approve plans for the link-up between the two bodies,
which next year would have combined the majority of core EEF activities with
the CBI's national manufacturing council. The issue has now been taken off
the agenda.
The two bodies had held exploratory discussions in 1991 but these fell
through. Relations cooled when the CBI set up the national manufacturing
council in early 1992, though the two bodies have since been co-operating.
The federation said yesterday that the talks would continue but, because of
the complexity of the many issues and interest involved, they may take
longer than first expected.
The proposal is now being examined by the federation's 14 regional
associations, which will have to approve the takeover. But the federation
denied that the proposal was being opposed by the associations.
The federation said Mr Johnson would 'actively continue' his position as
director-general and chief EEF spokesman until he leaves.
But his departure is a big blow to the EEF. Mr Johnson, 44, joined the
organisation in July last year from Rover Group and has spearheaded its
year-long campaign for a national industrial strategy. This week, he
strongly criticised the Treasury for being isolated from the real world of
manufacturing industry.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Clinton blockades Haiti to back UN sanctions: Troops on
standby to protect Americans on island
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday ordered a naval blockade of Haiti to
enforce renewed United Nations sanctions due to take effect on Monday and
placed on standby an 'enhanced' infantry company at the Guantanamo base in
nearby Cuba.
He also revoked the US visas and froze the US financial assets of all those
identified as preventing the agreed return of Fr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the
ousted president.
The naval task force of six warships - the first was to be on station last
night and the rest today - is under orders to intercept any commercial
shipping suspected of trying to break the oil and arms embargo. Acting in
advance of an expected UN Security Council resolution authorising 'military
power' to enforce the embargo, Mr Clinton advised merchant ships to give the
destroyers 'a very wide berth'.
Mr Clinton had hinted on Thursday he might impose a naval cordon, an action
rendered more probable by the murder later in the day of the justice
minister in the interim government in Port-au-Prince. Yesterday he conceded
it was a 'blockade' - if not in the full legal meaning of the word, in
'common sense parlance'.
Asked if the infantry force might be used to evacuate the 1,000 Americans
now in Haiti, Mr Clinton replied he wanted the troops 'in a position to deal
with any contingencies that might arise'.
'There are important American interests at stake in Haiti,' he said,
including the safety of Americans and the promotion of democracy.
The naval deployment bears some resemblance to the Cuban missile blockade of
1962 ordered by President John Kennedy. Yesterday Congressman Joseph
Kennedy, JFK's nephew and close to Fr Aristide, was among several to demand
action.
In Port-au-Prince, UN special envoy Dante Caputo said most of the UN
civilian mission to monitor human rights would leave for the Dominican
Republic last night and today. Two pro-military groups demanded that all
white foreigners immediately leave the country, independent local radio
reported.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Bock defends move to appoint non-executive directors at
Lonrho
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DIETER BOCK, joint chief executive with Mr Tiny Rowland of Lonrho, is
expected to tell a board meeting on Tuesday that the appointment of two
non-executive directors he has nominated is 'non-negotiable'.
He has told some directors of the international trading conglomerate that if
they block the appointments he is prepared to call an extraordinary general
meeting and put the issue to shareholders. Last week the board delayed the
appointments after pressure from Mr Rowland.
However, Mr Bock hopes the board will vote in favour of the proposal that Mr
Peter Harper, a Hanson director, and Mr Stephen Walls, chairman of Albert
Fisher, the food group, should become Lonrho's first non-executive directors
for two decades.
Mr Rowland has been opposed to non-executives since 1973 when the so-called
'straight eight' directors, led by Sir Basil Smallpeice, then deputy
chairman, tried unsuccessfully to remove him as chief executive at an
extraordinary general meeting. Two decades later, Mr Bock is prepared to use
the same forum to put his case direct to shareholders if he feels there is
no alternative.
The appointment of Mr Harper and Mr Walls would tip the balance on the board
irreversibly in favour of Mr Bock, who is expected to use this influence to
recruit further non-executives. In the longer term, he is expected to seek
to reduce the 12 full-time executives on the board by as much as half.
Mr Bock, who bought 18.8 per cent of Lonrho's shares at the start of the
year and then became joint chief executive, had hoped a board meeting last
week would ratify their appointment. However, the decision was postponed
after pressure from Mr Rowland.
It is understood a Lonrho director suggested the board should appoint one of
the non-executives proposed by Mr Bock and another chosen by Mr Rowland.
However, Mr Bock has rejected this after several of Lonrho's institutional
shareholders opposed the plan.
Lonrho's leading institutional investors support the appointment of Mr
Harper and Mr Walls.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Fraud squad investigates former ODA procurement agent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS, STEWART DALBY and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRAUD SQUAD detectives are investigating the suspected misappropriation of
Overseas Development Administration funds by one of the ODA's former
procurement agents, it emerged last night.
The ODA, which is a wing of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, last night
named the procurement agent as Hundhill Ltd, based in Keighley, West
Yorkshire, and said it had ordered the investigation in May.
A spokesman for West Yorkshire police fraud squad last night confirmed that
his department was investigating the company although the investigation
remained at an early stage.
Police have made a preliminary assessment of the funds involved, which they
estimate at running into 'hundreds of thousands of pounds'.
Hundhill Ltd, which ceased trading in May, is a subsidiary of the Hundhill
Group, which has offices at a separate address in Pontefract. The group is
not under police investigation.
Mr Donald Schofield, managing director of Hundhill Group, said last night he
had no knowledge of the fraud investigation.
The ODA manages Britain's aid programme to developing countries. It selects
procurement agents to supply the client in the third world with material
ranging from school text books to heavy engineering equipment which the
agents have purchased from other companies on behalf of the department. They
effectively act as the official middle-men in the overseas aid package which
runs at over Pounds 1.8bn a year.
Hundhill Ltd was one of two private companies picked by the ODA on the basis
of its supposed 'cost-effectiveness' when the government put out the
department's procurement programme to competitive tender in the late 1980s.
According to ODA officials, the company was involved in providing 'a wide
range of materials' required by developing countries from September 1987 to
May 1993. Hundhill Ltd is now in receivership according to company records.
The company describes its principal activities as 'exporters of scientific
teaching equipment and related sundries'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Dieter Bock should have known that it would be hard to persuade Lonrho's
board to accept non-executive directors. Not only has Mr Tiny Rowland long
viewed non-executives with disdain: existing directors have little interest
in accepting new members with the power to establish remuneration and audit
committees.
Mr Bock occupies the moral high ground in terms of corporate governance, but
his success in persuading Mr Rowland to dispose of The Observer does not
mean he is firmly in charge. Mr Rowland has a proven ability to muster the
support of small shareholders and, having spent Pounds 130m on his 19 per
cent stake, Mr Bock cannot afford to walk away. Unless he succeeds in
appointing non-executive directors, though, Lonrho's share price may fall
back sharply.

FT  16 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Forte
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Hugh Wontner's dismissive remark that Italians make good hotel managers
has always rankled with the Forte family. So it would be surprising if
Forte's arrangement with Ciga was purely a management deal. At one level it
is a way of expanding in Europe on the cheap, as Forte is committing only
Pounds 33m in cash to the venture. Its return, though, will be limited by
the fact that it will lease rather than own the Italian hotels in Ciga's
portfolio. Ciga's debts are ring-fenced by the arrangement, but Forte's
partner clearly does not have the cash to pay for the continual
refurbishment that hotels require. That will have to be generated out of
operations.
The deal is also at the upper end of the market, rather than the middle,
which would be Forte's more natural domain, given its roadside catering
strength. That, however, may betray the real purpose. Forte is gaining
rights to a luxury brand that will enhance its claim to eventual ownership
of the Savoy. It will now be negotiating from a position of much greater
strength.

FT  16 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Political tensions between Hong Kong and China may have been enough to
unnerve the stock market earlier this year, but they are having little
impact now. Indeed, negotiations over elections are not much further on than
when shares were only two-thirds their current value. In part that may be
because investors suspect Governor Patten may back down and because economic
conditions are still favourable. The brakes may have been applied to the
overheating Chinese economy, but only 4 per cent of the colony's pre-tax
profits come directly from there. Hong Kong, meanwhile, is still growing
strongly.
Liquidity is also powering the rally, as this week's intervention to hold
the Hong Kong dollar down to its US dollar peg suggests. Other markets in
the region are also hitting highs and the interest of US funds is well
documented. Japanese investors have also moved overseas as the perception
grows that the yen has peaked.
Almost Dollars 4bn worth of overseas assets were bought by the Japanese in
the first eight months of the year - more than in the whole of 1992 and
including some Dollars 1.9bn in August alone. Such liquidity can underpin
markets for many months. Hong Kong equities are trading at around 13 times
projected 1994 earnings - about the top of a normal trading range, but still
reasonable by international standards. On the cash-flow measure popular with
US investors, however, valuations look more stretched.

FT  16 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Milk market
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Managing a UK dairy company is developing into a fearsome intellectual
challenge as the industry prepares for the Milk Marketing Board's demise.
Fretting investors this week knocked 9 per cent off Northern Foods' shares
and 5 per cent off Unigate's. It is not easy to see how the uncertainty will
quickly be resolved.
Dairy companies are under attack on three fronts. First, they are finding it
difficult to manage the orderly decline of doorstep deliveries as
superstores rapidly lap up market share. Until now, the dairies have done
well to maximise returns by maintaining high prices. But with pints costing
as little as 22p in supermarkets and as much as 41p on the doorstep, the
differential has seemingly grown too wide. Second, they have to contend with
retailers' margin demands as they become more powerful customers. Tesco
appears to have taken the margin pain in cutting its milk prices this week.
But the dairies will bear some of the cost if other superstores join the
fray. Third, the dairies face the prospect that farmers' milk prices will
rise after the MMB is dissolved next year. This, too, could result in a
further margin squeeze.
The big dairies must hope these pressures will crush smaller operators,
enabling them to gain market share and economies of scale. The chances are
they will emerge bigger and more efficient. Nevertheless, they will be
pushed to remain as profitable.

FT  16 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Flights of fancy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Both the gilt and equity markets this week have impressed with their ability
to flourish despite depressing domestic news. Left to their own devices both
might have wilted under the impact of disappointing inflation figures and
weak industrial production data. Nor was there much to cheer about in the
limited flow of corporate news. Yet, thanks to a seemingly inexhaustible
flow of overseas buying, equities closed at another record high.
The chances are that the inflow will continue for a while longer. That only
increases the risk of suspending judgment about underlying valuations. The
run-up in telecommunications shares in the wake of the Bell/TCI merger, for
example, looks driven by sentiment. More alliances may be formed, but it
will be years before multi-media actually generates multi-earnings at the
touch of a switch.
Rightly or wrongly the markets continue to expect another UK interest-rate
cut at the time of the Budget. That should ensure ready demand for the
short-dated gilts auction announced yesterday. If inflation does turn back
up, though, there cannot be many more rate cuts in the pipeline. Once they
are over, gilts will be harder to sell. The markets would have to come back
to earth if the government felt compelled to tap the long end of the yield
curve again.

FT  16 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow fails to consolidate
morning gains
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER POSTING strong early gains on higher bond prices and good inflation
news, US stocks lost ground during the afternoon amid expirations-related
selling to end a busy session only slightly firmer, writes Patrick Harverson
in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 8.10 at 3,629.76,
below its high for the day of 3,642.30. Other indices set new record highs
for the second straight day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500
ended up 2.67 at 469.50, the Amex composite up 1.58 at 483.23, and the
Nasdaq composite up 2.02 at 787.43. Trading volume on the NYSE was 360m
shares.
Following Thursday's good news on producer prices, which rose only 0.2 per
cent in September, it was the turn yesterday of the consumer prices data to
cheer up bond and stock markets.
The labor department reported that its consumer prices index was unchanged
last month, and that 'core' consumer prices (excluding the volatile food and
energy components) rose by only 0.1 per cent.
Both sets of data pleased fixed-income investors, and lifted bond prices
sharply. The benchmark 30-year issue rose almost a full point, lowering the
yield to 5.781 per cent.
The good news on inflation, and the subsequent decline in bond yields,
lifted stock prices in turn. Some positive quarterly earnings reports from
leading companies also helped prices and sentiment. Prices slipped back in
the mid-afternoon, however, on selling related to the monthly expiration of
derivatives contracts, before recovering slightly at the end. Among
individual stocks, technology issues were in demand. Texas Instruments,
which has been moving up and down lately in line with the fluctuating
fortunes of the semiconductor stocks, jumped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 65 3/4
after the company announced a big improvement in third quarter earnings to
Dollars 146m.
Also higher in the sector were IBM, up Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 44 5/8 ,
Hewlett-Packard, up Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 70 1/8 , and Motorola, Dollars
1 5/8 firmer at Dollars 106.
Kellogg jumped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 56 after the foods group unveiled
quarterly profits of Dollars 209m, up from Dollars 199.7m a year earlier and
above analysts' forecasts.
Navistar International was the NYSE's most heavily traded stock, rising
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 23 in volume of 8m shares after the truck and
diesel engine manufacturing company issued 22m new shares of its common
stock at Dollars 21 7/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, Apple Computer climbed Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 28 1/4
in volume of 8.5m shares after the company announced a fiscal fourth quarter
profit of 2 cents a share and said Mr John Sculley, its long-time chairman,
was resigning. Mr Sculley's departure had been expected.
Canada
A WAVE of positive sentiment swept Toronto stocks to a sharply higher close
and pushed the TSE-300 index to a record level. It closed 37.62 points up at
4,182.58 in turnover of 60.7m shares valued at CDollars 765m.
Earlier it hadreached 4,183.82, breaching Thursday's intraday record high.
Toronto's key index rose 2.8 percent in four days.

<TEXT>
ACTIVE buying by life assurers and arbitrageurs bolstered trading as large
capital issues firmed along with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which rose
to its highest level in one month, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average gained 91.61 to 20,174.42 after a low of 20,097.01 in the
morning and a high of 20,338.83 during the afternoon. The average has lost 1
per cent on the week.
Volume rose to 341.4m shares against 258m. Advances led declines by 615 to
368, with 182 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
gained 8.80 to 1,654.01 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.85 to
1,285.35 .
Telecommunications issues led the rise with NTT up Y32,000 to Y906,000 and
KDD, the international telecom company, rising Y400 to Y13,100. DDI, a long
distance telecom company listed on the second section, gained Y320,000 to a
record Y6.78m.
Video game makers, which were previously sold on expectations of lower
profits, were sought by bargain hunters. Nintendo rose Y100 to Y8,120,
Konami gained Y170 to Y4,020 and Namco Y110 to Y3,060.
Retailers, which announced falls in profits earlier this week, lost ground.
Daiei fell Y40 to Y1,390 and Seiyu lost Y30 to Y1,450.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 186.72 to 22,327.91 in volume of 23.6m
shares.
Roundup
THE region maintained its record breaking ways yesterday.
Bombay remained closed for the third day as brokers maintained their strike
action in an attempt to force the government to resolve an impasse over
stocks seized by the tax authorities in connection with an investigation
into a securities scandal.
HONG KONG continued on its roll with a wall of foreign and local money, and
an absence of investors wanting to sell, propelling the market a further 4.2
per cent higher to a 10th consecutive record close.
The Hang Seng index added 351.58 to 8,763.98, after a day's peak of
8,777.14, in turnover up to HKDollars 9.09bn from HKDollars 6.45bn. The
market has risen 8.6 per cent over the week and 17.6 per cent since the
rally began on September 28.
Investors welcomed news that Britain was prepared to treat reforms for local
elections next year and for legislative polls in 1995 separately in talks
with China. This was viewed as a concession by Britain that could lead to a
breakthrough in the talks.
SINGAPORE was encouraged by funds coming into the market ahead of next
month's listing of Singapore Telecom. The Straits Times Industrial index
rose 35.00 to 2,112.95, its fifth consecutive gain, and a 4 per cent rise on
the week.
Singapore Telecom's listing on November 1 is expected to add between

SDollars 140bn.

927.46, but off an intraday record of 937.70, for a week's gain of 5 per
cent.
NEW ZEALAND turned back from a four-year intraday high, in line with a
slowing of demand for Telecom, which has been driving the market. The
NZSE-40 Capital index finished 12.33 ahead at 2,072.55, after a peak of
2,083.98, for a 2.8 per cent rise on the week.
TAIWAN edged higher on late bargain-hunting after early losses triggered by

4,025.27, 4.2 per cent higher on the week.

FT  16 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Germany defies gravity in reaching for
the sky - David Waller examines the reasons why equity prices have forged
ahead of corporate performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After several months of vertiginous ascent, the DAX index of 30 leading
shares closed yesterday comfortably above the 2,000 level, at a new closing
high of 2,015.
The natural question for investors who have been caught off guard by the
German market's rise this year is - where next? Can the factors which
sustained a sharp rally since the beginning of the year serve to take prices
to further new all-time highs?
If the market has defied gravity this year, it has also defied logic.
Time and time again shares have maintained their momentum despite the sort
of bad news and disappointments which would in other circumstances have
propelled prices sharply downwards.
Public finances are in a parlous state and the German economy is in its
worst recession since the second world war. GDP for the west of the country
is set to shrink by 2 per cent this year.
Corporate earnings are imploding. Brokers have had to scale back their 1993
earnings forecasts by at least 20 per cent over the last six months as big
companies such as Mannesmann delivered dire interim figures.
In addition, the 'dribbling' pace of the Bundesbank's interest rate cuts
would normally have proved disappointing for the investment community. In
the early part of the year brokers calculated that rate cuts would be bigger
than they were and would come more quickly than they did: but this too has
been ignored amid the all-pervasive euphoria.
The arguments used to explain the market's logic-defying performance are as
follows.
Interest rates will continue to fall: no matter how slowly this will be
positive for the German economy on a medium-term view. Combined with this,
companies are reacting to the recession by cutting costs to make themselves
more competitive than ever before.
An obvious example of industrial restructuring is Daimler-Benz's reduction
of its workforce by 60,000 in 1992-94 as part of a wholesale reorientation
of its manufacturing strategy. This pattern is being repeated across whole
swathes of German industry.
'This is the sharpest cost-cutting period in the post-war era,' Deutsche
Bank's Dusseldorf-based Institutional Investors Team commented in a recent
market note. 'This adds to unemployment ..but corporate Germany gets
healthier and more profitable if demand picks up even slightly'.
In financial terms, this means a revival in corporate earnings next year,
even if the recovery in the German economy proves to be slow and sales
stagnate. Mr Tom Holmes, head of the research arm of Schroder Munchmeyer
Hengst in Frankfurt, calculates that aggregate earnings for the German stock
market will climb by 39 per cent next year. This is the first such rise in
five years.
What matters to investors is the relationship of earnings to share prices,
not the scale of the rise in profits in isolation. The prospective
price/earnings multiple for next year is nearly 20. This is high by
historical standards: so high, according to Mr Jurgen Rothig of Barclays de
Zoete Wedd in Frankfurt 'that you have to start thinking beyond 1995 to
justify the current price earnings ratio'.
In other words, it will not be next year, nor perhaps even the year after,
before corporate performance starts to catch up with current share prices.
This has been ignored by investors, especially the non-German investors who
drive the market in German shares at the margin. According to recent figures
from the Bundesbank US investors alone have invested a net DM3bn in German
shares in the first and second quarters of the year. Dietrich Graff at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt calculates that foreigners have invested a total of
DM11bn in German equities in the first nine months of the year.
It is this 'weight-of-money' which has driven the German market to date this
year. Conscious that many foreign and domestic institutions are still
underweight in German equities, analysts believe that liquidity will
continue to flow into German shares despite fanciful valuations, helping to
underpin current prices and drive the DAX to new highs.
Mr Rothig believes that this leaves the market vulnerable to sudden,
unexpected shocks - not in the sense of political instability in eastern
Europe (the German market proved indifferent to the coup attempt in Moscow
earlier this month) but developments in the domestic political and economic
arena. Elections are looming - perhaps the German government will attempt to
prime the German economy with public expenditure projects. The impact on
inflation and hence interest rates could be dire, he says.
He is advising clients to invest in stocks where valuations are secure
should there be a reversal, for example in the big banks.
Other analysts say that the bull run in large company shares, the favourites
with foreign investors, will now give way to outperformance among
small-capitalisation stocks.
For those scared off by current valuations, Mr Graff at Commerzbank warns
that undue caution can be dangerous. 'This year we all made the mistake of
under-estimating the market's upward potential,' he says.

FT  16 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continental bourses look
towards interest rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE possibility of a further round of European interest rate cuts stimulated
activity yesterday, but opinion was divided as to whether governments and
central banks would bow to the pressure, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS took its cue from the bond market which stuck to the view that the
French government had to lower interest rates. This interpretation was not
followed by all equity analysts yesterday, some of whom believed that the
government would continue to defend the franc in the currency markets.
The CAC 40 index closed up 25.38 at 2,139.26, a week's loss of 0.8 per cent.
Turnover was FFr4.6bn.
LVMH regained some of the ground it had lost in recent days as various
rumours circulated: the shares added FFr117 to FFr3,735. Cap Gemini firmed
FFr10.60 to FFr198.90 in spite of reporting first half losses and a gloomy
earnings forecast.
BRUSSELS swept to a new record close as further speculation against the
domestic currency prompted hopes of a cut in interest rates.
The Bel-20 index put on 8.15 to 1,370.86, a week's gain of 1.7 per cent.
ZURICH rose to its sixth consecutive record close with a continuing firm
dollar and easier interest rates pushing prices higher in active trading.
The SMI index added 26.2 to 2,612.6, after an intraday high of 2,624.6, for
a 3.1 per cent rise on the week.
Nestle, the most active stock added SFr11 to SFr1,153 as Mr Ronald Morrow of
Smith Barney Shearson in New York cut his rating on the stock to neural from
outperform due to the stock price which had aggressively outperformed the
rest of the sector this year.
Sandoz rose strongly on Thursday's announcement that turnover rose 4 per
cent in the first nine months. Registered shares gained SFr100 to SFr3,400.
Among the smaller issues, Surveillance lost SFr83 to SFr1,757 as the company
said net profit in the first eight months of the year was slightly below
last year's level.
MILAN turned higher after a week of reverses as buying was sparked by the
first day of Fiat's rights issue, the largest ever on the market. The Comit
index rose 6.95 or 1.6 per cent to 577.59, but was still 2.2 per cent lower
on the week.
Buyers were out in force for Fiat shares and rights, the shares rising L177
to L3,828 in heavy volume of 11.6m. Rinascente added L239 to L9,689.
Mediobanca shed L215 to L15,400 amid media reports that the merchant bank
might freeze plans to raise new capital because Credito Italiano and BCI,
two of its large shareholders, were doubtful about underwriting the call.
Montedison fell L10 to L800 after a day's low of L760 following Thursday's
announcement of a rights issue. Trading in Ferruzzi was halted when the
shares were bid at less than half Thursday's closing price, after the
regrouping of 200 old shares for one new.
AMSTERDAM was driven higher partly by options trading and strong foreign
interest. The CBS Tendency index added 1.4 to 130.8, a week's gain of 2.2
per cent.
Unilever maintained its rally which began earlier this week, the stock
rising Fl 4.00 to FL 211.90. Commentators noted that buyers coming into the
market were looking for laggards and Unilever has been a notable
underperformer.
STOCKHOLM advanced to a record close on renewed demand for Ericsson stock.
The Affarsvarlden general index added 13.10 to 1,381.90, up 2.6 per cent
over the week, as Ericsson B's rose SKr8 to SKr470.
ISTANBUL recovered some of Thursday's losses and the composite index added
139.3 to 15,194.1. Since last week the index has slipped 1.6 per cent.
Turnover was TL1,100bn.
Carnegie International's Turkish analysts in London noted that with daily
volumes some 50 per cent off September peaks the impression is that the
market will not be lured back to higher ground until it has seen whether the
privatisation programme will actually start to produce results.

FT  16 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Telecom stocks in demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG US buying for telecom issues in the wake of this week's announcement
of a Dollars 22bn merger between Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications Inc
proved the spur for the strong advance of the market as a whole.
The demand for telecom stocks, first seen on Thursday, came early in the
session, though a host of other features also played their part in the day's
rise. BT was one of several stocks to gain from the rally and sentiment was
further enhanced by reports of recommendations from Strauss Turnbull and
UBS.
The shares moved 9 1/2 ahead to 456 1/2 p, as turnover soared to a hefty
14m. It was also the day's most active stock in the traded options where the
equivalent of an additional 4.4m shares was also dealt.
It was the strong overnight performance of the Hong Kong market that was the
additional bonus for Cable &amp; Wireless. C&amp;W has a 57.5 per cent stake in Hong
Kong Telecom, a substantial contributor to C&amp;W's earnings.
The shares raced forward and at the day's best were up 42 at 995p, before a
bout of profit-taking saw them relinquish some of the early gains to finish
a 17 up at 967p, after trade of 7.9m.
Other strong performances in the sector came from Securicor 'A' which put on
3 to 790p, and Vodafone Group, 8 better at 559p.
After a recent good run, favoured by investors looking for positions in
defensive stocks, the water sector is now braced for a period of
uncertainty.
None of the stocks, which provide a refuge in a shaky market with high
yields, was able to run with yesterday's momentum that swept through most
other sectors. Most of the shares gave up a few pence.
According to one analyst the sector has been overbought and is poised for a
balancing. 'It is nervous at these levels and the market has begun to
realise that.'
Also hanging over water stocks is the impending announcement of the
methodology which Ofwat intends to use in its pricing decisions. Caution is
likely to trouble the stocks ahead of the news expected early next month.
Welsh fell back 8 to 654p; Northumberland lost 4 to 675p; North West gave up
3 to 556p and South West went down 3 to 579p.
The buoyant Hong Kong market boosted several stocks in the banks sector.
These included HSBC, 10 better at 756p, Standard Chartered which also put on
10 to finish at 1024p. Lloyds, which has a stake in Standard, gained 14 to
577p.
However it was a recommendation from Morgan Stanley that was said to have
responsible for the advance in Abbey National where the shares put on 8 to
425p.
Lasmo, which suffered slightly in the previous session after a debt
downgrading by Moody's, managed a convincing fightback. Market talk had it
that the shares' rally was down to interest over a proposed asset sale by
the company.
European buyers are thought to be offering bids in excess of the Pounds 100m
expected for Lasmo's stake in the Markham North Sea gas field. The shares
gained 5 to 141p in strong turnover of 7.1m.
Strong activity was seen in British Gas shares ahead of it going ex-dividend
on Monday with the stock being pursued by basket traders and income funds.
In healthy turnover of 12m the price moved up 7 1/2 to 336p.
One analyst also saw a little psychological fillip for energy shares in the
first taste of a winter cold snap. BP traded in sound volume of 10m with
shares firming a penny to 326 1/2 p.
A boost for Burmah came with the change in stance by Hoare Govett. The
broker turned from a hold position to a buy.
Enterprise continued to benefit from positive sentiment and pushed up 8 to
487p. The strong market trend boosted Shell Transport helping the shares
rise 8 1/2 to 689p.
A placing of 5m Storehouse shares by Panmure Gordon, the London broking
house, was behind the well-above average activity in the stock. The placing
at 200p helped boost volume to 10m and the shares gained 4 to close at 203p.
Shares in Northern Foods trailed the market, falling 5 to 242p, on the
possibility that it may reduce its milk prices following Tesco's move to
slash the price. Analysts said, however, that the move only affected Tesco
whose shares hardened a penny to 203p.
Sentiment in the US for brand name food companies spilled into the UK market
benefiting several stocks. These included Cadbury Schweppes. where the
shares gained 8 to 472p, Unilever, which jumped 21 to 1115p, and United
Biscuits, 2 better at 367p. Brewing group Allied-Lyons was boosted by the
same sentiment and the shares advanced 14 to 583p.
A line of stock overhanging Allied Colloids was said to be largely
responsible for the stock's slip of 4 1/2 to 236p. ICI kept in step with the
market adding 10 to 729p albeit in low volume.
The prospect of cuts in UK defence spending cast a cloud over several stocks
in the field causing them to buck the market trend. GEC lost 9 to 344p, on
speculation that a new missile programme could be in danger. Shipbuilder
VSEL was also out of favour on the prospect of cuts in naval spending. The
shares eased 4 to 845p.
Automotive and aerospace components group Lucas Industries were in demand,
with those who favour the stock continuing to believe an announcement of a
the group's new chief executive is about to be made. The shares gained 8 to
175p as 5.5m were traded.

FT  16 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: New Footsie highs as buyers return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENEWED strength in equities across Europe, sparked by US buying of
telecommunications stocks in the Far East, drove the London equity market to
new peaks yesterday, pushing doubts over the domestic economy into the
background. The equity trading account closed on a strongly optimistic note
as confidence that interest rates are on the way down throughout Europe was
encouraged by new equity peaks in Germany and falling bond yields in London
and New York.
At the day's best, the FT-SE Index was 40.4 points ahead at a new trading
peak of 3,126.7, fuelled by heavy arbitraging from the stock index futures
sector where the December contract also touched a new peak of 3,163.
The final reading saw the FT-SE Index at a new closing high of 3,120.8, for
a net gain of 34.5. London received further US support towards the close.
The FT-A All-Share Index also set a new peak.
After initial uncertainty over official statistics on UK economic activity,
the Footsie closed the week 12.2 points ahead, but gained 2.7 per cent over
the equity account.
Activity focused on the market's top 100 stocks, although the FT-SE Mid 250
Index closed 15.4 up at 3,479.8.
While UK strategists remained convinced that the November Budget will be
accompanied by a cut in domestic interest rates - one leading analyst told a
radio audience that the chancellor of the exchequer should cut rates by 2
points - the market's focal point shifted from home to overseas.
Shares opened strongly, with the weight of US demand for telecommunications
stocks, on the back of this week's Dollars 22bn bid from Bell Atlantic for
Tele-Communications Inc, taking London marketmakers by surprise.
The running was quickly taken up by investment funds from continental Europe
and then by renewed interest from the US after the Federal bond market
responded strongly to the latest US inflation data.
With the benchmark long-dated federal bond offering a record low yield of
5.79 per cent, UK bonds were also in excellent form. Firmness in short-dated
British government bonds underlined optimism towards base rates, while the
long dates advanced by around half a point. Bonds brushed off news that the
next gilts auction, on October 27, will consist of stocks in the 1997-2001
range.

FT  16 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE SUDDEN turn towards optimism in UK equities, backed up by renewed demand
from US funds, brought sharply increased turnover in London derivatives
markets yesterday, writes Terry Byland. In stock index futures, the December
contract on the FT-SE Index raced to a new trading high of 3,163 at
mid-session when it stood at a 40 point premium to cash. Volume jumped to
14,230 contracts, nearly 50 per cent above recent averages.
The premium remained at 30 points at the close, and the session was featured
by heavy arbitrage activity between futures and cash. Fair value, the
premium allowing for dividend and carrying costs, stood at around 22 points
yesterday but falls to around 18 on Monday when the new equity market
account opens.
Confidence on other European bourses that interest rates are moving lower,
saw European and US funds active.
Volume in traded options also soared, and 52,462 contracts were recorded,
with the FT-SE contract more than doubling to 28,106.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Rate cut pressure grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN short-term interest rate futures continued to push upwards
yesterday, signalling the belief that interest rates are due to slide,
writes Peter John.
December short sterling and D-Mark contracts traded on Liffe were both
strong and the French contract traded on the Matif in Paris rose 10 basis
points in early trade.
The contracts go up on expectation of lower rates. They reflect the market's
view of where three-month lending rates are moving ahead of the contract
maturity dates in December.
Short sterling has been firm all week and appears to have broken through a
narrow trading range as belief solidifies that the UK government must cut
base rates by at least half a point if the economy is to continue its
recovery. The short sterling futures contract for December moved through
94.50 to close 12 basis points up at 94.57.
There is also a growing body of opinion that some European countries,
especially France and Belgium, will be forced to abandon attempts to link
their currencies with the D-Mark by cutting rates and letting them find
their own level.
The French financial futures contract rose 14 basis points to 93.56 while
the much more thinly traded Belgian contract added to a big rise on Thursday
with a further 26-basis point rise to 91.51. That level indicated
three-month money would be around 8.5 per cent in December. The Belgian
three-month rate was at 10 per cent yesterday. The German D-Mark contract
rose 4 basis points to 93.84.
Bank of England operations were relatively comfortable yesterday. The Bank
offered the money market an early round of assistance after forecasting a
liquidity shortage of around Pounds 1.5bn which was later revised down to
Pounds 1.3bn.
Among the main factors affecting the market were the take-up of Treasury
Bills and paper maturing in official hands which drained Pounds 504m from
the system, Exchequer transactions which removed Pounds 445m and a rise in
note circulation which took up another Pounds 675m.
Partly offsetting these developments were bankers' balances above target
which injected Pounds 145m into the system.
The central bank bought Pounds 1.004bn of bills at the early round of
assistance followed by a further Pounds 81m and late assistance of Pounds
110m.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Francs under renewed attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE French and Belgian currencies fell sharply on the foreign exchanges
yesterday as dealers became increasingly convinced that the two countries'
strong franc policies were dead, writes Peter John.
Attempts by the French authorities to convince investors that the French
franc would be held firmly in line with the D-Mark were beginning to look
stale as dealers remembered propaganda campaigns that have preceded previous
attacks on the currency.
Mr Jean Claude Trichet, the governor of the Bank of France, stressed the
importance of monetary convergence in a speech at a financial conference
yesterday.
But cracks were beginning to show towards the end of the week, particularly
after Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, said a weaker franc
had helped the economy over the past year. This was followed by reports that
Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, said he was not unduly
worried about the currency.
Many dealers believe the French authorities must cut key short-term lending
rates to avoid seeing the economy spiral into a vicious circle of high
interest rates and high unemployment at the same time as having a weak
currency.
Yesterday the franc hit a new low of FFr3.5480 against the D-Mark. It
recovered to FFr3.5410, down more than a centime on the day on the previous
close of FFr3.53. Dealers expected sellers to return when financial markets
reopen on Monday.
The Belgian franc also hit new lows in spite of continuing intervention from
the Belgian National Bank. It replaced the Danish krone at the bottom of the
European Monetary System ladder. Belgian short-term rates of 10 per cent are
considered unsustainable against headline inflation of only 2.8 per cent and
many investors are sceptical about the short-term benefits of the social
pact on wages and jobs, details of which are expected next week.
The Belgian stock market, on the other hand, hit a new high buoyed by US
investors switching from peak-level US stock and bond markets.
Early strength for the US dollar was undermined as the most recent economic
data failed to give much heart. The August US trade deficit of Dollars
9.71bn was lower than expected but reports covering production, inventories
and consumer sentiment failed to inspire. The dollar closed steady against
the D-Mark at DM1.6145 and against the pound at Dollars 1.5125.
Sterling was sidelined after disappointment over recent industrial
production figures and ended flat against the D-Mark at DM2.4425.

FT  16 OCT 93 / International Company News: Foreign banks reject Ferruzzi
proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOLUTION of the Ferruzzi-Montedison group's problems has been seriously
delayed by the refusal of foreign bank creditors to accept a restructuring
plan.
The foreign banks' position contrasts starkly with the 21 large Italian
banks, which account for 70 per cent of the group's total L25,000bn (Dollars
16bn) bank debt, and which have already endorsed the restructuring plan.
The plan centres on four elements - a debt moratorium for 1993 costing the
banks L1,800bn, subsequent consolidation of the debt costing L1,600bn,
capital increases totalling L5,400bn and asset sales of L5,500bn.
'We are prepared to co-operate but the present proposals are unacceptable,'
said a representative of one of the 110 foreign bank creditors. 'We are
setting up a working group to make our own proposals, and we want an
independent accountant's assessment.'
Foreign bankers suggested yesterday this process could take them well into
November. The next deadlines are November 30 and December 1 respectively for
the special meetings to approve Ferfin and Montedison capital increases.
The foreign banks' letter makes 11 points of primary concern on the
restructuring plan drawn up by Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank. The
first and fundamental point is that 'an international restructuring should
satisfy the interests of creditors first, and shareholders only thereafter'.
Another important bone of contention is the need for independent assessment
of financial information provided by accountants Deloitte &amp; Touche, plus
adequate information about their current investigations.
This is a reference to the possibility of holes still being found in
operations of subsidiaries, which are lso being investigated by Ravenna and
Milan magistrates.
'The creditors also require direct access to the group's auditors.'
The letter also makes clear the demand for 'substantially' more assets to be
sold 'in view of the inability of the group to meet its financial
obligations'. The banks want far more guarantees of 'arm's-length' sales.
On the question of a debt moratorium for 1993, the banks say the proposal
'violates creditors' rights, is inconsistent with acceptable restructuring
principles and is completely unfeasible'.
It appears that for the first half accounts, the Ferruzzi-Montedison
administrators have written in the effects of only one month's debt service
being withheld from the major Italian banks.

FT  16 OCT 93 / International Company News: Lafarge Coppee to expand US
interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN and FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LAFARGE Coppee, the French company which is the world's largest building
materials concern, is expanding its North American interests by buying a 10
per cent stake in National Gypsum, one of the largest plasterboard
manufacturers in the US. National Gypsum emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection earlier this year.
The French group, which recently staged a FFr2.5bn (Dollars 439m) capital
increase on the Paris stock market, described the deal as an opportunity to
diversify into the US plasterboard market.
Under the terms of the transaction, Lafarge agreed to buy nearly 4m shares
in National Gypsum, or about 20 per cent of the total, and to transfer half
of them to Golden Eagle Industries, a privately held investment company
controlled by Mr CD Spangler of Charlotte, North Carolina.
Lafarge said it paid FFr200m for its 10 per cent stake.
Golden Eagle declined to comment on the terms. It said the Spangler family
was 'pleased' National had relocated its headquarters from Dallas to
Charlotte in July, a move which coincided with the company's emergence from
nearly three years of protection under Chapter 11.
On the Nasdaq over-the-counter market in New York yesterday, shares in
National Gypsum traded at Dollars 26 3/4 , down Dollars 1.
For Lafarge, the deal re-establishes a relationship which began 30 years
ago, when the US group helped it with the technology to begin plasterboard
making in Europe.
In 1986 the French group invested Dollars 33m in a Dollars 1.5bn leveraged
buy-out of National Gypsum, and a further Dollars 47.5m in 1988 to take its
stake to 50.1 per cent.
However, Lafarge kept its relationship with National Gypsum at arm's length
because of the US group's heavy debt burden. It stake was held by a US
trustee to limit its exposure. Under terms of National's reorganisation,
Lafarge was left uncompensated for its investment.
The French group said it had 'no plans in the short term' to raise its
holding above 10 per cent, but that it would keep 'an open mind'.
Lafarge, a leading player in the US cement and concrete markets, has a
strong presence in plasterboard in Europe.

<TEXT>
VOLVO last night blocked an attempt by Sweden's shareholders association to
thwart the proposed merger of its car and truck operations with France's
Renault. It rejected demands for a change in the group's articles of
association.
Aktiespararna, representing thousands of small shareholders, wants a vote on
the issue at the November 9 shareholders meeting called to approve the
Renault agreement.
A change in Volvo's articles requires a two-thirds majority, while the
merger only needs a simple majority to go through.
Volvo said its board had ruled the merger was in line with the existing
articles and it would not propose any change.

FT  16 OCT 93 / International Company News: Alcazar agreement hinges on US
partner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOUR European airlines aiming to combine forces in the Alcazar project
have resolved in principle all key issues, except the selection of a US
partner, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) said yesterday. However,
resolving the US partner question is vital to a successful outcome of the
Alcazar negotiations which SAS, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair and
Austrian Airlines are hoping to complete by the end of this month.
'This has to be resolved in order to fit the whole puzzle together,' said Mr
Peter Forssman, head of corporate relations at SAS.
He said the three issues of the location of the Alcazar headquarters and
other major functions, the line-up of senior executives in the new
management company and how to value the four airlines' respective shares in
the alliance were in principle solved.
But negotiations this week had not resolved which US partner Alcazar would
choose from Delta, which has links with Swissair, Northwest, tied to KLM, or
SAS's partner Continental.
It is clear the issue is more complex than an argument over which US airline
would offer the best commercial partnership. The choice will form part of a
delicate division of spoils in Alcazar between the four airlines which each
have sensitive political constituencies to satisfy.
For example, the open-skies agreement between the US and the Netherlands,
and Dutch membership of the EC are strong arguments in favour of choosing
Northwest and siting the Alcazar headquarters in Amsterdam. But this would
most likely be unacceptable to the other partners.

FT  16 OCT 93 / International Company News: BNP issue rationed after strong
public demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIVATISATION of Banque Nationale de Paris was yesterday hailed as a
'remarkable success,' by Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister.
He confirmed that some 2.8m private investors had applied for shares and the
public part of the issue was five times subscribed.
The strong public response has prompted the government to reduce the
allocation of shares to institutional investors and to ration the number
given to individuals from 40 to 15 each.
The institutional part of the BNP issue was so heavily over-subscribed that
it was closed after only two days.
One of the main reasons for the popularity of the BNP issue was the share
price which, at FFr240, was far lower than the Paris market had expected.
BNP's new shares yesterday traded in the grey, or unofficial market, at
FFr277 (Dollars 48). Analysts expect them to rise to at least that level
when official trading starts on Monday.
Mr Alphandery will early next week disclose the name of the next company to
be privatised. An economy ministry official said a final decision had not
yet been taken, but that the second candidate would be 'either Elf Aquitaine
or Rhone-Poulenc'.
Rhone-Poulenc, the flagship French chemicals company, was initially intended
to be the second privatisation but has since come under pressure in the
intensely competitive European chemicals market.
Analysts suspect that Elf, one of Europe's largest oil and gas groups, will
be the next contender for sale.
Mr Alphandery yesterday described the strong response to the BNP issue as
'testimony to the French public's enthusiasm for privatisations'.
The government had originally allocated 37.5m shares at FFr240 each, or 52
per cent of the issue, to the public and expected to attract 1m investors.
Instead, it received applications worth FFr46.4bn for 193.5m shares.
It has increased the allocation of shares to the public to 46.9m by reducing
the number given to institutional investors.
The institutions will be left with 27.7m shares (35 per cent of which are
earmarked for French investors).
The allocation of shares to BNP's noyaux durs, or 'hard core' investors,
which include both Elf and Rhone-Poulenc, has also been reduced from the
original 15 per cent to 10 per cent.

sharp recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY'S Norske Skog, one of Scandinavia's biggest pulp and paper producers,
returned to the black in the first eight months of this year.
It made pre-tax profits of NKr9m (Dollars 1.27m), against a pre-tax loss of
NKr304m last year. Net losses in the eight-month period fell sharply to
NKr20m from NKr253m in last year's comparative period.
The improvement reflected better results in the business paper sector and
from affiliated companies, reduced costs and positive net financial items.
Last year there was a NKr76m restructuring charge.
The group forecast an improvement for the full year, pointing to a
cost-cutting programme, lower interest rates and realised profits on the
bond portfolio. It recorded a pre-tax loss of NKr659m in 1992.
Group sales in the eight-month period fell by NKr386m to NKr4.893bn.
Norske Skog said prices for pulp were at an all-time low due to
over-capacity in global markets while devaluations of the Swedish and
Finnish currencies had made it difficult to push up prices.
Gross operating profit dipped by NKr7m to NKr494m. Losses at associated
companies narrowed to NKr91m from NKr135m.

FT  16 OCT 93 / International Company News: Sculley quits as Apple chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Sculley has resigned as chairman of Apple Computer, ending months of
speculation about his departure since he gave up his post as chief executive
in June. One of the best known executives in the computer industry, Mr
Sculley has been with Apple for 10 years.
'Mr Sculley proffered his resignation at a board meeting that took place on
Wednesday and Thursday,' an Apple official said. 'The board accepted.' He
declined to elaborate.
Mr Sculley's resignation coincided with Apple's year-end financial results.
The company reported a 97 per cent drop in earnings for its fourth fiscal
quarter despite record sales of Dollars 2.1bn, blaming the earnings decline
on severe price competition.
In July, Apple reported its worst ever quarterly losses, of Dollars 188m,
including an after-tax restructuring charge of Dollars 199m. The company has
since laid off about 2,500 employees.
Mr Sculley has been succeeded as chairman of the board by Mr Mike Markkula,
one of Apple's original investors and its first chairman, from 1977 to 1981.
Since then Mr Markkula has been a non-executive vice-chairman. Mr Joseph A.
Graziano, Apple's chief financial officer, also joined the board.
Rumours that Mr Sculley would soon leave Apple had been circulating
throughout the computer industry for several months, as the company's
performance deteriorated and his pet project the 'Newton' personal digital
assistant appeared to be in trouble.
He has been widely criticised for paying too little attention to Apple's
core PC business, while focusing on the nascent market for hand-held
computer devices. Since the launch of the Newton 'MessagePad' in August,
Apple claims to have shipped 50,000 units. However, the product has received
damning reviews.
In June, Mr Sculley announced he was stepping aside as chief executive,
stressing that the move was at his own initiative. A very different account
of events has, however, emerged in a wrongful dismissal lawsuit filed
against Apple by Mr Al Eisenstat, former executive vice-president and one of
Mr Sculley's closest associates at Apple.
In his suit, Mr Eisenstat describes a board-room coup, in which Mr Sculley
was, he claims, ousted. Apple says the suit is without merit and has
disputed Mr Eisenstat's recollections as 'false'.
Mr Sculley, who has been on sabbatical for most of the summer, has declined
to comment. Neither did he announce his future plans.
Mr Sculley has been mentioned as a potential candidate for top jobs at
several US companies, including Eastman Kodak, which is searching for a new
chairman and chief executive. In June, however, Mr Sculley expressed
interest in starting his own high-tech company. 'That is a dream that I have
for the future,' he said in an interview.

KVAERNER, the diversified Norwegian group with main interests in
engineering, shipping and shipbuilding, yesterday reported a 3.7 per cent
increase in eight-month pre-tax profits to NKr720m (Dollars 101m).
It said profits for 1993 would match the level of profits in recent years.
In 1992 the group posted a pre-tax profit of NKr932m and net profit of
NKr729m.
The eight-month result was helped by a 32.8 per cent increase in revenue to
NKr15.9bn. Kvaerner said revenue included a NKr34m gain on ship sales but
that the rise mainly reflected the acquisition last October of the Warnow
shipyard in Germany.
Operating profits were 29.5 per cent higher at NKr725m, but at the net level
profits were slightly lower at NKr520m, against NKr532. Kvaerner was
restricted by operating losses within the shipping division and by an
unrealised exchange rate loss of NKr180m charged against accounts, related
mainly to ship financing.
Realised foreign currency gains dipped in the eight months to NKr129m from
NKr138m. Group new orders totalled NKr18.4bn at the end of August,
representing a 56 per cent increase over the comparative period.
Among the group divisions, shipbuilding saw operating profit rise by NKr103m
to NKr597m on sales up by NKr924m to NKr5.06bn. Oil and gas boosted
operating profit by NKr124m to NKr266m as sales rose by NKr1.5bn to
NKr4.9bn.
Mechanical engineering operating losses were cut NKr40m to NKr122m. Shipping
made an operating loss of NKr164m against a profit of NKr45m.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Metals take turns in the
spotlight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIN AND nickel shared centre-stage at the London Metal Exchange yesterday,
at the end of a week that saw the exchange's base metals contracts taking
turns in the spotlight.
Three month delivery tin began with a Dollars 120-a-tonne retracement
following last week's rally but that had been fully recovered before the
market moved ahead strongly yesterday. Dealers attributed the Dollars 70
rise to Dollars 4,812.50 a tonne to news that an output cut was being
considered at Pitinga, Brazil's biggest tin mine, suggestions that the
Association of Tin Producing Countries might keep its export control system
going for another year and a report that the US was considering a Bolivian
request for a halt to stockpile sales by its Defence Logistics Agency.
'It's a bit optimistic to hope for all this to happen, but you never know,'
one trader told the Reuter news agency.
The nickel market also started with the surrender of some of last week's
gains, the three months position slipping more than Dollars 200 to Dollars
4,350 a tonne at one stage. As with tin, however, a subsequent recovery set
the stage for a sharp advance yesterday.
Encouraged by a slackening in the pace of arrivals from the former Soviet
Union and a moderate fall in LME warehouse stocks, three months nickel
closed at Dollars 4,775 a tonne, up Dollars 212.50 on the week and Dollars
745 above the 6 3/4 -year low reached a fortnight ago.
The earlier fall had reflected growing doubts that other producers would
follow up on the production cutting plans announced by Inco, the biggest
nickel producer, at the end of last week. The Canadian company this week
gave more details of the means by which it intended to reduce its output by
16 per cent next year. These included closure of the Ontario division for
eight weeks from December and shutting the Manitoba operation for four weeks
from December 17, after which operations would resume on a four-day work
week.
The moves follow a heavy fall in nickel prices from over Dollars 6,000 a
tonne a year ago, which resulted in Inco losing USDollars 2.2m in the second
quarter of this year.
Early scenes in this week's LME action were stolen by sister metals lead and
zinc.
After edging higher on Monday as operators covered short positions, the
three months lead price exploded into prominence on Tuesday with a gain of
Dollars 24.75, or 6.3 per cent, to Dollars 413.50 a tonne. Dealers
attributed the rise to a revival in consumer interest, trade buying and
covering against earlier short sales. The price peaked next day at Dollars
418 after it was confirmed that the 72,000-tonnes-a-year Belledune smelter
of Canada's Brunswick Mining and Smelting, a Noranda subsidiary, was to be
closed for six weeks because of a shortage of concentrate feed.
The gain was trimmed back, however, and the price ended with a net rise on
the week of Dollars 20.25 at Dollars 405.25 a tonne. But that was still more
than Dollars 35 up from last week's seven-year low.
Zinc's big scene came on Wednesday, when rumours that announcements of
European production cuts were imminent helped to push the three months
quotation up by Dollars 38.75 to Dollars 968.50 a tonne. Dealers said the
rise was also fuelled by investment fund covering against what were believed
to be large short positions.
With the production cut rumours remaining unconfirmed, however, the three
months price subsided to Dollars 957.50 at yesterday's close, up Dollars 53
on the week.
The aluminium market traded comparatively quietly until producer support
buying and trade short-covering got prices rising in earnest on Thursday.
The upturn was fed yesterday by reports of reduced smelter output in the
ex-Soviet republic of Tajikistan, the near-trebling of energy costs at the
Bratsk smelter in Siberia after Russian tariffs were raised to western
levels from the beginning of this month, and plans for US officials to join
talks in Moscow on the problem of huge Russian exports disrupting the
market.
By the LME close the three months price had risen another Dollars 14.50 to
Dollars 1,142.75 a tonne, up Dollars 27 on the week.
At the London bullion market the gold price re-established itself above
Dollars 360 a troy ounce as investors formed a consensus that the recent
downward 'correction' was over. The market remained nervous, however, and
the price eased from Thursday's peak of Dollars 368.25 to close yesterday at
Dollars 364.75 an ounce, up Dollars 7.50 on the week.
The platinum price followed the same pattern, but its late fall was much
sharper than gold's, with the result that its premium over the yellow metal
shrank by another Dollars 2.50 to Dollars 2 an ounce - three week's ago it
stood at Dollars 8.25.
The London Commodity Exchange's cocoa and cocoa markets both staged
tentative rallies but finished well off the highs.
Dealers could offer no explanation for the upturn in the cocoa market, which
took the March futures position to Pounds 962 a tonne at one point and left
it at Pounds 944, up Pounds 31 on the week. 'There is very little volume in
the market and that is the key for the moment,' one trader told Reuter
yesterday.
The coffee market seemed unimpressed by news that Brazil was shortly to
begin its purchases under the producer retention scheme and the January
contract ended at Dollars 1,192 a tonne, up Dollars 14 on the week, after
reaching Dollars 1,208.

FT  16 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Forte forges link with Ciga hotels chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTE, the UK hotels and restaurants group, said yesterday that it was to
take over the management of Ciga, the Italian-based luxury hotels group
controlled by the Aga Khan.
The announcement is part of a restructuring plan of the highly-indebted
Italian group organised by Mediobanca, the Milanese merchant bank.
The deal would give Forte access to one of the world's most prestigious
hotel brands, raising questions over how strongly it now needs to pursue its
long-standing plan to take over the UK-based Savoy group.
Under the proposed Ciga restructuring, Forte will pay Pounds 33m cash and
insert some of its own luxury hotels with a value of about Pounds 125m into
an Italian operating company. Forte will have a majority interest in the
operating company.
Ciga's bank debt will be transferred into a separate property holding
company in which the operating company will have a 15 per cent stake.
Ciga, which operates 35 hotels in Italy, Austria, France, Greece, the
Netherlands and Spain had debts of L1,011bn (Pounds 420m) at the end of
June. It recorded of losses of L110.1bn in the first half of this year, up
from L58.9bn.
Mr Rocco Forte, chairman of Forte, said it was too early to say which hotels
his group would place in the Ciga operating company. It is thought, however,
that the group's four luxury hotels in Italy would be candidates.
Mr Forte said he had approached Mediobanca last June. The group's existing
activities in Italy and his family's Italian origins helped increase Forte's
attractiveness to Ciga's creditors, he said. 'In some degree it's an Italian
solution to the problem.'
Mr Paul Slattery, an analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said that it was difficult
to say what sort of return Forte could make on its investment until it had
fully investigated the state of the Ciga hotels. From a marketing point of
view, he described the combination of Forte and Ciga as 'potentially a dream
ticket'. He added: 'Forte will be managing the biggest array of super-luxury
hotels in the world.'
Forte's goal of controlling the Savoy was driven by the desire for a
prestigious name under which to market its own luxury hotels.
Mr Slattery said that with the Ciga deal, 'for the first time, I think Forte
could walk away from Savoy.'

Baris Holdings, the USM-quoted building services company, reported profits
of Pounds 9,000 for the half year to August 31, against losses of Pounds
70,000 which included exceptional costs of Pounds 358,000.
Continued recession in the construction industry had left a reduced level of
work with turnover down at Pounds 8.14m (Pounds 11.3m). The company said
further progress had been made in reducing operating costs in line with the
lower workload.

WB Industries, the spring manufacturer, incurred losses of Pounds 185,000
before and after tax in the first half of 1993.
The figure, which compared with losses of Pounds 657,000 last time, was
struck after a reduced interest charge of Pounds 77,000 (Pounds 185,000) and
an exceptional Pounds 74,000 for redundancy and severance costs.
Turnover from continuing activities - West Bromwich Spring - amounted to
Pounds 1.34m. The comparable figure of Pounds 3.94m included Pounds 2.79m
from Elson &amp; Robbins, sold in October 1992.
Losses per share were cut from 10.24p to 2.88p.

FT  16 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Craig &amp; Rose omits interim after loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Craig &amp; Rose, the paint and varnish manufacturer, lapsed into losses in the
first half of 1993 and passed its interim dividend.
The pre-tax deficit of Pounds 135,000 came on turnover of Pounds 2.64m
(Pounds 2.96m) and compared with profits last time of Pounds 134,000,
although that figure included a one-off profit of Pounds 148,000 on
realisation of investments.
Directors said the company had an 'exceptionally poor' first quarter and bad
debt problems remained. A return to the black in the second half was
unlikely.
Losses per stock unit were 32.25p (earnings of 25.25p). An interim of 2p was
paid last year.

<TEXT>
DESPITE A marginal decline in turnover, Brooks Service Group, the textile
rental and retail services company, announced a narrowed interim deficit and
a return to the dividend list.
The shares rose 5p to 70p.
After an exceptional credit of Pounds 75,000 (Pounds 110,000) following the
sale of goodwill to an associate, the pre-tax loss for the six months to
June 26 was Pounds 57,000 (Pounds 104,000). Turnover amounted to Pounds
11.5m (Pounds 11.7m).
Mr Simon Brooks, chairman, said that trading conditions were improving
slowly.
The outlook for the second half was 'reasonably positive' he said, leading
to the resumption of dividends with an interim of 0.5p. Losses per share
were reduced from 0.58p to 0.31p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
REED EXECUTIVE, the employment agency, cut interim pre-tax losses from
Pounds 3.73m to Pounds 177,000.
The figure for the six months to July 4 was achieved on turnover of Pounds
43.2m, against Pounds 40.8m. The result was in line with expectations
expressed in April.
The company said this had resulted in positive cash inflow of Pounds
930,000. However, that excluded the repayment of Pounds 630,000 of ACT,
previously provided, which has been deferred.
Reed has made small profits every month since May but said the full-year
outcome depended on the inevitable loss in December being contained so that
it did not negate the profits for the previous 11 months.
Losses for the period were 0.9p (5.8p) per share.

FT  16 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Leeds and N&amp;P terms still unclear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEEDS Permanent Building Society said yesterday that it still had to resolve
a number of 'difficult issues' with National &amp; Provincial in order to
produce a business plan for a merged society by the end of this month.
The two boards are scheduled to meet in the first week of next month to
approve a business plan that would allow the largest ever building society
merger to take place. However, senior managers are still trying to decide
terms.
Leeds said it did not believe that differences would be enough to block a
merger, and that it was normal in so big a merger to encounter some
obstacles. 'It is not an easy task, and no one expected it just to sail
through.'
Some senior managers of the Leeds are thought by some of its middle managers
to be unhappy at aspects of the merger, including the fact that Mr David
O'Brien, chief executive of N&amp;P, will take the same role in the merged
society.
The Leeds' board is due to meet on November 2 and N&amp;P's board on November 4
to consider the joint business plan. It would then go forward for approval
to the Building Societies Commission, which supervises the industry.
N&amp;P said that it believed the merger process was proceeding as expected, but
that the merger of two large and complex organisations was bound to raise
issues, and so lead to speculation about whether it faced difficulty.
The planned merger, announced in August, will eventually have to be approved
by the 3.3m members of the two societies. The societies have not yet decided
whether to offer their savings members a bonus in order to win approval.
The business plan is being drawn up by teams of managers of the two
societies, which are analysing various aspects of the businesses. These
include the mortgage lending side of their activities, and retail savings
operations.
The merger is intended to create the UK's third largest society, just behind
Nationwide. It would combine the Pounds 18.3bn assets of the Leeds,
currently the fifth largest, with the Pounds 12bn of N&amp;P, the eighth
largest.

FT  16 OCT 93 / UK Company News: New issues float on wave of market
confidence - The recent flotations have been welcomed in the City, but some
doubts remain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS rifling through documents for the second wave of flotations this
year are still bathed in the warm afterglow of the first, from which almost
all buyers have so far made money.
Issues which looked finely priced, if not expensive, such as Carpetright,
the retail chain, and Devro International, the sausage casings maker, have
performed well so far, albeit in a rising market.
Even RJB Mining, the coal company which saw its shares open at a discount is
now trading at a premium. Court Cavendish, the nursing home operator, which
also saw its shares slip, remains a disappointment.
There is still quality stock emerging, however, with the likes of Roxboro,
the electronics components maker, and Gartmore, the fund manager.
Mr David Barclay, deputy managing director of NatWest Markets Corporate
Finance, says: 'I think people have rediscovered new issues as a way of
apparently making rapid returns. Fortunately, the majority of issues we have
seen to date have justified their values, levels of enthusiasm are running
much higher than six months ago and certainly higher than a year ago.'
New issues are increasingly oversubscribed with retail demand quietly
approaching levels last seen in the 1980s. Today's market, which has risen
substantially, is anchored, however, by low interest rates, which is one
reason no one expects a repeat of 1987's stock market crash.
However, the nagging fear remains that the market is discounting a sharp
recovery in earnings which may be a more distant prospect than it knows.
'A few of the recent and forthcoming flotations could be risky if the
recovery falters,' says one banker.
This worry is fuelled by fears that today's buoyant market is over valuing
some smaller companies, particularly those in high technology sectors or
dependent on a single product.
'We are seeing some things coming out that perhaps in a more cynical market
you would have hesitated to float. There is no reason to expect the boom to
stop tomorrow; on the other hand history will tell you that sooner or later
people get carried away,' says the director of a merchant bank sponsoring
several of the current batch of new issues.
Other City sceptics point out that for venture capitalists seeking even a
partial exit from management buy-outs the market is currently prepared to
pay more for a percentage of the equity than trade buyers can afford or will
stump up for outright ownership.
One banker says: 'At some point that cycle will reverse. No one actually
believes there's going to be a crash, or even a mini-crash, but people ought
to be discriminating.'
Investors should be especially wary, he adds, of those managements which
know that the higher their issue is priced the bigger their own holdings
will grow under so-called ratchet agreements.
'If I were an institution I would be looking quite carefully at the
psychology of the management. The danger is some will squeeze every last
drop of juice out of the price which means less upside for new subscribers.'
Others argue that MBO floats are of the highest quality, already tested by
venture capital backers themselves and proven survivors of both recession
and financial stringency born of high debt.
The sheer volume of new issues means investors are likely anyway to become
more selective. Another banker, arranging a placing for a recent issue, said
he approached 30 institutions where he would normally contact 20, just
because of the number of new issues around.
In addition, institutions are subjecting new stock to a more rigorous
analysis. 'In the late 1980s we would rent a room somewhere, and have 40
institutions to meet the company. This meant there was scarcely any scope
for individual questions,' says another banker.
He contrasts this approach with today's one-to-one interviews: 'We go round
to them and they have a really in-depth hour of those people really grilling
our clients.'
For the moment the market is comfortable with the generally sensible prices,
but confidence is fragile. 'What usually happens is that some idiot
overprices something and it all gets left with the underwriters and then
people start being more careful', he says.

FT  16 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Hi-Tec chiefs unwind US options
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR EXECUTIVES at Hi-Tec, the sports shoe and leisure wear group, are being
paid Pounds 2.5m in cash and shares to unwind their original options over
the company's US business.
Hi-Tec yesterday announced details of a complicated deal which it said would
free the company to seek an efficient equity injection for its rapidly
growing US business.
The four executives - including main board director Mr Terry Mackness who
joined the US operation in 1988 - have options over 13 per cent of Hi-Tec
Sports USA.
Mr Peter Butler, finance director, said that under the original agreement
their stakes could not be diluted. This meant that the directors would have
to be paid a proportion of any equity injection into the US business.
'We agreed with the management that they should exercise their options now,'
Mr Butler said. The value of their stake at the option price is Dollars
1.6m, valuing the US business at Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.8m).
However, the executives have agreed to sell back 8.5 per cent of the 13 per
cent stake for Dollars 2.6m in cash and the issue of 1.4m shares in the
parent company. They will receive Dollars 1.6m in cash, offsetting the cost
of exercising the options.
Three of the four executives will also receive a 3 per cent stake in the
quoted parent as payment, while one US director has opted for a deferred
cash sum of Dollars 1m.
The executives will then be granted options over a further 6.5 per cent in
the US business, exercisable in three years at a total cost of Dollars 3.6m.
Mr Butler said this valued the US business at Dollars 44m.
Hi-Tec's shares closed 2p lower at 60p, for a market value of Pounds 28m.

FT  16 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Greycoat talks at early stage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREYCOAT, the property company struggling to fend off receivership, said
yesterday that talks regarding a possible takeover or a financial
restructuring were at an early stage and no formal proposals had been
received.
In a brief statement Greycoat's board said it had noted the recent price
movements of both its ordinary and preference shares, together with press
speculation regarding an imminent announcement of either a possible takeover
or a financial restructuring.
The board acknowledged that it had received 'a number of approaches from
interested parties', but said it wished to emphasise that 'these talks are
still at a preliminary stage and no formal proposal has yet been received.'
The statement added that the board intended to co-operate fully with
interested parties, but that it was unlikely that those discussions would
lead to definitive proposals 'before the latter part of next week.'
NM Rothschild, Greycoat's adviser, has confirmed that it had received at
least two approaches, including one from the UK Active Value Fund which is
advised by corporate financiers Mr Brian Myerson and Mr Julian Treger.
It controls 18 per cent of Greycoat's ordinary shares. Other interested
parties declined to be identified.
Yesterday the UK Active Value Fund claimed to have 'very substantial
backing' for its approach from a number of large UK and US institutions and
private families.
Greycoat's shares closed up 4p at 31p.

FT  16 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Ferromet cuts interim loss and plans
capital reorganisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FERROMET Group, the USM-quoted metals trader, yesterday revealed a cut in
losses on continuing activities for the first half of 1993 and at the same
time announced a capital reorganisation.
The pre-tax loss fell from Pounds 241,000 to Pounds 81,000. Turnover of
continuing activities, Portsmouth Metals and Clogau Nevada, fell from Pounds
820,000 to Pounds 558,000. Administration expenses were trimmed to Pounds
159,000 (Pounds 372,000).
Losses per share worked through at 0.04p (0.12p.
There is to be a rights issue to raise Pounds 327,129 gross and it is
planned to raise a further Pounds 418,595 gross via a share subscription.
In the share restructure each existing 1p ordinary share will be converted
into one ordinary 0.25p share and a 0.75p deferred share, the latter being
effectively valueless.
The rights issue of 130.85m new 0.25p shares will follow the capital
restructure and will be on the basis of one new 0.25p share for every two 1p
shares held.
The share subscription will take the form of the issue of 167.44m new 0.25p
shares to Bankhill Trustees.
Bankhill will then hold 29.9 per cent of the enlarged share capital of
Ferromet. The holding will represent 15 per cent on behalf of a trust formed
for the benefit of Mr Masoud Amir Alikhani and his immediate family with the
14.9 per cent balance held on behalf of seven Russian investors.
Mr Alikhani, who is currently a member of the board of the International
Foundation for Privatisation and Foreign Investment in Russia, will be
appointed to Ferromet's board.

FT  16 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Barclays quits card venture
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS yesterday said that it had sold its 49 per cent stake in a joint
store card venture with Hertie Waren und Kaufhaus, the German retailer,
following a review of its operations in Germany.
The group said it had decided that the joint venture, which it set up three
years ago to provide credit cards to customers of Hertie in eight German
cities, was a distraction from its main credit card business in Germany.
The 49 per cent stake was sold for an undisclosed amount to Berliner Bank.
Berliner said it had also acquired a further 1 per cent in the Optimus Bank
fuer Finanz-Service venture from Hertie, giving each 50 per cent.
Barclays said that no decision had yet been made on the future of CFS, its
German store card processing arm.

FT  16 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Sleepy Kids wake up to pet shop vampires
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SLEEPY KIDS, the USM-traded animation and merchandising group which is
behind the licensing of Budgie the Little Helicopter, the cartoon character
invented by the Duchess of York, is turning its hand to a slightly darker
side of children's entertainment.
Through Transylvania Pets, its 50.1 per cent-owned subsidiary, the group has
sold the television rights for one series, comprising 13 half-hour episodes,
of Transylvania Pet Shop to Carlton Television.
The series centres around Dr Scuzzbag, a fiendish scientist and owner of the
only pet shop in Transylvania, a cobwebbed castle populated by zombies,
vampires and dinosaurs. He is assisted in his endeavours by Horrifido, a
skeletal hound.
Sleepy Kids' shares rose 3p to 56p yesterday, a net rise of 15p on the week;
on Thursday the directors said they knew of no reason for the strength of
the shares. The Stock Exchange would not comment on yesterday's announcement
but said: 'We will look into any share price movement that looks unusual.'

FT  16 OCT 93 / Walls do not a penitent make: As the UK prepares to send
more offenders to jail, Alan Pike asks whether prisons work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Mr Michael Howard, the UK home secretary, needs any hints on how to make
prisons more austere as part of his forthcoming crackdown on crime, he can
obtain a handy booklet from the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys.
Last year, OPCS published the results of the first national survey of
prisoners in Britain's jails. Top of the list of improvements sought by
inmates was better food. All Mr Howard need do is to serve lumpy potatoes,
as well as restrict the other facilities that prisoners particularly value -
phonecards, television sets in cells and more frequent visits by their
families.
But Mr Howard's opponents hope that he will study the survey in more detail
before he tries to increase austerity, or to implement other measures from
his 27-point programme against crime that would increase the prison
population. It shows that only 30 per cent of prisoners believe prison is a
deterrent, compared with 93 per cent who regard it as an occupational hazard
of criminal activity, and 86 per cent who say inmates learn more about crime
while there.
Evidence of this sort, say critics, demonstrates that a crackdown on crime
spearheaded by a crackdown on the minority of offenders who happen to be
caught is doomed to failure. This week, as Prime Minister John Major backed
Mr Howard, the band of critics was joined by Lord Woolf - from the
government's point of view, an embarrassing opponent.
Lord Woolf, who dismissed the policy of imprisoning greater numbers of
people as having a 'miserable record of failure', is the senior judge who
led the 1990 public inquiry into the riots at Strangeways and other prisons.
Only two years ago, the government was among his report's admirers. A
prisons white paper in September 1991 acknowledged its debt to Woolf. Mr
Kenneth Baker, home secretary at the time, said the government accepted the
central proposition of the report that 'security and control must be
balanced with justice and humanity'.
Ministers were motivated not only by a desire to reduce prison overcrowding,
one of the flashpoints of the 1990 riots. They had concluded that prison was
an expensive failure for some offenders.
But this week Mr Major and Mr Howard defended the use of prisons by arguing
that offenders were prevented from committing further crimes while detained,
and that it deterred others. Such views are not only disputed by Lord Woolf,
penal reformers, probation officers, social workers and some senior police
officers and prison staff. They overturn the government's own arguments
advanced in a green paper leading to the 1991 Criminal Justice Act, which
legislated for greater use of non-custodial sentences.
The government maintained then that imprisonment reduced crime 'only by
restricting opportunities for a limited period'. People sent to prison were
also 'less likely to acquire the self-discipline and self-reliance' needed
to avoid reoffending in the future, while even a short period of custody was
likely to confirm young offenders as criminals.
Prison is certainly not cost-effective compared with alternative penalties.
The cost of an average prison sentence is 20 times greater than
non-custodial alternatives. And the Association of Chief Probation Officers
says official figures show that 69 per cent of men under 21 released from
young offenders' institutions reoffend within two years, compared with 56
per cent who are put on probation and 58 per cent serving community
penalties.
Mr Howard's critics complain that non-custodial penalties, such as service
in the community, have not been tried long enough, or financed adequately,
to demonstrate their full worth.
They are also alarmed that the government wants conditions in prison to be
deliberately austere. Mr Howard has said Butlins, the holiday camp operator,
will not be bidding for the contract to run six proposed new privately
managed prisons - the critics even question the need for these extra
prisons, saying the government should invest the money in improved crime
prevention.
Order in prison depends on strict maintenance of discipline, but few
governors would welcome instructions to bring in harsher conditions as part
of what one describes as a 'government public relations exercise to show
that it is giving criminals what it thinks they deserve'.
The view, heavily influenced by the Woolf report, that prison must offer
positive options is shared by the government's private sector partners,
which are taking over prison management. Mr Jim Harrower, chief executive of
security company Group 4, says he believes the private sector can gradually
contribute to crime reduction by breaking new ground in providing prisoners
with better work, education and training opportunities. 'The prison
population includes some very tough, difficult characters, and they must be
held in conditions that ensure they cannot disrupt things for everyone else.
But I do not wish to be in the business of simply warehousing prisoners.'
The Woolf report was not starry-eyed about the extent to which prison might
reform offenders. But it argued that the best hope was to avoid unnecessary
use of custody and make the damaging experience of imprisonment as positive
as possible.
Liberal-minded concern for the offender need not be the motivation for such
policies. Even though Mr Major and Mr Howard are stressing that prison takes
criminals out of circulation, few people stay there for life. As a memorable
passage of the Woolf report commented: 'The prison service has to live with
these prisoners during their time in prison. The rest of the country lives
with them afterwards.'

FT  16 OCT 93 / Torn in the USA: Americans are asking if Clinton has a map
to guide him through a complex, post-cold war world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If a day in government is a long time, a week can seem an eternity. Rarely
has one seen so many twists and turns as the last seven days, with President
Bill Clinton first put on the rack for foreign policy mismanagement in
Somalia and Haiti, then momentarily freed from it by his own verbal
counter-attack and the release of the downed US pilot in Mogadishu, only to
be defied again by the murder in Port-au-Prince of the justice minister just
hours after he had warned that the safety of Haitian democrats was a matter
of great concern to the US.
A torrent of commentary has swirled around him and, if not all has been
negative, the great bulk has questioned whether this president and his
administration have any form of road map to guide their path through a
complex and dangerous post-cold war world.
This time, significantly, it has not only been the predictable congressional
blowhards, instant screaming TV pundits and displaced Republican foreign
policy experts who have been tearing into Mr Clinton for the problems in
Somalia, Haiti and, if now to a much lesser extent, Bosnia.
Senator Mr Richard Lugar, the Republican from Indiana, is invariably the
soul of moderation, a firm believer in a bipartisan foreign policy. Yet this
week he vented his complaints about the lack of consultation with the
executive branch to the New York Times with uncharacteristic public venom.
'The roof has fallen in,' he declared. 'There is no significant
congressional support for the president's policy in any of the three
countries, and it's his own fault. A few people have stood beside him . . .
but they are doing it solely out of loyalty to the constitution and the role
of commander-in-chief.'
David Broder, whose political columns in the Washington Post are normally
restrained, took dead aim this week at the foreign policy team. To the
public, he wrote, Warren Christopher, secretary of state, was 'a cautious
corporate lawyer', Tony Lake, national security adviser, 'a bookish
academic' and Les Aspin, secretary of defence, 'a garrulous brainstormer
given to hypothetical musings'.
'All three of them seem to indulge, if not encourage, Clinton's penchant for
talking issues to death . . . None of them has come close to achieving a
degree of public confidence that would buttress the shaky trust in Clinton's
management of international affairs.' He thought Mr David Gergen, the
presidential counsellor who has worked wonders on the domestic side, should
'remind Clinton that there are Republicans who know their way around the
world'. The 'ouch' could be heard around Washington.
Yet the president has had his supporters, some from unlikely quarters.
President Isaias Afwerki of Eritrea wrote in the Washington Post that Mr
Clinton had taken the 'responsible and courageous decision' on Somalia. He
may not carry much weight in Washington, but Senator Bob Dole, the
Republican leader, does and he has tempered his frequently biting criticism
to help beat back congressional attempts to force an earlier withdrawal from
Somalia.
Some of the more thoughtful columnists, from Mr Clinton's own generation,
have sympathised with his dilemmas and condemned the opportunism of his
critics, especially the old interventionists. Michael Kinsley's syndicated
column concluded that it was 'arguable and tempting' both that the US should
continue to lead the world and that it should retreat from it. 'What is
demeaning and harmful is the widespread belief that we can have it both
ways.'
E J Dionne of the Washington Post commended the economic emphasis in the
Clinton foreign policy and urged him to make the connections to domestic
well-being more clearly. 'It ought not to be surprising that after 50 years
of engagement many Americans think that the country's priorities should be
turned inwards.'
Precisely for this reason Mr Clinton had been enjoying some of the best
weeks of his presidency, with approval ratings back up over 50 per cent on
the strength of his expositions on healthcare reform and the North American
Free Trade Agreement (a battle not yet lost by any means) and a general
sense that was getting on top of his job. A North Carolina speech on Monday,
which did get lost in the foreign policy tumult, saw the president at his
more effectively philosophical as he spoke of the need for personal,
economic and community security during times of change.
But the outside world does not go away, and there is concern that this
progress should not be derailed by external 'crises' reflecting badly on the
president's competence. This wired world, with CNN's ubiquitous cameras,
demands instant responses from government and its opposition, but it also
encourages an ephemeral attention span. This week's dramas may also be next
week's history.
Yet the latest passage of events has been instructive in the light it sheds
on the way this administration operates in foreign affairs. Its vaunted
collegiality did not prevent a serious disagreement between the state and
defence departments over the safety of the aborted Haitian mission, and it
still relies to a remarkable degree on the intervention of Mr Clinton to win
hearts and minds and take action.
Mr Christopher and Mr Aspin, for example, failed lamentably last week in
their joint attempt to persuade congressional leaders that the US knew what
it was about in Somalia. It took the president to set matters straight the
following day, while this week the articulation of policy has been left
almost exclusively, if understandably, to him. No wonder he sometimes
wistfully comments on the time he devotes to foreign affairs.
The Washington knives have been out for Mr Christopher since January, first
on the grounds that he was no conceptual global thinker and then for failing
to get the European allies to intervene more forcefully in Bosnia. Now he
stands accused of a lack of concern for the safety of US troops in Haiti and
inattention to Somalia, where he is said to have underestimated the apparent
obsession of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, to nail
General Mohammed Farah Aideed, the Somali faction leader. As it is,
relations with Mr Boutros Ghali, additionally miffed that US special envoy
Mr Robert Oakley's diplomatic mission is not under UN direction, are
severely strained.
Yet there is no reason to suppose that Mr Clinton has lost confidence in his
secretary of state, nor in Mr Aspin or Mr Lake. Indeed the president stoutly
defended Mr Aspin's decision not to send additional weaponry to Mogadishu
before the disastrous firefight two weeks ago that cost 17 American lives.
If Mr Clinton's comments on foreign affairs do not always reflect the
passion he can impart on domestic issues, there was no doubt of its presence
this week. The heat has been turned down on General Aideed, up on the
Haitian military, and is lukewarm towards US involvement in UN peacekeeping,
unless the terms (US military command and a commitment to political
engagement, as in Cambodia) are right.
And if his critics could not see the consistency in this and thought he was
'naive', then they failed to understand that 'we are living in a new and
different world' and that he had made 'a pretty good beginning on the things
that affect us most'. As the sportswriters say here, the best offence is a
good defence, and Mr Clinton, at the end of a difficult week, at least
managed to launch that.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Proposal to split charities' role
destructive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms JUDY WELEMINSKY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Alan Pike in Monday's FT ('Charity tins may rattle to a different
tune') and your leading article, 'An attack on the voluntary sector'
(October 13), commented on the launch of a new research study, 'Voluntary
Action', by the Centris group. This report proposes that charities and
voluntary organisations should be split into two categories - service
providers and campaigners - and that organisations must choose between them.
Such a recommendation is simplistic and destructive.
Our sector is very aware of the high standards demanded by our unique
position as recipients of gifts from individuals and funding from statutory
funders. It would be naive to believe everything in the charitable world is
rosy, but this report exaggerates the problems and fuels unnecessary fears.
Charities that provide services are engaged in a lively debate about how
they combine their increasing role as providers of services under contract
to government or government agencies and retain their independence to
campaign and lobby forcefully.
Charities can combine these roles effectively and they should not be
separated. Experience in service provision informs and enriches campaigning
work. Except for a very few examples, it is essential that voluntary
organisations undertake both roles. They would be failing in their
responsibility to their donors and supporters if they ignored the causes of
the social and economic crises faced by many people in need. Government is
much better informed and advised by charities through allowing the voices of
those at the sharp end to be heard.
However, I have significant concerns about two trends which are particularly
strong in the community care and health fields and which will risk the
goodwill of charities. Statutory funders often fail to pay the full cost for
services provided under contract. This is done deliberately in order to
provide a 'cheaper' service. Such irresponsibility leaves charity trustees
with the difficult choice between subsidising services out of charitable
funds or withdrawing services. The second fear is that statutory agencies,
with the current pressure on resources, will cease to fund the new projects
which supplement the basic statutory provision and lead to new and improved
services.
The report went further and suggested that tax reliefs should be withdrawn
and the Charity Commission abolished. This would be a significant
disincentive to donors. The Gift Aid scheme and the use of covenants would
be in peril. Withdrawal of fiscal benefits enjoyed by charities would have
very serious consequences, making it more difficult to stimulate people to
give in a planned and thoughtful way. Loss of supervisory support from the
Charity Commission might erode the trust people rightly have in charities.
I believe that the debate on the future of voluntary actions should focus on
how more people can be involved as volunteers and help to solve the problems
of our society - crime and youth unemployment, environmental degradation,
the challenge of helping the third world and the issues around the effective
provision of care in the community.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Too reliant on litigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mrs CELIA HAMPTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Cutting red tape' (October 11), took a refreshing view of
the rule-making process. Sadly, the radical suggestion that the government
should set the regulatory objectives and leave the rest to litigation goes a
bit far.
Clear statement of the general principles makes legislation infinitely
easier to understand. But often the implications need to be spelt out in
some detail, especially where penalties or heavy damages may be the result.
English courts only award compensatory damages, so large damages always mean
that someone has already suffered a large loss or injury.
A lot of regulations serve the function of instruction manuals rather than
general laws. The dangers they are designed to avert may not be obvious to
those involved. For example, many people are unaware of the risks of using
the same knife to cut raw and cooked meat: the regulations aim to stop an
outbreak of food poisoning, not to penalise careless or ignorant
restaurateurs.
The vice in most regulations is the way that the detail is organised. Far
too often it follows the convenience of the drafter, not the reader. The
unmanageable bulk of regulations is aggravated by the baroque way in which
they are usually written.
The areas covered by regulation may not be capable of much reduction. You
rightly point out that one person's regulation is another person's
protection. What could be done is to re-organise the whole body of
regulations, setting them out in a logical structure. This would show up
inconsistencies and obscurities in the present texts. A drafter dedicated to
logical exposition would use more coherent and accessible language.
Of course, this would cost quite a lot of public money. But the present
alternative inflicts this cost, many times over, on the population at large
in terms of time wasted trying to abide by the law.

</HEADLINE>

   From Ms ALICE JOLLY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Many thanks to Joe Rogaly ('The patter of tiny ideas', October 12). In
these difficult times, we should ensure we fulfil our obligations to the
least fortunate in our society. In fact, the opposite is happening.
Scapegoats are required and the least fortunate, who are unable to defend
themselves, are being blamed. It is sickening to see the Conservative party
exploit these prejudices to boost its popularity, and to do so in the name
of the 'moral majority'.
Let us focus on the real issues: if the British economy were successful,
there would be fewer needy people and it would be easy to meet the cost of
providing for them.

FT  16 OCT 93 / More than the job's worth: Recession has changed Japanese
attitudes to work - maybe for good
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the past, slaves were loaded onto slave ships and carried off to the New
World. But in some way, aren't our daily commuter trains packed to the brim
even more inhuman? These corporate slaves of today don't even share the
simplest of pleasures that forced labourers of ages past enjoyed: the right
to sit down at the dinner table with their families.'
Toshitsugu Yagi, a Japanese advertising executive, made this entry in his
diary, with tragic prescience, shortly before his recent death from karoshi,
or sudden death caused by overwork.
He is among the estimated 10,000 Japanese to die this way annually, the same
number as are killed in traffic accidents, a phenomenon which is attracting
public concern as well as a host of legal demands for compensation from
employers.
Mr Yagi's diary speaks for the many salarymen whose devotion to a company in
return for lifetime employment has helped transform Japan into an economic
superpower but who are now questioning the postwar social contract.
The toughest recession for 20 years has forced both partners to the
contract, companies and employees, to rethink attitudes to work. The process
may already have been under way, pushed by the internationalisation of
Japanese corporate culture, before the economy took a dive. If so, Japanese
feelings about work could be undergoing a permanent change.
On the employers' side, corporate Japan has been obliged to take an axe to
excessive wage costs, a legacy of the social contract uncovered by four
years of falling profits.
Early retirements, job transfers to remote affiliates, enforced holidays on
low pay and reduced hiring, have been toughest among the biggest companies,
the very groups which were once seen as guarantors of the tradition of jobs
for life. They include telecommunications group NTT, which is Japan's
biggest employer, Nippon Steel, the world's largest steel group, and most
top electronics companies.
On the part of employees, many salarymen today feel there is more to life
than honourable sacrifice in the service of a great multinational - and it
is fashionable to say so.
Fewer, for instance, today introduce themselves in the traditional fashion,
company name first, own name second; a pattern that indicated that the
company did indeed come first in everything.
More striking still, some salarymen are starting to hit back by taking their
companies to court for alleged unfair treatment. A recent example is Mr
Haruo Kawaguchi, who has achieved big publicity by suing his employer,
Teikoku Hormone Manufacturing, for compensation for a six-year separation
from his family caused by a routine job transfer.
A sign that businessmen think Japan should throw out some of its traditional
workplace values came in a recent survey of 1,600 executives, who said the
top three qualities that Japanese society should pursue are creativity,
fairness and symbiosis. The values commonly thought to have made Japanese
companies into world beaters, such as efficiency, growth and competition
came bottom of the scale, in the poll by the Social and Economic Congress of
Japan, a private think-tank.
An increasing number of salarymen are turning their new aspirations into
reality by taking the initiative and asking to be switched to less ambitious
but more fulfilling jobs outside Tokyo headquarters.
The bursting of the 'bubble economy' and subsequent corporate streamlining
have offered salarymen an opportunity to review their relationships with
companies. And some of them, especially those in their 30s, have decided to
switch jobs,' says Kazuhiko Tanaka, editor of B-ing, a job placement
magazine.
One of them is Tetsuro Handa, who two years ago left a high-flying job as
section manager of Mitsubishi Corporation's copy machine export division, to
work in the newly created environmental affairs department, where he vets
the environmental impact of Mitsubishi capital investment plans. 'I couldn't
care less about promotion now. What I am doing is more important and
rewarding for my life. The environment is a cause that I can devote myself
to, even after I retire,' he says.
But the liberated Mr Handa is in a minority. Those who have been forced to
take more leisure or change job as part of a cost cutting plan, rather than
make their own moves, have sometimes discovered that trying to kick
workaholicism can be traumatic.
Mental illness is increasing among early retiring and semi-redundant
salarymen. While this is well-known among surplus executives in the west, it
is unfamiliar in Japan, and especially striking because of the Japanese
taboo against admitting to psychological upsets.
Several Tokyo psychiatrists say a rising number of distressed salarymen have
come to their couches in recent years. 'Many patients say that . . . they
have been assigned to sections they did not desire, and have lost
confidence,' says Dr Toru Sekiya, a psychiatrist who treats about 10 people
a day for mild depression, twice as many as five years ago.
Dr Sekiya recalls a patient who could not bear to tell his family that he
was out of a job and left home clad in a suit every morning, to spend the
day killing time in coffee shops. Eventually he tired of this and asked Dr
Sekiya for a medical certificate, citing 'internal problems' as an excuse to
stay at home.
The public debate opened by the casualties among Japan's corporate slaves
can only increase the urge among those still in work to put private
aspirations first and loyalty to the company second.
This invites the question of whether Japan's corporate strength, partly
built on salarymen's selflessness, might be weakened by a dilution in
devotion to the company. 'It could be a sign of the decline of the economy .
. . it could make it hard to adapt if there is a really severe recession,'
argues Toshio Kusamitsu, associate professor of social history at Tokyo
university.
Alternatively, Japanese companies might secretly welcome confrontation with
the workforce, as an excuse further to cut their bloated payrolls.
Officials at the Keidanren business federation says that companies have an
estimated 800,000 to 1.2m surplus workers on their books, on top of the 1.5m
registered unemployed. If the change in attitudes does help erode companies'
old loyalties to their unwanted staff, corporate Japan could come out of it
leaner and meaner.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: A splenetic portrait of events
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As I am one of the group which Patricia Morison attacks ('Gallery
headhunting', October 9) for 'gossip', 'venting their spleen' and 'petty
opposition' to the decision of the trustees of the National Portrait Gallery
to reject the favoured candidate, may I suggest that her article is as
splenetic as any could be.
What is outstanding about Dr Rogers is precisely his conventional
curatorship with an art history that embraces social history, and to boot he
is an able verbal communicator.
Of course, we all know that Ms Morison's 'new' art history comprises
analyses of finger expressions and the height of the wig above the eyebrow.
She is on thin ice indeed if she upholds the writings of Saumarez Smith as
evidence of this new approach.
When you already have in-house a potential institutional leader whose
relationship to donors to the very institute she or he aspires to is of the
very best, it is surely foolish of the trustees to alienate and anger those
very donors.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Not such a lucky fella: Doubts over the UK's economic
recovery have narrowed Kenneth Clarke's options for next month's Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Kenneth Clarke has had a wonderful opening innings as chancellor.
Some 4 1/2 months of masterly inactivity at the Treasury, offset by a rather
more punishing schedule in television studios, have cemented his position as
the cabinet heavy-weight and the bookies' favourite as heir apparent to Mr
John Major, the prime minister.
But as Mr Clarke's first big test - the unified Budget on November 30 -
draws nearer, it is clear that he is no longer quite such a lucky fellow.
Successive chancellors have learned that the UK economy has a nasty way of
springing unpleasant surprises just when things appear to be going well.
Poor figures on production and inflation this week threaten to make Mr
Clarke the latest in a line of distinguished victims of this trend.
With hindsight, we now know that the economic signals that appeared just
after Mr Clarke moved into number 11 Downing Street in late May were too
flattering. Looking back it seemed the UK was enjoying a 'near perfect'
recovery, led by exports and investment, that held out hopes of sustained
non-inflationary growth.
The annual rate of inflation - at 1.3 per cent in May and 1.2 per cent in
June - reached its lowest level for nearly three decades. Unemployment fell
23,100 in May, after similar falls in February and March. Manufacturing
output was rising at an annualised 4 to 5 per cent and exports also showed
strong growth.
The past week's figures have confirmed doubts about the manufacturing
recovery. The Treasury made no attempt to hide its disappointment at the 0.7
per cent decline in manufacturing output in the three months to the end of
August against the previous three months.
It is easy to be too negative about the latest figures. Exports and
industrial production have been depressed by the recession on the European
continent. Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, has
pointed out rightly that recoveries do not 'proceed in a straight line'. The
news that unemployment fell a seasonally adjusted 13,600 in September
suggests that the economy as a whole is still growing. According to Mr
Darren Winder, an economist with SG Warburg Securities, official figures
next Friday could show that the economy expanded by about 0.4 per cent in
the third quarter, leaving it on track for growth of about 1.7 per cent this
year.
But the quality of recovery will be different from that signalled in spring.
Output will have been rising in the service sector, rather than in
manufacturing, and will have been sustained by the British consumer rather
than the factory manager or the overseas client. In fact, Britain appears to
have settled back into a traditional recovery pattern fueled by household
demand.
A consumer confidence survey from Gallup and Business Strategies, an
economic consultancy, found this week that the recovery in consumer spending
is increasingly well established after rising for six consecutive quarters.
Low interest rates, low inflation and the stabilisation of unemployment have
boosted consumers' confidence compared with a year ago.
Recent Central Statistical Office figures for exports and producer prices
suggest that recovery is showing other traditional patterns. UK
manufacturers have used Sterling's devaluation since the pound's exit from
the European Monetary System in September 1992 to push up margins where
possible rather than maximise market share.
The government and Bank of England thus need to be vigilant on inflation. It
is true that headline inflation at 1.8 per cent in September was still low
by UK standards. But the upwards creep of the more important underlying
rate, excluding mortgages, to 3.3 per cent last month from 3.1 per cent in
August and 2.8 per cent in May and June, must disturb the authorities.
Not only is the underlying rate fairly near the government's 4 per cent
target ceiling, set a year ago, but inflationary pressures are building up.
Mr Norman Lamont's March Budget decisions to impose value added tax on
domestic fuel and power as well as restrict mortgage interest relief to the
lowest 20 per cent tax band will add 0.65 percentage points to the RPI from
next April. The government's promise to raise road fuel duties by at least 3
per cent a year in real terms could push up petrol prices as early as
December.
The deteriorating economic background has implications for Mr Clarke's first
Budget. Rising inflation and the changing quality of growth formed the
backdrop to yesterday's confidential conclave on Budget strategy attended by
the chancellor, Treasury ministers and senior officials at Dorneywood in
Buckinghamshire.
If there has been a consistent theme to his chancellorship it has been to
stress the need to restore the nation's finances and bring down the Budget
deficit from the forecast Pounds 50bn in 1993-94 at a faster rate than
envisaged in March.
While not detailing possible tax measures, Mr Clarke has been unusually
talkative for a chancellor about matters of revenue raising and public
spending.
We know that Mr Clarke sees no opportunity for cutting the deficit by
reducing the 'control total' for public spending below its pre-set level of
Pounds 254bn for the 1994-95 financial year. This accords with his political
beliefs: the chancellor is not one of those Tories who believes public
spending is automatically bad. It may also jibe with political realities:
reports leaking out of the special EDX cabinet committee that is trying to
hold down departmental expenditures suggest the spending round is proceeding
'bloodily'.
Ever since his first major interview with this newspaper in July, Mr Clarke
has been consistent in suggesting that taxes might have to rise in the
Budget. He has made clear that he prefers indirect to direct taxation and
has made no secret of his belief that Britain's value added tax net, which
zero rates items such as foods, books, newspapers, new dwellings, childrens'
clothes and sewerage services, is too narrow.
As befits a son of the industrial Midlands, he has spoken of the importance
of a tax structure 'which favours enterprise, entrepreneurship and thrift'.
He has indicated that he would not turn first to taxing the corporate sector
in conditions of weak recovery.
But he faces problems turning preferences into policy. It is unlikely he can
act boldly to increase VAT or widen its net.
VAT rises would feed through into both headline and the underlying retail
price indices and increase the risk of underlying inflation exceeding the
government's 4 per cent target ceiling. Also will Mr Clarke want to hit
consumers with more VAT levies, announced just before Christmas, if they are
now the mainstay of recovery?
Although the chancellor robustly defended existing plans to levy VAT on
domestic fuel and power at the Conservatives' conference nine days ago,
party activists in Blackpool's Winter Gardens made clear their dislike of
tax rises in general and VAT increases in particular.
Other political factors may limit Mr Clarke's options. The 1992 election
manifesto pledged to 'maintain' mortgage interest relief, raise child
benefits and pensions in line with inflation and increase spending on health
in real terms. Mr Clarke is too much a politician to trample on these
pledges. Mr Major, keenly interested in the Budget, also wishes to avoid any
overt breach of manifesto commitments.
Yet the Treasury has been studying ways of further curtailing mortgage
interest relief. But the fragile state of the housing market is another
argument against too savage an attack on this subsidy, which will cost about
Pounds 4.3bn in 1993-94 and Pounds 3.6bn in 1994-95.
Monetary policy is an area where Mr Clarke is being constantly urged to take
action. While commentators could assert inflation was dead, it was easy to
construct a strategy of fiscal tightening, offset by an interest rate cut to
support the economy through fiscal consolidation.
Mr Clarke has kept base rates unchanged at the 6 per cent level set on
January 26 this year.
But UK short-term interest rates are the lowest in Europe. It is not clear
how far a further cut would help the housing market or mortgage borrowers.
Most new mortgages taken out this year have been at fixed rates while many
lenders have made clear that they could not pass on the full amount of any
base rate cut in lower borrowing costs.
Lower interest rates might benefit industry, although industrialists have
generally stopped complaining about rates. Without rate cuts on the
continent, cheaper money in Britain could undermine the pound and give a new
boost to inflation through imported goods prices.
There is also a political factor for Mr Clarke to weigh. Savers greatly
outnumber borrowers. MPs' post bags are full of complaints from moderately
well-off pensioners lamenting the drop in their interest income since
September 1992. Local elections are due in May and European elections in
June next year. Would Mr Clarke, the politician, want to alienate further a
group of voters that is already up in arms over VAT on fuel?
With just over six weeks to the Budget, Mr Clarke is walking a fine line.
His dilemma should not be over-dramatised because the Treasury is skilled at
finding hitherto unsuspected and relatively painless ways of raising
revenue, by closing loopholes or altering tax allowances. But too much
action to cut the deficit could tip the economy into a new recession. Too
little, and the hope of tax cuts before the next election would evaporate.
Though it might go against the grain, Micawberism, living in hope that
'something might turn up', might be the best way forward for Mr Clarke. Some
Pounds 6.73bn of fiscal tightening has been programmed for 1994-95 as a
result of Mr Lamont's March Budget. This strengthens the case for a 'do
nothing Budget' that leaves further action on the deficit until recovery on
the continent has provided new support for activity in Britain.
It is no wonder that his big decisions on taxation will be left as late as
possible next month. But as November 30 looms, Mr Clarke, the chancellor,
may find that he is having to resolve some difficult conflicts with Mr
Clarke, the politician.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Euphoria revisited
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS long been clear that the securities markets are the only place left
in the developed world where inflation continues to work its spell on
prices. A sudden rash of paper bids and deals in the US, culminating in Bell
Atlantic's outsized Dollars 22bn bid for Tele-Communications Inc on
Wednesday, suggests that the business community has finally grasped the
significance of this fact. If you have a barrowful of questionable currency,
the sage thing to do is swap it as quickly as possible for something real.
While most of the recent share-based acquisitions and mergers rest on
plausible industrial logic, it seems likely that Wall Street's sky-high
price-earnings multiples eased the thought processes of the industrial
logicians more than somewhat.
Other bid announcements that preceded this elephantine telephone and cable
television get-together include the contested battle for the film and
publishing group, Paramount Communications; the KeyCorp and Society
Corporation regional banking merger proposal; and pharmaceutical giant
Merck's offer for the biggest US drugs distribution group, Medco. It can
only be a matter of time before all this activity spawns a clutch of
imitators in the UK. City merchant bankers' nostrils are already twitching
at the scent of fees.
Bull market euphoria has thus entered a new phase; and it is, in a sense,
the natural outcome of an asset price boom built on economic growth that
continues to run well below potential. What else are businessmen to do but
engage in paper shuffling when the economic indicators tell such conflicting
tales? While broad money remains stagnant in much of the Anglo-Saxon world,
reflecting the weakness of the banking system and the flight of savings out
of banks into the capital markets, the narrow money used for transaction
purposes is expanding vigorously, leaving central bankers in a quandary.
Urgent need
Bonds and equities have been rising simultaneously, despite the fact that
the attraction of fixed-interest bonds for many investors rests on a
deflationary view of the world that would be bad for corporate profits and
equities. Some equity investors are assuming increased risk for no better
reason than that the return on cash is low. Their optimism about corporate
earnings is less a matter of analysis that the by-product of their urgent
need for income.
One thing that would make partial sense of a simultaneous bull market in
equities and bonds is a decline in real bond yields, after adjusting for
inflation, as a result of a shift in the supply of savings relative to
investment demand. Put another way, if nominal bond yields have been coming
down faster than the economists have been shrinking their forecasts of
inflation, the real cost of fixed interest capital will have been falling.
Because figures for real yields have to be based on forecasts of future
inflation, there is inevitably a lack of precision about the argument. But
the London Bond Broking Company estimates, on the basis of perfectly
plausible assumptions, that real yields are now lower in the US, Japan,
Germany and the UK than in the period from 1981 to 1992. In the case of the
UK alone, the movement of index-linked gilts over the past 15 months clearly
indicates a marked fall in real yields.
Strain in Europe
This flies in the face of the conventional wisdom that took hold after the
fall of the Berlin Wall. Then it was widely assumed that the reintegration
of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union into the free world economy
would place huge demands on the world's financial markets. The assumption
was reinforced by changed perceptions about Latin American debt and the
growing enthusiasm in Latin America and Asia for economic liberalism.
Yet in the event the strain in the financial markets has been largely
confined to Europe, where unification transformed Germany from a net
creditor to a net debtor as resources were diverted into the east German
economy. Even then, the financial pressures, which were exacerbated by the
rigidity of the exchange rate mechanism, came not so much from the capital
markets as from the operations of the Bundesbank on short-term interest
rates - this at a time when the Group of Seven countries were running up
large fiscal deficits. In short, the global savings shortage failed to
emerge.
But that is no cause for complacency. If the developed world has been able
to accommodate these new requirements for capital, it is because the demands
have been more subdued than expected and savings have been higher thanks to
recession. That said, the jumbo deals that are now making headlines in the
world's financial press are no cause for alarm precisely because they are
being financed by equity. Taken together with the wave of public equity
issues across the globe, this helps mitigate the damage wrought by the junk
bond excesses of the 1980s. If there is damage in these mega-mergers, it
will be industrial rather than financial. And it will take a long time
before the shareholders fully grasp what has been done in their name.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Man in the News: Mandarin in a masterly game - Jiang Enzhu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like a man engaged in a marathon game of 'Go', the Chinese version of chess,
Mr Jiang Enzhu, China's chief negotiator in the Sino-British talks over Hong
Kong, has given little away in a protracted struggle; but it appears now
that he may be ready to break out of the pattern of stolid defence that has
characterised the contest so far.
When Mr Jiang said this week that the negotiations were at a 'crossroads',
it was a clear sign that from China's perspective the two sides were now
entering the beginning of the 'endgame' in their battle of wills over
Governor Chris Patten's proposals for an extension of democracy in Hong
Kong.
In this typically Chinese game of encirclement, the 55-year-old Mr Jiang is
proving an adept 'front man' in dogged defence of what he has described
repeatedly as China's 'principled stand'. While his British counterpart, Sir
Robin McLaren, UK ambassador in Beijing, has signalled the odd tactical
shift - a hint of further British concessions galvanised the Hong Kong stock
exchange yesterday - the Chinese official has played a waiting game,
bolstering his defences and re-stating China's position ad nauseam. It is
almost certainly a measure of Mr Jiang's diplomatic skills that at the end
of more than 100 hours of face-to-face talks British officials know little
more about their chief interlocutor than at the beginning, beyond noting a
certain abrasiveness on occasions behind a bland exterior.
To the outside world, and to those who have faced him across an oval table
of an opulent guesthouse of the Diaoyutai compound in Beijing over 13 rounds
of desultory talks since April, Mr Jiang has conveyed the impression of the
very model of a modern Chinese bureaucrat. From his public statements to the
press to his lengthy private monologues about Mr Patten's 'perfidious' plans
to extend the franchise for elections due in 1994 and 1995, Mr Jiang appears
not to have departed one iota from a carefully prepared script, or game
plan.
If Chinese 'chess' relies on infinite patience, and more than a little
repetition, then he might be described as an exemplar in the diplomatic
game. 'He tailors his performance to the occasion. He is one of their
smarter operators,' is the assessment of a western official familiar with Mr
Jiang's negotiating skills and urbanity.
It is a reputation widely acknowledged in Beijing's gossipy diplomatic
community where the Chinese official is a well-known figure, thanks to a
series of high-level foreign ministry posts, including director of the
Department of West European Affairs, before his appointment as vice minister
in 1991. A native of Jiangsu province, south of the Yangtze, Mr Jiang
entered the foreign ministry as a translator in 1965, the year before the
Cultural Revolution brought chaos to China. His fluent English led him to a
diplomatic appointment in London where he served as third and then second
secretary in the late 1970s.
While he has no reputation as an Anglophile, unlike several of his foreign
ministry contemporaries, his language skills and his experience of dealing
with the 'English' made him an obvious choice to head Beijing's negotiating
team over an issue as sensitive as Hong Kong. Among his peers, he has a
reputation for meticulousness and perhaps more important, patience. 'He is
very professional and hardworking,' was the description one of his
colleagues accorded him. But asked about anecdotes or personal details that
might illuminate a picture of Mr Jiang foreign ministry cadres seemed at a
loss. In keeping with reticence common to Chinese officials, Mr Jiang has
shunned discussion about his background since the Hong Kong talks brought
him to notice internationally.
What seems certain is that his prominent role will do his career no harm.
While Mr Jiang may not seem an obvious heir apparent to Mr Qian Qichen,
China's long-serving foreign minister, there is also no doubt that his
background, experience, and now sustained international exposure equip him
for bigger and better things.
A question that has hung over Mr Jiang since the first round of the Hong
Kong talks has been exactly how much flexibility he might enjoy in the
negotiations. Indeed, the foreign ministry's own influence in formulating
policy on the vexed issue is unclear, and may be slight compared with that
of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs office directly under the State Council
or 'cabinet'. If Mr Jiang is unable, as some suggest, to depart by so much
as a 'comma' from instructions formulated deep in the bowels of the Chinese
bureaucracy, then within these limitations, he appears to have handled his
'brief' without faltering.
Dressed in his conservative dark suits and sober ties, his hair tinged with
grey, a coolly smiling Mr Jiang has contrived to appear in the eyes of the
press to be a fairly avuncular figure. While talks stumble on he has not
chosen to show his caustic side publicly, although if negotiations fail he
can be expected to join in the noisy rhetoric that will surely follow.
If it is possible to discern subtle mood shifts over the many months of the
Hong Kong talks, then this latest phase indicates an appearance of
increasing certainty on the part of the Chinese that in this elaborate chess
game their tactics of encirclement and wearing one's opponent down may be
giving them the upper hand.
Judging, by phlegmatic reactions in Hong Kong to the ups and downs of
Sino-British relations negotiations in Beijing over Mr Patten's proposals
are hardly the worry they may have once been.
Whether this insouciance would survive a rupture between London and Beijing
over the Patten proposals is another matter, but Mr Jiang certainly
contrived to appear unfussed about such an outcome when he told reporters
this week that the talks were at a 'crossroads' and were 'faced with two
possibilities: reaching an agreement or not'.
'If an agreement could not be reached,' he said, 'it would be no big deal.'
In the Chinese game of 'Go' stalemate is a far from unusual occurrence.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Bank of England wins appeal over Mount Banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England was yesterday vindicated in its decision a year ago to
petition for the closure of Mount Banking, a small Asian-owned bank.
The Banking Appeal Tribunal ruled that the Bank had been justified in
applying to a High Court judge for provisional liquidation in October last
year.
The tribunal's 52-page ruling, circulated yesterday, showed that the Bank
acted on suspicion of large-scale money laundering of proceeds of a fraud
against Standard Chartered and the Indian Stock Exchange, and 'other serious
improprieties'.
The judgment is particularly significant in ratifying the Bank's attempts to
take a bolder line in using its judgment as a regulator since the closure of
the Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
The Bank had been criticised in the Bingham report into BCCI for relying too
far on high standards of evidence as a basis for regulatory actions and
being unwilling to have its authority tested.
The judgment came in the first sitting of a tribunal under the 1987 Banking
Act. It met in September under the chairmanship of Mr Jonathan Mance, QC. It
revealed that the Bank of England has allowed Mount Banking to keep its
licence for another three months, which may give time for its sale.
The tribunal determined that the Bank was right to assess the two
shareholders of the bank, Mr Navinchandra Bhagwanji Shah and Mr Suresh
Bhagwanji Shah, as 'fit and proper' to hold their positions as directors.
The tribunal ordered the appellants to pay the Bank of England's costs,
expected to be several hundred thousand pounds.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Fresh row over milk reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAIRY companies have become embroiled in another row with the Milk Marketing
Board about arrangements for liberalising the Pounds 3.3bn milk market next
April.
The dairies say the board will continue to monopolise haulage arrangements
for milk, making it more difficult for new entrants to the market.
The board will be wound up in April when it plans to transform itself into
Milk Marque, a voluntary farmers' co-operative.
But the dairies have objected to board proposals which envisage transferring
existing haulage contracts for the milk market to the new body until 1995.
'Our main concern is that as we go to a free market, there should be open
access for everyone to the transport system,' said one dairy representative.
The board says it will put all of its transport contracts up for tender at
the end of next year, but the dairies are arguing this should be done as
soon as the market is liberalised.
The contracts will allow Milk Marque to tie up existing haulage capacity in
the initial stages of the new market, even if it fails to secure all of the
supply.
Mr Trevor Blackburn, chairman of Northern Foods' dairy group, said: 'It is
an attempt to monopolise all available milk haulage beyond the end of the
scheme to create another substantial difficulty for organisations seeking to
contract directly with farmers in the free market.'
The board said it could not understand why the dairies were so upset, as the
contracts would be put up for tender at the end of 1994.
At the end of this month, the board will take over 23 milk delivery depots
from Dairy Crest. Haulage contracts from these depots will be put out to
tender by January 1994.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER 300 job cuts were announced yesterday at shipbuilders VSEL in
Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria.
In the past three years VSEL has cut its workforce steadily from 14,000. The
company has said it might have to reduce its workforce to 5,000 in spite of
its diversification programme.
The losses are in both manual and management areas and will take place
between now and December.
Mr Ray Davies, the personnel director, said the move was due to a
'continuing reduction in our Ministry of Defence workload, coupled with the
need to reduce costs to make us more competitive'.
He added that the losses - which will bring the workforce down to 6,500 -
were in line with those anticipated in the company's strategic plan.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Controversial shopping centre gets go-ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLEARANCE WAS finally given in the High Court yesterday for the
controversial Pounds 200m shopping centre at Dumplington on the banks of the
Manchester Ship Canal.
After eight years of takeover battles, planning inquiries, a dispute between
shareholders and legal wrangling eight local authorities failed in a
last-ditch attempt to overturn the government's go-ahead for the centre, in
Trafford Park, given last March.
They had argued the centre would affect town centre trade in Manchester,
Bury, Bolton, Oldham, Rochdale, Stockport, Tameside and Wigan.
The centre - to be developed by the Peel property group - is scheduled to
open in 1997. Peel is predicting it will create 6,000 construction and
retail jobs. The 300-acre site will house 129 shops, two superstores, a food
hall, restaurants, leisure facilities and parking for 2,000 cars.
Manchester's metrolink supertram system will be extended through Salford
Quays and Trafford Park to the centre, improving the region's public
transport infrastructure.
The centre's market will be the 7m population of north-west England, north
Wales and some of the west Midlands. Because the site is near five motorways
and one main trunk road, most people in the region will be able to get there
within 50 minutes.
The site's potential was the lure for the hostile takeover of Manchester
Ship Canal, the landowner, by Mr John Whittaker, Peel's chairman. He won
control in 1987 after two years but was then stalled by a series of public
inquiries and a dispute with the canal company's minority shareholders over
the land's potential value.
There were inquiries into three competing schemes for a retail centre in the
area. Further delays occurred over traffic forecasts and whether the M63
motorway would have to be widened.
A meeting last month approved the scheme for Peel to buy out minority
shareholders at Pounds 23 a share, plus a Pounds 7 loan note, redeemable for
Pounds 10.50 when the centre opens.
Yesterday's decision is expected to enhance the prospects of Peel, which is
now fully absorbing the ship canal into its own Stock Exchange quotation.
Peel's shares closed up 11p yesterday at 340p.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Price wars force Courage to shed 700 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COURAGE, the UK's second biggest brewer, is to shed 700 jobs during the next
18 months - casualties of the price wars between national brewers and other
competitive pressures on the industry.
Mr Nick Bryan, managing director of Courage, which is owned by Fosters
Brewing of Australia, said yesterday that the decision was 'regrettable . .
. but vital if we are to secure the long-term growth required for success in
the future.
'The UK brewing industry has become increasingly volatile and competitive
due to the cumulative effect of falling beer consumption, increased excise
duty, imports, and retailer concentration.'
Beer consumption has fallen by about 4 per cent during the past year, and
competition between brewers to supply the growing number of independent pubs
has intensified.
Courage has been one of the most aggressive contenders in a price war in
which discounts of up to 50 per cent of list prices have been offered.
Mr Bryan said profit margins had been squeezed so hard that insufficient
resources were being generated for the investment needed in beer brands and
customer service. 'We had no alternative but to cut our costs,' he added.
Resources released by the job cuts would enable the group to provide
stronger support for its brands, beginning with a market-ing programme next
year for Foster's lager and John Smith's bitter.
Courage said that its rationalisation programme would include management
delayering as well as reduction of head office services.
None of its five breweries - at Bristol, Reading, London, Halifax and
Tadcaster, in North Yorkshire - nor any of its 30 distribution depots would
be closed.
The company said that compulsory redundancies could not, however, be ruled
out, although it would redeploy as many as possible of those affected within
the business and would provide generous severance arrangements for those who
lost their jobs.
The TGWU general workers' union yesterday asked for an early meeting with
Courage's management, and shop stewards will meet, probably next week, to
discuss their response to the job cuts.
Mr Brian Revell, the union's national secretary for the drinks industry,
said: 'We will support our members in their resistance to these serious job
losses.' He added that the government must take part of the blame for the
damage done to the industry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry
and by the high levels of beer tax.
