FT  13 OCT 93 / People: NatWest bank appoints third deputy chairman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
National Westminster has restored to full strength its roster of three
non-executive deputy chairmen following the retirement of Tom Frost.
The bank has appointed Sir Sydney Lipworth QC, below, the former chairman of
the monopolies and mergers commission, and one of the founders of Allied
Dunbar in 1970.
NatWest's board has been slimmed down from over 30 members by its chairman
Lord Alexander since his own appointment in 1989. It now consists of 13
non-executives and seven executives. Lord Alexander said yesterday that Sir
Sydney would bring 'an invaluable perspective' as a practitioner and
regulator.
Sir Sydney, 62, joins two other knights, Edwin Nixon, the chairman of
Amersham International, and Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of
British Industry, as deputy chairmen of NatWest. He is joining the board
immediately following Tom Frost's retirement last month.
Like Lord Alexander, Sir Sydney is a barrister, whose legal training and
experience encouraged a no-nonsense approach at the Mergers and Monopolies
Commission, which he chaired between 1988 and April this year.
Besides being one of Allied Dunbar's founders, he was also its joint
managing director from 1980 to 1984, having previously helped form Liberty
Life in South Africa.

FT  13 OCT 93 / People: Lilliput board increases its size in float build-up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Anthony Simonds-Gooding has joined Lilliput, one of the UK's leading
producers of hand-painted, miniature collectable cottages, as a
non-executive director.
Lilliput, with a turnover of Pounds 13.5m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 2m
in 1992, plans to float on the London Stock Exchange in November.
Joining a miniature cottage-maker is perhaps an unexpected way for
Simonds-Gooding, right, to dip his toes back into public company waters; his
previous plc contacts were on a Brobdignagian rather than Lilliputian scale.
With Unilever for 13 years, he joined Whitbread in 1972, ending up group
managing director. 1985 saw him join Saatchi &amp; Saatchi as chairman and chief
executive; in 1987 he took on the same roles at British Sky Broadcasting,
until 1990. Since then, something of a quietus. He became chairman of the
Design and Art Directors' Association in May 1992.
Should his move to Lilliput be seen as a step towards much grander things?
Maybe. He describes Lilliput as a 'whizzy little company' and says that it
'intrigues' him; the company is involved in 'the business of brand
marketing, and I relish being part of that again.'
At 55 Simonds-Gooding is far from retirement, though he is at this stage a
little enigmatic: 'I am reviewing what I am about; watch this space.'

FT  13 OCT 93 / People: Lancer rides off with new chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lancer Boss Group, the Leighton Buzzard-based lift truck manufacturer, has
strengthened its senior management by going outside the industrial truck
industry to appoint Ludwig Schneider as its first group chief executive.
The appointment is an important move for Lancer Boss, one of Britain's
biggest privately-owned manufacturing companies.
Lancer Boss is 100 per cent owned by Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw, the chairman,
and his brother Trevor Bowman-Shaw, vice-chairman.
Schneider's appointment to the company is the clearest sign yet that Boss is
preparing the ground for a new generation of management, 35 years after the
two brothers founded the company.
Sir Neville, who is 63, has previously combined the chairman and chief
executive's roles, but will now concentrate on broad strategic issues as
chairman.
Sir Neville, said the matching of senior management skills to one of the
most modern, comprehensive and internationally attractive product ranges
would give the group the 'drive and management resource it needs well into
the next century.'
Boss said Schneider would bring his wide experience in the automotive and
related industries in Europe and elsewhere. Schneider is in his mid-40s and
holds German and Brazilian nationality.
Besides his automotive experience, Schneider has also held senior positions
with major consumer goods companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Grants urged for forest scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS TO develop a 200 sq mile National Forest in central England were
greeted with scepticism yesterday by landowners, farmers and industrialists,
who said substantial government finance would be needed for such a scheme.
The government, which yesterday launched a three-month consultation process
on the forest in conjunction with the Countryside Commission, said it could
not guarantee any public funds would be available.
It will examine the viability of planting 30m trees to create a wooded
landscape across parts of Staffordshire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire.
Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, said: 'The government will not decide
what, if any, its contribution will be until completion of the consultation
period.'
His comments were criticised by the Country Landowners Association and
National Farmers Union. Both said that farmers could not comply with the
draft strategy for the National Forest, also published yesterday, if it
meant they were expected to convert arable land to forestry without any
promise of grant aid.
Expectations that industry will pay for the forestation of disused workings
were also criticised. Mr Stephen Hardy, group property manager of Ibstock
Johnson, a brick manufacturer in the area, told Mr Yeo: 'There has to be a
firm financial commitment from the government.'
The Countryside Commission said it was confident that the proposals would go
ahead.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Charities defend campaigning role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS to abolish charitable status and to split Britain's voluntary
sector into service-delivery and campaigning charities, were attacked
yesterday by charity leaders.
The proposals are contained in a report by three former advisers to the Home
Office Voluntary Services Unit. Although the report is not official policy,
it is published and partly funded by the Home Office, and is based on one of
the most extensive studies of the sector for 45 years.
The report argues that charities providing welfare services under public
contracts can no longer be regarded as conventional voluntary organisations.
It says the sector should be divided into service and campaigning
organisations.
Ms Judy Weleminsky, director of the National Council for Voluntary
Organisations, the sector's umbrella body, said the proposal was 'simplistic
and destructive'.
Mr Fred Heddell, chief executive of Mencap, the leading charitable provider
of residential services for the mentally handicapped, said that the size and
Pounds 60m turnover of his organisation brought 'power and political
influence' which were vital in campaigning on behalf of disabled people.
He said that if campaigning and service provision were split, much of
Mencap's effectiveness would be lost.
'At a time when statutory services are failing to meet so many of the needs
of people with a disability, it is irres-ponsible to make proposals which,
if implemented, would throw the organisations that provide so much of the
limited care available into structural turmoil,' said Mr Heddell.
The government intends to study the report before reaching any conclusions.
Mr Alun Michael, a Labour spokesman on home affairs, welcomed this cautious
approach but said that splitting the sector would be 'bad in principle and
dangerous in practice'.
He said the government had shown 'unhealthy' signs of wanting to control the
voluntary sector.
A forum on the social economy organised in London yesterday by Unity Trust
Bank agreed there was a need for a formal structure in which non-profit
organisations could exchange ideas and information.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Getting to work on a more attractive profile: Michael
Cassell meets a top executive taking time out to rid manufacturing of its
'slummy image'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS CHIEF executive of Allied-Lyons, one of Britain's biggest food and drink
groups, Mr Tony Hales is a busy man; not too busy, however, to place himself
at the head of an ambitious mission to restore the image and performance of
manufacturing industry.
Today, Mr Hales 45, will preside over his first meeting as chairman of the
Confederation of British Industry's National Manufacturing Council, set up
nearly two years' ago to spread best practice in management, build new
partnerships with government and the City and give industry a more
attractive profile. The post is for two years and, by the end of it, he
wants to be able to demonstrate that UK competitiveness has improved to the
point where industry can show some real manufacturing leadership in Europe.
He also wants to see the beginning of the end of industry's 'dirty, slummy'
image, promoting it back up the list of respectable professions.
A trifle ambitious?: 'I have to believe that hopes of real improvement are
realistic or I might as well pack up and go home.'
But can the National Manufacturing Council, bringing together nearly 60
executives from every corner of industry, prove anything more than a
high-powered talking shop?: 'It certainly will be a rather unusual meeting
to chair', he concedes. 'But it is more a question of the individual
initiatives pursued by the various sub-groups set up to tackle separate
issues. In that respect, we are making progress'.
At its annual conference next month, the CBI will launch its Competitiveness
Forum programme, to help companies improve performance in areas such as
innovation, marketing and manufacturing.
Mr Hales acknowledges that manufacturing has acquired a new political
priority and that government, led by the Department of Trade and Industry -
'we used to call it the department of trade interference' - is gradually
proving more supportive. 'It has been impressed by structured argument put
forward on behalf of manufacturing but we have to keep banging away at the
same themes across government.'
But though he has demands of government to help improve the chances of a
strong, sustained manufacturing revival - 'above all, a stable macroeconomic
climate' - he stresses that the solutions lie primarily with industry
itself. 'It is too easy to say everything wrong with British industry is the
fault of government. We have to get on and be very much more professional
managers ourselves.' Mr Hales says productivity is improving, labour
relations are good and Britain can offer a flexible, well-trained workforce
which should not be constrained by the 'bureaucracy of Brussels'.
Most worryingly, corporate investment is not improving. He therefore wants
the institutions to be more imaginative in providing financing and he
believes the government has a clear and pressing role to play in this
respect. 'It is crunch time for Kenneth Clarke, who has said he wants to be
remembered for what he did to help commerce and manufacturing. He has used
the right language; now he has to deliver.'
A Budget priority must be extra investment incentives, particularly for
small and medium-sized companies. 'Not enough has been done on tax breaks to
help stimulate investment in growing businesses. Dividends have been treated
more favourably than investment. The invitation to consume rather than to
invest has proved harmful. Attitudes have to change.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Council of Building Material Producers says that imports are
rising as the rate of growth of export markets shows signs of weakening.
The council's six-month survey of about 2,000 producers - 28 per cent of
companies in the sector - found imports accounted for more than 10 per cent
of the market compared with 20 per cent of companies six months ago. Nearly
half of UK producers had seen exports rise in the past six months as a
proportion of total sales. But 10 per cent had seen their export ratio
decline.
Mr Nigel Chaldecott, director-general, said members were worried about next
month's Budget. 'Cuts in capital spending projects or further increases in
taxation will knock the tentative recovery currently under way,' he said.

The Association of British Travel Agents said Sea-sun had been a member

holidays and return travel would be met from a bond. Holidays due to start
from or after today had been cancelled and the money would be refunded.

A MIDLANDS local authority was last night at the centre of a fraud inquiry
following the arrest of one of its senior executives. Mr Geoff Wilson, chief
planning officer at Warwick district council, was arrested after a year-long
police inquiry, Tim Burt writes.
Warwick police said the inquiry involved planning applications for housing
and industrial developments. Serving councillors, former councillors and
officials will also be questioned.
Mr Wilson, one of the longest-serving chief planning officers in the
country, was arrested at the headquarters of the Tory-led council. Police
sealed off the building's first-floor planning offices and removed a large
number of documents.
It emerged yesterday that Mr Tony Dalton, leader of the council's Tory
group, had been helping with the investigation for more than a year.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Prisons inquiry chief attacks Howard proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT proposals to get tough on crime are 'short-sighted and
irresponsible' says Lord Woolf, who conducted the official inquiry into the
1990 riots at Strangeways and other prisons.
Last night he told an audience of prison service chiefs, politicians, senior
police officers and churchmen that policies of imprisoning greater numbers
of people had a 'miserable record of failure'. Cramming more people into a
prison system already under acute pressure could lead to further riots.
Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, last week announced wide-ranging
proposals to crack-down on crime and acknowledged that his plans were likely
to increase the prison population.
Lord Woolf said: 'The cost of prisons to the public is heavy and only
justified when there really is no alternative.' The new prisons would cost
hundreds of millions of pounds to build and more than Pounds 66m a year to
run and yet the system would still be overcrowded. He called for more
resources for community punishments and crime prevention.
He proposed legalising some drugs in controlled circumstances so addicts
would no longer need to commit crime to feed their addiction. He also called
for fines on people who did not take steps to protect their property.

FT  13 OCT 93 / HarperCollins may report Mirror to police
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARPERCOLLINS, publisher of Baroness Thatcher's memoirs, intends to report
the Daily Mirror to the police because it believes that a criminal offence
may have been committed in connection with publication of unauthorised
extracts in the paper. Mr David Banks, editor, may also be reported.
A version of the book, The Downing Street Years, complete with accurate
quotations, appeared in the left-of-centre daily newspaper last week in
advance of the official serialisation in The Sunday Times.
The publisher took elaborate security precautions to protect the book,
advised by former senior policeman Mr John Stalker.
HarperCollins believes the loss of information, whether it was in the form
of a copy, a computer disc or waste pages from the printing process,
involved theft. HarperCollins believes that the Daily Mirror and Mr Banks
might be guilty of an offence in receiving such information.
Mr Banks said yesterday: 'I don't know if the book was stolen. If there was
a book stolen it was not used here. We have been very careful all along.'
He added: 'I have never had a complete copy of the work in any form. This is
like a murder inquiry without a corpse.'
HarperCollins paid Pounds 3.5m including serialisation rights for the book,
which is to be published on Monday.
The Sunday Times failed last week to get an injunction preventing the Daily
Mirror publishing material from the book on the grounds that publication was
in the public interest. The Sunday Times may now sue the Mirror for damages
over the publication of the material.
Action is likely to be taken against The Mail on Sunday for alleged contempt
of court. On Friday Sir David Napley, acting for Lady Thatcher, obtained a
High Court injunction preventing the paper from publishing material from the
her memoirs. The action followed rumours that the paper was about to publish
extracts.
HarperCollins believes that the material published by the Mail on Sunday
amounted to a breach of that injunction.
Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, yesterday defended to the
European Commission the UK's decision to license Mr Ted Turner's new
European satellite channel, the combined TNT/Cartoon Network.
The channel has been banned from cable television networks in France and
Belgium because of its American content.
It is believed the commission has written to the French and Belgian
governments asking why Mr Turner's channel is being blocked.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Minister agrees to study CBI demands on policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TIM SAINSBURY, the industry minister, said yesterday the government would
give serious consideration to a call by the Confed-eration of British
Industry for a white paper setting out its industrial objectives for the
recovery.
Responding to CBI demands for a more 'co-ordinated and coherent policy', Mr
Sainsbury said the government's main objective in industrial policy was to
maintain low inflation and steady growth.
'The overriding need to keep inflation down means that we will have to take
tough and unpopular decisions on public spending and taxation,' he told
business leaders in Birmingham last night. The CBI's call on ministers to
publish industrial objectives comes against a background of government
efforts to develop a new partnership with business.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, told the dinner of industrialists
that he was not calling for the old industrial strategy of picking 'winners
and losers'.
Instead, he said he is seeking a middle approach between old-fashioned
intervention and a minimalist government role towards industry.
Businessmen need to hear what government industrial policy is, he argued, in
order to understand how it affects ministerial decisions towards public
spending and taxation.
His call to Mr Sainsbury follows the CBI's publication yesterday of a new
policy document. The document said industrialists 'are not convinced that
the current structure of decision-making in government is ideally suited to
the creation of a coherent approach to competitiveness'.
The paper concludes by calling on the government to take a more direct role
in representing the interests of British industry in Europe and other
markets. Mr Sainsbury, meanwhile, said the government had already pursued
that role through its increased commitment to export promotion.
He said that over the past 18 months the government had increased the extent
of export credit cover by Pounds 2bn.

inquiry into the 1990 riots at Strangeways and other prisons, Alan Pike
writes.
Policies of imprisoning greater numbers of people, he said, had a 'miserable
record of failure.' He warned that cramming more people into a prison system
already under acute pressure could lead to further riots.
Lord Woolf's comments in a London lecture were in contrast to those of Mr
Michael Howard, home secretary, at the Conservative Party conference last
week. Mr Howard announced wide-ranging proposals to crack down on crime and
said his plans were likely to increase the prison population.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Coal chief pessimistic on pits' future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL CLARKE, British Coal chairman, said yesterday he was pessimistic
about saving any of the pits selected for closure a year ago.
The fears extend beyond the 12 mines reprieved in March after a public
outcry. Pit managers believe some of the 19 'core pits' which have never
been earmarked in public for closure are also vulnerable.
A delegation from the Trades Union Congress will tomorrow meet Mr Tim Eggar,
energy minister, to press him to halt pit closures and extend redundancy
arrangements for miners beyond December 31. The unions are arguing for a
'balanced energy policy making full use of all resources'.
British Coal has closed 21 pits since March, but still operates 30. Industry
analysts believe the market can sustain fewer than 15.
British Coal is keen to win ministerial approval to start the closure
programme at one or two pits.
Depending on the reaction, other closures are expected to follow in the
following months. The option of closing a large number of pits
simultaneously has been ruled out.
Mr Steve Tulley, an official of the National Union of Mineworkers at the
Frickley pit in the Yorkshire region, said miners at his pit believed
closure was inevitable. He said: 'It is worth fighting for but the will is
not there in the industry. We are totally demoralised.'
Since the white paper in March, the coal industry's problems have been
exacerbated by a better-than-expected performance from nuclear power
stations and an acceleration in gas-fired generation. The two largest
generating companies have indicated they are unlikely to take substantial
amounts of coal in this financial year, ending next March, in addition to
the amount they have agreed to take. Almost 1m tonnes of coal is being
stockpiled at pitheads each month to add to the 14m held by British Coal and
the generators' 36m.
Some 20,400 mineworkers and 2,100 white-collar staff have taken redundancy
since October, leaving just 30,100 workers in an industry which once
employed more than 1m. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary,
said the government had not tackled the 'rigged market' in electricity
against coal.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Radio 5 plans are condemned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDEPENDENT radio industry yesterday attacked the BBC's plans to replace
Radio 5 with a news and sport format, saying it would limit the choice
available to those applying for the third national commercial licence, to be
based mainly on speech.
Mr Stewart Francis, chairman of the AIRC, the industry trade body, said:
'News and sport was the last great format.' He added that the BBC should
have to make 'promises of performance', and stick to them.
His comments came as the BBC set out its evidence for its belief that sport
and news can co-exist on the new Pounds 30m national radio network which
will replace Radio 5 next April.
Mr Phil Harding, taskforce leader for the new network, provided the research
evidence that sunk the concept of a 24-hour news network on Radio 4 longwave
and instead persuaded the BBC governors to go for the new network - its
motto is 'first and live'.
Mr Harding, a former editor of Radio 4's Today programme, told of the
detailed plans drawn up to demonstrate how the new network would have coped
with the evening of September 21.
The evening combined a heavy football programme with President Boris Yeltsin
dissolving the Russian parliament.
The new network would have managed to 'cover' the events in Moscow, handle
60 minutes of the Huddersfield v Arsenal match while still being no more
than 2 minutes away from announcing all 65 goals scored that evening.
The new BBC news and sport service will be broadcast on medium wave 909 and
693, and will cost Pounds 30.2m a year to run, compared with Radio 5's cost
of Pounds 23.7m. About 75 jobs will be lost at Radio 5, although all of
those involved will be interviewed for jobs resulting from the new service.
Children's programmes will be the main losers in the shake-up. About 200
hours of stories and drama are broadcast for children each year on Radio 4.
This is being reduced to 75 hours.
Primary schools programmes will move to Radio 3 FM in the afternoons, youth
programmes will move to Radio 1, and Open University coverage will go to
Radio 4 longwave.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Red tape 'slows genetic research'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXCESSIVE regulations covering genetic engineering are handicapping the
biotechnology industry, the Lords science and technology committee says
today.
The committee's report on biotechnology says the regulatory regime is based
on an 'obsolete' view of the hazards of genetic engineering. It calls for
urgent government action to streamline the UK regulations and to relax the
European Community directives on which the regulations are based.
The report says the rules are 'bureaucratic, costly and time-consuming and
is an unnecessary burden to academic researchers and industry alike'.
The Lords found that regulations were simpler and less demanding in some
Continental countries, notably France and Belgium, which interpreted the EC
directives less stringently, and the US and Japan.
The report says that whatever the nature of a genetically modified organism
 -be it a lethal virus or a harmless plant - a UK researcher faces a
'bureaucratic nightmare', and has to answer 89 standard questions and pay
Pounds 1,800 for each release. US researchers face nine questions, no fee
and a faster procedure, said Lord Howie of Troon, who chaired the
subcommittee that drew up the biotechnology report.
The BioIndustry Association, the trade body for UK biotechnology companies,
welcomed the report and urged the government to implement its
recommendations.
Dr Peter Doyle, research director of bioscience company Zeneca, agreed that
'the current regulatory regime is outdated, unscientific, fails to
discriminate in terms of the level of real risk, and is an unnecessary
burden to academic researchers and industry alike'.
But the industry's opponents expressed outrage. Dr David King of the
Genetics Forum, an environmental pressure group, said: 'It is completely
irresponsible to say that the current regulatory regime needs to be
relaxed.'
He added: 'We have no hard evidence that regulation is affecting the
competitiveness of the biotechnology industry - just unsupported
assertions.'
Ms Sue Mayer, science director of Greenpeace UK, said: 'It is rather
alarming that the environment has been set aside in the interests of the
industry.'

FT  13 OCT 93 / Fears on 'phantom' cash withdrawals dismissed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW ORLEANS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXTENT of so-called phantom withdrawals and fraud from cash machines has
been exaggerated, according to Halifax building society's senior lawyer.
A well-publicised High Court class action launched against Barclays Bank and
other card issuers had fuelled public fears about the safety of automatic
telling machines (ATMs), Mr Christopher Jowett told the International Bar
Association in New Orleans yesterday.
Since the adoption of the banking code of practice last year limiting
customers' liability to Pounds 50 and placing the burden of proving fraud on
the card-issuer, banks had been paying out on phantom withdrawal claims more
regularly. But it was easy to exaggerate the size of the problem.
Halifax has just under 3m cards on issue, handling 130m transactions a year.
Last year there were more than 1,000 alleged phantom withdrawals involving
Pounds 238,000. Halifax payed out in 334 cases, refunding Pounds 69,000.
Mr Jowett said that, in reality, there was no such thing as a phantom
withdrawal. Fraud lay at the heart of most un-explained automatic
transactions.
There was, however, a need to reassure the public about the security of ATM
systems.
Banks and building societies had to take steps to ensure opportunities for
fraud, particularly inside banks, were cut to a minimum.
He said public confidence in the integrity of card transactions could only
be maintained by improving methods of card authentication and card
verification.
There had been some discussion in the UK about the use of personal
identification numbers (PINs) at the point of sale for credit card and debit
card transactions.
But UK card issuers were extremely concerned about the risk of PIN numbers
being compromised, said Mr Jowett.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Dublin welcomes approach to Sinn Fein
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT of the Irish Republic yesterday welcomed statements from a
leading Unionist in Northern Ireland that Sinn Fein, the political wing of
the IRA, might be accepted at the negotiating table.
Speaking on Irish radio, the Rev Martin Smyth, Ulster Unionist MP for South
Belfast, said that if Sinn Fein delivered a genuine cessation of violence in
Northern Ireland the Ulster Unionists would give Sinn Fein 'the recognition
that they are a bona fide political party and have a right to take part in a
political process, representing those who vote for them . . . It is not a
question of saying we'll give you this or give you that, that is a matter
for discussion when they come (to the negotiating table)'.
He also said in an earlier interview with the BBC that Sinn Fein should
recognise unionist rights to be part of the UK. Mr Albert Reynolds, the
Irish prime minister, described Mr Smyth's comments as 'positive and
constructive' and added: 'It has always been my view that a cessation of
violence would radically transform the situation.'
The Irish government continues to guard its silence however regarding the
content of the peace initiative launched two weeks ago by Mr Gerry Adams,
Sinn Fein leader, and Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and
Labour party. After receiving a briefing on the initiative last week from Mr
John Hume, Mr Reynolds said the initiative would be evaluated by the Irish
cabinet next Tuesday.
After yesterday's cabinet meeting however, the Dublin government said only
that 'evaluation is ongoing' and gave no indication whether any proposals
are about to made to the British government.
The Hume-Adams initiative appears to be driving a wedge into Unionist ranks,
with the Democratic Unionist party reacting angrily to the latest UUP
position.
Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the DUP said: 'Since Sunningdale (the
1973 conference which established an ill-fated power sharing executive
without the DUP), no deeper wound has been inflicted upon unionism than
this.' He said the UUP position was 'an act of monumental folly'.

FT  13 OCT 93 / No opt-out from works councils: Robert Taylor explains how
EC rules may hit 300 British companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ISOLATION of Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, over the European
Community works council directive was disclosed at yesterday's meeting of EC
social affairs ministers in Luxembourg.
While the other 11 EC member states have signalled their intention to push
ahead with the directive after November 1, Britain was excluded from the
discussion.
But when the directive comes into force, British private companies, who
employ more than a 1,000 workers elsewhere in the EC, will have to introduce
a works council for their continental employees.
Employees working in UK-based subsidiaries of large Continental companies
can also expect to participate in Europe-wide works councils.
Last night Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, said the UK government had
'lost the argument' over the issue. 'The works council directive will sooner
or later apply in Britain,' he said. 'The era of the British veto is over.
This is good news for British workers and the whole country.'
At the moment there are an estimated 30 European works councils at large
companies, none of them UK-owned.
The number will grow when the directive comes into force to an estimated
1,000: all those which have head offices in EC; which employ more than 1,000
people; and which have subsidiaries with at least 100 employees in at least
one other member state.
A third of these are UK companies, and they include British
Telecommunications, Grand Metropolitan, Barclays Bank, Thorn EMI, Royal
Dutch Shell, Imperial Chemical Industries and Unilever.
The proposed European works councils will not be involved directly in
collective bargaining. Their purpose is to provide a forum for employees in
European transnational companies to receive information and consultation on
their business activities.
British union leaders do not see how these companies would be able to
insulate their UK operations from the effects of the directive. Enormous
pressure would be exerted on them to allow their UK workers to be involved
in the works council system as well.
A survey published last weekend by Industrial Relations Services found that
half the UK companies surveyed did not believe a European works council
would add to their costs.
But Britain's employer organisations can be expected to resist change
strongly. The Confederation of British Industry has been at the forefront of
the battle to oppose the works council directive.
The question is whether Britain's employers will find themselves, like their
country's government, isolated from their colleagues on the Continent over
the issue.

<TEXT>
ELI LILLY, the US pharmaceuticals group, is to cut 275 UK jobs in its
international rationalisation programme. The redundancies, which will be
voluntary, cut across all levels and categories.
They will be concentrated at Speke near Liverpool where 107 of the 834 staff
will leave, and Basingstoke in Hampshire where 112 out of 650 employees will
go. Research staff at Windlesham, Surrey, will be reduced by about 30.
The UK subsidiary, employing 2,100 staff, had a turnover last year of Pounds
224m with overseas sales worth Pounds 132m.
There will also be cuts in the 35 staff at the European headquarters in
London, while the Vienna office, which handles east Europe, will be scaled
back. The group said it was still committed to Europe.
Earlier this week, the Indianapolis-based parent company announced it was
cutting 2,000 jobs, equivalent to 10 per cent of its worldwide workforce.
Last year the group turned in its first quarterly loss of Dollars 268.5m.
The deficit reflected mainly restructuring and other charges of Dollars
519.6m. Northern Ireland Electricity, the former public utility which was
privatised in June, is to shed 600 jobs in the next three years.
The redundancies, announced yesterday, will affect management and manual
workers in all areas of the company except the shops which sell electrical
appliances.

CARMAKERS Toyota and Renault have both fallen foul of the Advertising
Standards Authority over the way they have advertised the speed of their
cars, according to the latest report on complaints made to the authority
published today, Diane Summers writes.
The authority said it had received fewer complaints about car advertisements
following its clampdown in 1990.
However, the authority said there had been a 'blip a couple of months ago'
as some manufacturers 'appeared to be returning to speed as an advertising
platform'.
It said that the text of the Toyota national press advertisement for the MR2
GT (above) 'placed too great an emphasis on fast and possibly unsafe
driving'.
A complaint against a Renault Clio advertisement showing a car on a race
track ahead of a Formula One racing car was also upheld.

LOCAL government employers yesterday announced a 1.4 per cent pay rise for
firefighters under their wage formula, ending the threat of a strike this
autumn, Robert Taylor writes.
The settlement is lower than the government's 1.5 per cent public-sector pay
limit and adds Pounds 4.50 to the present Pounds 305 a week basic rate of
firefighters.
The Fire Brigades Union had been warning of conflict if the pay formula that
links their members' pay to the upper quartile of male manual earnings was
not honoured.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Managers' pay 'accelerating'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGERS' pay is accel-erating, a survey published today shows.
The survey by P-E International, the management consultants, shows the
median annual increase is 3.5 per cent. This compares with a 25-year low of
3 per cent at the beginning of the year.
The survey, which covers nearly 700 companies across 18 sectors, shows that
managers have fared better than the workforce in general, where basic salary
increases have levelled off at about 2.6 per cent.
Mr Simon McBride, P-E consultant, said there were a number of factors,
including inflation, which would influence salaries in 1994.
He said companies would need to consider the effect of a further year of low
pay increases on their ability to retain highly regarded managers. Also
important was the uncertainty of recovery in continental Europe and the
continued fears over job security.
The number of managers receiving no pay increase over the 12 months to July
was still one-in-10.
However, the number of directors whose wages were frozen had increased - 21
per cent of managing directors and 13 per cent of other directors received
no increase compared with 14 per cent and 11 per cent respectively over the
12 months to July 1992.
Average base salary increases for managing directors were highest in sectors
such as textiles, and food, drink and tobacco.

FT  13 OCT 93 / MoD unions seek Devonport talks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN URGENT meeting with ministers is being sought by Ministry of Defence
unions following Friday's announcement of 500 redundancies at Devonport
naval dockyard in Plymouth, Devon.
Mr Jack Dromey, chairman of the group of MoD industrial unions, said
yesterday that when the government awarded the Trident submarine refitting
contract to Devonport in June, ministers had promised job losses of no more
than 350.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Unions at Ford to demand jobs for life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DEMAND for 'jobs for life' will be made today when unions representing
Ford's 20,000 manual workers present their annual claim.
Mr Tony Woodley, TGWU general union negotiator for the car industry, hinted
yesterday that the unions are prepared to negotiate on the introduction of
multi-skilling for Ford workers in return for a guarantee of employment
security.
But it was unclear last night whether the other unions at Ford, notably the
AEEU engineering and electricians' union, will support this position.
In spite of the recession Ford has managed to avoid any compulsory
redundancies and has cut its workforce through natural wastage and voluntary
severance. But union leaders are concerned that the company may not be able
to continue this policy.
'Our top priority in these negotiations will be job security,' said Mr
Woodley. He added that the unions at Ford wanted only what had been achieved
at other UK-based car plants such as Rover, Nissan, Honda and Toyota.
The unions will also be seeking a 'substantial' increase in basic wage rates
for manual workers.
'Ford UK has a world-class workforce with the lowest labour costs in
Europe,' said Mr Woodley. 'We want to see them have the same wages and job
protection that the best has to offer.' He added that only Peugeot Talbot
paid lower basic wage rates than Ford among car companies in the UK.
The unions want Ford to drop what they see as its piecemeal approach to
workplace change and take a more comprehensive view of what needs to be
done.
'If they want to compete with the best, the company must provide job
protection to its employees so they can deliver the goods,' said Mr Woodley.
The company is expected to respond to the manual unions' claim when they
meet again on October 28.
Vauxhall shop stewards at Ellesmere Port on Merseyside have rejected the
company's last two-year pay offer. The unions will decide next week whether
to ballot Vauxhall's 9,000 workers for strike action.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Redundancies at NI Electricity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Ireland Electricity, the former public utility which was privatised
in June, is to shed 600 jobs in the next three years.
The redundancies, announced yesterday, will affect management and manual
workers in all areas of the company except the shops which sell electrical
appliances.
Discussions have already started with the trade unions.
The company said: 'We are operating in a new environment and part of the
redundancy programme has already been discussed in the context of
reorganisation.'
The utility's privatisation began in April last year when the province's
four power stations were sold.
The transmission, distribution and supply side of the business were sold in
a public flotation in June.
More than 600,000 applications for shares were received with the initial
price set at Pounds 1 a share with a further Pounds 1 instalment payable
next June.
Turnover and operating profits for 1992-93 were Pounds 452.4m and Pounds
56.6m respectively.
Around 500 people have already left the company since the power stations
were sold and a further 600 will reduce total employment to around 2,600.
Many employees have long service records and are likely to be attracted by
an enhanced redundancy package.
Management said customers would not expect the company to unnecessarily add
costs to services. The job losses were part of a long-term plan aimed at
stabilising prices, it said.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Lloyd's faces race against time to settle out of court:
Floodgates may open now Names have been told they can sue agents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S JUDGMENT in the Commercial Court that Lloyd's Names can sue the
agents who handled their affairs has underlined the importance of efforts by
Lloyd's of London to reach out-of-court settlements.
Mr David Rowland, the chairman of Lloyd's, hopes to offer Names a deal
before the end of the year. But if he fails to come up with an acceptable
offer, Names - the individuals whose assets support the market - are now
free to go ahead with their actions. Mr Justice Saville's court ruling means
that members' agents are potentially liable for millions of pounds of
losses.
Several thousand Names are involved in actual or possible legal action.
Almost all have targeted members' agents - as well as the managing agents
who administered their syndicates - as defendants.
The first case to go ahead - on 26 April next year - involves 3,000 Names,
who were members of four Gooda Walker syndicates (numbers 164, 290, 298 and
299) between 1988 and 1990. The Names allege negligent underwriting and are
seeking more than Pounds 550m in damages from 71 Lloyd's members' agencies.
In October Mr Saville will hear a case brought by 1,650 Names, who were
members of Feltrim syndicates 540/542 and 847 between 1988 and 1989. Feltrim
Names are also suing for negligent underwriting, targetting 60 agencies, 59
of which are members' agencies in an effort to recover up to Pounds 600m in
losses.
A third large case could come to court early in 1995. Some 2,000 Names on
Merrett syndicate 418 are taking legal action against 130 members' agents,
the Merrett managing agency, the syndicate's auditors, Ernst Whinney, and Mr
Stephen Merrett, the syndicate's underwriter, over losses registered in the
1985 year. The claim is estimated at about Pounds 350m.
At least four smaller groups of Names also have actions that are well
advanced:
A case involving more than 320 Names on Pulbrook syndicate 334 in 1985
should come to court in December this year. The Names face losses of at
least Pounds 80m. 310 Names on another Pulbrook syndicate, number 90, have
served writs on 12 members' agents, the Pulbrook managing agency and
Winchester Bowring, a firm of insurance brokers. They are taking action to
obtain compensation for losses that could exceed Pounds 225m. Writs have
also been served in an action by 470 Names, who were members of Poland
syndicates 105 (in 1985 and 1986) and 108 (in 1985 and 1986). The Names are
suing members' agents and the Poland managing agency and seek to recover
more than Pounds 80m.
More than 30 members of the Oakeley Vaughan syndicates between 1981 and 1983
are suing Lloyd's over its failure to regulate the market. Their case, which
was lost in the Commercial Court, comes to appeal in February next year.
Other Names who have formed action groups and who are at various stages of
legal action include 850 Names on Bromley 475; 1,000 Names on Cuthbert Heath
404; 1,000 Names on Devonshire 216, 527, 833, 1137; 490 Names on Gresham
321; 861 Names on King 745; 850 Names on Rose Thomson Young 255; and 600
Names on Wellington syndicates 406 and 448.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Ministers act to end rail revolt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT headed off another revolt by Tory backbench peers against the
Railways Bill last night by promising to consider providing additional
legislative safeguards for British Rail's 130,000 pensioners.
Ministerial assurances that a new pension fund to be established after
privatisation would not be allowed to become insolvent, and that benefits
would be index-linked, failed to satisfy critics of the bill. They were led
by Lord Peyton of Yeovil, former Conservative transport minister, who moved
the amendment permitting British Rail to apply for franchises to operate
passenger services on which the government was defeated in July.
Lord Peyton was strongly supported by Lord Marsh, the cross-bench peer and
former chairman of BR, when he insisted that guarantees covering solvency
and index-linking should be written in. They were unimpressed by claims by
the Earl of Caithness, transport minister, that the government had gone '85
per cent of the way' on their concerns.
Lord Peyton maintained that by enshrining guarantees in the bill, the
government would be able to remove a 'residue of suspicion and ill-will'
among BR pensioners. He finally agreed not to move an amendment seeking to
achieve this objective pending the outcome of further talks with ministers.
But Lord Peyton warned that unless they reached a satisfactory conclusion he
would move a similar amendment at the next stage of the bill.
In an effort to avert a further setback for privatisation, Mr John
MacGregor, transport secretary, and Mr Roger Freeman, a transport minister,
are to meet Tory backbenchers who want BR to be allowed to bid for
franchises.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Fresh Conservative battle threatened on Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservative party's deep divisions over the European Community
re-emerged yesterday as pro- and anti-EC MPs threatened a fresh battle in
the wake of Maastricht. Rightwing Euro-sceptics said they were disappointed
by the German constitutional court's decision to allow Germany to ratify the
treaty.
Sir Teddy Taylor, the rightwing MP for Southend East, said the government
would face a further fight over a bill to increase British contributions to
EC finances. Enough MPs were willing to vote against the government to block
the bill, which implements revisions to the EC budget agreed at last year's
Edinburgh summit, he added.
The threat of a further battle indicates that the right has not been
mollified by the sceptical tone of recent government comments on Europe.
Ministers believe there is little prospect of defeat on the bill, which will
be introduced in the next session of parliament beginning next month.
But senior ministers concede that the rightward shift in government rhetoric
has prompted 'rumblings' of discontent among previously loyal MPs on the
centre and left.
Pro-Europe MPs were annoyed by anti-EC passages in speeches delivered at
last week's Conservative conference by Mr Peter Lilley, social security
secretary, Mr David Hunt, employment secretary and Mr Michael Howard, home
secretary.
Sir Edward Heath, former prime minister, said the speeches showed a 'very
nasty nationalistic approach' which was 'childish and stupid'.
He said pro-Europe MPs planned 'a major fightback' against the right, and
urged Mr John Major, the prime minister, to ignore 'the people who criticise
us in our own ranks'.
He said pro-Europe MPs had helped the government by remaining silent during
the passage of Maastricht bill. He warned: 'We are not going to stay silent
any longer.'
Labour yesterday tried to exploit Tory divisions over Europe by publishing a
list of 24 Conservative MEPs who voted for a European parliament motion
supporting a federal EC.
Leading rightwingers, including Lord Tebbit, have said they will decline to
campaign for federalist candidates in the European parliament elections next
June.
Mr Michael Portillo, the rightwing chief secretary to the Treasury, said on
Sunday that federalist MEPs should be deselected.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Councils shake-up 'will cost Pounds 1.1bn'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONFLICT between councils over the local government review intensified
yesterday as counties claimed that transitional costs of restructuring would
be Pounds 1.1bn.
Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, announced last month that he
favoured replacing two-tier authorities with unitary authorities, even if
this incurred extra cost.
But Mr Dennis Pettitt, chairman of the Labour-controlled Association of
County Councils, said that the government had already said that there is not
likely to be more money for local government next year.
The association's evidence came in a formal submission to the environment
department. Using estimates which have been independently validated, it
found that the costs of the restructuring had been underestimated, and
predicted an average cost of Pounds 27.2m for each county.
District councils, claimed that polls in three counties where plans for
reform have been published - Durham, Derbyshire and Cleveland - showed that
most voters wanted unitary authorities to replace the two-tier system.
Voters in Durham and Derbyshire indicated that retaining the two-tier status
quo was their favourite option. But the Labour-led Association of District
Councils pointed out that a separate question yielded majorities for unitary
authorities in Cleveland and Derbyshire.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Tory MPs fight to stop further defence cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY BACKBENCHERS will next week launch an attempt to stop further deep cuts
in defence spending in the drive to meet public spending targets for the
next three years.
Several Tory MPs are expected to use a two-day Commons debate on this year's
defence white paper to say the armed forces are already stretched.
This will follow the publication on Monday of a report by the Commons
defence committee which is expected to be critical of some of the the white
paper's plans.
Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Conservative chairman of the committee, said this week
he was 'extremely alarmed' by reports that more defence cuts might be in the
offing.
This new expression of backbench discontent follows clashes between Mr
Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, and the Treasury over demands for
billions of pounds of additional cuts from the Pounds 23.5bn defence budget.
Mr Rifkind is demanding a full-scale review of the armed forces if the
Treasury refuses to drop its demands.
Even if he beats off all the Treasury's demands, defence spending is set to
drop by 1995-96 to its lowest level as a proportion of Britain's gross
domestic product for decades.
Though the white paper contained a series of new cuts, some long-awaited
measures were put off. These may now be examined by EDX, the cabinet
committee charged with sharing out the spending cake. They include plans for
an air-launched nuclear missile and a decision on whether to upgrade
existing tanks or buy more Vickers Challenger 2s.
MoD pension payments have been outside the public spending control total
from April. This makes the option of encouraging staff to retire early more
attractive since the wage bill could be trimmed while the corresponding
increase in pension outlays would not be counted.
Defence suppliers may in future contract to provide staff as reservists to
support the armed forces, under proposals put forward by the Ministry of
Defence yesterday.
Companies would undertake to provide a service, such as maintaining
equipment sent to foreign trouble spots, for an agreed payment. They would
have to ensure that enough of their employees became members of the
volunteer reserves, to allow them to be deployed.
Unions are seeking talks with ministers following over the 500 redundancies
planned at Devonport naval dockyard in Plymouth, Devon. They say that the
government had promised when it awarded the Trident submarine refitting
contract to Devonport that there would be no more than 350 job losses.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT of the Irish Republic yesterday welcomed statements from a
leading unionist in Northern Ireland that Sinn Fein, the political wing of
the IRA, might be accepted at the negotiating table.
The Rev Martin Smyth, Ulster Unionist MP for South Belfast, said on Irish
radio that if Sinn Fein delivered a genuine cessation of violence the Ulster
Unionists would give Sinn Fein 'the recognition that they are a bona fide
political party and have a right to take part in a political process,
representing those who vote for them'.
He also said in an interview with the BBC that Sinn Fein should recognise
unionist rights to be part of the UK.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, described Mr Smyth's comments
as 'positive and constructive'. He added: 'It has always been my view that a
cessation of violence would radically transform the situation.'
The Irish government continues to guard its silence however regarding the
content of the peace initiative launched two weeks ago by Mr Gerry Adams,
Sinn Fein leader, and Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and
Labour party.
Mr Reynolds was briefed by Mr Hume last week on the initiative. After
yesterday's cabinet meeting the Dublin government said that evaluation of
the initiative was 'ongoing'. It gave no indication whether any proposals
are about to made to the British government.
The Hume-Adams initiative appears to be driving a wedge into unionist ranks,
with the Democratic Unionist party reacting angrily to the latest UUP
position.
Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the DUP, said: 'Since Sunningdale (the
1973 conference which established an ill-fated power sharing executive
without the DUP), no deeper wound has been inflicted upon unionism than
this.' The UUP position was 'an act of monumental folly'.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Lloyd's disputes sum of liability in Exxon Valdez case
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S yesterday said its liability over the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill
disaster amounted to Dollars 289m (Pounds 191.3m) compared with the Dollars
1.2bn total claim lodged in Texas courts by Exxon.
It said there was a limit of Dollars 850m on the policy, of which it would
be liable for Dollars 289m.
Exxon has filed claims against insurers, saying the company's policies
included oil spills and other catastrophes.
The underwriters say the agreements excluded marine pollution protection for
tankers, and that Exxon as the cargo owner was not legally required to clean
up the spill.
The Exxon Valdez spilled some 11m gallons of crude oil off Alaska.

FT  13 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Mexico plans S American trade pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, DAMIAN FRASER and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Mexican government plans to sign a free trade agreement with Venezuela,
Colombia and possibly Bolivia by the end of this year, and another with
Costa Rica, according to Mr Jaime Serra Puche, Mexican trade minister.
Mr Serra told the Financial Times the government hoped to join the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) early next
year. Entry should be eased by passage of a new, more liberal foreign
investment law, which the government is expected to submit to Congress at
the end of this year.
Mr Serra said the foreign investment law would be submitted whether or not
the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) is ratified. The substance
of the proposed legislation would be similar in either eventuality, but the
access that it gave to specific countries could be different.
Mexico has been concurrently negotiating trade agreements with Central
America, Venezuela and Colombia in an effort to balance the proposed
agreement with the US.
President Carlos Salinas said last week that Mexico's relations with the US
could be damaged if the trade accord with the US and Canada was not
approved. Officials are talking of a possible backlash against US companies
in such an event.
A senior Mexican government official said he would not rule out the
possibility that Mexican tariffs would be raised if Nafta was not passed.
Such comments may be no more than part of a campaign to press the US
Congress into approving the treaty. A move to discriminate against the US
could backfire, since Mexico depends on it for about 60 per cent of its
direct foreign investment.
The Mexican government expects the fate of Nafta to be settled by November
25, the day by which the House of Representatives has been asked by
President Clinton to vote on the legislation which permits Nafta to go
ahead.
The vote in the Senate, where support for the treaty is stronger than in the
House, may not come until after the New Year.
Nancy Dunne adds from Washington: Mexico has granted a licence for a joint
insurance venture between an Iowa-based company and a Mexican insurance
broker in the first new foreign licence issued by Mexican insurance
authorities in more than 50 years.
The licence allows Principal International to complete an agreement with
Servicios Especiales Profesionales to market life insurance and pensions
plans.

FT  13 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Time to square the Quad for the Round - A
need to clarify the Tokyo deal between the big four traders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the world's four biggest trading nations struck an unexpected deal on
tariffs last July in Tokyo, there was an almost audible sigh of relief from
the other participants in the 116-nation Uruguay Round of trade
liberalisation talks.
The apparent resolution of disagreements related to industrial goods between
the so-called Quad nations - the US, the European Community, Japan and
Canada - was seen as paving the way for an ambitious tariff-cutting package
going well beyond the Round's one-third target reduction.
However, with just more than two months to go to the December 15 deadline
for concluding the seven-year-old Round, the negotiations to improve market
access for imports are still being held up by the Quad's failure to agree
how precisely the Tokyo accord should be applied, tariff line by tariff
line.
Under the most-favoured-nation principle of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, tariff concessions agreed by the leading traders are extended to
all, providing a basic platform for bargaining by others. Mr Peter
Sutherland, Gatt's director-general, said at the end of September that the
Quad's 'unfinished agenda' was putting 'clear obstacles' in the way of the
Geneva talks.
The meeting in Brussels today between Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, is thus seen as
crucial in breaking the logjam. 'If this meeting is unproductive, the
Uruguay Round will be in a very difficult situation,' says a senior official
from another Quad country.
Senior Quad negotiators will meet in Geneva tomorrow to review progress in
the market access negotiations before an important stocktaking meeting of
all Uruguay Round participants on Friday.
The basic problem appears to be a difference between the EC and its Quad
partners on how the Tokyo accord should be interpreted. EC negotiators say
it provides an agreed 'formula' for tariff cuts across the board: zero
tariffs for some categories of goods, harmonised low tariffs for others,
peak tariffs (15 per cent and over) to be halved, and other tariffs to be
cut by a third.
The US, Japan and Canada say the accord sets out objectives, to be hardened
up through the normal bargaining process. Community officials argue that the
'request and offer' approach - which the EC has always opposed - is simply
impracticable at this late stage of the negotiations.
The EC is particularly annoyed because it thought it had won agreement from
the US in Tokyo to halve most tariff peaks on textiles, a key objective for
the Community. Instead, Washington has offered 50 per cent cuts on only half
the textile tariff peaks the EC has identified, and the reductions on the
rest amount to less than a fifth.
In the tariff category targeted for a one-third reduction, the US has chosen
to meet the goal by offering extra zero-tariff sectors, notably electronics,
rather than lowering duties across the range.
For its part, Japan has offered 50 per cent reductions on fewer than half
its tariff peaks. High tariffs on leather goods, where both the EC and the
US are pushing for reductions, have barely been touched.
Community negotiators say they cannot agree to more than the eight
zero-tariff categories already accepted unless the US and Japan make further
concessions. Apart from electronics, the EC's Quad partners want Brussels to
scrap duties on paper and pulp and scientific instruments, and to reduce or
eliminate tariffs on glass, ceramics, toys, wood and non-ferrous metals.
The other Quad nations are laying blame for the impasse in the negotiations
at the EC's door. 'It's Brussels that needs to move,' says one senior trade
diplomat, pointing out that the Community's tariff offer is by far the worst
of the four and falls well below the one-third Uruguay Round target.
According to one estimate, Japan's offer on industrial goods amounts to an
average tariff reduction of about 60 per cent, Canada's 50 per cent, the
US's 37 per cent and the EC's 26 per cent, though EC officials say their
offer was pitched low deliberately to put pressure on trading partners.
US negotiators are hoping that, in the textiles area at least, a settlement
may be in sight after signs that the American and European textiles
industries are close to a tariff-cutting agreement on products of bilateral
interest, mostly wool. Similar industry accords, on zero tariffs for
pharmaceuticals and low harmonised tariffs for chemicals, were taken on
board in the July Quad deal.
As for the rest, according to one sanguine insider, 'there are few issues
left and the trade-offs are clear. Mr Kantor and Sir Leon should be able to
close in on a deal.'

harm EC

FRENCH efforts to protect its subsidised farm exports, which are putting in
jeopardy a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of talks on world
trade liberalisation, could inflict enormous damage on the European
Community, Mr Richard Needham, UK trade minister, warned yesterday.
On the eve of a high-profile trade-promotion visit to China, Hong Kong and
Taiwan, Mr Needham insisted Britain 'could not stand back and agree to fall
in with a protectionist Europe'.
'If one country in the EC wrecks the Uruguay Round, they have to know it
will do enormous damage to the Community,' he said.
His comments come in the wake of drab trade figures showing UK exports in
July to the depressed markets of Europe - which account for almost 60 per
cent of all British exports - fell to Pounds 4.85bn, their lowest level for
18 months. In contrast, exports to non-EC countries are 2.5 per cent up on
the year, with sales to China up by 90 per cent.
'These figures illustrate well the new British priority being given to
Asia's markets,' Mr Needham said. This will be his fourth visit to China
since assuming office last year.
Complaining about the comparatively poor performance of UK exporters in
Asia, Mr Needham said the government intended to exploit more effectively
the Crown Agents, the Commonwealth Development Corporation, and multilateral
agencies such as the World Bank in seeking contracts in Asia and other parts
of the developing world.
He noted that last year, France won 15 per cent of World Bank procurement
contracts in the developing world, and Italy 12.8 per cent, while the UK won
just 2.2 per cent.
David Buchan adds from Paris: Prime Minister Edouard Balladur is today to
spell out proposals for an interim world trade deal this year to break the
current impasse in the Gatt negotiations. He called seven of his ministers
together yesterday to discuss his idea of identifying a list of trade issues
which could be settled by the December 15 deadline agreed between the EC,
the US and other main Gatt participants, leaving the rest for later
negotiation.
But several officials conceded that they were 'in the dark' about much of
the state of bargaining in several of the 15 Gatt areas of negotiations,
because Sir Leon Brittan, EC chief negotiator, and his Brussels officials
'have not chosen to enlighten us'.

FT  13 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Tokyo talks to discuss access to insurance
markets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
US AND Japanese negotiators gathered in Tokyo yesterday to discuss the
possibility of smoothing access to each other's insurance markets.
The US says business practices of Japanese companies create an obstacle to
foreign insurers in the Japanese market. Japanese companies tend to deal
with insurance companies in their own corporate groups, or keiretsu. This
and the fact that car insurance is mainly sold through car dealers have been
cited as barriers to foreign companies, which have only about 4 per cent of
the Japanese market. Japan, meanwhile, has told the US its state licensing
system for insurance companies made it difficult for foreign companies to
enter the US market.
The insurance talks come at the start of a period of intense trade talks
between the two countries. They had been preceded by inconclusive talks
between Mr Mike Espy, US secretary of agriculture and Mr Eijiro Hata,
agriculture minister.
Later this week, officials will turn their attention to Japan's pensions
fund management market - another bone of contention. Japan agreed this
summer to expand the scope of corporate pension funds that can be managed by
foreign investment advisers as part of market opening measures agreed with
the US, Canada and the EC in an effort to bring the stalled Uruguay Round to
a successful conclusion.
The talks this week between the US and Japan covering financial services
will be followed next week by talks on trade in cars and car parts, and on
government procurement of high technology equipment. In both cases, the US
is likely to press Japan to further open its markets to US products.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Clinton puts US Haiti mission on hold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton last night put on hold the US technical assistance
mission to Haiti and said he wanted to renew UN sanctions against the
military regime in Port-au-Prince.
'I have no intention of sending our people there until the agreement is
honoured,' he said, referring to last July's UN-sponsored pact designed to
pave the way for the return at the end of this month of Fr Jean-Bertrand
Aristide, the president ousted by the military in 1991.
'I will not have our forces deposited on Haiti when they cannot serve as
advisers,' Mr Clinton said.
'We were not asked to come in and make the peace or keep the peace.'
Earlier the troopship carrying about one-third of the detachment of 600 US
and Canadian military engineers and trainers left Port-au-Prince harbour for
Guantanamo, the US base in Cuba, while the Defence Department announced that
a second ship, due to leave today, would not depart.
The Harlan County had been prevented from docking on Monday and US and UN
officials were harassed in what appeared to be a demonstration orchestrated
by the Haitian military command under General Raoul Cedras.
In his brief remarks Mr Clinton said: 'I want the Haitians to know that I am
dead serious about honouring the agreement they made. Now the time has come
for the people clinging to their last gaps of power to honour the
agreement.'
Fr Aristide, still in Washington, immediately endorsed Mr Clinton's action,
including the reimposition of economic sanctions. He described Gen Cedras
and Mr Joseph Michel Francois, the police chief, as leaders of 'a gang of
thugs involved in drug trafficking' and demanded that they step down by
Friday.
Over the last week the pending Haitian intervention, which would have left
exposed lightly armed US troops, had come to appear almost like another
Somali quagmire for the administration. The Pentagon's distaste for the
mission became public last week and the public's, as manifested in several
polls, this week.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Economic historians win Nobel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Nobel prize for economics was yesterday awarded to Robert Fogel of the
University of Chicago and Douglass North of Washington University in St
Louis for pioneering work on the causes of economic and institutional
change.
The Nobel committee's decision to break with tradition and award the prize
for work in economic history, rather than economics proper, reflects the
growing importance economists attach to the role of social institutions in
providing a framework for economic growth.
Professors Fogel and North are widely credited with revolutionising economic
history as an academic discipline by applying rigorous statistical
techniques and theories. The approach is known as 'cliometrics' or 'the new
economic history'.
'It's a tremendous decision,' said Prof Roderick Floud, provost of London
Guildhall University, who has collaborated with Prof Fogel for the past
10-15 years. He said their emphasis on quantitative techniques had
transformed economic history and stimulated greater numeracy in other
branches of history.
Prof North, 72, has cast doubt on many traditional explanations of economic
growth, arguing that factors such as technical change and innovations are
less important than previously claimed. He puts more stress on legal and
social institutions, such as property rights, that create the conditions in
which market economies can flourish.
His work is of particular relevance to former communist countries where the
lack of capitalist institutions is widely seen as one of the main obstacles
to development. Prof North recently advised the Czech Republic on
privatisation. He previously acted as a consultant in Russia, Argentina and
Peru.
'He is adamant that you cannot just leave development to markets,' said Prof
John Nye, a colleague of Prof North at Washington University. 'He is trying
to push back the boundaries of economics by getting economists to focus on
institutions as well as exchange and allocation.'
Prof North has also used the modern economic theory of transactions costs to
throw new light on feudal and medieval economies. He concluded these forms
of economic organisation were efficient given existing institutional
constraints.
Prof Fogel, 67, pioneered the application of rigorous statistical techniques
in economic history, in the process turning conventional wisdom on its head.
Historians, for example, have long argued that the development of railways
played a crucial role in US economic development. Prof Fogel rejected this
claim, arguing that had railways never existed, US gross national product
would have been only 3 per cent lower. He argued that in the absence of
railways substitute forms of transport such as roads and canals would have
played a more important role. This type of 'counterfactual' analysis,
familiar to economists, was new to economic historians.
In a study that provoked bitter criticism, Prof Fogel rejected the
conventional wisdom that American slavery was an inefficient, unprofitable
economic system. His careful statistical analysis indicated that slavery was
economically viable and would have persisted but for political opposition.
He did not, however, attempt to justify slavery, arguing that it was morally
unacceptable.
More recently Prof Fogel has helped to develop a new branch of economic
history that uses biomedical data on human height, weight, food intake and
morbidity as a gauge of changes in economic welfare.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Healthcare bill likely to be sent to Congress this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration will probably send its detailed healthcare reform
bill to Congress next week, according to one of its chief architects.
Mr Ira Magaziner, White House adviser, said in a speech in Washington
yesterday that publication of the bill had been delayed by last-minute
number-crunching over new taxes and fees to finance the extension of basic
health coverage to all Americans.
This delay has offset some of the initial momentum gained from the
impressive presentation of the outlines of the package by President Bill
Clinton and his wife late last month.
Mrs Hillary Clinton has continued to draw favourable reviews as she
campaigns around the country on behalf of the plan, which she also played a
leading role in shaping. But her husband, and the public, have been
distracted by events in Somalia.
However, yesterday the president flew down to North Carolina, one of the
biggest tobacco producing states, with the apparent intent of at least
trying to make the case that it is right and proper to help finance national
healthcare reform through the levying of higher 'sin taxes'.
The suspicion of some lost momentum was confirmed by the latest Washington
Post poll released yesterday. This found public support for the Clinton plan
down to 51 per cent from 56 per cent after his speech to Congress, while
opposition had risen from 24 per cent to 39 per cent.
Most reservations centred on the undoubted fact that people will have to pay
more, directly or indirectly, for their medical care and on the fears that
its quality, including the freedom to choose doctor and hospital, might
decline.
Nevertheless, as the White House was quick to point out yesterday, the Post
poll still found a comfortable majority (59-31 per cent) believing that the
Clinton plan was better than the current system. Even many Republicans
concede that reform is essential.
The details of the bill, likely to run to over 1,000 pages, will be
critical, with countless interest groups some representing indisputably
worthy of causes, waiting to pounce.

MEXICO'S ambitious programme to privatise electricity generation has

The Carbon II plant was to be sold for Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.05bn) to a
consortium 49 per cent owned by Mission Energy, a subsidiary of Southern
California Edison, and 51 per cent owned by Mexico's Grupo Acerero del Norte
and Organizacion Autrey.
US environmentalists complained pollution from the plant would blow over the

scrubbers be fitted at a cost of about Dollars 300m. Such scrubbers are
demanded by US law, but not by Mexico.
Mr John Bryson, chief executive of Southern California Edison, said
circumstances were not favourable to conclude the deal.

<TEXT>
THE Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince was tense yesterday, with many shops
and offices closed and heavily-armed men roaming the almost empty streets.
Public transport was at a standstill. Small-arms and machine-gun fire was
heard through the night, following Monday's violent demonstrations which
prevented the landing of US troops on a UN mission intended to oversee the
restoration of democracy on the island.
The offices of national radio and television were occupied by plainclothes
police auxiliaries, known as 'attaches', who also led Monday's
demonstrations.
The UN special representative in Haiti, Mr Dante Caputo, cancelled a planned
trip to Washington because of the incident. He blamed the Haitian military
for Monday's incident, saying the attacks were an insult to the UN and a
clear violation of the agreements signed in New York between the army and
exiled president Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, due to return to Haiti at the
end of this month under the peace plan.
The USS Harlan County, carrying the troops, remained anchored outside port
yesterday as US officials tried to negotiate a plan for its safe arrival.
In Washington Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, yesterday accused
Haiti's military leaders of violating the UN-mediated accord and warned that
if sanctions were reimposed, they would be severe.
'By their actions, Gen (Raoul) Cedras and Chief of Police (Joseph Michel)
Francois are inviting reimposition of severe economic sanctions that could
affect their country and would also affect them personally,' Mr Christopher
said.
Gen Cedras, who led the 1991 coup which ousted Mr Aristide, condemned the
violence but said he sympathised with the Haitians' outrage at the threat to
their sovereignty.

ARGENTINA has been in talks with a US subsidiary of Smiths Industries of the
UK to modernise second-hand fighter bombers its air force is buying from the
US to replace those shot down by Britain in the 1982 Falklands conflict.
Smiths' US unit says it 'actively competed' for the contract, even though a
British arms embargo imposed during the conflict remains in force.
The company's avionics division, based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, said this
week it had held meetings in Buenos Aires with local defence ministry
officials. More talks were planned this week in the US with Mr Oscar
Camilion, Argentine defence minister, who will make a counter-proposal to
the bid.
UK and Argentine government officials agree there is little chance that
Smiths will win the contract unless the embargo is relaxed. By negotiating
with a British company for a defence contract Argentina may be trying to
underline the 'anachronistic' nature of the embargo.
Smiths in the UK said: 'This is a responsible company. It is not one that is
going to break any embargoes or sanctions imposed by governments.' Smiths
was 'not going to supply anyone that does not have the approval by the
government agencies involved.'
Argentina is negotiating to buy 36 second-hand A4M Skyhawk fighter bombers
from the US Navy. The US agreed to sell the aircraft to Argentina in 1992,
but bowed to requests by the UK that they should not be equipped with
electronics or weapons systems that might threaten British forces based on
the Falkland Islands.
A senior Smiths executive was in Argentina last week 'answering questions'
from the air force. A marketing director involved in the talks said Smiths
had informed both Washington and London it would make an 'initial top-level
presentation' in Argentina concerning the contract.

The problems over the plant have highlighted growing pressure on Mexico to
upgrade environmental regulations to the levels in the US even though this
is not required by Mexican law. Mexico has recently been willing to cede to
the US over the environment, in an effort to win support for the North
American Free Trade Agreement.

NEGOTIATORS for the United Mine Workers of America and coal company
representatives resume talks in Washington today, amid hopes that the
long-running US coal strike may be near its end. The talks are being led by
Mr William Usery, who was appointed by the White House as a mediator in the
dispute in September.
Mr Usery met the union and coal companies separately yesterday in
preparation for today's discussions. Both sides are returning to
negotiations after a week-long recess for consultations.
A spokesman for Mr Usery said: 'We are hopeful for a resolution by this
weekend. That is our objective.'
The union and the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, the coal companies
negotiating group, would not comment on the talks.
The UMWA called a selective strike against the US's largest coal companies
in early May, after working without a contract since February. Since then,
more than 14,000 coalworkers have joined the picket lines. Peabody Coal, a
subsidiary of UK-based Hanson, has estimated the strike has cost about
Dollars 1m a day in lost profits.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Nippon Steel asks staff to take pay cut
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIPPON STEEL, the world's largest steel maker, said yesterday it would ask
its 37,000 staff to take two extra days holiday per month on reduced pay.
This is the latest and most radical cost-cutting step in Japan's steel
industry, faced with declining demand from most of its main markets, plus a
recession at home.
It follows similar moves from NKK and Sumitomo Metal Industries and is
likely to add to the risk of labour tension at a time when many of Japan's
top companies are shedding jobs or considering wage and bonus cuts.
The two other leading Japanese steel makers are expected to follow. Kawasaki
Steel, which has already moved some workers out of steelmaking into other
divisions, said it was considering temporary holidays from next January,
subject to union approval. Kobe Steel was also studying temporary leave.
Unions will be unhappy about the Nippon Steel plan but will agree, predicted
Mr Minoru Udono, steel industry specialist at James Capel Pacific. He
estimated Nippon Steel has a 10 per cent labour surplus, as against an
average of 17 per cent for the Japanese steel industry.
Unlike European and US competitors, Japanese steelmakers have so far avoided
redundancies, considered socially unacceptable.
Nippon Steel, which recently forecast a loss for this year, says it will ask
all staff, including management, to take extra holiday during November and
continue every month until further notice. It last resorted to this step
from December 1986 to July 1989, to cope with the downturn in domestic
demand.
Japanese steel companies are also planning to cut output this month, in line
with reduced demand. Nippon Steel officials believe domestic demand will
fall to 24.2m tonnes this quarter, from 24.8m tonnes last quarter.
In one glimmer of encouragement for the steel industry, public works starts
rose 1.5 per cent in August against August last year. That was the ninth
monthly rise running and the best monthly result for a year.
It bodes well for demand for long products such as girders, wire and bars,
used in the construction industry, though demand for flat products like hot
rolled coil continues to be weak from the car and electrical goods
industries.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG'S Governor Chris Patten yesterday attempted to blame China for the
failure to achieve any breakthrough in the long-running Sino-British talks
over Hong Kong's political future.
The comments came as the negotiations appeared to deteriorate into an
argument over which side is guilty for the current stalemate.
The governor was replying to Monday's statement by Chinese vice-foreign
minister Jiang Enzhu that it would be 'no big deal' if an accord could not
be reached. Mr Patten said: 'I think everybody in Hong Kong thinks it would
be a big deal if we didn't reach an agreement in the talks.' He questioned
China's sincerity in its approach to the talks.
The 13th round in Beijing lapsed yesterday with the two sides remaining
divided. They are trying to reach agreement over proposed changes to the
mechanism for electing Hong Kong's 60-seat Legislative Council. Britain's
chief negotiator, Sir Robin McLaren, said: 'I won't say we have made no
progress, but I can't say I'm satisfied with the progress we have made.'
Britain and China have agreed to start a 14th round on October 20, but local
expectations of a breakthrough are declining along with the tone of the
diplomatic exchanges between the British and Chinese negotiating teams.
The atmosphere in the talks has deteriorated sharply in recent weeks. China
recently republished an 11-year-old policy document on Hong Kong, voicing
the threat of an early takeover of the colony. It has reacted angrily to Mr
Patten's statement last week that the talks could continue for 'only weeks
rather than months'.
Analysts think Mr Patten's expected meeting with the UK cabinet on November
11 will provide the effective deadline for talks, unless there is a
last-minute compromise.

FT  13 OCT 93 / China missile total is revised upwards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA has more than 100 land-based nuclear ballistic missiles, some 50 per
cent more than previously estimated, according to figures published by the
London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies today.
The IISS says its revised estimate does not imply any recent dramatic
increase in the Chinese nuclear arsenal, which has always been 'shrouded in
secrecy'. China is now believed to possess about 14 intercontinental
missiles and at least 90 intermediate-range missiles. It also deploys a
nuclear-armed submarine.
In the 1993-94 edition of its Military Balance, the IISS cites fears that a
new spate of nuclear testing could jeopardise renewal of the
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), due in 1995. The IISS points to the build-up
in conventional arms by most nations in east Asia. It describes as
'worrying' the emphasis on improved capability for naval and air forces.
The IISS highlights Iran's efforts to rebuild its forces with modern
aircraft, including Russian MiG-29 fighters, submarines and medium-range
ballistic missiles. Iran, like North Korea, is strongly suspected of working
towards a nuclear arsenal, but the IISS says no proof exists as yet; 'In all
probability Iran cannot hope to produce its own nuclear weapons before 2000
at the earliest.' But it notes that Iran 'is actively procuring weapons
systems (aircraft and missiles) capable of delivering nuclear weapons'.

<TEXT>
THE Australian government finally got a break over its stalled budget
proposals, when one of the two minority parties, which hold the balance of
power in the Senate, said it would not support an Opposition plan to block
all sales and fuel tax rises unless the government withdrew its threat to
delay tax cuts.
The promised cuts are due to take effect next month. Ms Cheryl Kernot,
Australian Democrats' leader, said the Opposition plan, outlined to the
minority parties by the Opposition's Treasury spokesman, Mr Alexander
Downer, did not consider the possible effects on the economy.
'The suggestions contained in Mr Downer's letter are cute, but flawed and
irresponsible,' Ms Kernot said. The Democrats believed the government had
the right to get the core of its budget passed.
Two elements in the budget package were voted down by the Senate last week:
the proposed increased wine tax, where the Democrats joined forces with the
Opposition to block the measure, and a second round of sales tax rises, due
to come into effect in 1995, where the vital vote was cast by Mr Brian
Harradine, an independent senator.
The government has threatened to delay implementing proposed income tax
cuts, which have been approved, unless all its revenue-raising measures are
passed. Yesterday, the Australian dollar jumped more than a third of a US
cent, breaking through US cents 66, after the Democrats' decision.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Yeltsin apologises over POWs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday moved to patch up relations with Japan, on
the first day of an official visit that had been expected to produce scant
progress.
Mr Yeltsin pleasantly surprised his Japanese hosts by making a spontaneous
apology for 600,000 prisoners held in Siberia after the second world war and
by acknowledging the existence of Japan's claim on four islands annexed by
Soviet troops at the end of the war.
The apology 'will be extremely significant in building the foundation for
the spiritual and psychological reconciliation of our two peoples,' said Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister.
Mr Yeltsin's readiness to discuss the islands, through a twice yearly
meeting of foreign ministers 'goes beyond what was said before' and is 'the
basis for further negotiations,' said a foreign ministry official. The
dispute has prevented Russia and Japan from signing a post-war peace treaty.
Tokyo has made large-scale economic aid to Russia dependent on progress on
the islands, though officials said yesterday no further pledges were
envisaged for the moment. The Kurile islands are popular symbols of slighted
pride in Japan and the source of Japanese mistrust of Russia, seen as an
opportunistic aggressor in the war.
Some Japanese officials had expected deadlock over the islands when the
Russian leader announced, just before leaving Moscow, that he hoped Tokyo
would not spoil the visit by raising the issue. In recognition of this
progress yesterday, Mr Hosokawa accepted an invitation to visit Moscow.
Mr Hosokawa was the first to raise the territorial problem by telling Mr
Yeltsin that it was 'an objective fact' that the islands were 'inherent
territories' of Japan.
Mr Yeltsin replied that he appreciated the existence of the problem and said
Russia took responsibility for treaties between the former Soviet Union and
Tokyo. Japanese government officials interpret that to include a 1956 joint
declaration in which Moscow offered to return two of the islands and
negotiate on the other two.
Mr Yeltsin also promised to withdraw the remaining 5,000 Russian troops
stationed on the islands.
Separately, he agreed to start joint research on Soviet dumping of nuclear
waste in the Sea of Japan.
Mr Hosokawa gave no clear answer to Mr Yeltsin's request for further
rescheduling of Russia's Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1bn) debt to Japan, beyond
saying he understood the importance of this, given Russia's own importance
to the global economy. Russia and Japan should continue economic
co-operation, Mr Hosokawa said, citing as examples a Dollars 200m optical
fibre telecom link between Moscow and the Russian far east and oil and gas
development in Sakhalin.

FT  13 OCT 93 / S Korea averts financial panic

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA yesterday smoothly completed the introduction of a ban on
anonymous financial accounts and avoided a panic on money markets.
The government had stipulated that yesterday was the deadline for all
accounts to be registered under the real name of their owners. The ban on
false-name accounts is meant to reduce the large underground economy,
estimated to be equal to 20 per cent of GNP.
About 95 per cent of the won300,000bn (Pounds 241bn) in financial accounts
had been identified as of yesterday.
There had been widespread fears that the deadline would provoke a massive
withdrawal of hidden assets from banks and the stock market in a desperate
attempt to beat the tax collector, causing a liquidity drain and a financial
crisis in its wake.
But the government on Monday suggested that accounts listed under borrowed
names would not have to be converted to the owner's real name until 1996,
when a new tax system is introduced.
Analysts believe that most of the untaxed assets are hidden under borrowed
name accounts.
It is common practice for large depositors to use the names of family,
relatives and friends to hide their assets and reduce their tax bill.
The concession will enable the nominee holders to withdraw money from the
accounts over the next three years without officials discovering who
actually owns the funds in the account.
The stock market reacted soberly to the deadline. The general index rose by
2.5 points to 724, almost precisely the same level before the real-name
system was announced two months ago and caused a brief panic on the
exchange.
The bourse has recovered since then because the government promised that it
would not impose capital gains taxes for the next five years to persuade
investors to keep their money in the market.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Countdown to Palestinian self-rule starts: The task facing
Israel and the PLO
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL and the Palestine Liberation Organisation today begin a complex
process of working out the details of how to implement the historic peace
accord signed one month ago in Washington.
The negotiations in Egypt mark the coming into effect of the Declaration of
Principles, a broad framework for a peace settlement, sealed at the White
House with a handshake between Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister and
Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman. The talks also start the tight nine-month
countdown to Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories with Israeli
military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho to
be completed by April 13 and an elected Palestinian Council to take over
internal administration by July 13.
Two standing committees, which begin work today in Cairo and the Red Sea
resort of Taba, will over the next two months hammer out a lengthy agenda of
difficult and sensitive security issues ranging from the role of the
Palestinian police force to the release of Palestinian prisoners.
The overall liaison committee, led by Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign
minister and Mr Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), a senior PLO official, will meet
in Cairo. A committee of experts led by Major-General Amnon Shahak, Israeli
deputy chief of staff and Mr Nabil Shaath, adviser to Mr Arafat, will meet
in Taba to concentrate on the protocol for Israeli military withdrawal which
both sides have agreed to reach by December 13.
A third committee will meet in Washington to prepare a protocol for the
holding of Palestinian elections and detailing the powers of a Palestinian
Council. A fourth committee will concentrate on a crash programme of
economic assistance to the territories.
Both Israel and the PLO appear committed to thrashing out the problems and
keeping the peace momentum on track. But it is clear that many of the issues
will severely test the Palestinian side as hardliners in the occupied
territories continue to seek to sabotage the agreement and level charges of
betrayal against Mr Arafat.
The most difficult issues revolve around the security of Jewish settlers who
will continue to live in the territories throughout the five-year period of
interim self rule. Last weekend's killing of two Israeli hitchhikers by
Palestinian gunmen near Jericho has heightened Israeli concerns about
security. Mr Rabin has made clear that the security issue and Palestinian
guarantees will be the touchstone of the next two months negotiations.
The Taba committee will be the centre point for talks about security and its
location on the Israeli-Egyptian border will allow the negotiating team to
make site visits into the territories to resolve demarcation lines on the
ground. Any deadlock between the two sides will be referred up to the higher
level liaison committee.
Among the issues to be resolved in Taba are the extent of the hitherto
unspecified area around Jericho from which Israeli troops will withdraw; the
level of co-operation between the Palestinian and Israeli police forces and
in particular what right Israeli policemen will have to pursue Palestinian
suspects who commit crimes in Israel and flee across the border into the
territories.
The Taba talks must also resolve the extent of Israeli military protection
for Jewish settlers travelling on roads in the territories; what will happen
to Palestinians currently living under Israeli protection who have been
dubbed 'collaborators'; the conditions for the release of Palestinian
prisoners held by Israel; the right of passage for Palestinians crossing the
Egypt-Gaza border and the Jordan-Israeli border and the right of Jewish
settlers to pass through Palestinian controlled areas.
Israeli officials say they will arrive at Cairo and Taba today with a clear
agenda, working papers and a will to reach solutions within the next two
months. However, concern has been expressed in Jerusalem about the extent of
preparation on the Palestinian side. The PLO, however, come to he talks
buoyed by a vote in the PLO's central council in Tunis approving the peace
agreement by 63 votes to eight with 11 abstentions.
Although the negotiations are going to be difficult and lengthy, Israeli
officials believe it will be much more difficult to deliver on the
agreements when they come into force. They say that building confidence and
relationships between the two sides are as important as the details of the
agreements.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Oakley extends Somalia peace mission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOGADISHU
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Robert Oakley, the US special envoy to Somalia, is to extend his stay in
Mogadishu following an encouraging two days of talks aimed at breaking the
impasse between UN peacekeepers and Somalia's rebel warlord, Gen Mohammed
Farah Aideed.
'Mr Oakley will probably remain in Somalia until Thursday due to positive
signs emerging from his meetings,' Mr Stephen McIlvaine, the US charge
d'affaires in Mogadishu said yesterday.
But confusion remained over what President Bill Clinton's special envoy
hoped to achieve. Statements from Washington did not clarify whether the US
wanted Gen Aideed behind bars for the killing of UN peacekeepers, or whether
they wanted to cut a deal with the fugitive general to end his guerrilla war
in Mogadishu, in which 70 UN soldiers have died.
'Anything Mr Oakley said could be misinterpreted,' Mr McIlvaine said. 'But
he is not dealing with Aideed and he is not competing with the Unosom (the
UN Operation in Somalia).'
Mr Oakley's meetings have been shrouded in secrecy but he is believed to
have met members of Gen Aideed's Haber Gedir clan. Mr Oakley, a former
ambassador to Somalia, is said to be respected by the Haber Gedir, having
obtained US visas for many of those who were persecuted under the Siad Barre
dictatorship.
He has also held consultations with the UN's top man in Somalia, Admiral
Jonathan Howe, and the Italian ambassador, Mr Mario Scialoja. The latter
said he was 'in perfect agreement' with Mr Oakley's mission, but refused to
spell out what this was.
Mr Farouk Malawi, the UN spokesman in Mogadishu, also sought to play down
policy differences between Washington and the United Nations. 'There is
co-ordination and full understanding of Mr Oakley's mission,' he said
yesterday.
Nevertheless, Mr Oakley must be under orders to secure the freedom of the US
helicopter pilot seized by Gen Aideed's militias during last week's bloody
gun battle in which 15 US soldiers and more than 200 Somalis were killed. A
Nigerian peacekeeper is also being held hostage.
Mogadishu's war-weary residents have greeted the intense diplomatic activity
and Gen Aideed's offer of a ceasefire on Sunday, with great relief. 'I need
peace, bread and a job,' says Ahmed Mohammed, who worked for a British
hydro-engineering company before the civil war. He now scrapes a living
selling his services as an interpreter.
Even this brief interlude without fighting has allowed a semblance of
normality to return. Children's voices could be heard across school
playgrounds yesterday afternoon. Traffic jams piled up outside the port,
where lorries waited to load rice, maize and cooking oil for distribution
around town. Pick-up trucks, which once carried militias and mounted guns,
were ferrying passengers.
'Of course we know that the ceasefire is temporary, that it could blow up
again any minute,' says a UN official. 'But morale has definitely picked up
since Oakley's arrival. Both on the UN and the Somali side.'
But Mr Oakley's mission is being interpreted by Gen Aideed's rivals as a
policy of appeasement towards the man who defied the United Nations. 'Other
clans are getting restless,' says another UN official inside the
heavily-fortified Unosom compound. 'They are even getting angry. They don't
want the US to build Aideed into a strong opponent. If he is granted too
many concessions, it may complicate the UN's relations with other clans.'
But after four months of increasingly bloody warfare, both UN and US
officials are seeking a way to end the fighting. The risk is that Mogadishu
may be flooded with too many diplomatic initiatives. Apart from Mr Oakley,
Ethiopian and Eritrean diplomats are also in town trying to mediate an
'African solution' - currently gaining favour in Washington - as a
convenient way to disengage from the Somali quagmire.
Mr Koffi Annan, UN under-secretary general for peacekeeping operations, is
also in Mogadishu, and Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the UN secretary-general,
is expected to arrive this week.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Referendum idea rejected by Mandela
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NELSON MANDELA yesterday rejected a referendum as a way of breaking an
impasse in South Africa's constitutional talks and said that the African
National Congress was determined to go ahead with next April's general
election as scheduled.
The ANC leader, in London to address a Confederation of British Industry
conference, was responding to a speech by President F W de Klerk in
Stellenbosch on Monday. Mr de Klerk suggested a referendum as a way of
ending a deadlock caused by a boycott of the talks by the Inkatha Freedom
Party, the ANC's main black rivals, and the extreme right Conservative
party.
Mr Mandela, who received an explanatory telephone call from Mr de Klerk on
Monday night said: 'At no time did President de Klerk make a specific
proposal that a referendum should be held. All that he said was that this
was a matter which must be addressed in one way or the other. One way might
be to have a referendum.'
Some political analysts in South Africa have suggested that holding a
referendum would allow the government and the ANC to claim international
legitimacy and a mandate to govern in the face of right-wing opposition
which could disrupt the proposed election.
Addressing the CBI conference in London, Mr Mandela said he wanted a
reassurance that the Freedom Alliance between right-wing whites and Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party would recognise and accept the
results of a referendum.
'I got no such reassurance,' he said, adding that a referendum was 'entirely
unlikely' to resolve the situation.
Earlier, Mr Mandela said South Africa should abolish exchange controls at
the earliest opportunity.
'We are fully aware that the existence of exchange controls could act as a
deterrent to many potential investors who may not be certain about the full
implications of this system to their investments,' he said.
Abandonment of the system would be possible 'once some semblance of
stability returns to the economy, particularly the balance between capital
inflow and outflow,' he said.
Mr Mandela, who later met Mr John Major, the prime minister, was nearing the
end of a trip to the US and the European Community to promote investment in
South Africa.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Russia's future may be decided in a day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE FUTURE of all Russia's democratic institutions is likely to be decided
on December 12 following indications yesterday that President Boris Yeltsin
would opt for a presidential poll in December.
This would coincide with elections to both houses of the federal assembly,
or new parliament and to the regional and republican councils.
Earlier, Mr Yeltsin had insisted that presidential elections be held in June
to guarantee stability in the country over the parliamentary election
period.
However, Mr Georgy Satarov, a presidential aide, was quoted yesterday by the
official Itar-Tass news agency as saying that Mr Yeltsin, presently on a
visit to Japan, was now looking more favourably on the December date.
The latest opinion polls suggest Mr Yeltsin has gained in popularity, and
many of those advising him believe he should stand while he remains popular
and while his popularity would benefit those parties and groups which
support him.
Several supporters, including Mr Anatoly Sobchak, the mayor of St Petersburg
and Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime minister with responsibility for
finance, have called on him to stand in December.
The biggest uncertainty facing the December polls is whether there is enough
time left for them to be organised.
Boundaries have to be drawn, electoral commissions appointed, party lists
made up and rules on media coverage published.
Many parties and some papers remain banned during the state of emergency -
due to end on Sunday.
Mr Satarov said yesterday that another possibility was to move all elections
to a later date.
However, the main forces of the far right and left now seem likely to
participate.
Mr Sergei Baburin, a nationalist deputy and a former deputy chairman of the
banned National Salvation Front group, said yesterday he would call on his
comrades in the Russian Popular Union - a smaller party of which he was also
chairman - to put up candidates because 'it is important to participate . .
. in order to make the federal assembly, which is now purely decorative,
into a real organ of representative power'.
Mr Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Russian Communist party, said that of the
120 nationalist/communist parties, only a few had been banned - and that
communist and nationalist candidates could use the legal parties for their
campaigns.
He said that the Agrarian Union and the trade unions would also serve as
vehicles for these forces.
However, the main trade union federation - the Russian Federation of
Independent Unions - said yesterday it wished to be free of all political
affiliations.
On Monday, its praesidium accepted the resignation of Mr Igor Klochkov, the
federation president - apparently as a 'peace offering' to Mr Yeltsin, whose
policies Mr Klochkov had strenuously opposed and whom the unions now fear
may confiscate all or a large part of its property holdings.
Meanwhile, several key Russian regions, until now broadly opposed to Mr
Yeltsin, are falling into line with his plans. The diamond-producing
republic of Yakutia yesterday dissolved its local parliament and has set
December 12 as a date for fresh elections.
In the Siberian city of Irkutsk, local politicians promised to reform their
legislature, as Mr Yeltsin has demanded.

FT  13 OCT 93 / OECD warns Russian R&amp;D network crumbling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN research and development, once the largest system of scientific
research in the world, is now in 'profound crisis', according to a study by
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
The report, by a group of western experts, says that many institutions are
now on the verge of collapse, that the break-up of the Soviet Union has
severed links between parts of the same research institutes and that young
researchers are either leaving or refusing to join institutes because of low
pay and morale. The rapidity of the decline in funding and projects,
especially in the military sphere which accounted for more than 70 per cent
of all R&amp;D, has left politicians and administrators with a huge problem of
redefining priorities.
The Russian Academy of Science, the most prestigious centre for basic
research, has seen its budget decline by 2.5 times in real terms between
1990 and 1992. The report says that R&amp;D investment (corrected to OECD norms)
accounted for 2.1 per cent of gross domestic product in 1990, falling to 1.4
per cent in 1991. Of the estimated 950,000 people working in R&amp;D in Russia
(excluding space research) in 1991, 200,000-300,000 people have left the
system, with further cuts expected. The 'brain drain' has, so far, not been
very large - with an estimated 30,000 people leaving to work abroad since
1990.
The continuing domination of the military sector, accustomed to working with
large budgets and no cost constraints, means that the introduction of an
innovation system based on interactions between science and the marketplace
'will be slow and difficult'. The space sector, an area of excellence,
employs some 1m workers, of whom more than half were in R&amp;D. However, recent
budget reductions have been substantial.
The report recommends a range of changes, focusing on continued opening up
of the sector to international co-operation and a reduction in secrecy.

FT  13 OCT 93 / First woman elected to lead Irish political party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MS MARY Harney was elected yesterday to lead Ireland's Progressive Democrat
party. It is the first time a woman has led a political party in the Irish
Republic.
The election follows last week's announcement by the outgoing leader, Mr Des
O'Malley, that he would withdraw from the frontline of Irish politics.
A reforming politician, Ms Harney, 40, has campaigned for the liberalising
of Ireland's conservative social legislation since she was elected to the
Dail in 1981. She was a key figure in the founding of the Progressive
Democrats in 1985 by a group which split from the Fianna Fail party on
policy differences over Northern Ireland, the contraceptive issue and
internal party democracy. The Progressive Democrat party has 10 seats in the
166-seat Irish parliament.
Ms Harney said yesterday she wanted the party to field candidates in every
constituency at the next general election, and to mount an 'effective but
constructive opposition' to the present government. On economic policy the
PDs are conservative in outlook, favouring low taxation and low government
spending.
The PDs held the balance of power in the last coalition government and were
instrumental in the downfall of Mr Charles Haughey, the former prime
minister, and the collapse of the last coalition led by Mr Albert Reynolds.
Coalitions are likely to be the norm in the foreseeable future, due to
Ireland's proportional representation system, and a trend of declining
support for Fianna Fail, previously the majority party. This should create
an opportunity for the PDs to return to government sometime in the future.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Italian magistrates cry foul on football finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE high-spending world of Italian football has received a rude shock from
magistrates investigating alleged phoney transfers, tax evasion and
falsified balance sheets.
Five first division and two second division clubs are involved along with
nine of their players. At stake are the reputations of the best-known and
richest clubs - including AC Milan, owned by media magnate Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, and Juventus, the team of Mr Giovanni Agnelli, head of Fiat.
These clubs, along with Cosenza, Inter-Milan, Genoa, Torino and Venezia,
have all had their offices raided by police this week. Police have also
visited the homes of players and managers. The top-named players are Milan's
Gianluigi Lentini, who reputedly was responsible for the game's record
transfer fee of L60bn (Pounds 24.92m), and one of Italian football's idols,
Dino Baggio, now playing for Juventus.
Almost a year ago Turin magistrates were alerted by a small Torino
shareholder to the suspicious circumstances of a player's transfer to
Venezia. Inquiries revealed the L570m transfer was fictitious and the
player's name was none other than the son of a Torino employee.
As a result, the magistrates extended their investigations into the
management of the then Torino chairman, Mr Gian Mauro Borsano, a socialist
member of parliament.
Apart from transfers of fictitious players, the magistrates are examining
the disparity between the figures for which transfers are booked and the
figure quoted. Lentini was transferred from Torino to Milan in July 1992 for
a sum said by his old club to be around L60bn. He appears in Milan's books
worth L27.2bn.
Again Dino Baggio was party to a curious triangular deal whereby in the
space of a few days he was transfered from Torino, to Juventus to Inter for
a mere L4.5bn - a figure considered surprisingly low for someone of his
reputation.
One of the tricks magistrates believe they have uncovered is the accounting
for a player's transfer for half the real price in one year, then next year
the remainder is paid over to a 'ghost' player. By splitting the fee in two
the payment to the fictitious player looks more realistic. The Italian press
has carried statements from former football managers claiming the practices
have been long known and tolerated.

FT  13 OCT 93 / French strike over public sector policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A ONE-DAY strike in protest at pay restraint, job cuts and employment
worries yesterday caused widespread disruption in France's public sector,
affecting rail, air, postal and telecommunications services.
The strike was called by two of France's union federations, the Force
Ouvriere (FO) and the left-wing Confederation Generale du Travail (CGT) and
took place mainly within public sector companies, though one in four civil
servants stayed away from work.
Train services in much of the country were cut by two-thirds, as was much of
the Paris Metro, while striking Air France employees for a time blocked
access to their airline's terminal at Charles de Gaulle airport and caused
the cancellation of many medium-haul, but not long-distance, flights.
Pay is the main issue for the national civil service which has been offered
an increase of 4.5 per cent for the 1993-95 period. But elsewhere strikers
were mainly preoccupied by job cuts, privatisation plans and the Balladur
government's employment bill which is aimed at introducing more flexibility
in French labour law.
The strike was widely followed at Air France which has announced a further
4,000 lay-offs over the next year. Air France is on the government's
privatisation list, while the postal service and France Telecom are not. But
striking postal workers cited privatisation as one of the reasons for their
protest.
Nearly three-quarters of France Telecom staff stayed away from work. The
government has announced its intention to turn the telecoms utility into a
public limited company so that it is better adapted to form international
alliances. But many France Telecom staff see this as a step to eventual
privatisation.
While Mr Louis Viannet, head of the CGT, hailed the action as a success, Mr
Francois Perigot, head of the Patronat employers' federation, said such a
revival of strike action would 'block action already underway to get the
country's out of its rut'. He contrasted yesterday's action in the public
sector with the labour climate in the private sector 'where the number of
disputes is the lowest since 1945'.
Meanwhile, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, claimed yesterday
that the recession was now no longer getting any worse. 'One swallow does
not make a summer,' said the minister. But he said it was important not to
minimise encouraging signs. With an upturn already in new housing and
household consumption, it was possible to hope that unemployment would
stabilise in 1994.
The draft budget for 1994, on which the national assembly started debate
yesterday, would support economic activity and fight unemployment, he said.

GREECE'S newly elected Socialist prime minister, Mr Andreas Papandreou,
yesterday named a cabinet dominated by old political allies from his first
term in office.
He did not appoint a deputy prime minister, but created a special cabinet
post for Mr Antonis Livanis, an adviser who worked closely with him when the
Pasok was in power from 1981-89.
The post of economy minister went to Mr Giorgos Gennimatas, Pasok's most
popular member, but who is suffering from cancer. However, Mr Yannos
Papantoniou, a young economist, will be alternate economy minister and is
likely to represent Greece at EC finance ministers' meetings.
The foreign minister's job went to Mr Carolos Papoulias, a specialist in
Balkan affairs, while Mr Theodoros Pangalos got back his old post as
alternate foreign minister in charge of EC relations.
Ms Melina Mercouri, the actress, returns to head the culture ministry. Mr
Papandreou's personal physician, Dr Dimitris Kremastinos, was appointed
health minister.
Meanwhile, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, outgoing premier, is stepping down as
leader of the New Democracy party.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Greater powers are in prospect for the European Parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German ruling on the Maastricht treaty clears the way for small, but
potentially significant changes in how the European Community does business,
writes Lionel Barber in Brussels.
Treaty ratification will increase the powers of the European Parliament, and
deepen co-operation between governments on drugs, immigration and crime. It
also lays the groundwork for greater co-operation on foreign policy, and
provides for a move to a single currency by 1999 at the latest.
Some of these changes look incremental; others such as the move to European
economic and monetary union look problematic. But, as one long-serving EC
diplomat in Brussels said: 'The powers are there in the treaty. It depends
on whether the politicians are prepared to use them.'
The obvious winner among EC institutions is the parliament. Under Article
189b, it gains the right of 'co-decision' on legislation, to be shared with
the council of ministers. This does not extend to core issues such as
foreign policy and judicial co-operation, rather to mundane matters such as
the internal market.
A senior EC official predicts that the legislative struggle between EC
ministers and parliament will resemble bargaining between House and Senate
in the US, with the European Commission playing the broker.
The parliament will exert greater scrutiny over the Commission, starting
from January 1, 1995. On this date, both bodies will begin five-year terms.
Other important changes include:
More qualified majority voting in social policy legislation. Britain has a
treaty opt-out, but remains involved in discussions.
The right of EC citizens to vote or stand as a candidate in local and
European parliament elections.
Accelerated devolution of power to national and local levels under the
principle of 'subsidiarity'.
Establishment of 'joint actions' in foreign and security policy. This does
not mean the EC will be sending combat troops to ex-Yugoslavia, but should
lead to less reactive diplomacy.
Creation of a committee of the regions. Only four states have so far put
forward a list of members, and some senior EC officials worry about
bureaucratic confusion over its role.
Lastly, the EC will be known in future as the European Union, but not
apparently in all its future guises. Top lawyers in Brussels are studying
variations. The safe bet is that the British, who remain worried about
federal connotations, will stick to the 'Community' - or even better, the
'Common Market'.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Date set for Bonn move to Berlin
</HEADLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRANSFER of Germany's seat of government from Bonn to Berlin will be
completed by the year 2000, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said yesterday, ending
months of debate about the timing of the move. However, parliament might
decide to move earlier, possibly in 1998, when the parliamentary factions
will discuss the cabinet decision next week.
The cabinet decision was welcomed by the Berlin Senate, or state government,
which said there was 'finally a clear perspective'. It will also send a
signal, however late, to investors and property developers, who always
believed the move would attract more investment into the five eastern
states.
Officials in Bonn, particularly those who have established careers and homes
in the Rhineland, have tried to delay the move as long as possible, largely
because of the cost and upheaval. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, has
estimated the move will cost about DM30bn (Pounds 12bn).
The decision to move the government to Berlin was voted by the Bundestag,
the lower house, in June, 1991.
The slow timetable, however, has prompted sharp criticism by commentators,
most notably Marion Grafin Donhoff, publisher of Die Zeit. She recently
wrote that the government's reluctance to move to Berlin was slowing the
social and psychological unification of eastern and western Germany.
The Treuhand, the agency charged with restructuring and privatising east
German industry, yesterday announced it had liquidated 3,151 enterprises
with the loss of 235,000 jobs since it was set up in July 1990. They had
been liquidated largely because they proved unviable, even after
restructuring, or could not be privatised.
The Treuhand has already privatised almost 12,000 of the 13,000 enterprises
under its control. Some 1,300 are in the process of being sold, leaving
about 500, many of which will also be privatised.
However, there is increasing concern about the fate of 15 enterprises, which
together employ about 100,000 people, and include the chemicals, mining and
heavy machinery sectors.

FT  13 OCT 93 / German court's Maastricht ruling a win for all: Quentin Peel
interprets the judgment on the European treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE face of it, Chancellor Helmut Kohl seems to have got pretty much what
he wanted from Germany's august constitutional court, giving the green light
for ratification of the Maastricht treaty.
Of course the devil is in the detail, and after the 85-page judgment was
delivered yesterday, both proponents and opponents of European union were
claiming victory.
The eight red-robed judges of the constitutional court in Karlsruhe gave
their own interpretation on how the treaty, and the whole process of
European integration, should and would be implemented. Yet their words
appear close to what the German chancellor, and the German parliament, have
already agreed.
The end result is that all agree that the German Bundestag and Bundesrat,
the two houses of parliament, should in future exercise stronger national
democratic control over EC decision-making. In future, German overseeing of
Brussels legislation will be similar to that in Britain and Denmark, and not
the rubber stamp it used to be.
'The principle of democracy does not prevent Germany joining a
supranationally organised community of states,' the judges said in their
main guidelines.
'If an association of democratic states takes on sovereign tasks and
exercises sovereign powers, it is principally the peoples of the member
states who must legitimate this through their national parliaments.'
The judges did pay tribute to the need for democratic control at the
European level - through the European parliament - but without quite the
same sense of conviction.
'Increasingly as European nations grow together . . . democratic
legitimation is conveyed by the European parliament elected by the citizens
of the member states,' they said. 'It is of decisive importance that the
democratic basis of (European) Union should keep pace with integration, and
that a vital democracy should be maintained as the integration of member
states continues.'
They then went back to stress the need for national democratic controls.
'If, as is currently the case, the peoples convey democratic legitimation
through national parliaments, then the principle of democracy sets limits on
the expansion of the tasks and powers of the European communities. The
German Bundestag must retain substantial tasks and powers.'
In weighting their judgment in favour of national control, the judges are
following the inclination of the Bundestag and Bundesrat when they ratified
the Maastricht treaty. In a considerable tussle with the German government,
the two chambers have wrested constitutional powers to oversee all future
Brussels legislation.
The constitutional court judgment, by stressing that trend, may help to
reinforce it. According to a new article of the German constitution wrung
out of the government by parliament last year, the government must now
'consult and take into consideration' the opinions of its parliament.
Moreover the judges have gone further in reserving their own right to keep a
sharp eye on future developments towards European union. 'The federal
constitutional court will consider whether legal acts carried out by the
European institutions and organs remain within the sovereignty rights
accorded to them, or whether they go beyond them,' they said.
The court agreed with the German government that a loosely-worded article in
the Maastricht treaty which allows the European Union to give itself the
'means' necessary to achieve its goals, did not amount to a blank cheque.
Germany, and all the other members states, agreed that the statement was
merely a compromise clause to allow future financing to be arranged, without
a clear commitment.
As for the transition to economic and monetary union, the court seems to be
satisfied that the controls to be exercised by the Bundestag, and perhaps
even more strictly by the Bundesbank, will be adequate.
'With ratification of the Union treaty, Germany is not subordinating itself
to an unclear, automatic and uncontrollable mechanism leading to currency
union. The treaty opens the way to a further step-by-step integration of the
European community of law which depends at every further step either on
conditions which the parliament can now foresee, or on further approval by
the federal government, subject to influence from the parliament.'
Mr Kohl could hardly have put it better himself.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Industry recoils at German union's pay claim

UNION calls for pay rises of up to 6 per cent for west German engineers next
year and a moratorium on job cuts were rejected by employers yesterday as
'poison' for business.
Gesamtmetall, the industry association, which will start negotiations with
the IG Metall union next month, said such a settlement would have to be paid
for with tens of thousands of jobs.
Mr Klaus Zwickel, the new IG Metall president, told a news conference the
claim was based on next year's expected inflation rate of between 3.5 and 4
per cent and productivity increases of at least 2 per cent.
Engineering and metal employees had already paid the price of recession with
'alarming job losses and severe cuts in real earnings,' he said. Real income
increases would increase spending power and demand, he argued.
The unveiling of the IG Metall claim marks the formal opening of what
promises to be a tense but relatively strife-free pay round in all sectors
of German industry.
IG Metall, with around 3.6m members, is the country's most powerful union
and traditionally sets the pattern for other industry awards. While Mr
Zwickel's statement was peppered with the ritual, veiled hints of possible
strife, the overall tone was moderate.
It indicated guarded readiness to negotiate on more flexible working times
and practices, and appeared to leave the way open for a long-term deal such
as last year's 21-month settlement which expires at the end of December.
However, Gesamtmetall's sharp response reflected local economists' opinions
that the employers hold the upper hand. According to independent analyses,
west German unemployment is rising by 27 per cent year-on-year. This year
alone the industrial workforce has shrunk by 7 per cent.
Gesamtmetall, which has yet to make any proposals on pay, said 30,000 jobs a
month were being lost in engineering and metalworking. Unit labour costs had
risen 11 per cent in the first half of this year, production had fallen 14
per cent and productivity was down 2 per cent.
However, observers are sceptical about many industrial employers' hopes of
winning a general wage freeze, pointing to real earnings cuts in some IG
Metall areas of up to 3 per cent this year, and a sharp drop in personal
savings.
Most preliminary forecasts for 1994 assume nominal pay increases at or near
an expected 3.5 per cent inflation rate.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Waldegrave admits error over exports to Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CABINET MINISTER Mr William Waldegrave yesterday accepted that he had erred
in approving exports to Iraq that were used to boost the country's military
capability.
But he blamed Whitehall officials for not passing on key intelligence to
ministers that might have shed light on the Iraqi build-up and the
involvement of British companies.
It was the most serious public admission by a serving minister since the
Scott inquiry began last May and may refuel the furore over the
arms-for-Iraq affair.
Mr Waldegrave said that in 1989 as foreign office minister he had decided on
'the balance of probability' that British machine tools would be used for
civilian purposes by the Iraqis.
'I took the view maybe wrongly - clearly wrongly in hindsight - that the
priority in Iraq had changed and these were going for civil use,' he said.
'Clearly, with hindsight, that was the wrong judgment.'
The government faced a further embarrassment when Mr Waldegrave agreed to
retract an earlier statement to the inquiry that 'no dual use exports (to
Iraq) were allowed if it was believed they were to be used to produce
weapons'.
Mr Waldegrave, now public services minister, was being questioned over his
role as foreign office minister between July 1988 and November 1990.
He was referred by the inquiry to a series of intelligence reports showing
that when he agreed to the British exports there was firm evidence that the
Iraqis were using the machine tools for military purposes.
He said he had not been made aware of the reports which were circulated
among his own officials. Had the reports been made available to him, he
said, it would have been easier for him to argue against other government
departments and to block the export of machine tools.
'I have a very high regard for the capacity of the intelligence services in
this country but I don't think we used them properly in this story,' he
said.
Documents made available to the Scott inquiry and referred to yesterday
appear to confirm a contradiction at the heart of the government's handling
of its defence policy towards Iraq.
Ministers agreed in 1989 to approve the export of machine tools made by
Midlands company Matrix Churchill in spite of intelligence linking the
company to a munitions contract. The information was used later to prosecute
directors of the company.
The defence in the Matrix Churchill trial argued that the directors acted in
the full knowledge of government. The trial collapsed after a judge refused
the government's attempt to withhold documents.
Mr Waldegrave was asked by Lord Justice Scott why, given the intelligence on
Matrix Churchill, there had not been an earlier prosecution or whether such
a prosecution at all was fair. The minister said: 'I find it very difficult
to judge this. Perhaps that is what all the inquiry is about.'

THE LAST legal obstacle to the ratification of the Maastricht treaty on
European union was removed by the German federal constitutional court
yesterday.
The court in Karlsruhe rejected a series of challenges to the treaty as
either inadmissible or unsubstantiated.
The ruling by the eight judges, four of whom are pictured above, was greeted
with relief in European capitals, allying fears that the German judicial
authorities might impose conditions incompatible with the treaty.

FT  13 OCT 93 / 'Wise men' divided on merits of Budget tax increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE, the chancellor, was urged yesterday to think carefully
before raising taxes in the November 30 Budget and to be prepared to cut
interest rates to offset any tightening of fiscal policy.
In his first meeting with the Treasury's panel of independent forecasters,
the so-called 'wise men' were divided on the merits of a further fiscal
squeeze in the Budget, with several voicing doubts about the wisdom of tax
increases.
However, the Bank of England is thought to have suggested tax increases in
the Budget rather than additional spending cuts. In a letter to Mr Clarke,
the Bank urged the government to take extra action to cut the fiscal
deficit.
In the past, the Bank has expressed a preference for tightening fiscal
policy through spending cuts rather than tax rises and advocated increases
in indirect rather than direct taxation when taxes must be raised.
By suggesting tax increases, the Bank appears to have accepted Mr Clarke's
claim that there is no way the government's pre-set spending target for
1994-95 can be reduced.
Mr Clarke's brief meeting with the 'wise men' came as Budget preparations
moved into high gear. The chancellor is chairing meetings this week of the
EDX cabinet committee, which is struggling to keep public spending in
1994-95 within its preset 'control total' of Pounds 254bn.
On Friday, Mr Clarke will be closeted with Treasury ministers and senior
officials in the government mansion of Dorneywood to discuss Budget strategy
and the economic outlook.
Yesterday, the Treasury published its monthly monetary report, which noted
that recent economic indicators such as manufacturing output, retail sales
and consumer confidence pointed to continuing growth. It contained no clues
as to the Treasury's likely Budget judgment and will in any case be
overtaken by more up-to-date information on the economy in the next eight
days.
Mr Clarke has said he will not decide on taxes before November. In his
30-minute meeting with the 'wise men', it emerged that at least two of the
panel expressed doubt over whether there should be any fiscal tightening in
the Budget.
Mr Andrew Sentance of the Confederation of British Industry said the
government should cut spending but not raise taxes.
He told Mr Clarke of the danger that the recent rise in consumer spending
might 'fizzle out' should the chancellor decide on a further tax increase in
the next financial year.
Other panel members expressed worries about the strength of the recovery.
It is understood that Professor Minford of Liverpool University urged Mr
Clarke to cut interest rates, held at 6 per cent since January, to boost the
recovery. Prof Minford believes monetary relaxation and a low pound could
kick the UK economy into substantial growth over the next year without undue
inflation.

FT  13 OCT 93 / Ruling on Lloyd's paves way for Names to sue agents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S underwriting agents could face actions claiming more than Pounds 2bn
in damages for alleged negligence following a judgment in the High Court
yesterday.
Mr Justice Saville ruled that agents had a legal duty to exercise reasonable
care and skill when acting on behalf of Names, the individuals whose assets
support the London insurance market.
The ruling, largely expected at Lloyd's, means the way is now clear for a
number of actions by Names seeking to recover hundreds of million of pounds
in losses. The judgment also puts pressure on Lloyd's to deliver an out of
court settlement.
The ruling was welcomed by leaders of the Names. 'This is an enormously
important victory,' said Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker
Names Action group, the biggest group of loss-making Names. It was the 'last
major hurdle' for Gooda Names before their case comes to court next April,
he added.
'It does not decide the outcome of the war but goes a long way to determine
its strategic direction,' said Mr Colin Hook, chairman of the Feltrim Names
Association which represents 2,000 Names who are claiming damages of Pounds
600m from agents.
The Names had argued that their agents were under a legal duty to exercise
reasonable care and skill and perform to the standard of reasonably
competent and efficient professional underwriters. The agents disputed this,
saying the contracts between agents and Names excluded such a legal duty.
Giving judgment in the Commercial Court, Mr Justice Saville said that it
'literally' went without saying that agents had to act with reasonable care
and skill.
The wide authority given to agents to act on behalf of Names, the
potentially unlimited liability faced by Names and the remuneration received
by agents pointed 'irresistibly' to the conclusion that the agents have such
a legal duty of care, the judge said.
He found that members' agents, who handle the affairs of Names, were liable
for the conduct of managing agents, who administer syndicates in the
insurance market. In addition, he found that managing agents, who administer
syndicates, owed a duty of care to Names in tort law even if they did not
have an agency contract with the Name.
The agents are considering appealing against yesterday's ruling.

FT  13 OCT 93 / UK wins opt-out on labour law: EC concession on young
workers lifts government hopes on investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British government last night predicted that multinationals in Europe
might move their operations to the UK to save costs, after Britain won a
six-year opt-out from legislation to protect young people at work.
But Britain failed to prevent the 11 from deciding to go ahead with plans
for the mandatory introduction of elected works councils in companies that
operate in more than one country.
The compulsory introduction of works councils comes under the social chapter
of the Maastricht treaty. The treaty was finally ratified by Germany
yesterday after the country's federal constitutional court removed the last
legal hurdle to its approval.
Mr David Hunt, UK employment secretary, claimed victory on all fronts. In
spite of Britain's isolation, he said: 'We are turning the tide in Europe.'
He added: 'In private, many of my (EC) ministerial colleagues agree with
me.'
He said of the opt-out from the main provisions of the young workers'
directive: 'We have won a victory for newspaper boys.' On works councils, he
said Britain had refused to accept 'an alien model of compulsory
consultation' of workers on investment, relocation and jobs plans.
He was backed by Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of
British Industry, who said in a letter to Mr Hunt that it would 'impose a
rigid and bureaucratic procedure for informing and consulting'.
Mr John Monks, the TUC's general secretary, disagreed, saying the UK
government had 'lost the argument' over the issue.
'The works council directive will sooner or later apply in Britain,' he
said. 'The era of the British veto is over. This is good news for British
workers and the whole country.'
The British government's resistance to the introduction of the working hours
directive for young people stems from its general belief that the EC will
add unnecessarily to the cost burdens on business by introducing
inflexibility into labour market regulation in giving protection to young
people aged 16 and 17 who have left school.
Mr Hunt predicted that 'there may well be companies that decide to
concentrate more of their activities in the UK,' a provocative remark in
view of controversy that the UK is gaining unfair advantage in investment by
staying outside EC social and employment regulations.
German, Dutch and French officials poured scorn on the idea of a mass
industrial exodus from the Continent to the UK. 'But you can be sure the
Council (of Ministers of the 12) will react if any such thing were to
happen,' a German official said.
The object of the directive is to regulate the number of hours and the
conditions of work for children (up to the age of 15) and adolescents (from
15 to 18 years).
The EC works councils directive, obliging companies with more than 1,000
workers in more than one member state to consult and provide information to
elected workers' representatives on the German and, increasingly, French
model, will now be put forward again under Maastricht's social chapter for
the 11.
More than 100 British companies in continental Europe would fall under the
rules, which the UK will now be powerless to shape. In addition,
multinationals based in Britain and on the Continent may face demands from
their workers to offer the same consultation rights in the UK as in the rest
of the EC.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Survey of Four Cities Partnership (6): Regional double act -
Profile / Andre Rossinot, mayor of Nancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Andre Rossinot's two jobs, as France's civil service minister and mayor
of Nancy, incarnate two trends in today's Europe: the way in which
provincial cities and regions are gaining power at the expense of the
national state; and how they are allying with each other across national
borders.
Mr Rossinot has a special brief to continue with all deliberate speed the
transfer of French bureaucrats out of over-crowded Paris to the more
sparsely populated provinces.
For a UDF politician such as Mr Rossinot, it is the ideal job. The UDF has
long believed in the regions. Its partner in the ruling coalition - the RPR
Gaullists, who inherit the centralising tradition of the Bourbon kings and
the Jacobin revolutionaries - has been only reluctantly convinced of the
need in recent years for some devolution of power.
But Mr Rossinot cautions that 'the idea of regions is new in France' - a
regionalisation law passed in the early 1980s only really took effect in
1986. Interviewed in his stately office overlooking the Place Stanislas, he
also complains that his Socialist predecessors gave delocalisations (the
transfer of government offices out of Paris) a bad name by being 'too
brutal'. Prime minister Edith Cresson's peremptory ordering of the famous
Ecole Nationale d'Administration (ENA) from Paris to a refurbished prison in
Strasbourg led to legal problems, which Mr Rossinot and others in the
Balladur government have subsequently had to sort out.
Nonetheless, Mr Rossinot is sticking to Mrs Cresson's plan for an exodus of
30,000 civil servants out of Paris by the end of this century; so far a
tenth have left the French capital. Indeed, the mayor-minister says he
intends to make delocalisations a permanent feature of French territorial
planning.
'We have the advantage of having more space than Britain to work with, but
we also have the disadvantage of over-concentration in some urban areas and
desertification in some parts of the countryside'. The Balladur government
will continue to shift new powers, such as responsibility for professional
training, to the regions, says Mr Rossinot.
As mayor, Mr Rossinot has been able to preside over his city's growing
international links. Although Nancy is also twinned with Padua in Italy,
Liege in Belgium, Kanasawa in Japan and many others, its key relationship is
with Karlsruhe.
Twinning with this German city 35 years ago was 'an act of political
courage,' says Mr Rossinot. It has paid off since, and not just in terms of
sporting, student and tourist exchanges. Karlsruhe has been very active in
joining Nancy and other French and German cities to lobby for a high-speed
Franco-German rail link. 'As a result, the last two Franco-German summits
have stressed the importance of extending the TGV east of the Rhine,' says
the mayor-minister.
For Nancy, in its enthusiastic courting of Karlsruhe - which extends to
close co-operation between the cities' universities in chemical engineering
 -Nottingham and Halle count for relatively little, despite the success of
the 1991 joint exhibition by the four cities at the Hanover trade fair.
Nancy is still formally twinned with Newcastle. The only economic link seems
to be a plant near Nottingham belonging to Pont a Mousson, the Nancy
tube-maker. Some people in Nancy also express disappointment that
Nottingham's interest in the four city arrangement is more in marketing
and 'Europeanisation' of the cities' image to impress the European
Commission, rather than in establishing more basic business or
educational links.
By contrast, Nancy may eventually be drawn much closer to Halle through the
medium of its German sister town, Karlsruhe.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Eurotunnel seeks Pounds 1bn and sees squeeze on revenues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROTUNNEL said yesterday it was on target to begin phased commercial
operations of the Channel tunnel next March, but confirmed it would need to
raise at least another Pounds 1bn by mid-May 1994, from its banks and
shareholders.
The group has also been forced to reduce its initial revenue estimates
because of service start-up delays and fierce price competition and surplus
capacity on the Dover-Calais ferry routes. Eurotunnel's prices are due to be
announced in January.
Shareholders will be asked to support a rights issue for at least half the
additional funds, probably early next year after negotiations with
Eurotunnel's 220 banks are completed. Eurotunnel's share price fell by 6p to
close at 488p.
Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's chief executive, said the new funding was
mainly required to pay interest costs on the group's existing Pounds 7.28bn
of debt. Although he said projected revenues are expected to cover operating
costs by next August, it will be 1998 before the tunnel breaks even on a
cash basis.
By that stage Eurotunnel estimates the total cash requirement for the
project will have reached Pounds 10bn - Pounds 965m more than existing
resources including the anticipated exercise in 1995 of warrants which will
generate Pounds 220m.
Eurotunnel acknowledged the shortfall could be even higher 'depending on a
number of continuing uncertainties', including claims by contractors and
talks with the banks which have been insisting on additional contingent
requirements of almost Pounds 400m. Sir Alastair said he was confident this
would be reduced.
Mr Graham Corbett, chief financial officer, said Eurotunnel's total cash
requirement, from establishment in 1986 to the start of commercial services
in March, will be Pounds 8.75bn compared with Pounds 8.4bn estimated in
June.
He said the bulk of the increase reflected the signing of the 'Protocol'
agreement in late July with Transmanche Link, the Anglo-French contractors
building the tunnel. Under the agreement, Eurotunnel agreed to advance the
contractors Pounds 235m pending settlement of the claims.
Sir Alastair said that following that agreement there had been a
'significant improvement' in the relationship between Eurotunnel and TML and
that work was on schedule for the start of heavy goods vehicle freight
shuttle services on March 7.
These will be followed by rail freight and tourist shuttle services ahead of
the state opening on May 6, and the start of Eurostar train services between
London and Paris at the end of June.
Because of the advanced payments to TML, partly offset by a new Pounds 120m
standby bank loan agreement, Eurotunnel's projection of when it would
exhaust its existing resources has been brought forward to mid-May.
The additional funding requirement also reflects the reduction in projected
revenues in the tunnel's early years - due in part to initial capacity
constraints, the late introduction of some services and lower anticipated
fare yields pending 'the inevitable rationalisation of ferry capacity'.
Eurotunnel is now projecting total revenues in 1994 of Pounds 224.1m, some
Pounds 44.5m lower than indicated in April. Revenue forecasts for 1995 and
1996 have been reduced by Pounds 32m and Pounds 18m respectively to Pounds
554m and Pounds 690.7m.

FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Moller consolidates lead in
containers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A. P. MOLLER, the Danish shipping, shipbuilding and oil group, is
consolidating its position as the world's leading container carrier.
The group announced last week that it had placed an order for five container
vessels with its own shipyard, the Odense Steel Shipyard.
Capable of carrying 4,800 TEU (standard 20-foot containers) each, these are
the biggest container vessels yet ordered by Moller's Maersk Line shipping
operation.
Maersk passed Taiwan's Evergreen in terms of container carrying capacity
earlier this year, when it took over nine vessels from its erstwhile Danish
rival, the East Asiatic Company, which has withdrawn from liner shipping.
Maersk's capacity on the group's 50 ships is about 140,000 units to
Evergreen's 135,000, according to available estimates. Maersk also has about
20 ships on charter to its global liner services.
With last week's order, Maersk has on order 10 new vessels with a total
container capacity of 30,510. However, the expansion of the liner business
is only one of the factors which has made the Moller group's twin parent
companies, D/S 1912 and D/S Svendborg, two of the strongest shares on the
Copenhagen stock exchange this year, with the B shares increasing by about
56 per cent.
The most important factor behind the rise in the share price, Copenhagen
analysts say, was a new contract for sale of natural gas from the group's
fields in the Danish sector of the North Sea. The Moller group has a 39 per
cent share in Danish Underground Consortium (DUC), in which it is the
operating company for the North Sea oil and gas operations. Its partners in
DUC are Shell and Texaco.
DUC's production is relatively small - about 7.9m tonnes of oil and 3.6bn
cubic metres of natural gas in 1992 - but this is about 110 per cent of
Denmark's oil and gas needs.
DUC and the state's oil and gas distribution company, Dansk Olie og Naturgas
(Dong), earlier this year signed a contract under which DUC's deliveries of
gas from 1997 will be doubled, taking them to 7bn cubic metres a year.
On the management side, Moller is going through an interesting transitional
period. Mr Maersk McKinney Moller, whose father founded the group at the
beginning of the century, stepped down from the day-to-day running of the
group on reaching the age of 80 in July this year.
He remains chairman of the parent companies, but he made Mr Jess Soderberg,
49, the group's chief executive from July 1. Mr Soderberg's entire career
has been with Moller, where he became finance director before being made a
partner and chief executive.
The Moller group's oil and shipping operations had a turnover in 1992 of
about DKr23bn (Dollars 3.5bn) and reported net profits of DKr1.5bn.

FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Small shareholder threat to
Volvo-Renault merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S small shareholders' association yesterday stepped up its campaign
to block a proposed merger between Volvo's car and truck business and
France's Renault, claiming it had won the support of an institutional
shareholder.
The group, called Aktiespararna, also wrote to Volvo insisting the merger
would require a change in the company's articles of association at the
November 9 shareholders' meeting on last month's deal, a move that would
require two-thirds support instead of the simple majority needed to approve
the merger.
Mr Lars-Erik Forsgardh, chief executive of Aktiespararna, refused to
identify the institution he said was ready to support the association, or
how big a share of votes it held. But he said he had received verbal
assurances it would give Aktiespararna its proxy votes and added that he was
optimistic of winning over more institutional shareholders. However, the
association still appears to have the odds against it.
Volvo is already assured of support from more than 20 per cent of the voting
stock. Aktiespararna said yesterday its members probably held a little less
than the 7.7 per cent of votes they controlled when a survey was last
conducted three years ago. The largest institutional shareholder, a Swedish
state pension fund, holds around 7 per cent.
Volvo will today have a chance to press its case further at an annual
meeting at its headquarters in Gothenberg of a dozen of its largest
shareholders. Apart from Renault, the biggest single shareholder with 8.2
per cent, they include state pension funds, investment companies, bank
pension funds and insurance groups. The company said it did not accept that
the Renault merger required a change in its articles, saying the terms of
the deal were covered under its existing articles.

<DATELINE>
   ALGIERS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALGERIA yesterday executed 13 Moslem fundamentalists, the largest number to
go before the firing squad in 20 months of violence, Reuter reports from
Algiers.
The executions, announced by the Justice Ministry, signalled a continuing
crackdown despite efforts to find a political consensus before the end of
the year.
'The execution of these criminals reaffirms the will and determination of
the state to protect lives and property and ensure stability and social
peace,' the ministry said.
Announcing the executions in a statement carried by the official news agency
APS, the Ministry said six other condemned men had been reprieved. After the
rejection of court appeals, condemned men may be reprieved only by the head
of state, Mr Ali Kafi. Earlier this year, he commuted eight death penalties
to life imprisonment but allowed three batches of executions to go ahead.
Violence erupted in January after the army-backed authorities cancelled a
general election in which the now-outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) had
taken a huge first-round lead. The then president, Mr Chadli Benjedid, quit
in what diplomats termed a bloodless coup. A five-man presidency took over,
promising to return the country to a state of law, ensure the safety of its
26m people, and stand down by the end of this year.
The FIS was later banned and its hardline wing is frequently blamed for
ambushes in which members of the security forces, their relatives,
intellectuals, politicians and journalists have been murdered. In response,
special courts, in the capital and two of the country's biggest cities, were
set up late last year with tough powers to combat killings, sabotage and
'terrorism'.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Thieves on rice rampage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RICE thieves are on the rampage in Japan, attracted by the high prices
created by the worst harvest since the war, according to the the national
police agency.
Thefts of the staple are increasing throughout Japan, traditionally known
for an absence of petty crime beneath the big financial corruption scandals
of the past few years.
The agency said rice worth Y34m (Pounds 212,000) had been stolen in 208
incidents in the first nine months of the year, almost the same as for the
whole of 1992. Police expect the number of thefts to rise as the harvest
progresses from southern to northern regions.
Police are worried by the spread in rice-stealing from criminals to ordinary
workers, which they take to be a mark of the seriousness of the recession.

FT  12 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hamlet opens firmly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market debut of Hamlet, the clothes importer supplying the retail
trade, was marked by a strong performance from the shares.
They opened at 140p - a 10p premium to the issue price of 130p and traded
firmly with volume reaching 5m.
Hamlet, which supplies low-ticket items to almost all the main clothing
retailers except Marks and Spencer, had been expected to make a substantial
mark on its first day of share trading. But the high turnover surprised at
least one analyst who said the volume had been expected to be nearer 2 1/2
to 3m.
Much of the activity was attributed to large institutions securing positions
in the stock and trading was steady throughout the day. A little
profit-taking knocked some of the shine off the price and the shares closed
at 139p.
Property shares again showed good gains following recent bullish broker
comments and positive weekend press coverage. The leading stocks again
recorded healthy advances, with Friday's James Capel recommendation still
echoing in investors' ears, and second liners also caught the upbeat mood.
Among the former, British Land rose 10 to 423p, Land Securities, busy in the
options market, 11 to 714p and MEPC 9 to 519p. Elsewhere, Town Centre
advanced 5 to 133p, Asda Properties 5 to 120p, Chesterfield 7 to 523p and
Dencora 7 to 164p.
Investor enthusiasm for water and electricity utility shares showed no signs
of waning, both sectors surging on yield considerations. Among the Recs,
London climbed 12 to 593p, Yorkshire 10 to 619p and South Wales 9 to 534p.
Selected water stocks advancing included, Thames, up 8 at 563p and Yorkshire
8 to 572p.
Boots responded to continued talk that its results early next month would
herald announcements over either a restructuring at its Do It All business
and or the merging of its drugs division. Gossip at the end of last week
linked the latter concern to Fisons, the pharmacuetical group, with
suggestions that the two could link-up their non-ethical drug businesses.
Boots shares, with UBS also said to be positive. gained 5 to 494p. Fisons
edged forward a half-penny to 166p.
Reports that US executives of leading brand name companies were buying their
own stock led some optimistic dealers to decide that the war on brands was
over. However, this failed to affect the UK's leading brand producers, with
Unilever off 2 at 1050p and Tate and Lyle 6 at 370p. Hillsdown Holdings, up
8 at 167p, was said to be responding to a BZW 'buy' note.
Speculation that construction projects may be a target for the UK
government's plans to cut public spending wiped value off some building
stocks. But with share trading volumes generally low, industry analysts
thought the market was treating the stories cautiously rather than
seriously.
RMC lost 5 to 818p and Redland gave up 6 to 536p. Redland may also be weaker
as the date for a placing of scrip dividend shares, expected in three to
four weeks, moves closer.
In banks, Lloyds, left behind in recent sessions found admirers and ended
the day 10 up at 570p. A broker's recommendation at the end of last week
along with weekend press reports of rationalisation plans boosted National
Westminster and the shares gained 8 to 549p.
Talk of a negative broker's note saw TSB run back 3 1/2 to 220p.
Some rebalancing of positions in SmithKline Beecham after the confirmation
last week that it was to retain FT-SE 100 status was cited as the reason for
much of the activity in the stock.
The A shares fell 6 to 412p while the units fell 3 to 367p in substantial
trading. Interest in SmithKline will be largely pegged to next week's
anti-infective conference in New Orleans as will that in Wellcome which made
a gain of 5 to close at 728p.
The conference is expected to hear new results that will mark out the
competitive position of the two companies which are both very active in
anti-viral drugs.
However, one analyst said that similar interest ahead of a recent conference
in Copenhagen had proved to be largely misplaced and the event had turned
out to have little impact.
Trafalgar House shed 4 to 103p, with SG Warburg said to be cautious on the
stock. Weekend reports of board room changes at the group were also said to
have weakened sentiment.
Uncertainity about board room changes at international trading group Lonrho
undermined the shares and they declined 4 to 117p.
Bargain hunters thought to be from the US, together with renewed bid talk,
saw shares in Tiphook, the troubled container leasing group, advance 15 to
138p.
Automated Security, whose joint broker BZW resigned on Friday after it
issued a profits warning, attempted a rally but finished just a penny ahead
at 103p. Westland Group also firmed a penny to 224p, following news of a
Pounds 250m contract for one of its subsidiaries.
Oil discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico and further acquisition of land in
Texas for exploration pushed up the shares of British Borneo. The stock
climbed 6 to 203p in the face of a downward trend afflicting most of the oil
sector. Burmah lost 3 to close at 767p; Shell gave up 2 at 682p and BP ended
a half-penny down at 322 1/2 p.
Theme park operator Euro Disney slumped 35 to 610p as reports from Paris
suggested that a leading French broker had turned negative, prompting old
worries over the need for a bumper rights issue.
Ladbroke, still embroiled with claims and counter-claims with a Sunday
newspaper over the company's debts, recovered 4 to 182p in heavy turnover of
9m. Dealers said positive comments from Hoare Govett and house broker Smith
New Court had garnered some support.

<TEXT>
Shares in Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel closed 6 off at 488p, having
been lower, after it cut revenue forecasts and disclosed that it would need
further funding before the Tunnel's official opening next May.
The revenue forecast for 1994 was cut by Pounds 44.5m to Pounds 224.1m and
the group plans to raise at least Pounds 500m in fresh equity next year. UBS
was said to have reiterated its 'sell' advise to investors, while other
brokers also remain cautious. However, much of the dealing in the stock
takes place in Paris where it is also quoted and volume in London remained
light.

FT  12 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lucas advance on results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUTOMOTIVE and aerospace components group Lucas Industries cheered an
otherwise dull market after it reported bumper profits at the top end of
most analysts' forecasts, and maintained the dividend.
The group posted profits of Pounds 50.3m against Pounds 22.5m a year
earlier, when the range of forecasts in the market was Pounds 40m-Pounds
56m. Lucas maintained the full-year dividend at 7p, with many researchers
predicting a reduction, the more pessimistic even expecting it to be halved.
The shares leapt forward in heavy demand for the stock and closed 12 ahead
at 167p, on good volume of 10m. The equivalent of 1.3m shares was also dealt
in the traded options market.
However, dealers said the failure of the group to name a new chief
executive, as had been expected, prevented a stronger advance in the shares,
and profit-taking was also seen just ahead of the market close which brought
the stock from the day's high.
Many analysts upgraded profit expectations for the current year, moving the
range of forecasts from Pounds 60-Pounds 80m to Pounds 90-Pounds 100m.
Mr Robert Speed, at Henderson Crosthwaite, a long-time bull of the stock, is
maintaining his forecast for the current year at Pounds 100m. Explaining the
day's performance of the stock, he said: 'Today's share price movement
reflects final recognition that Lucas has got to grips with tackling its
cost base. It can now make gains in spite of difficulties in the underlying
market conditions for aerospace and motor components.'

FT  12 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH most New York markets closed for Columbus Day, derivatives were left
firing on very few cylinders as the market missed the driving force of US
buying, Christine Buckley writes.
As the influx of US money has formed such an important part of recent
trading for FT-SE 100 futures, the December contract yesterday found itself
with few friends. Largely deserted by domestic institutional investors, it
opened shakily and fell victim to a period of mid-morning selling.
But, considering the small volume, the downward movement was felt to be more
of a drift than a positive judgment on the value of the contract.
The UK's trade deficit figures had some impact on market sentiment but the
slide was well under way by the time of their publication.
December traded within a 25 point range with its day's high at 3,145 and the
low at 3,120, with the latter mark emerging as a support level.
At the close, the contract was 3,128 - 7 points ahead of the fair value
premium to the cash market, although much of the day's trading had been on a
par with fair value.
Activity in traded options was moderate and at 29,658 lots was only slightly
down on the previous session's levels. The heaviest traded of the stock
options was Land Securities - a reflection of the positive sentiment moving
through the cash market for property stocks.

FT  12 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Erratic session in leaderless market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE absence of a reliable lead from the US and Japan, the London stock
market was left to react to domestic factors yesterday, with a handful of
company features providing such highspots as there were. The announcement of
a UK visible trade deficit of Pounds 1.55bn in July was certainly a
disappointment to the stock market but with currency markets sluggish, share
prices rallied from their initial fall. Domestic producer statistics for
September were regarded as mildly favourable. London was helped by a firm
stock market in Germany, which has been seen as a competitor with the UK for
US fund investment.
The session started well, with the Footsie 8.5 ahead to a new trading peak
within the first half hour of trading as shares extended the gains scored
late on Friday.
The UK weekend newspapers had drawn attention to the pressure of demand for
shares in European markets from the US mutual funds. However, the stock
market has already taken this information on board and was inclined
yesterday to wait for a return to full trading in New York before drawing
any fresh conclusions.
The early advance was halted and then reversed when stock index futures ran
into sellers. The equity market slipped away and the Footsie 3,000 mark was
briefly lost at mid-session as London contemplated the prospect of a Wall
Street market trading while the Federal bond market, together with the
banks, was closed for Columbus Day.
The only saving grace of the London market was the extremely slow pace of
equity trading, particularly in the first half of the session. Seaq volume
was still under 300m shares in early afternoon.
Sentiment picked up later and business also improved as the Footsie 3,000
proved a recovery platform. By the close, the FT-SE Index had rallied to
3,102.2, a net 6.4 points off on the day.
The slow pace of the stock market showed itself most in a lacklustre
performance from the blue chip stocks. Second line stocks continued to trade
more hopefully, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, at 3,482.2, gaining 4.2 points.
Seaq volume finally looked almost respectable at 444.3m shares against
Friday's 477.4m for a retail worth of Pounds 1.03bn. Non-Footsie business
made up around 63 per cent of yesterday's Seaq total.
UK equity strategists sounded marginally satisfied with the stock market's
ability to hold on to the Footsie 3,000 level on the first day of a week
heavily featured by data on the domestic economy. In particular, there are
some doubts ahead of the Retail price index (RPI), due tomorrow, which will
follow two somewhat disappointing sets of monthly RPI data.
The market was led yesterday by utility stocks, still attractive on yield
considerations. Bank and property stocks, both seen as sectors likely to
benefit quickly from the one further reduction in base rates still expected
in this cycle, were also well supported.
With the third quarter corporate reporting season now virtually over, it was
left to Lucas Industries to please the market with its dividend and trading
statement. However, the disclosure that Eurotunnel will have to call for at
least another Pounds 500m from its shareholders was no help to investor
sentiment.

FT  12 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow becalmed in Columbus Day
doldrums

Wall Street
US SHARE prices edged higher in light trading yesterday as the Columbus Day
holiday depressed business activity and kept the bond market shut, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 8.67 at 3,593.41. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.57 firmer at 460.88, while
the Amex composite was up 2.89 at 467.59, and the Nasdaq composite up 3.39
at 767.66, a record high. Trading volume on the NYSE was 183m shares, and
rises outnumbered declines by 1,009 to 944.
Analysts had said that the markets would be quiet because of the Columbus
Day holiday (which closes the country's banks and many companies), and they
were right. Trading was light throughout the day, and prices remained in a
narrow trading range, rarely straying far from Friday's closing values until
a late surge at the end.
Sentiment remained subdued in the wake of last week's September employment
report, which revealed continued weakness in the manufacturing sector and
sub-par job creation growth rates. Equity investors were unable to look to
bond prices for a lead because the cash bond market was closed for the day,
although trading of Treasury bond futures in Chicago remained open. Activity
overseas was no help either - European markets were little changed, and
Tokyo was closed for a holiday.
Among individual stocks, Aluminum Company of America, a leading Dow
constituent, fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 66 7/8 after the big brokerage
house, Merrill Lynch, downgraded its short-term rating on the stock in the
wake of the company's earnings report last Friday.
Paramount Communications eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 76 1/2 after the
board of the entertainment group said that it would open 'informational
discussions' with QVC, the home shopping network which has launched a bid
for Paramount, but that it also remained committed to completing its agreed
merger with Viacom, the cable television company. QVC, traded on the Nasdaq
market, eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 56 1/4 on the news while Viacom 'A'
shares rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 56 5/8 and the 'B' shares climbed
Dollars 1 to Dollars 52 3/4 .
Eli Lilly rose Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 53 5/8 in active trading after the
big drugs group announced several cost-cutting measures which, the company
hopes, will reduce its global pharmaceuticals workforce by 2,000, or 10 per
cent, over the next year.
Chock Full O Nuts rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 9 1/2 after the company said
that it expected to achieve an 87 cents a share after-tax gain in its fiscal
second quarter from the sale of its Hillside coffee operation.
On the Nasdaq market, Intel fell Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 65 1/2 in volume
of 20m shares after investors expressed disappointment at the group's
third-quarter net income of Dollars 1.33 a share, which came in just below
the median of analysts' forecasts.

FT  12 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Interest rates emphasised as
bourses begin to flag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST rates have further to fall, said Mr James Cornish, European market
strategist at NatWest Securities, yesterday, and bourses could rise between
7 and 15 per cent over the next 12 months after a 37 per cent gain since the
beginning of the currency crisis in late August, 1992, writes Our Markets
Staff.
FRANKFURT scored its fifth consecutive high, but getting there seemed an
effort and, after peaking at an intraday 2,021.20, the DAX index closed just
6.01 higher at 2,011.02.
Turnover fell from DM9.4bn to DM8.5bn. Sector rotation continued with banks,
construction stocks and retailers mostly higher, and the automotive sector
and a number of other recent winners down.
In insurance, for example, Allianz fell DM16 to DM2,730 after Mr Peter
Constable, of Robert Fleming Securities, recommended a sell on profit-taking
grounds, saying that recent outperformance in the stock
conflicted with poor fundamentals. 'Rises in premium rate in Germany,' said
Mr Constable, 'are inadequate and too late to improve underwriting results
significantly there in 1993.'
The pharmaceuticals group, Schering, fell DM17 to DM1,041. Here again, the
reason was profit taking after a rise of DM75 last week.
ZURICH moved ahead to a record close, the SMI index rising 14.9 to 2,548.5.
Financials led the way, supported by a firm domestic bond market.
Winterthur registered were active, rising SFr8 to SFr720 while CS Holding
put on SFr55 to SFr3,150.
Swissair rose SFr10 to SFr735 on the prospects for a special dividend after
a Financial Times report that the Alcazar alliance partners had agreed on
how to value their stakes and that the negotiations would come to a head at
a meeting in Zurich today.
PARIS saw a late drop inter-
preted as a correction following an extended bull period. The CAC 40 index
closed 17.66 lower at 2,138.72.
Eurotunnel and Euro Disney were among the hardest hit stocks during the
session. Eurotunnel's downward revision of its revenue estimates left it
FFr1.05 lower at FFr42.10. Euro Disney fell FFr3.90, or 7 per cent to
FFr51.90 on unfavourable analysts' reports.
MILAN was unnerved by the resignation of Mr Paolo Savona, the industry
minister,
as a result of serious disagreements over the government's privatisation
programme and the Mibtel index fell 118 to 10,307 in thin trading.
Among early privatisation candidates, BCI shed L132 or 2.8 per cent to
L4,596 and Credito Italiano fell L69 or 2.7 per cent to L2,465 amid concern
that the programme could face delays. Savings shares in both banks were
suspended before board meetings that are expected to propose changes to
their statutes ahead of privatisation.
Montedison was L51 or 6.4
per cent ahead at L850 and Ferruzzi added L2 to L400 after the progress at
the weekend by the main Italian creditor banks.
AMSTERDAM saw ING, the financial services group, another Fl 1.90 higher at
Fl 79.80 on Thursday's news that the Dutch state had sold its 7 per cent
stake to a Dutch pension fund. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.5 at 128.5.
ABN-Amro gained Fl 1 to Fl 66.60 with strong foreign demand noted. After the
bourse closed, the Dutch state said it had selected the bank to lead the
privatisation of the Dutch PTT.
MADRID heard Spain's state-owned power company, Endesa, deny reports in a
Spanish economic newspaper that it was to distribute Pta50bn to its
competitors. However, Endesa fell Pta70 to Pta5,460 as the rest of the
sector rose. The general index closed 1.65 higher at 294.23.
VIENNA pursued Frankfurt
with the ATX index up 19.82, or nearly 2 per cent to 1,027.13, its highest
since March, 1992.
ISTANBUL dropped 5.3 per cent, the composite index closing 821.5 lower at a
provisional 14,617.6. However, turnover dropped from TL1,350bn to TL786bn
and brokers said the decline in trading volume showed that there was no
strong selling sentiment.
ATHENS greeted the Socialist general election victory with the general share
index down 14.34, or 1.7 per cent at 831.05 in thin trading. This followed a
gain of nearly 3 per cent last Friday.
WARSAW's general optimism prevailed over political fears linked to a
left-wing victory in elections last month, the WIG index rising 333.5, or
4.9 per cent to 7,164.8, in turnover of just over 1,000bn zloty (Dollars
50m).

FT  12 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Mixed views on highs in Germany, Hong

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
European equity markets put in an impressive performance last week, rising
at double the level of the FT Actuaries World Index, with several bourses
hitting all-time highs.
Mr Marcus Grubb of Salomon Brothers notes that increased buying by US
investors was rumoured to be behind the rallies. Net sales of US mutual
funds this year have reached Dollars 180bn, he says; during the last two
months, the amount of new cash flowing into foreign funds has exceeded
Dollars 1bn a week. He adds that some global funds have increased their
weighting in foreign assets to more than 20 per cent.
'The bullish medium-term arguments for European equities are compelling,' he
says. 'In a recessionary environment with high savings ratios, low inflation
and falling interest rates, liquidity will flow towards long-term financial
assets. This flood of liquidity will continue unless spending picks up on
consumption, investment and real assets or, alternatively, inflation
pressures build up, reversing the trend in interest rates. Neither of these
scenarios,' he maintains, 'is likely to occur in Europe in the near future.'
Germany was one beneficiary of the foreign investment process. The end of
the fighting in Moscow triggered an 80 point rally which took the DAX index
to a new all-time high above the 2,000 level.
According to the UBS global research team, the low selling pressure during
the course of the Russian turmoil indicated that investors were willing to
hold their positions in German stocks. They say that stabilisation around
the 2,000 level in the DAX seems likely in the short term.
UBS expects financials to outperform but sees a good opportunity to take
profits in the retailing sector, given the gloomy outlook for disposable
income and consumer expenditure in Germany.
Mr Albert Edwards at Kleinwort Benson takes a more bearish view of German
equities, believing that the German market 'has all to do with liquidity and
little to do with valuations'.
'In all markets that are financed by a wall of foreign liquidity,' he says,
'there always remains the risk of a sudden reversal . . . With US mutual
funds notoriously fickle, we prefer the liquidity situation in France.'
Mr Edwards believes that the profits outlook will disappoint in Germany and
that the fundamentals are falling into place for underperformance.
He takes the same view of Hong Kong which surged to a succession of record
high closes during the first four days of last week, and took itself to a
new record high yesterday in response to increases in the weightings of the
market by a number of US houses.
Mr Edwards comments that, having previously convinced itself that no
slowdown was in sight in Hong Kong, the market now believes that, although
the economy is slowing, there will be a soft landing: 'Soft-landing is a
word we used to hear a lot of in the late 1980s about western economies -
and it came to nothing,' he says.
'The first two quarters of China's slowdown has come to an end and the
current quarter should start to see the real pain beginning and intensifying
in the first quarter of 1994. Cutting money supply growth from 50 per cent
to 20 per cent will be a shuddering experience. Hong Kong,' he concludes,
'remains vulnerable from a draining of Chinese liquidity.'
Norway was another strong performer last week after a month characterised by
profit-taking in connection with the general election and weaker
international markets.
Ms Tone Varmann of Unibors in Copenhagen sees the market focusing this month
on a crop of interim results and the new government's 1994 budget, due to be
released tomorrow.

FT  12 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Seoul up before
transactions deadline
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE were another four record highs in the region, but Seoul, still some
way short of its mid-year peak, probably came top for topicality as it rose
ahead of today's deadline for 'false name' transactions and holdings.
Tokyo and Taiwan were closed for public holidays.
SEOUL had reported fears of a massive, last minute withdrawal of funds from
bank and stock accounts by large depositors in an effort to hide their money
from the tax collectors.
In the event, the market chose to anticipate government market boosting
measures after today's deadline for implementing the 'real-name' financial
system, and the composite index ended 9.74 higher at 722.09 in turnover of
Won396.7bn, compared with Won209.3bn during Saturday's half-day session.
Sammi Corp and Sammi Steel went limit-down, losing Won600 each to Won10,300
and Won10,400 respectively, following unconfirmed rumours about the group.
HONG KONG scored its sixth rise in seven sessions, the Hang Seng index
climbing 186.62, or 2.3 per cent to a new record high of 8,192.18 as
overseas money continued to come into the market, and domestic investors
followed suit.
Turnover was a provisional HKDollars 5.48bn, up from HKDollars 3.86bn on
Friday. Property companies were traded heavily, Sun Hung Kai rising
HKDollars 2.75 to HKDollars 45.25 following last week's 43 per cent jump in
profits.
Henderson Land soared by HKDollars 4.50, or 19 per cent to HKDollars 28.70
on news of a USDollars 400m bond issue convertible after three years into
shares in its Henderson China Holdings unit, which is not even listed yet.
AUSTRALIA consolidated its break through the 2,000 level and advanced again,
the All Ordinaries index closing at another post-1987 crash high of 2,039.8,
up 13.6.
Continuing foreign interest and a rise in the gold price helped push the
index higher. Golds put on 35.9 to 2,130.2 following a USDollars 2.00 rise
in bullion prices over the weekend.
Overall, turnover was light at ADollars 314.22m.
MANILA hit another record high as it rode the sharp rise of Philippine Long
Distance Telephone (PLDT) on Wall Street, the composite index ending 43.81,
or more than 2 per cent higher at 2,026.53.
Combined Manila/Makati turnover rose from 667.4m pesos to 742.8m. PLDT,
which turned over 55m pesos by itself, climbed by 55 pesos, or 3.8 per cent
to 1,520 pesos.
KUALA LUMPUR extended its rally on the back of strong speculative and
institutional buying, the KLSE composite index closing 10.53 higher at a new
record high of 895.15 as volume rose from 702.6m shares to 839.1m.
Brokers said that the strong presence of foreign institutions continued to
inject liquidity into the market, which has been driven by anticipation of a
generous 1994 budget to be presented later this month. They expect the
composite index to test the key 900-point level this week.
SINGAPORE saw healthy interest, generated by the giant flotation of
Singapore Telecom shares due today. The Straits Times Industrial index ended
15.12 higher at 2,046.57.
Sentiment was boosted by the huge size of the Telecom offer - over 1bn
shares at a minimum price of SDollars 2 each. Some dealers said that the
Telecom valuation made other Singapore blue chips look cheap. Analysts,
however, said that the offer was overpriced at 27 times prospective earnings
against the market p/e of 22.
BANGKOK extended its rally into an eighth trading day, the SET index rising
25.10, or 2.3 per cent to 1,123.74 in heavy turnover of Bt16bn.
Active stocks included major property developers and banks. Interest rate
hopes saw Bangkok Land climb Bt7 to Bt140, Tanayong Bt7.50 to Bt84.00 and
Krisda Mahanakorn Bt5 to Bt135. Bangkok Bank jumped Bt6 to Bt153 and Krung
Thai Bank Bt1.50 to Bt52.50.
KARACHI took settlement day in its strike, the KSE index closing 16.12
higher at 1,378.24 on fresh institutional buying.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Markets await German ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL foreign exchange markets held steady yesterday in spite of a
rate cut by the Danish national bank as dealers looked towards today's all
important German ruling on Maastricht and its implications for European
currency union, writes Peter John.
The day began with a sharp mark-down of the US dollar, continuing Friday's
trend on the back of disappointing employment statistics and the expectation
that those figures have set the agenda for the next few weeks.
The US markets were operating at reduced capacity because of Columbus day
celebrations and a public holiday in Japan. Consequently, the dollar lacked
support and slipped in very thin trading, to be quoted at well below DM1.60
in early European dealing.
However, it rose steadily throughout the day as technical positions were
adjusted and by the close it was up at DM1.6040, unchanged on Friday's weak
close.
This was less a justification of the US currency's fundamental value than a
refocus on today's judgment by the German constitutional court on the
validity of the Maastricht Treaty on European union.
If the court votes against the Treaty there could be catastrophic
consequences for a number of leading European currencies.
It is more likely that the court will produce a verdict that agrees with
Maastricht but imposes conditions.
In any event, the D-Mark is likely to be the main gainer and the currency
was firmer against a range of European currencies.
Meanwhile, sterling was generally weaker after indications in the latest
producer prices statistics that some inflationary pressures might be
returning. It closed at DM2.4550 against the D-Mark, down from DM2.4650.
Several economists were taking a very cautious line on inflation yesterday
and cracks were beginning to show in the rate-cut-by-November argument.
Much depends on the outcome of tomorrow's Retail Prices Index figure,
particularly the figure for underlying inflation which excludes the impact
of mortgage interest payments.
Meanwhile, the Danish Krone held steady as the central bank cut its key CD
interest rate by half a percentage point to 8.5 per cents. However,
economists said any hope that this signalled a return of generally lower
interest rates in Europe was misplaced. Danish rates were around 11 per cent
after the crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism broke in early
August and were merely returning to conventional levels.
The Greek drachma came under pressure in early trading after the Socialist
victory in Sunday's election. The Drachma opened at Dr146.50 against the
D-Mark in light trading down from Friday's fixing at Dr145.48 but by the
close in London dealers were quoting it at Dr144.75.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Short sterling stalled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VARIOUS vacuums affected the UK money markets yesterday. The Tory party
conference had given no real cause for concern, the latest economic data
produced nothing of real import, liquidity was not unacceptable and the
market was on hold, writes Peter John.
Financial futures traded marginally lower and Bank of England operations
went ahead smoothly if not quite as effortlessly as last week.
The December contract for short sterling was down by one basis point to
94.37 at the close on gentle turnover of around 12,500 contracts. French and
German cash futures were also weaker on balance.
December short sterling has traded within a very tight range between around
94.32 and 94.38 for some time as the market has sat back waiting for some
indication of the long-anticipated rate cut.
One sterling dealer said: 'Basically, we have had the same interest rate for
nine months and the market is hungry for change.'
A number of market operators were surprised at lack of bad news from the
party conference. What they saw as neutral to non-inflationary producer
price statistics did not give a boost to the argument for another rate cut
in the next few weeks.
Several analysts pointed to the 2 per cent fall in import prices which might
be expected be expected to follow through to lower prices in the high
street.
There was suspicion that the gilts market might be homing in on something
different. Government bond prices were weaker across the board and a fall in
bond prices often signals concern that inflation might be on the turn.
Generally, the market is looking nervously towards the key retail price
index figures tomorrow and several economists are predicting small rises in
underlying inflation, the index that excludes mortgage interest payments.
SGST, the French owned securities house, predicts a 0.1 point rise in
September to 3.1 per cent.
Interbank operations began the week with a forecast liquidity shortage of
Pounds 1.05bn, later revised to Pounds 1.2bn. The pressure of the shortage
was defused early on after the Bank of England provided Pounds 412m of
assistance.
This was followed by further injections of Pounds 6m and Pounds 545m topped
off with late assistance at an unspecified rate of Pounds 50m bringing the
total to Pounds 1.013bn.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Survey of Four Cities Partnership (10): New and harsh
realities - Halle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEFORE the unification of Germany there was hardly an ambitious communist
party apparatchik who did not want to be promoted to run the eastern German
city of Halle.
It was a powerful sinecure. Its importance as a party post lay primarily in
the region's old industrial base, which in turn had bred a radical socialist
movement. Not surprisingly, the city's nickname, 'Red Halle', was coined
long before east Germany's communists assumed power in 1949.
The city's economy was anchored on heavy industry, consisting of
machine-tool manufacturing, chemicals, and brown coal. These were the three
main engines which also drove the east German economy. But they were never
tested on the world market. After the declaration of German unification on
October 3 1991, preceded by monetary union which did away with the Ost Mark,
the eastern German currency, the inhabitants of Halle were faced with a new
and harsh reality: its industry was uncompetitive.
Without huge restructuring, investment, and privatisation, this region of
Saxony-Anhalt would never be able to compete either on the domestic or the
world markets. These are some of the challenges facing the 300,000 strong
population of this city, the birthplace of George Friedrich Handel.
To meet this challenge, the Treuhand, the agency charged with privatising
and restructuring eastern German industry, placed almost the entire
industrial network of Halle and its environs under its control. It brought
in western German managers to introduce new accounting methods in the
enterprises, reduce inefficiency, and above all, prepare the manufacturing,
brown coal, and chemicals sectors for privatisation. There is hardly an
inhabitant of Halle who has not been affected by these sweeping changes.
The most fundamental changes have occurred at the work place. Instead of
employment for life, more than 124,000 people have lost their jobs. This
does not include the 14,500 on short-time work, or the 46,100 on job
creation schemes. In all, the total unemployment rate in Halle is 40 per
cent of the labour force.
The virtual collapse of the industrial base, combined with high
unemployment, has had a debilitating affect on the city's finances. Mr Klaus
Rauen, the mayor of Halle, says the city is running a budget deficit of 70
per cent. The annual budget is DM1bn.
'What would you expect?' he said in his office overlooking Halle's old,
elegant, but neglected town square. 'Without revenue from industry, and
without people working, it will be a long time before we even approach the
level of financing to similar-sized cities in western Germany.'
Mr Rauen gives a poignant example. Bonn and Halle have the same size
population. While the latter was, and is still dependent on industry, the
economy of the former is fuelled by services. Thus, more than DM250m revenue
from services is earned by Bonn's city council each year. In Halle, revenue
from industry totals DM18m, and total tax revenue does not exceed DM65m.
Narrowing the gap between expenditure and revenue is now one of the key
tasks facing Halle's administration. The question is how.
There is no doubt, that, in common with the other cities and states in
eastern Germany, Halle will be reliant on financial transfers from Bonn for
many years to come. Annual transfers to the five eastern states total
DM180bn gross. However, the future economic growth of Halle will depend on
what happens to two key sectors: the chemical and brown coal industry.
These two sectors are located less than half-an-hour's drive from Halle.
To the north-east lies Bitterfeld, home to Germany's chemical industry
before the second world war and one of the first big manufacturing centres
of Germany's own industrial revolution of the late nineteenth century. After
1945 the Allies broke up the huge industrial conglomerates led by, among
others, IG Fraben and Bayer. After 1949 the entire region, in common with
other parts of the east German economy, was placed under state control.
Until 1990, the regime was more intent on extensive development, determined
to become the main industrial country in Comecon, the former socialist
trading bloc. But the price was heavy. The industry proved to be
uncompetitive after unification. And environmental standards were ignored,
leading to soil pollution on such a scale that more than a third of
Bitterfeld's chemical sites are unlikely to be fit for use again.
The Treuhand and west German investors are now slowly turning Bitterfeld
around. It will take several years. But Mr Klaus Schucht, head of chemicals
and mining at the Treuhand, and one of the most energetic officials working
to open up the region to competition, has no doubt that Bitterfeld will have
potential in one important aspect: by attracting through generous investment
grants and tax holidays, companies such as Bayer, the pharmaceuticals and
chemcial manufacturers, and others, will create a competitive industrial
base.
After all, these green-field sites will bring with them very high
technological standards. But green field sites and high technology do not
create many jobs. 'That is true,' says Mr Schucht. 'But you must remember
that these new, capital intensive industries, coupled with research and
development, have to be serviced, and it will be attractive for other
investors.'
Signs of a services sector are already emerging in Halle itself. These
consist of handwerken - small work shops employing fewer than 10 people,
which specialise in anything ranging from car and house repairs, to computer
programming and engineering.
Mr Michael Wilkens, head of Deutsche Bank in Halle says that these work
shops, together with the mittelstand, the small and medium sized industries
which formed the backbone of western Germany's post-war growth, are
sprouting up. But he recognises the need for an industrial base, however
small, to act as a magnate for the mittelstand.
Apart from the future development of Bitterfeld, Halle's economy will also
depend on the Mitteldeutsche Braunkohle, or Mibrag, the giant lignite fields
which straddle Saxony-Anhalt. An Anglo-American consortium led by Britain's
PowerGen, NRG of Minneapolis, and Morrison Knudsen of Idaho are set to sign
contract later this month to buy Mibrag. Although Mibrag's pre-1989 work
force of over 50,000 has been reduced to under 10,000, the consortium is
committed to turning the mines round.
Certainly these two sectors alone will not revitalise Halle's entire
economy. Construction and services are already playing a key role, as any
visitor to Halle will testify - it is hard to avoid the bulldozers and the
scaffolding. But together, all three sectors will eventually generate tax
revenue. The budget deficit will remain. But at least it might narrow over
time.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Survey of Four Cities Partnership (13): Persistent and
determined - Klaus Rauen, mayor of Halle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFE would have been much simpler and easier for Mr Klaus Rauen if he had
stayed in Bonn. But Mr Rauen, the former Christian Democratic Union mayor of
Germany's seat of government, is a restless man who rises to challenges.
German unification provided the perfect opportunity. 'I wanted to contribute
to this great event. I felt that by becoming mayor in Halle, I could really
help to do something.'
He took up office in the city's Rathaus in May 1991. But instead of the
normal eight-hour day he was accustomed to in Bonn, Mr Rauen now works at
least 12 hours.
His time is divided between reforming the local administration, meeting
foreign investors, opening new enterprises, visiting schools, and above all,
helping to restore the self-confidence of Halle's community.
Mr Rauen, who is 57 years old, believes the self-esteem of the eastern
Germans has been shattered largely because of what happened after German
unification. 'People here feel ashamed in the sense that they feel that
everything they had worked for over the past 40 years under the former
communist regime was a complete waste of time,' he says. 'They feel
disorientated because they feel they were living in a system which had lost
any respect. We must restore that self-confidence.'
One of the ways Mr Rauen has set about this is by trying to restore parts of
the old city. Unlike other cities in eastern Germany, Halle was not
seriously damaged during the second world war. Its elegant central square is
still intact. But its elegance has been impaired by dull, concrete buildings
put up by the former communist administration.
'There was no need to put these buildings up around the square. But I feel
that the former regime wanted to destroy memory, or a kind of historical
consciousness. I want to help restore the best of Halle's past,' explains Mr
Rauen. The fact that George Friedrich Handel, the composer, was born in the
city, has helped. But one name is hardly enough to compensate for 40 years
which led to the complete neglect of the infrastructure. Nor is it enough to
shake up the local administration so as to attract west German and foreign
investment which could help revitalise and renovate the city.
Mr Rauen has the misfortune to be saddled with the old communist local
council constitution.
This means that he cannot dismiss certain senior officials, even though they
may be incompetent. One particular official is in charge of settling
property disputes. The current law states that all owners of property
confiscated by the Nazis between 1933 and 1945, and by the communists
between 1949 and 1990, are allowed either restitution or compensation.
'We have been so slow in resolving these disputes,' explains Mr Rauen. 'In
fact, Halle is one of the slowest in eastern Germany. We have settled only 6
per cent of all cases.' He says the city's solicitor is partly to blame. 'He
just looks for problems, rather than solutions,' he adds.
The upshot is that the 11,000 old delapidated houses and apartments in the
centre of the city are still the subject of property disputes. The longer
they take to resolve, the greater cost for repair. And investors will stay
away . . .
Another problem facing Mr Rauen is the size of the local administration. In
common with all city councils in eastern Germany, he inherited a bloated
bureaucracy of 13,000. He wants to pare it down bo 4,000 by the end of the
year. After that, by law, the staff at the city hall will have tenure.
Pushing through cut-backs might be blocked by Halle's coalition, in which
the social democrats, the PDS, the former communists, and the Greens hold
the majority, while the CDU holds 30 per cent of the council seats.
But Mr Rauen is a persistent man. 'We have to turn round the city and make
it more efficient. It's the price we have to pay for the past four decades.'

FT  12 OCT 93 / Survey of Four Cities Partnership (12): Drive for investment
 -Halle seeks to be self-sustaining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMONG the more pessimistic economists on eastern Germany, there is a school
of thought which argues that the five new eastern states will be relegated
to the status of Mezzogiorno.
That is, their economies will be akin to southern Italy, or indeed the
southern republics of the former Yugoslavia, devoid of an indigenous
economic and industrial base, and completely dependent on the richer north
to subsidise and sustain them. If this theory is applied to Halle in
particular, or eastern Germany as a whole, then the conclusion is that there
is no prospect of the region moving towards a self-sustaining economy.
Don't tell that to the people of Halle.
Not only because they would be deeply offended - and depressed. It is
difficult enough, coming to terms with high unemployment. But they would
point out that the Mezzogiorno theory should not have, and cannot have, any
credibility in a region of eastern Germany so traditionally strong in
finance, commerce, and the arts. A walk around the city explains why.
Starting from Marktplatz, the city's old town square, you see fine, elegant
town houses built in the 19th century, which were homes to the city's former
business community. That community, specialising in industry, developed a
local banking and trading system which used the Rathaus or city hall, to
lobby their interests.
Walk across the town square and you will see the Rathaus - just about. It is
currently decked with scaffolding, undergoing a much-needed refurbishment.
Go past the Rathaus and ramble down towards Number 5, George-Schumann-Platz.
There you will come across the Industrie und Handelskammer, or IHK, the
co-ordinating body for trade and commerce which has branches all over
Germany.
Halle's own IHK branch was originally established on this site more than a
century ago. History interrupted its work. After the second world war, the
local communist party used the IHK as its headquarters - despite the
interior design, whose fine woodwork, engravings, and imperial emblems
contrasted sharply with the party's hammer and sickle.
Three years after unification, the IHK has regained its rightful place. It
is now a thriving centre, set on promoting the city as a Standort, or
location, for investment.
'Halle. Der Standort', may seem an ambitious slogan for the city's drive to
attract investment. But then, apart from its old industrial base, it is easy
to forget that one of the keys to western Germany's post-war economic
success was the way in which the government forged close links between
research institutes, universities and enterprises.
These links, which earlier had helped forge Germany's own industrial
revolution in the 1890s, were used for ideological purposes by the former
eastern German communist regime.
But once again they are playing a greater role in training a younger
generation for the market economy. Mr Klaus Rauen, the mayor, is determined
to link local industry with the centres of higher education.
At his disposal he has the Martin-Luther University, the respected School
for Art and Design at Giebichenstein, the Environment Research Centre, and
the Institute for Economic Forecasting, one of the six economic think-tanks
which advises Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
But Halle is now only about commerce and the drive to restore its economy.
Unbelievably for a city of 300,000 inhabitants, it has an opera house, four
theatres, one concert hall, six museums, the great Gallery Moritzburg and a
respected orchestra.
You won't be bored in Halle. But there are two warnings. At rush hour, avoid
driving into Halle on the motorway from Leipzig. The congestion is horrific.
And, to avoid upsetting your hosts, don't ask if Halle is akin to the
Mezzogiorno. The people of Halle have a long memory, and a 1,000 year-old
history.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Survey of Four Cities Partnership (11): The velocipede
started it - Karlsruhe scientists have a long tradition of co-operation with
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KARLSRUHE'S reputation as a technology centre dates back to 1815 when one
Baron Karl Friedrich Freiherr von Drais invented the velocipede, the
forerunner of the bicycle.
It spoils the story only slightly to know that the baron subsequently moved
to Mannheim - it was there, rather than in Karlsruhe, that he patented his
invention and began industrial production.
Other 19th century inventors include the machine-builder Emil Kessler who
started making locomotives in Karlsruhe in 1842, and Heinrich Hertz who
discovered magnetic waves in the town in 1888.
Coupled with the foundation of the Polytechnical School in 1825 - the
forerunner of the Technical University and today's Fridericiana University -
this points to a long tradition of co-operation between Karlsruhe scientists
and industry.
This tradition is alive today in a city which boasts where 10,000 scientists
work - more per head of the population than any other part of Germany. There
are three Fraunhofer institutes which specialise in the scientific research
which has a practical industrial application.
The Fridericiana University has close links with industry - especially via
the Computer Sciences Research Centre, which works with companies such as
IBM and Nixdorf in developing information technology.
There is also the Technology Factory, an institution founded in the early
1980s at the initiative of Mr Lothar Spath, the then president of the state
of Baden-Wurttemberg.
He came back from visit to Silicon Valley in California inspired by the idea
to set up a co-called 'innovation centre' which would promote
technology-oriented start-ups and help replace jobs lost in more traditional
manufacturing industry. Housed in a former sewing-machine factory, the
Technologie Fabrik is now the largest institution of its kind in Germany.
Founded with the help of DM14m in state funds, the Technologie Fabrik now
houses 40 firms and six institutes, which collectively employ between 600
and 800. Entrepreneurs present their business plan to the Factory's
administrators. If the plan is accepted, the fledgling company can stay for
a maximum of five years, starting on a peppercorn rent which increases over
the course of the tenancy.
The Factory's administration provides secretarial and other support services
to the tenants, and advice on how to raise finance.
Since the centre was founded, a handful of tenants have gone bankrupt, but
the survivors far out-number the normal 70 per cent success rate for
start-ups in Germany. In total, 1,400 jobs have been created since the
factory was founded: an appreciable contribution to Karlsruhe's workforce of
180,000.
The biggest existing tenant is a company called INIT, which has 70 employees
specialising in communications equipment for the transport sector.
Of the 30 tenants which have moved out, the most successful is probably
Pipetronix, a company which devised electronic equipment for identifying
faults within pipelines. The company now employs 250 people and was sold in
February 1992 to Preussag, the Hanover-based conglomerate.
Pipetronix also benefited from co-operation with the Kernforschungszentrum
Karlsruhe. Literally translated, this is the Nuclear Research Centre, but it
does not limit itself to nuclear research: it has developed expertise in
environmental technology, information technology, microsystems technology
and cellular and molecular biology.
Dr Jurgen Wust, head of the centre's Technology Transfer Co-ordination
Office, explains that the centre plays an active role in seeking industrial
applications which emerge from these research areas. 'We market ourselves
aggressively,' Dr Wust says, 'concentrating on licensing and patenting what
we discover here.'
One such patent was the sensor which is at the core of Pipetronix's pipeline
equipment. The centre has 320 licensing arrangements and is working on 70
formal projects in co-operation with industry; since it was founded in 1956
it has worked with 5,000 different industrial companies.
Karlsruhe is confident that its historical connection with technology will
guarantee its future. As a measure of its confidence in the future, the city
will start to build a 30 hectare technology park early next year and the
technology factory is set to be enlarged by a further 8000m squared.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Survey of Four Cities Partnership (8): Relatively resilient
 -Karlsruhe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KARLSRUHE can legitimately claim to be Germany's dream city.
According to legend, the town came into being after the Margrave
Karl-Wilhelm von Baden-Durlach fell asleep under a tree after a day's
hunting. He dreamt of a splendid palace, with pathways leading up to the
building like a fan. On waking he determined to move his court from Durlach
and build the palace on the spot where he slept. Thus in 1715 Carol's-Ruhe -
'Charles' Peace' - was founded.
It is no exaggeration to say that modern Karlsruhe retains the charm
identified by its founder more than two and a half centuries ago. With
273,000 inhabitants it is the 20th largest city in Germany, bright and open.
At its centre is the palace built by the margrave, and the expanse of the
Marktplatz, surrounded by the 18th century facades built by the architect
Friedrich Weinbrenner.
Following the contours of the dream, the rest of the city spreads out,
fan-like, from the centre, its suburbs interspersed with parkland. The local
food is more refined than the average German fare, reflecting the influence
of France, barely 20km away. The scenic delights of Alsace and the Black
Forest are likewise not far away.
Karlruhe is a pleasant place to live, work and study, with none of the
abrasive qualities of many of Germany's bigger cities. 'It retains many of
the qualities of a small town but lacks nothing that a large city can
offer,' claims Mr Horst Zajonc, head of the city's business promotion
office.
The third largest city in the south-western state of Baden-Wurttemberg,
after Stuttgart and Mannheim, Karlsruhe came late to industrialisation. In
time of European warfare its geographical position close to the French
border discouraged investment in manufacturing industry. Until 1952 it was
the capital of the state of Baden, giving the city a reputation as
'civil-servant' city.
Germany's federal constitutional court ensures that Karlsruhe still plays a
role as an administrative centre, but the city's regional importance
diminished after Baden merged with the state of Wurttemberg to form what
developed into the most prosperous of western Germany's Lander, and the city
of Stuttgart became the state capital.
For years Karlsruhe trailed behind Stuttgart, as the former state of Baden
failed to develop as successfully as Wurttemberg - or Swabia, as the eastern
half of the state is called. Swabia is an almost mythical land, its
inhabitants fabled for their love of independence and hard work; technically
minded entrepreneurs who built up corporate giants such as Daimler-Benz -
Germany's biggest industrial company - or Robert Bosch, the car components
group, not to mention dozens of medium-sized or Mittelstand companies which
acted as the motor of Germany's post-war economic miracle.
The charms of Baden, its scenery and its vineyards, did not appear to
compensate for the success of Swabia; Karlsruhe had to work hard to fashion
for itself an identity. The city has built itself up as a technology centre
(a term reflecting the presence of more scientists as a percentage of the
population than anywhere in Germany), an abundance of research centres, and
the Fridericiana Technical University, founded in 1825 and the oldest of its
kind in Germany, together with many other technically-orientated higher
education establishments.
Research institutes in the city include the federal nuclear research centre
(Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe); three Fraunhofer institutes (one for
system technology and innovation research, one for chemical technology,
another for information technology and data processing, which is a special
strength of the local university); a research centre for informatics;
federal institutes for mathematics and data-processing, for nutrition, for
hydraulic engineering; the state institute for environmental protection.
Some 10,000 people are employed in the city's research institutes. There are
also numerous other institutes which specialise in converting research
results into commercially viable products and processes. Karlsruhe has
linked up with seven municipalities and two rural districts in Baden to form
the so-called TechnologieRegion Karlsruhe, proudly sold as a mixture of
'high-life and high-tech'.
For decades, the 'ideas factories' of Karlsruhe and neighbouring towns were
not enough to give Baden the edge against the real factories of Wurttemberg.
Now, amid Germany's worst recession since the second world war, the tables
have been somewhat turned.
The Stuttgart region's dependence on the car-making industry and on
machine-tool manufacturing means that Wurttemberg has become a German crisis
region. Unemployment is higher than it has ever been. GDP for the state of
Baden-Wurttemberg fell more sharply in the first six months of the year than
for western Germany - by 4 per cent compared to 2.6 per cent.
It is easy to exaggerate the problems of the Stuttgart region - after all,
its decline is from a very high base - but there is no doubting that it is
suffering badly amid a crisis in the European car making industry and the
collapse in world demand for capital goods which has hit the state's
machine-tool industry particularly badly. By contrast, Karlsruhe's economy,
while hardly immune from Germany's recession, is looking more resilient.
'For the first time in 10 years our unemployment figures are better than the
average for the state as a whole,' Zajonc of the business promotion office
says gleefully. In July last year unemployment in the city was 4.9 per cent
compared to 4.6 per cent for Baden-Wurttemberg. In July this year
unemployment had risen to 6.5 per cent for Karlsruhe - and to 6.7 per cent
for the entire Land.
This relative resilience reflects the structure of Karlsruhe's economy: less
dependent on manufacturing and on big companies than Baden-Wurttemberg as a
whole. Manufacturing accounts for about a third of the city's jobs. The
average number of employees at the region's 10,000 companies is 180.
The service sector is well-represented: big local employers include the
Karlsruhe Lebensversicherung life insurance company; the Badenia
Bausparkassen investment company; the Landeskreditbank Baden-Wurttemberg, a
regional bank; and the Heinrich Heine mail-order firm.
The region's heavy reliance on research institutes is not good for
Karlsruhe's employment outlook: they are mainly public-sector bodies feeling
the impact of the German government's need to cut expenditure. At the
Kernforschungszentrum, for example, where 90 per cent of its DM700m budget
comes from government grants, the workforce is set to shrink by 480 people -
about 15 per cent - by the end of 1995.
Despite the clouds of unemployment, one fact ensures that Karlsruhe
maintains some of the dream-like qualities of its origins. It gets more
sunshine than any other city in Germany.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Survey of Four Cities Partnership (9): Judicious watchdog -
Hans-Georg Zierlein of the constitutional court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the past few months Mr Hans-Georg Zierlein, director of the German
constitutional court in Karlsruhe, has been watching with some horror the
events unfolding in Moscow.
It was not so much the collapse of the Russian economy, or the political
confusion, or even the sight of tanks firing rockets at the Russian
parliament, which shocked him. It was the extraordinary political behaviour
of the Russian constitutional court.
Mr Zierlein is director of the German federal constitutional court in
Karlsruhe, spokesman for the court, head of protocol and chief of security,
just to name a few of his functions.
He is not a judge, although he is qualified to be one, and has written
learned papers on the functions of the court. Indeed, if he were a judge, he
would have been long gone from the job: they must leave after a maximum 12
years. Mr Zierlein has been in charge of the court's administration for 20
years, and in Karlsruhe for 23. And he remains irrepressibly enthusiastic.
'You must not think that we are remotely like that constitutional court in
Moscow. The president of the court there appears to be totally political,'
he says. 'We have never been anywhere near that. Very occasionally, this
court is accused of stepping across the borderline between the law and
politics. Perhaps it is inevitable. But we are talking about the 499th case
out of 500.
'It is recognised everywhere, inside Germany and abroad, that this court is
an independent court. Our independence has played an important role in the
stability and credibility of the German Federal Republic.'
If Karlsruhe features in the headlines of the German press, then the chances
are that the cause is the federal constitutional court. Alongside the
staunchly independent German Bundesbank, it is the institution which has
done most to give German citizens a belief in the resilience of their
post-war democracy, and the revival of a law-based state after the Nazi era.
'People trying to transform their countries from dictatorship to democracy
look to our case as an example,' Mr Zierlein says proudly.
The court is modestly tucked away in a grey marble-faced modern block in the
palace gardens, self-effacing like so many of the federal republic's
post-war institutions. Nonetheless, the court is being forced to play an
ever greater role in German life, with a steady increase in the flow of
complaints and appeals and constitutional quarrels being passed on to its
judges by the political institutions of the state.
For a supreme court, it has the unusual distinction of being a single
entity, but it is divided into two chambers, or senates, each consisting of
eight red-robed judges. 'In 1951, when the court was founded, there were 800
cases in one senate, and none in the other,' says Mr Zierlein. 'So they had
to change the division of powers, to balance the workload.'
The number of approaches to the court now totals more than 4,000 a year.
This year, the second senate alone has had to deal with reform of the
abortion law, challenges to the Maastricht treaty, the dispute on where and
when German troops can serve outside the Nato area, and the complaint by
former East German spies that they cannot be tried under West German law for
their offences.
The system is certainly creaking under the strain. But Mr Zierlein is not
complaining. The court must remain scrupulously non-political, and seek to
interfere in the political process as little as possible, he says - on the
lines of the US Supreme Court concept of judicial self-restraint. The very
fact that it is being used so much shows that it works.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Survey of Four Cities Partnership (7): Sefam's show case -
Nancy ideas and techniques enter the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WE will now probably go for external growth and make an acquisition or two
 -we've got plenty of cash,' says Mr Pierrick Haan, president of Sefam, a
company which did not exist 10 years ago but is now the French market leader
in breathing equipment for patients being treated at home.
Sefam (Societe d'Etudes et Fabrication d'Appareillage Medical) is a show
case example of how ideas and techniques in the laboratories of Nancy and
the surrounding area can be successfully brought to market.
In his brand new offices in the Brabois science park on Nancy's southern
outskirts, Mr Haan recalls how he and another engineer at the INSERM
national health institute in Nancy, in 1983, conceived the idea of making
small series of specialist equipment. But he says that their company only
took off a couple of years later, when they started to make a respiratory
machine invented by a Strasbourg neurologist.
'We were lucky enough to fall into an enormous market,' says Mr Haan. The
machine caters for serious snorers who suffer breathing and sleep
interruption, and for chronic sufferers from bronchitis and emphysema. Last
year Sefam sold some 4,000 respiratory machines, half in France and half in
the rest of Europe.
Its equipment does not come cheap; its Continuous Positive Pressure machine
sells for about FFr10,000. But the cost is generally borne by governments
(except the UK's National Health Service, which is even more short of cash
than its continental counterparts), because these machines allow patients to
be treated at home - cheaper than hospital care.
With a FFr70m annual turnover now, Sefam may have reached saturation point
in respiratory equipment, but Mr Haan intends to target other 'home care'
products such as wheelchairs and electric beds for the handicapped.
Mr Haan says he is not a big fan of the local authorities 'nursery'
programme for infant companies - though Sefam benefited by only paying a
nominal rent for its first two years on the Brabois science park. But that
science park now has 12,000 people working on its 500 hectares. Mr Bernard
Guerrier de Dumast, of Nancy's Development Agency, points out that the
science park depends on bringing the university and business worlds
together. 'This requires constant pressure. The moment you relax this
pressure, the two sides fall apart.'
Someone who has applied constant pressure is Mr Michel Gantois. In addition
to founding a couple of companies in his own field, engineering materials,
he used his 1986-92 presidency of the Institut National Polytechnique to
federate this engineering faculty with Nancy's much larger universities.
Thanks to Mr Gantois' efforts, Nancy's universities, like those of
Strasbourg and Grenoble, are now considered by the French government to form
a pole universitaire europeen.
This is not just a public relations effort to attract European Commission
attention and money. It is a recognition of what Nancy's universities have
done to pool research in areas such as engineering materials, industrial
safety and cleaner manufacturing, and to improve foreign links. Nancy's
French students are being given more facilities to learn foreign languages.
Extra French is laid on to increase the share of foreign students in Nancy.
Nancy is also reaching out to help universities in Poland and Hungary.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Survey of Four Cities Partnership (4): No friend to sacred
cows - Profile / Sir David White
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR David White is tired of waiting for Britain's politicians to reach
agreement on Europe.
The industrialist, regarded by many businessmen in Nottingham as the city's
corporate champion, puts his frustration bluntly: 'We have spent the last 20
years in Parliament arguing about Europe and it's getting in the way of
business. Most companies recognised years ago that we couldn't screw around,
we had to get on with the market.'
Companies faced a clear risk by waiting for parliamentary approval: their
overseas competitors would proceed without them - forging alliances to pave
the way for orders worth millions of pounds. If businessmen regarded the
European Community with the same suspicion as the Euro-sceptics at
Westminster, lucrative contracts would have been lost and thousands of jobs
threatened, says Sir David.
Speaking in his oak-panelled office at Nottingham Health Authority (which
Sir David has added to his clutch of chairman-posts, along with Nottingham
Trent University and Mansfield Brewery), he says that securing such
contracts depends on creating a climate of mutual trust between trading
partners.
As an initiative to foster that trust, the Four Cities Partnership is a
valuable asset - albeit a delayed one - for companies operating out of
Nottingham, he adds. 'It may be that we've got away with it because other
countries such as the US have not taken advantage of the EC market while
we've been faffing around.'
Now that the partnership has been formed, Sir David - a former deputy
chairman of National Freight Consortium and founder chairman of Nottingham
Development Enterprise - says companies should waste no time in exploiting
the opportunity to establish a greater presence in Europe.
Citing the success of the Mansfield Brewery in winning export orders to
Russia, he warns companies to develop a keen sense of customer tastes if
they are to win the kind of contracts that secure jobs at home. 'It's not
just about getting your feet under the boardroom table but under the kitchen
table. We must make every effort to understand our customers - if we get to
know them culturally then we can judge their foibles and moods.'
Winning the trust of companies and politicians overseas demands flexibility
among executives and councillors in Nottingham. Sir David says businessmen
may have to give up some sacred cows if they are to establish that trust -
primarily the adherence to sterling rather than a single European currency.
Sir David sees the Four Cities Partnership's main role as changing
perceptions over links with Europe. 'If it creates closer relations that
would be helpful, but it's really just setting the scene rather than
producing jobs.'

FT  12 OCT 93 / Survey of Four Cities Partnership (3): Motorists queue to
get in - Nottingham plans a new transit system to relieve pressure on roads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

TRAVELLING into Nottingham can be wearing. Rush-hour commuters know they are
near the city centre when the traffic grinds to a halt.
The capital of the East Midlands has congestion worthy of a metropolis three
times the size. At peak times, queues of motorists joust with buses, which
have crowded into the city following deregulation and the decision of rival
companies to compete head-on.
Planning officials have inadvertently made the problem worse by turning a
number of city streets into pedestrian malls, leading to delays and jams on
remaining roads when buses stop to pick up passengers or trucks make
deliveries. To the west of the city, the congestion stretches into the
suburbs where motorists travelling in from the M1 motorway are filtered on
to a single-lane road.
Mr Malcolm Reece, chief executive of Nottingham Development Enterprise, has
no illusions about the dilemma. 'Compared with similar European cities our
infrastructure is a problem. Our road links are poor - you have to queue to
get into the city. That is a bad sign.'
Aware of the deterrent effect of poor infrastructure to businesses and
consumers, Nottingham is planning a new transport system to ease the jams.
The city is going back to the future. Like other British cities which ripped
up tramlines in the 1950s, Nottingham is looking wistfully at light rail
systems to take pressure off the roads.
Planners in the East Midlands are following the example of their colleagues
in Manchester, Sheffield and Birmingham, which all have new transit systems
in operation or under development.
Although systems elsewhere in the UK are more advanced, Nottingham
Development Enterprise (NDE), which is masterminding the project, says it
has been successful in forging links with overseas cities with rapid transit
systems in place.
Citing the advantages of rapid transit - involving light rail carriages
capable of running on regular railway track or mingling with road traffic on
street rails - NDE claims that a similar system in Grenoble 'immediately
attracted 65,000 users every day'.
Karlsruhe, one of the prime movers in the Four Cities Partnership, has also
offered technical expertise to Nottingham. German officials have acted as
advisers on proposals for a Pounds 65m line stretching north from the city
centre to the outlying village of Hucknall.
Advice from Karlsruhe has focused on the German city's pioneering model of
track sharing between trams and regular trains. If adopted in Nottingham,
trams would intermingle with trains on a five mile section of track
currently operated by Regional Railways, the division of British Rail,
between the suburb of Basford and Hucknall.
Officials at VBK and AVG, the two companies operating the Karlsruhe system,
have also offered information on vehicle selection, maintenance and civil
engineering. The aims - to relieve congestion, attract more consumers,
retailers and new businesses into the city - are laudable. But there is
considerable doubt over whether it can get off the drawing-board.
The department of transport has told city authorities around Britain that it
can afford to make grants available to one rapid transit system a year. But
Nottingham is some way down the pecking order in the list of applicants.
Sheffield is expected to win the next tranche of state aid for its system,
with Birmingham next in line. After that Croydon, Leeds and Nottingham are
all vying for contention.
With increasing curbs on public sector spending, the government may not be
so well disposed to rapid transit schemes by the time Nottingham reaches the
front of the queue.
'I don't know when the government will have the money,' admits Mr Reece. 'So
we have to spread the risk.'
The enterprise agency is seeking private backing for the venture and says
local companies have raised Pounds 700,000 out of Pounds 2m committed so
far. That leaves a yawning gap in the financial arithmetic; the money raised
is only a fraction of the sums needed and the government may be reluctant to
pick up the shortfall.
Nottingham, however, is determined to reform its transport infrastructure.
It could do worse than looking at Nancy, where the city opted for trolley
buses in preference to trams. Development costs for the system, a hybrid
between buses and light rail, were offset by a levy on businesses.
It could be an attractive option in the East Midlands, where the dreams of a
rapid transit network are a long way from reality. Whichever system the city
chooses, Mr Reece knows there must be a change. 'If there's no public
transport relief the city will lose economically. The consumers and
businesses will go elsewhere.'

FT  12 OCT 93 / Survey of Four Cities Partnership (5): City with a high IQ -
Nancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NANCY is a city with far more self-confidence than the surrounding region of
Lorraine.
This is not surprising. It was always going to be easier for this city of
services, with its three universities, 45,000 students and long cultural
tradition, to adjust to a post-industrial future than Lorraine, hit by the
triple decline of coal, steel and textiles.
Nancy, too, naturally thinks of itself not just on a regional but also a
European scale. Many of the bewildering number of institutions in the city
have 'European' attached to them, (as in the city's 'European university
pole' or 'European enterprise and innovation centre'); or 'international',
as in 'International Water Centre'. It is as if the city believes that
whatever it is doing should automatically be of significance to the wider
world.
If this sounds as though Nancy is getting above its station, it should be
remembered that it did once occupy a rather high station as an independent
principality which only joined France in the mid 18th century.
Its last ruler was Stanislas Leszczynski (1737-66) who, after losing the
throne of Poland in yet another division of that country, accepted
Lorraine's invitation to come and rule it - near to his daughter, who was
married to Louis XV. He then used his own money, and his son-in-law's, to
great effect by creating the Place Stanislas and the rest of the rococo
heart of Nancy.
A century later Lorraine was split into two; Metz and the eastern part were
annexed by Germany from 1870 to 1919, and Nancy was left very much on the
front line as the standard-bearer of French revanchism.
Baron Bernard Guerrier de Dumast, a vice-president of the Greater Nancy
Development Agency (ADUAN) and scion of one of Mancy's oldest families,
describes the legacy of this chequered history. 'First, it made Nancy a far
more Latin city than its neighbours, even to the point of making it more
Florentine than French, a city of intrigue still which harks back to the
time of a prince, a court and courtiers.
'Second, and more positively, it is a city with a capital spirit. Metz
became Lorraine's military and administrative capital, but Nancy remains its
cultural and even economic centre, harbouring no fewer than 450 regional
headquarters of private companies and public authorities.
'Third, Nancy, like Lorraine, has been squeezed over the centuries between
the Holy Roman and German empires on the one hand, and France on the other,
and thus invaded a lot. But it has left it undeniably a European city.'
Today's 'prince' of Nancy is its mayor, Mr Andre Rossinot, a former doctor
who is now also the minister for France's large civil service in the
Balladur government (see profile). Mr Rossinot has no doubts about his
city's place in the European sun. With the eastward extension of the TGV
(train a grande vitesse) from Paris to Nancy, Strasbourg and eventually
points in Germany, he says, 'We will no longer be a frontier zone leading
nowhere, but at the heart of the Moselle-Rhine basin.,'
The mayor does not rate the TGV as a miracle cure, but simply 'as one of the
criteria by which companies will now judge where to invest.' However, as a
result of the Balladur government's latest plan, Nancy is scheduled to get
its TGV link with Paris several years before Strasbourg - a fact which
Nancy's developers hope to exploit.
Even without the TGV Nancy is not suffering unduly. To the extent that the
city has problems, these stem from the decline of industry on its periphery.
To the north and south west, it has the former steel-making basins of Pompey
and Neuves Maisons. In Dombasle, to the south east, it has the chemical
plants of Solvay and Rhone-Poulenc, which are in better shape.
In all, the periphery still provides 12,000 industrial jobs. But, as Mr
Gerard Rongeot, director-general of ADUAN, says, industry provides only 10
per cent of private sector employment for greater Nancy's 350,000
population, while services account for 70-80 per cent, with the construction
sector filling the rest.
Unemployment is a little more than one percentage point below the national
average (10.4 per cent as against 11.7). There are several reasons for this.
According to its secretary-general, Mr Jean-Luc Robaux, St Gobain's Pont a
Mousson pipe-making division has laid off none of the 2,000 workers it
employs full time in the town of that name. At the same time, however, the
Pont a Mousson executive remains rather pessimistic about worldwide
over-capacity in iron pipe-making.
Mr Robaux lauds the 'long-standing savoir-faire' of Pont a Mousson
iron-forgers. If so, it is hard to see why the French company would want, or
need, to continue making anything as basic as the cast iron manhole covers
which, Mr Robaux complains, are coming in large and cheap quantities from
eastern Europe.
Some local banks have done their bit, as Mr Bernard Yoncourt, president of
SNVB, explains. To the charge that banks are letting new or small companies
go under in the present recession, Mr Yoncourt retorts that not only is SNVB
still lending to one in three of every small and medium sized company in its
catchment area (the Seine-Marne, the Champagne Ardennes and Lorraine
regions), but its venture capital fund invested FFr50m in new companies last
year.
But the most important influence is the economic stability provided by
Nancy's outsize academic population - 45,000 students act as a steady
'employer' of some 5,000 people to teach them, and perhaps as many again to
house, feed, transport and entertain them - and the technological hope for
the future represented by the numerous government and university
laboratories, and the 15 grandes ecoles for engineers and managers,
clustered in and around the city.
Local politicians, businessmen and university leaders have joined together
in an effort to try to put all this pure research to commercial use. This
has helped to create new businesses (see accompanying article) and to
preserve existing industry.
Mr Henri Begorre, mayor of the Nancy suburb of Maxeville and the politician
responsible for dealing with all the universities in the city, estimates
that the universities have been very important to the survival of the local
subsidiaries of Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals group, and of SGS-Thomson, the
semi-conductor maker which has now sold its Maxeville plant to a Hong Kong
group. In stepping in to help business, Nancy's academia is returning past
favours from locally-established business. Solvay, for example, helped to
found Nancy's ecole de chimie.
By the high standards of eastern France, Nancy has attracted a reasonable
but not spectacular amount of foreign investment. Notable among investors
are Kimberly-Clark of the US, making Kleenex; Ferruzzi, in food; Clarion of
Japan, in car radios; Bauer of Germany, in electric motors. Nancy is choosy.
'We don't want bounty-hunters, because we have not got big bounties (in the
form of EC, national or regional investment incentives) to offer,' says Mr
Begorre.
'What we want are companies with the right strategies,' he says. He gives an
example: a Nancy university invention in anti-adhesives, better known as
non-stick materials, which has applications not only in the kitchen but also
in reducing friction in motors. 'One of the bidders is a company called
Tefal, which obviously needs to sort out its marketing image with Teflon of
the US if it is to be competitive with other possible exploiters' of the
university invention.
This is typical of the slightly know-all attitude of many of Nancy's
leaders. But, then, some of them do know a lot. Nancy is a city with a high
average IQ.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Survey of Four Cities Partnership (2): The patient is on the
mend - Nottingham
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE RECESSION in Britain wounded Nottingham. But the economic injuries
inflicted on the city have not scarred it permanently.
Unlike other cities, where dependence on a single industry or employer has
left large sections of the workforce facing unemployment, the
self-proclaimed capital of the East Midlands has been protected by a
diversified economy.
The full impact of the recession was defused because the shock waves were
spread across a large number of employers.
While the collapse of Swan Hunter devastated parts of Tyneside, or the loss
of British Aerospace cast a pall over Hatfield, Nottingham was able to fall
back on a mixed economy based on textiles and a clutch of large companies
such as Boots and Raleigh and a host of small manufacturers.
But Nottingham did not emerge unscathed. British Coal's decision to close
the nearby pits of Cotgrave and Silverhill has dealt a serious blow to the
mining workforce. Nottingham County Council estimates that the full effect
of pit closures could lead to a 15 per cent shrinkage in the area's gross
domestic product.
The knock-on effect of the closure programme has yet to be felt, but the
county council claims that for every two jobs which disappear from the
mines, another goes outside. There could be serious implications for an
economy where spending by mines on goods and services has been estimated at
Pounds 210m a year.
Redundancies among miners are likely to exacerbate high levels of
unemployment in parts of Nottingham. Although unemployment of 11.6 per cent
in the Nottingham travel-to-work area is only 1.2 per cent above the
national average, some inner city wards have suffered disproportionately.
Unemployment in Radford is estimated at 44 per cent; 39.2 per cent in
Lenton; and 35.2 per cent in Forest.
These pockets of high unemployment reflect small business failures and the
shake-out of jobs by companies introducing labour-saving technology.
Overseas inward investment, a big priority for the city council, has not yet
produced the results to offset such deprivation. Five inward investment
projects last year created just 117 jobs in the city, according to Invest in
Britain, the department of trade and industry's development agency. By
contrast, unemployment in Nottingham's 10 worst-hit wards exceeded 10,800 in
the year to July 1993.
In its determination to counter the decline, the city council has launched
an economic development strategy aiming to deal with the effects of social
deprivation. The goals include capitalising on the strong growth in the
service sector, protecting the diverse industrial base and emphasising the
role of the excellent higher education facilities in helping new companies.
The ideas are ambitious but attaining them is another matter. Any of the
1,340 miners facing redundancy at Cotgrave or Silverhill would probably be
sceptical; Mr Jim Taylor, director of development at the city council, is
not.
Mr Taylor, a leading advocate of the Four Cities Partnership, claims
Nottingham already has the strength to become the economic powerhouse of the
East Midlands. He points to the success of companies such as Boots, whose
pharmaceuticals division is headquartered there; GEC Plessey
Telecommunications; ZF Gears; and Central Television as examples of how the
city is moving away from traditional industry.
While acknowledging there are problems of deprivation, Mr Taylor says:
'We've got the best city centre management scheme in the country. There is
Pounds 37.5m of City Challenge money going into rundown areas, and we've
cleaned up 3,500 buildings in 10 years.'
His optimism is echoed, albeit cautiously, by Nottingham Development
Enterprise, the local business promotion agency. Mr Malcolm Reece, the
agency's chief executive, believes the recession has changed the culture
among companies seeking outside investment. 'Companies now realise our
future lies in Europe. It would have been good if that had been recognised
five years ago, and the Four Cities Partnership is a response to that,' he
says.
The move toward Europe reflects the need to refocus on new markets,
according to the enterprise agency, and, if successful, should soften the
blow of pit closures.
The city aims to lure inward investors with attractive incentives such as
its stable and low wage workforce. The average gross weekly pay for male
workers is Pounds 270, compared with a national average of Pounds 300; while
the average number of days lost to strikes is the second lowest in the
country.
The accountancy firm of Price Waterhouse, meanwhile, claims the region's
prospects have been increased by a recent survey showing that 81 per cent of
businesses thought they had now experienced the worst of the recession,
against 59 per cent in 1992.
Aware of the need to capitalise on signs of increasing confidence,
Nottingham has taken on some ideas pioneered by its sisters in the Four
Cities Partnership. These include setting up a technology region offering
low cost sites to innovative design companies modelled on a similar scheme
in Karlsruhe; a rapid transit system, on which the developers have sought
German advice; and putting increased emphasis on international links between
academic institutions.
The Four Cities Partnership, however, is not responsible solely for these
initiatives. It is a useful arena for exchanging expertise and development
proposals but it does not have the muscle to force through change. That is
up to the partners themselves, and Nottingham would have to develop plans to
safeguard its economy whether the partnership existed or not.
For the city, therefore, inward investment means not only attracting
continental companies but also wooing business from elsewhere in the UK.
Citing some success in this strategy, the city council says it has persuaded
the Inland Revenue and English Heritage to move to Nottingham as part of a
Pounds 90m relocation package. It also hopes to site a Channel tunnel
freight village at Toton sidings on the city fringes.
Mr Taylor is certain that this mixed response to the recession is the right
way to cure Nottingham's economic ills.
The prospects for a recovery have been boosted by the presence of finance
houses in Nottingham with venture capital to aid expanding companies.
Mr Roger Cole, director of 3i in Nottingham, says companies that survived
the recession now need to raise new equity. 'It's helpful to be close to
your financiers. All the major firms of accountants have offices here, as do
most of the clearers.'
Assessing the local economy, he adds that fewer 'distressed' parent
companies are selling off subsidiaries and most employers are happier with
domestic orders and export growth than a year ago.
By his analysis, if Nottingham was characterised as a patient recovering
from a trauma then it would be out of intensive care. The prognosis is
hopeful: stable and getting better, but not able to get out of bed yet.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Survey of Four Cities Partnership (1): A quartet tunes up -
Four medium-sized European cities, each of regional importance, have formed
a loose alliance in the quest for faster development. Tim Burt looks at
co-operation between Nottingham in the UK, Nancy in France, and Karlsruhe
and Halle in Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE creation of the Single European Market, bringing with it a lifting of
economic frontiers across Europe, has forced not only national governments
but also individual cities to re-examine the ways they do business.
A number of cities which have seen their former industrial bases decline
have begun to cast around for international partners. The prize is access to
new export markets and the prospect of attracting inward investors. There is
also the opportunity to learn from the experience of other similarly-sized
cities or regions with similar industrial and economic problems.
Nottingham, the de facto capital of the East Midlands, is one example. By
the late 1980s, it was clear to council officials that they had to widen
their economic horizons if the city was to rediscover the formula which a
decade earlier had helped make the region one of the most buoyant in the
country.
Three years ago, the city's economic development committee approached its
namesake in Karlsruhe, the German university town in the state of
Baden-Wurttemberg.
Attracted by the idea of a loose alliance, fuelled by an exchange of
industrial expertise, research projects and joint business ventures,
Karlsruhe invited its own twin cities of Nancy in eastern France and Halle
in the former East Germany to join the group - giving rise to the formal
launch of the Four Cities Partnership 18 months ago.
Karlsruhe itself has managed very successfully over recent years to find a
new role for itself, and new prosperity. As such it is perhaps the partner
with the most to offer.
Once the capital of Baden, it lost out to Stuttgart which became the chief
city of the merged Baden Wurttemberg land, but it refused to allow the
polarisation of business round its Swabian rival to relegate it to a
backwater.
The economy of Baden-Wurttemberg has been weakened by its dependence on big
employers such as Daimler-Benz, and state unemployment has increased from
4.6 per cent to 6.7 per cent.
Karlsruhe, however, has been protected from the worst of the recession by a
diverse economy - even though unemployment has increased to 6.5 per cent.
The city has developed an economy based on service industries and is home to
some of the country's leading research institutions.
Nancy, for its part, has been affected by the decline in heavy industry
around Lorraine. But, as in its German twin city, unemployment has been
contained by the concentration of service companies and large academic
institutions. Unemployment In Nancy is 10.4 per cent against a national
average of 11.7 per cent in France.
Nottingham is having to come to terms with a rundown in the local mining
industry, following the decision by British coal to close two nearby pits,
and there are fears that the knock-on effects on the local economy could
undermine the recovery among local companies. British Coal's decision to
close the nearby pits at Silverhill and Cotgrave. Cuts in the mining
workforce, according to local authority estimates, could lead to a 15 per
cent shrinkage in the area's gross domestic product. That could undermine
the recovery among local companies just when they thought they had beaten
the UK recession. Unemployment totals in the city, at 11.6 per cent, are
already worse than in its continental partners. In some inner city areas the
total exceeds 40 per cent.
The city retains, however, a diversified industrial base, including the
headquarters of one of Britain's biggest companies, Boots the Chemist, the
retailing to drugs group.
Like Nancy and Karlsruhe, Nottingham has also seen strong growth in
services. Recent arrivals in the city include the Inland Revenue and English
Heritage.
Halle, by contrast, has problems of a different scale, and in theory it has
most to learn from its richer neighbours. Once the powerhouse of its region,
the unification of Germany has rendered Halle's manufacturing, machine tool
and chemical industries uncompetitive, and about 40 per cent of the
workforce is unemployed.
In the limited time since the partnership was formed the city partners have
put in place a number of exchanges between businesses, academics and
individuals, but so far they have not been able to take many of their joint
initiatives beyond the discussion stage.
But some tangible projects are now beginning to emerge.
Among these is the establishment of technology regions based on a successful
model in Germany. Designed to attract new companies with promises of cheap
and readily available factory space and skilled workers, the technology
zones have been taken up in all four cities.
Universities in each city have also embraced the alliance. There are student
and academic exchange programmes under way and a pooling of expertise. For
example, a business graduate from Halle could seek the advice of management
buy-out research centre in Nottingham.
The exchange of expertise has also been taken up by city planners. The main
beneficiary of this so far has been Nottingham, where officials developing a
rapid transit system have been able to consult executives operating an
existing network in Karlsruhe.
Inevitably there are some problems in the relationship between the cities;
some of the links between them work more effectively than others. These
problems are more of tone than of substance, however, and partnership
officials are determined to solve them.
City leaders backing the Four Cities Partnership believe, too, that
investment by the partners in each other's cities will come - given time.
They acknowledge that the recession in Europe has delayed their vision, but
are adamant that it has not been derailed.
All four are determined to press ahead with their alliance, which they
regard as a vital building block for future development. They also believe
that they are creating a model which other cities and regions across Europe
will find well worth examining and adapting to their own needs.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium producers urged to
'share pain' of output cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALUMINIUM PRODUCERS must accept further cuts in output if the industry as a
whole is to survive, a London Metal Exchange seminar heard yesterday,
reports Reuter.
Mr Colin Pratt, of Commodities and Research Unit International, said the
western world aluminium industry was already operating at about 91 per cent
of capacity but that more cuts were needed, and suggested a 5 to 10 per cent
reduction by all producers. 'They must adopt a shared pain, shared gain
approach,' he said.
The crisis had been caused by world recession, the coming on stream of 1.8m
tonnes of new smelter capacity over the past three years, and a huge
increase in Russian exports, said Mr Pratt.
But no new capacity was expected in the short term, giving the industry a
two-year breathing space.
Demand growth, which had averaged about 1.5 per cent a year for the past
four years, would increase to 3 per cent in 1994 as economies emerged from
recession, he said.
However, huge Russian exports would continue as they represented genuine
excess of production over consumption, not just a stocks drawdown.
Without the shared approach to production cuts, the industry faced prices,
already at all-time lows in real terms, drifting further downwards, Mr Pratt
warned.
Mr Huw Roberts, of research consultancy Brook Hunt and Associates, told the
seminar that action to bring the lead and zinc markets into balance would be
taken over the next 12 months, as smelters in some cases would simply run
out of concentrates to process.
Lead would outpace zinc in the recovery, thanks to the positive outlook for
replacement battery demand, said Mr Roberts.
Production cuts had already made an impact in both markets, he said, and
there was no chance of large-scale reactivation of mothballed mines next
year.
This year, he estimated, some 400,000 tonnes of zinc mine production would
be lost, while lead output would be 200,000 tonnes lower.
Zinc prices would average Dollars 925 a tonne next year, unchanged from the
projected 1993 level, Mr Roberts said. He saw the lead price average
recovering to Dollars 500 a tonne from Dollars 390, but that would still be
low in real terms.
The LME should consider extending its business beyond the London daytime and
look at introducing contracts further forward, Mr Barry Marshall, president
of Hunter Douglas Metals, told the seminar.
'We would like to see a 24-hour market and currently only four or five
brokers provide such a service,' he said. Presenting a consumers' view of
the LME, he welcomed the recent decision to move contracts out to 27 months
but added that more could be done. 'We have to look at prices four, five or
six years ahead,' he said.
Mr Marshall thought the LME offered a very good hedging mechanism but said
some fine tuning was required. More transparency on prices and volumes of
LME business was desirable as at present a lot of the exchange's business
went unreported.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rallies in coffee and cocoa
prices surprise traders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE AND cocoa futures prices rallied at the London Commodity Exchange
yesterday after their recent 'corrections'. But dealers were at a loss to
explain the rise.
The January delivery coffee position, which at one point last week dipped to
Dollars 1,139 a tonne, closed at Dollars 1,207 a tonne, up Dollars 29 on the
day. But that was still Dollars 128 below the 2 1/2 -year high reached at
the end of August as bullish assessments of the likely impact of the
producer's export retention scheme reached their peak.
The scheme, to hold 20 per cent of supplies off the export market until
prices rise to a target about 12 per cent above the present level, came into
operation on October 1, but by that time confidence in the producers'
ability to make the strategy work was already on the wane.
'The real problem is the retention scheme is a paper tiger which is not yet
biting. No-one is trying to buy coffee and not being able to get any because
of the retention scheme,' one trader told the Reuter news agency.
In the absence of news to justify the price rise of the past few days,
dealers said it was due to speculative activity that began in the New York
market last Friday.
The March cocoa position's Pounds 21 rise to Pounds 936 a tonne was also
seen as a purely technical bounce after last week's Pounds 72 setback.
'People are trying to push the market higher in the hope there is lots of
buying above current levels,' said one dealer. 'At the same time there's
also quite a bit of selling waiting below the market if near March dips back
again towards Pounds 900.'
In its daily commodity report GNI, the London trade house, said Pounds 900 a
tonne was 'the critical level' for the prompt December price, which closed
at Pounds 905 tonne. But it was not looking for recent 40-month highs to be
re-tested. 'While we remain positive long-term,' it said, 'we doubt that we
will see a significant jump from here while the West African crops are
coming in.'

<TEXT>
SRI LANKA. the world's largest exporter of tea, is expected soon to announce
substantial changes in the contracts awarded last year for the private
management of 450 government-owned tea, rubber and coconut estates.
The changes are likely to include a decision to extend the contract period
from five years to around 30 years, which will amount to an effective
privatisation, though the land will still technically be owned by the
government.
'In Sri Lanka land is a sensitive issue and there is no way we could sell it
to the private sector. But before the end of the year I fully expect to be
in a position to grant a new contract, possibly a usufruct contract, of 40
years,' says Mr Rupasena Karunatilleke, Sri Lanka's minister of plantation
industries.
The package, which has yet to be finally approved by the Sri Lankan cabinet,
comes after a clamour of complaints from the country's 22 privately owned
management companies. They argued that with only a five-year contract it was
to raise the money needed for large-scale investment to boost productivity
and stem heavy losses.
When the companies took over last year the two government plantation boards
that ran the industry had accumulated losses of around SLRs13bn (Pounds
178m) and had put the viability of the nation's two main banks in jeopardy.
Investment of several hundred million dollars is required to modernise Sri
Lanka's ageing plantations and factories. The tea bushes on many estates are
more than 50 years old and of the wrong type. A massive replanting scheme is
required to double output per hectare.
Sri Lanka's output of tea is about 1,000kg a hectare, half that of Indian
plantations and even further below those of Kenya. With less than 10 per
cent of Sri Lankan tea output converted to CTC form (curt, tear and curl, as
used in tea bags), the country also needs substantial investment in new
factories.
The government is talking to The Asian Development Bank in the hope of
obtaining loans of around Dollars 60m, which would be re-lent to those
management companies willing to put in investment of their own. The ADB is
insisting that the 'lease or management' contract between the government and
the companies be put on a more long-term and commercially viable basis.

Base metal trading was largely routine on the London Metal Exchange, as many
participants were absent because of LME week. The three months COPPER price
pushed higher in the afternoon, as sellers lost interest. The market eroded
the band of resistance between Dollars 1,705 and Dollars 1,710 a tonne and
final business was at Dollars 1,709 a tonne, up Dollars 9, with Dollars
1,725 the next target. NICKEL prices lost ground following the rally fuelled
late last week by Inco's announcement of plans to cut production. Traders
attributed the retreat, which took the three months position to Dollars
4,455 a tonne, down Dollars 105, at the end of after-hours trading, to
disappointed liquidation as many believed that the Canadian company's move
would not be matched by other producers. LEAD prices edged up, as the move
above Dollars 385 a tonne for three months metal touched off some light
short-covering. Final business was at Dollars 390 a tonne, up Dollars 5.50
from Friday. TIN prices fell back in nervous trading as the market continued
to fluctuate in a wide band. The three months position ended at Dollars
4,590 a tonne, down Dollars 60.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lower cotton prices forecast
despite deficit

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD COTTON consumption is expected to outstrip output in the 1993-94
season (August/September), but stiff competition among exporters may keep
prices low, the International Cotton Advisory Committee said yesterday,
reports Reuter from New Delhi.
Output in 1993-94 is forecast at 18m tonnes, unchanged from the previous
year, but consumption is likely to rise by 450,000 tonnes to 19.3m tonnes.
Despite the growth in the world total, consumption in many importing
countries is declining and there is stiff competition among exporters
resulting in lower prices.
The ICAC said that the average of Cotton Outlook magazine's Cotlook A Index
for the season to date was around 55 cents a lb, compared with the 1992-93
average of 58 cents and a 20-year average of 72 cents.
The committee is a worldwide organisation of 46 governments created to
monitor developments affecting cotton production and to promote the use of
cotton. At least 190 foreign delegates and observers are attending the
five-day meeting in New Delhi.
ICAC estimated world cotton stocks at the beginning of the season at 9.1m
tonnes, including 3.3m in China and 1m in the US, the two biggest producers.
Stocks are expected to fall to 7.8m tonnes by the end of the season.
While stocks in China are forecast to fall by 1m tonnes to 2.3m because of
lower production, US stocks may rise to 1.3m tonnes.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold back above Dollars 360 an
ounce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOLD price climbed above Dollars 360 a troy ounce yesterday for the
first time since it plunged on selling by US computer-controlled funds on
September 7.
Dollar weakness encouraged early commission house buying as the price was
driven to Dollars 361.50 an ounce at one point. But with expected upside
resistance looming at Dollars 362 the rise ran out of steam and the price
retreated to Dollars 360.25 an ounce, up Dollars 3 on balance, at the London
bullion market close.
Silver, which led the precious metals rally last week with a 26-cent net
rise, put on another 2 cents to close at 434.5 cents an ounce, just below
last Thursday's high.
In New York early commission house buying lifted Commodity Exchange (Comex)
silver prices to the highest levels in a month and a subsequent back-off was
slowed by some emerging investment fund buying, dealers told the Reuter news
agency.
The platinum market, which took part only half-heartedly in last week's
rally, was again the laggard, with its price closing in London at Dollars
363.40 an ounce, up Dollars 1.65 on the day.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Dutch usher in the age of the
self-milking cow - State of the art machinery could make the herdsman
redundant in the dairy parlour / Farmer's Viewpoint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MY FIRST job as a 16-year old farm student on a neighbouring farm was
milking cows. It was not planned that way - the intention was that during
the 12 months I was to work on the farm I would be given a variety of arable
and livestock jobs to broaden my experience.
But when I took up my post one of the regular herdsmen was having an illicit
affair with another herdsman's wife. The day I arrived the cuckold found out
and punched his colleague in the mouth, breaking his jaw. Needless to say
they refused to work together again and I was drafted into the cow shed to
fill the gap.
I bet you thought such excitement only took place in towns. At my tender age
and in my innocence I too was a little shocked. It taught me a little about
human weakness and a lot about dairy cows.
Believe it or not milking can be a very satisfying job. You get to know the
animals by name. Or at least you did then, before herds got so big that they
started giving cows numbers. It must be more difficult to establish a
relationship with number 123 than with Ada or Mabel. And apart from the
inevitable inconvenience of the fact that it had to be done twice every day
of the year it was a job I really enjoyed doing.
But if new technology from the Netherlands catches on in this country the
herdsmen of tomorrow may be denied the hands-on pleasures of pulling milk
out of cows.
The fully automatic milking machine has been the dream of some enthusiasts
for years but until recently the difficulty of developing a device to
accomodate different shapes of udders and placings of teats has proved too
much.
Now, it is claimed, the Dutch have cracked it. A few machines are already
operating in Holland and it is expected that the first will be installed in
the UK within a matter of months.
In truth the automatic milker is an inevitable and logical development. Any
task that is repeated daily and is labour intensive will attract the
attention of technologists. Moreover the hand-operated milking machine
introduced half a century ago, even before I started doing the job, was the
first breakthrough. Overnight one man, who had been hand-milking perhaps 10
cows a session into an open bucket, could deal with 40 or 50 cows and do so
more hygienically and thoroughly.
Some years later automatic cluster removers enabled that figure to be more
than doubled. The cow man attaches the cluster of four teat cups to each cow
by hand, but when the udder is empty and the flow of milk ceases a cord
attached to the teat cups gently pulls them off. It saves internal damage to
the empty teats from continuous vaccuum pressure when it is not needed to
draw milk. It has led to fewer cases of diseases such as mastitis.
Other electronic labour saving devices have also been introduced to dairying
over the years. In some herds, for instance, cows wear collars containing
tiny transponders. These are programmed by the computer in the dairy to
trigger the individually desired delivery of feed to the cow concerned when,
of her own free will, she enters an enclosed feeding stall.
When she has eaten her fill the device lets her out and another cow in to
repeat the process.
Pedometers with radio transmitters are sometimes fixed to cows' front legs
to measure their activity rate. Increased activity, again recorded on the
computer in the dairy, indicates she is on heat and ready for artificial
insemination. A decreased in her activity could mean that she is ill.
It is also possible, by fitting special thermometers into the milking
machine, to measure the heat of the milk drawn from each cow and each teat.
A rise in the temperature, once more recorded on a computer, indicates that
the cow has a fever, maybe sickening for some disease and probably needs
treatment.
Most of these hi-tech developments have been incorporated into the new
automatic milking machine. The cow decides, according to the fullness of her
udder, when she wishes to be relieved of the burden of her milk. She enters
the milking stall and is identified by the transponder round her neck. The
computer causes a little feed to fall into the trough in the stall.
Then comes the really clever bit.
The computer delves into its memory bank for the shape of the udder of the
cow in the stall. It then instructs the pneumatic cylinders which control
the teat cups exactly where to attach them. After a few days' training
apparently, the cow does not object.
Once successfully attached, the milking procedure begins with automatic teat
washing inside the teat cup. The washings are then discarded and the inside
of the cup rinsed clean. After that, milking takes place in the normal way
and the cow is released from the stall. If at any point the procedure goes
wrong, the whole process is aborted, the cow is released into a holding pen
and an alarm is sounded to alert the herdsman that he is needed after all.
As will be deduced from all this, milk production can be a technical and
sophisticated business, although in truth very few dairy farmers have all
the gadgets I have described. It may perhaps be surprising, therefore, that
a similar level of sophistication has seldom shown itself in dairy farmers'
approach to marketing.
The fact is, of course, that it has not been necessary for the last 60 years
since the advent of the Milk Marketing Boards. The boards have a statutory
duty to buy and pay the same price for all milk (according to quality) from
all milk producers whether they do it on top of Mount Snowdon or inside the
M25.
But that situation is fast drawing to a close as the boards are wound up
(April 1, 1994 is the target date) and then Britain will once again have a
free market for milk.
The Milk Marketing Board of England and Wales intends to turn itself into a
producer-owned co-operative and hopes to secure committments to purchase 80
per cent of its present turnover and broker it to other milk users. Other
companies, such as Northern Foods, Nestles, MD Foods and Unigate, on the
other hand, hope substantial numbers of milk producers will sell direct to
them, by-passing Milk Marque, as the new co-operative will be called.
So, over the next few months, milk producers will be faced with a difficult
choice. Do they stick with the people they know and hope they can trust at
Milk Marque but run the risk that it will ultimately fail like so many UK
agricultural co-operatives before it? Or do they sign up with a commercial
outfit with a proven record of adding value but risk having ex-farm milk
prices squeezed as buyers respond to market pressures and shareholders
demands for maximum profits?
It is a choice most would prefer not to have to make and as each of the
players makes their increasingly aggresive pitch for milk producers over
coming weeks it is anybody's guess how the future structure of the milk
business will pan out. But it will be a fierce battle - that much is quite
certain. I just hope there will be no broken jaws.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: Markets wait for German court decision on
Emu
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN bond markets were quiet yesterday as participants eyed today's
ruling by the German Constitutional Court on the Maastricht treaty for
European monetary union (Emu). Moreover, holidays in Japan, the US and
Canada kept a lid on activity, leaving prices to drift lower on moderate
volume.
While Germany's supreme court is widely forecast to rule in favour of the
treaty, many expect it to attach provisos which could further delay the
timetable for Emu and undermine the weaker currencies in Europe's
exchange-rate mechanism (ERM).
These expectations triggered some unwinding of trades based on European
economic convergence and sparked speculative switching into German assets,
causing bunds to outperform most markets and reinforcing the D-Mark.
After a short-lived breach of key resistance at 100 - hitting a record high
at 100.02 - the December Bund future drifted lower to end at 99.76.
The Bundesbank's call for repo tenders is likely to be closely watched
today.
Most market participants expect another two-week repo at a 6.70 per cent
fixed rate and a variable-rate four-week repo, in spite of speculation last
week that both tranches could be offered at variable rates.
With payment on the government's new bunds due Friday and October tax
payments beginning to drain money-market liquidity this week, 'a reversion
to variable-rate repos on the shorter tranche could risk a small rise in the
minimum rate which the Bundesbank probably would wish to avoid', said Mr
Paul Meggyesi, senior German economist at MMS International.
Elsewhere, the government today will issue 10-year bunds via the federal
bond consortium, with another portion to be auctioned tomorrow.
Traders are betting on a 6 per cent coupon and expect the issue to total
DM10bn.
UK gilts drifted lower in line with most European markets and the December
long gilt contract slipped  5/32 to 114 9/32 .
Remembering how higher-than-expected August inflation data had sent gilts
tumbling last month, many investors remained nervously sidelined ahead of
tomorrow's release of September RPI.
Participants are eyeing Friday's announcement of the next gilts auction,
with many traders expecting a new five-year benchmark for next year.
IN France, the December notional bond futures contract eased 0.04 point to
123.98 on moderate turnover.
Traders reported some switching into bunds out of OATs, which caused French
10-year bonds' yield premium over bunds to widen to six basis points from
two basis points on Friday.
DANISH bonds were the day's only winners, with the 10-year benchmark bond
rising 0.30 of a point after the central bank cut its leading interest rates
by  1/2 point.
Denmark has taken advantage of its new latitude to cut rates independently
of the Bundesbank, aided by the strength of the krone, since the fluctuation
bands for most ERM currencies were widened to 15 per cent on August 2.
BELGIAN bonds posted the biggest losses, with the 10-year benchmark bond
falling nearly  1/2 point on the day.
The 10-year yield premium over bunds rose to 133 basis points, from 126
basis points on Friday.
Nevertheless, Mr John Hall, economist at Swiss Bank Corporation, feels
'there is good value for medium-term investors with the spread around 130
basis points'.
For one, Mr Hall argues, the market has discounted much of the uncertainty
over the likelihood of a social pact.
Moreover, he expects a compromise pact to be delivered, and while it may not
solve all of Belgium's problems, it will defuse the threat of an outright
debt crisis.
He warned that a failure on the pact could push the spread out to 150 basis
points and recommended that 'more cautious investors wait until we see what
the pact actually looks like'.
The report from the committee of experts charged with preparing the social
pact talks is expected to be published next week.

CHILE, which was one of the first Latin American countries to return to
Eurobond markets after the 1980s debt crisis, has pre-paid its Dollars 320m
bond issue placed as part of its 1991 debt refinancing accord, Reuter
reports from Santiago.
Mr Jose Pablo Arellano, Chile's finance ministry budget director, said the
operation was completed last month when the government paid Dollars 260m for
outstanding bonds.
Chile placed Dollars 200m in Eurobonds with a five-year maturity plus two
years of grace at Libor plus 1.5 per cent in 1991 and in 1992 followed with
a Dollars 120m placement.
A total of 20 banks from the US, Japan and Europe subscribed the issue.
Mr Arellano said the difference between the Dollars 260m and Dollars 320m
total issue was accounted for by bonds which had already been repaid under
the scheduled amortisation calendar.

3.12bn (USDollars 405m) in bonds which convert into shares in its unlisted
subsidiary, Henderson China.
Henderson is the latest in a growing list of property companies which are
capitalising on low interest rates and renewed global interest in Hong Kong
shares, by issuing convertible preference shares or bonds.
The bonds have a three-year life and pay a coupon of 4 per cent. They can be
redeemed at par, or converted into shares in Henderson China upon its
initial public offering. There is no guarantee that the company will be
successfully listed.
The share price of Henderson Land climbed 19 per cent yesterday with the
issue apparently implying substantial value to the group's China assets. An
independent audit has given an estimated net tangible assets per share for
Henderson Land of HKDollars 42.69, against yesterday's closing price of
HKDollars 28.70.
Mr Lee Shau-kee, chairman of Henderson, said the move 'provides funds for
our China property business and creates an opportunity for investors
specifically interested in China'.
Hong Kong investors have tended to shun companies with Chinese property
interests, due to concerns over the impact of the austerity programme in
China. Overseas institutions have been less concerned.
New World Development, a Hong Kong property developer with substantial
Chinese exposure, reacted to local fears recently, by launching a USDollars
200m Dublin-listed China investment fund.
The fund has acquired a number of the group's China infrastructure and
property projects and is only 50 per cent owned by the company, reducing the
parent company's exposure and raising funds for China investment.

FT  12 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Traders mark time as Columbus Day curbs
activity

THERE were relatively few new issues in the international bond market
yesterday as the public holiday in the US restricted activity.
However, syndicate managers expect a wide range of new issues to emerge over
the next two weeks. Belgium is expected to raise Dollars 500m through a
fixed-rate offering of 10-year Eurobonds, priced to yield about 30 basis
points over underlying US treasuries. Banks made their bids for the deal
yesterday and the mandate should be awarded today.
Depfa, Germany's largest mortgage bank, could launch its Eurosterling issue
today or tomorrow, via Salomon Brothers and UBS. The issue of 10-year
Eurobonds is likely to raise about Pounds 500m and be priced to yield 20 to
25 basis points over UK government bonds.
Regarding Turkey's planned Eurosterling issue, lead manager SG Warburg said
that it was not in a position to comment on the details of the offering
following news last Friday that Moody's, the international credit rating
agency, had placed Turkey's long-term credit rating under review for
possible downgrading.
However, based on the feedback from investors following Moody's
announcement, SG Warburg remained optimistic that the deal could be launched
during the course of this week.
Banco Bamerindus, Brazil's third-largest private-sector bank, is expected to
launch a Dollars 100m offering of five-year Eurobonds next Monday. Mr
Anthony Pain, the bank's international and corporate director, said the
bonds were likely to be priced to yield between 450 and 475 basis points
over underlying US Treasuries.
The market is waiting for two issues from the European Community, one
denominated in Ecu and the other in D-Marks.
Among yesterday's issues, Fisons, the UK pharmaceuticals company, made its
first public bond issue since 1986 when it raised Pounds 100m through an
offering of 10-year Eurobonds.
The yield spread of 120 basis points over gilts was seen to be fair in view
of the company's lack of a credit rating and the residual negative sentiment
following its poor equity performance. The bonds closed at 98.70 bid, with
the spread intact.
Fokker, the Dutch aircraft manufacturer in which Daimler-Benz took a
majority stake via its Deutsche Aerospace subsidiary last April, raised
DM500m through an offering of five-year Eurobonds. A put option on the bonds
was seen as an insurance policy for investors who had bought the bonds
because of Daimler's commitment to building Europe's leading aircraft
manufacturing group. Bondholders can exercise the put option in 1996 if
Deutsche Aerospace decides to take its stake in Fokker below 50 per cent.
Minus full fees, the bonds were priced to yield 81 basis points over
medium-term German government notes. The bonds were trading at 99.30 bid in
the afternoon, within fees.

FORD Credit Europe will launch several funding programmes in coming weeks to
finance the growth of its various European units.
The company plans to launch a US-commercial paper programme totalling
Dollars 1.5bn and a Euro-CP programme worth Dollars 1bn, Ford said.
In addition, a planned Euro medium-term-note (MTN) programme, scheduled for
early November, will total up to Dollars 1.5bn, it said.
Under this programme Ford will be targeting the shorter end of the maturity
spectrum, with most issuance likely in the 10- to 15-year sector, Ford said.
The CP-programmes are rated A-1 by Standard and Poor's and P-1 by Moody's
Investors Service, while the MTN programme has been rated A by S&amp;P and A-2
by Moody's.

FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Digital unveils strategy shift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIGITAL Equipment, the US computer manufacturer, has unveiled about 150
products and services designed to position the company as a significant
supplier of client-server systems.
Mr Geoffrey Shingles, chairman of Digital's UK operations said the
announcements were 'the basis for the new Digital'. The intention is to
become the leading client-server company by 1995.
Client-server systems involve workstations and personal computers tied
together in networks.
Digital has been the world leader in minicomputers but was slow to
capitalise on the trend towards personal computers and open networks where
machines from different manufacturers can be linked together easily.
With today's announcement, the company is attempting to recover lost ground
and position itself for the future. The products will include special
software to enable groups of staff to work co-operatively over a shared
computer system and a number of high-powered workstations based on Digital's
Alpha chip, said to be the world's fastest.
The company has improved its pricing structure and simplified ordering
procedures for most of its products and services. It is extending and
developing its consultancy services.
Digital's move is seen by industry experts as essential for any company
hoping to take a large share of tomorrow's data processing markets. There is
little or no growth in mainframe or minicomputer based systems.
Digital emphasised its global commitment to information technology. It said
development of its client-server products had been spread through countries
where it operates.

FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Regional US banks merge in
Dollars 125m deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FLEET Financial, New England's biggest banking group, said yesterday it
would pay Dollars 125m in stock to acquire Sterling Bancshares of
Massachusetts.
The announcement comes just two weeks after Fleet's share price rose sharply
amid talk that it would be taken over by an even bigger regional bank,
NationsBank of North Carolina.
The acquisition of Sterling, however, is not regarded as a defensive
manoeuvre to discourage NationsBank from launching a bid.
The Fleet-Sterling deal is the third regional banking merger unveiled in the
last month, which suggests that a new round of consolidation in the US
banking industry is under way. Last month, the second and third largest
banks in Wisconsin, Marshall &amp; Illsley and Valley Bancorp, announced they
would merge in a transaction valued at almost Dollars 1bn. On October 5,
Keycorp and Society Corporation, two banks with operations in several
states, unveiled a merger that will create the 10th largest bank in the US
with assets of Dollars 58bn.
Sterling has assets of almost Dollars 1bn and operates 13 banking offices in
Massachusetts, which will be added to Fleet's 155 branches in the state.
Fleet's chairman and chief executive Mr Terrence Murray said the acquisition
would allow it to expand its middle-market corporate lending, consumer
services and investment services businesses in the region.
Under the terms of the deal, which has yet to be approved by Sterling's
shareholders and banking authorities, Fleet will offer 1.1575 of its own
shares for every Sterling share, which are valued at Dollars 39.50 each.
News of the acquisition lifted Sterling's stock Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 36
1/4 on the over-the-counter Nasdaq market. Fleet's shares eased Dollars 1/8
to Dollars 34 on the New York Stock Exchange.

FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Strong PC demand helps lift
Intel to record quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
INTEL, the world's largest computer chip maker, yesterday reported record
revenue and earnings for the third quarter.
Net income increased 143 per cent over last year's corresponding quarter,
while revenues advanced 57 per cent.
Intel, the dominant supplier of microprocessor 'brain' chips for personal
computers, is riding on a wave of strong demand for PCs.
The company's 486 DX2 microprocessor has become the 'workhorse of business
computing', said Mr Andrew Grove, president and chief executive.
Net income was Dollars 584m, or Dollars 1.33 a share, compared with Dollars
241m, or 56 cents, in last year's third quarter. Revenue for the quarter
rose to Dollars 2.24bn, up from Dollars 1.43bn last time.
The company said its nine-month revenue and net income exceeded the
corresponding totals for all 1992.
For the first nine months of 1993, net income advanced to Dollars 1.7bn, or
Dollars 3.86 a share, from Dollars 638m, or Dollars 1.49 a share, in the
same period last year. Revenue was Dollars 6.39bn, up 60 per cent.
Earnings were in line with Wall Street's expectations, but failed to match
the most optimistic projections. Intel's stock price closed at Dollars 65
1/2 , down Dollars 4 3/4 from a Friday close of Dollars 70 1/4 , in heavy
trading.
Intel said it expected to ship 'hundreds of thousands' of its latest
microprocessors, called Pentium, this year and millions next year. It added
that about 100 Pentium-based computers will be launched by computer
manufacturers later this year.
The company said strong demand for other semiconductor products, including
flash memory chips and microcontrollers, contributed to its strong
third-quarter revenues.
During the quarter two other chip manufacturers announced plans to compete
with Intel in the PC microprocessor market. Texas Instruments of the US and
United Microelectronics of Taiwan are the latest entrants into a growing
field of Intel 'clone' chip makers.
Sun Microsystems announced yesterday that it had set up a sales and
distribution organisation for Sparc microprocessors and supporting chips,
manufactured by Texas Instruments and other licensees.
Sparc chips are used in Sun's computer workstations. The move represents
Sun's latest effort to establish Sparc as an alternative standard to Intel's
microprocessors.

FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Sprint takes Dollars 56m charge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK MCGURTY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPRINT, the US telecommunications company, is to take an after-tax charge of
Dollars 56m, or 16 cents a share, to cover the cost of restructuring, tax
increases and debt reduction in the third quarter.
Most of the provision is associated with the cost of reorganising the
company's operations following its merger with Centel, a Chicago-based
provider of cellular and local telephone services.
Sprint, the third-largest long-distance telephone company in the US,
acquired Centel in a Dollars 3.6bn stock-swap deal completed in March.
Mr Charles Schelke, an analyst at Smith Barney Shearson, said the
announcement would have no effect on his third-quarter earnings forecast of
51 cents a share.
In the quarter to the end of September 1992, Sprint posted net income of
Dollars 115m, or 52 cents a share.
The results are not directly comparable to figures for the current quarter
because of the issue of new shares as part of the Centel acquisition.
The warning by Sprint follows an announcement in August of a plan to
eliminate about 1,000 jobs, about 5 per cent of the workforce, at its
long-distance division.
In addition, two facilities in Indiana and Virginia are to be closed. In the
first quarter, Sprint said it would eliminate 1,500 jobs as part of a
consolidation of its cellular and local telephone operations.
In breaking down the components of the third-quarter charge, Sprint said the
cost of restructuring would reduce after-tax earnings in the period by
Dollars 28m. Federal tax increases enacted in August would require it to
take a one-time charge of Dollars 13m, or 4 cents. A further Dollars 15m
charge would cover the cost of refinancing and the early retirement of debt.
On Wall Street, Sprint stock fell Dollars 3/4 yesterday to close at Dollars
36 1/4.

FRUIT OF the Loom, the US clothing manufacturer, has agreed to buy Salem
Sportswear, a maker of sports and children's wear, for Dollars 12.75 a share

Salem's shares, which are quoted on the Nasdaq over-the-counter market, rose
Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 12 3/8 .
Salem, which makes sportswear licensed by the four big US professional
sports leagues, is expected to earn about 75 cents a share in the year to
next August.
Fruit of the Loom believes the price paid for the company will be justified
by the opportunity to expand its range of sports and children's wear and

waste groups
</HEADLINE>

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIP Environmental of Canada is buying two US hazardous waste companies
for almost USDollars 100m.
The acquisition of Seattle-based Burlington Environmental for USDollars 75m
and Nortru for USDollars 23m will add hazardous waste, recycling and
environmental engineering revenues of USDollars 120m to Philip's annual
volume. This will increase Philip's total sales to about USDollars 325m.
Philip, based in Hamilton, Ontario, is financing the deal by selling
USDollars 120m of special warrants to underwriters, allowing investors to
buy convertible debentures.
St Lawrence Cement, eastern Canada's biggest cement maker which is
controlled by the Swiss Holderbank group, bought 11 per cent of Philip in
1991 and has the right to maintain an interest up to 22 per cent.
Philip is an industrial recycler, which also collects waste and operates
landfill sites across Canada and in key US markets. The company had dropped
plans for an equity issue because of poor first-quarter results. Its latest
acquisition was a Hamilton-based metals recycler.
Philip recorded first-half net profit of CDollars 4.8m (USDollars 3.6m), or
15 cents a share, down from CDollars 7m or 24 cents, a year earlier. It
blamed the first-quarter problems on severe weather and said the shortfall
would be made up by year-end.
Mr Allen Fracassi, president, said Philip would apply the Dollars 22m
remaining from the warrant issue to reduce debt.
Belgium's Tractabel has formed a joint venture with the Montreal property
and construction group Desourdy to introduce new European waste treatment
technology to the Canadian market. Projects worth CDollars 50m are planned
in Ontario and Quebec.

FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Motorola earnings exceed
forecast
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Motorola, the US semiconductor manufacturer, surged Dollars 3 to
Dollars 101 1/2 in after-hours trading on the New York stock exchange
yesterday after reporting earnings sharply above forecast.
Third-quarter earnings jumped to Dollars 254m, or 92 cents a share from
Dollars 127m, or 47 cents, a year earlier. Analysts had expected the company
to earn between 67 cents and 83 cents a share.
Sales in the quarter totalled Dollars 4.48bn against Dollars 3.48bn in the
same period last year.
Nine-month earnings amounted to Dollars 682m, or Dollars 2.50 a share, up
from Dollars 272m, or Dollars 1.02, a year earlier. Sales for the nine
months totalled Dollars 11.97bn, against Dollars 9.59bn.
Nine-months earnings per share fully diluted were Dollars 2.40, against
Dollars 1.01. Last year's figures include a loss of Dollars 123m from the
cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting standard.
Motorola said that its third-quarter net margin on sales was 5.7 per cent,
compared with 3.7 per cent a year earlier, while in the first nine months
net margin on sales was 5.7 per cent, up from 4.1 per cent a year earlier.
Mr Gary Tooker, president and chief operating officer, said sales in the
company's semiconductor products segment rose 31 per cent for the quarter,
to Dollars 1.51bn. Orders rose 25 per cent and segment profits increased, he
added.
In the general systems sector, sales rose 43 per cent to Dollars 1.35bn,
while orders rose 58 per cent. Segment profits also increased, Motorola
said.
The company did not provide any forecast, beyond saying that third-quarter
and nine-months results were not necessarily indicative of those to be
expected for the full year.

<TEXT>
ICI AUSTRALIA, part of Imperial Chemical Industries, is to go ahead with
construction of a ADollars 300m (USDollars 200m) pipeline linking the Moomba
gas fields in South Australia with its Botany Bay petrochemical plant. This
follows a decision by the South Australian government to sell ethane to the
ICI plant.
ICI's expenditure will be spread over a couple of years. About ADollars 170m
will be spent on the pipeline; ADollars 100m on the Botany Bay facility; and
the remainder in South Australia's Cooper Basin. The pipeline will be about
1,380km long, and follow a similar route to the existing Moomba-Sydney
pipeline.
The aim is to switch the Botany Bay plant over to South Australian ethane by
May 1996. ICI has been anxious to secure long-term feedstock supplies
locally.
The decision to sell ethane to ICI followed a deal between the South
Australian authorities and the Queensland government for the latter to
supply natural gas to South Australia after existing contracts between the
states expire in 2003.

RELIANCE Industries, the Indian textiles and chemicals group currently in
the middle of the country's largest corporate fund-raising exercise,
yesterday posted a 14 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to
Rs2.07bn (Dollars 66.8m).
Sales in the six months to the end of September rose 35 per cent to
Rs24.7bn. Reliance said it had performed well in the first half and forecast
'an even better performance on all major indicators in the second half'.
Reliance Industries is the flagship of the fast-growing Reliance group
headed by Mr Dhirubhai Ambani and his sons Mr Anil Ambani and Mr Mukesh
Ambani.
Last year it raised funds for two plastics factories being built in
partnership with Itochu, the Japanese trading company. Now it is raising
Rs8.6bn in the first slice of a Rs21.7bn convertible bond issue for a new
company, Reliance Petroleum, which plans to construct a Rs51.4bn oil
refinery. If the project goes ahead as planned, the refinery will be India's
biggest private-sector industrial investment.
Mr Dhirubhai Ambani has built Reliance over the last 25 years from a small
trading company into one of India's largest industrial houses, rivalling
much older combines such as the Tata group. Unlike longer established houses
which are usually highly diversified, Reliance has concentrated on building
a vertically integrated group focused on oil, petrochemicals and their
derivatives such as artificial fibres, plastics and chemicals.

FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Phone privatisation proves
profitable in Venezuela - Joseph Mann reports on the two-year transformation
of a previously under-funded public company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSEPH MANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY two years after taking operating control of Venezuela's national
telecommunications concern, GTE of the US has provided the Caracas
government with an opportunity to ease the state's fiscal deficit.
Compania Anonima Telefonos de Venezuela (CANTV) has been turned from a
money-losing, inefficient concern into a profitable company, although GTE
has a long way to go in its transformation.
The Venezuelan government, which owns 49 per cent of CANTV following a
partial privatisation in 1991, hopes to raise some Dollars 800m from the
sale of part of its stake this year.
GTE led Venworld Telecom, the international consortium that won 40 per cent
of CANTV with a bid of Dollars 1.89bn. Venworld is controlled by GTE, which
has 51 per cent, and has four other partners: Telefonica de Espana (16 per
cent), La Electricidad de Caracas (Venezuela's largest private utility,
holding 16 per cent), CIMA (the investment arm of Venezuela's Banco
Mercantil group, with 12 per cent) and AT&amp;T (5 per cent). CANTV employees
will eventually own 11 per cent of their company's shares.
CANTV was in poor shape when it was privatised. An erratic telephone service
was not only a social irritant, but also seriously hindered economic
development. Under government ownership CANTV invested little in equipment
and had an appalling record in maintenance and service to the public.
For example, in 1991 Venezuela had eight telephones per 100 inhabitants,
compared with 49 per 100 in more developed countries. Digital lines
accounted for only 20 per cent of total lines (62 per cent), 80 per cent of
outgoing international calls were not completed (35 per cent), and 57 per
cent of public telephones were out of service at any time (5 per cent).
Since December 1991, Venworld has made more capital investments than the
country's telecommunications industry received over the previous two
decades. The 'new CANTV' invested Dollars 500m last year and plans capital
outlays of Dollars 650m in 1993 as part of a Dollars 6bn capital investment
programme between 1992-2000.
Other than using its own cash to invest, the company will receive more than
Dollars 300m in loans this year from external sources such as export-import
banks in the US, Japan, France, Germany and Sweden, as well as from
syndicated bank loans and commercial paper.
Investments cover new digital telephone lines, new public telephones,
infrastructure and service improvements, installation of fibre-optic
systems, expansion of international telecommunications capacity, rural and
cellular telephone systems, new services for telephone customers, businesses
and other communications clients, plus other areas.
CANTV installed 413,000 digital telephone lines in 1992 and is adding
459,000 more this year. It installed or replaced 18,400 public telephones
last year, and is aiming for another 17,000 by December.
Customers have noticed a big improvement in reliability of services, and
repairs are often done within days rather than weeks or months.
Financial results during the first year of privatisation were also a big
improvement over previous years, when CANTV regularly produced red ink and
paid little in taxes to the Venezuelan treasury.
Using figures adjusted for inflation, CANTV had operating revenues of
Dollars 986m in 1992 (78.5bn bolivars), up from Dollars 637m the previous
year. Net income for 1992 was Dollars 169m, compared to a loss of Dollars
72m in 1991. The improvement was due to higher rates for telecommunications
services, better collection procedures and expanded services.
Aside from normal income taxes, CANTV now also pays the treasury a special
tax of 5 per cent of its ordinary annual revenues, plus quarterly royalty
fees.
The 35-year concession contract grants CANTV the exclusive right to operate
all local and long-distance (national and international) telephone services
for nine years. Other services, such as cellular phones and data
transmission, are open to competition.
There is still debate among Venezuelan officials and CANTV executives over
when the government should put its remaining shares up for sale. While some
in the cash-strapped government want to tap the US stock market as soon as
possible to shore up official finances this year, others argue that the
uncertainties of a presidential election year and recent political upheavals
will have a negative effect on the sales price of shares.
Pricing for these new shares is also a problem, since the privatisation is
still in its early stages and the company declared no dividends in 1992.
CANTV's privatisation, the biggest sale of Venezuelan state assets so far
and one of the largest in Latin America, is a big test for the government's
privatisation programme - and for CANTV, which must continue to develop
services, retrain (or replace) the 20,000 employees it inherited from the
days of government ownership, and cope with a militant labour union in
Caracas.

FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Joint venture with Goplana gives
Nestle Polish production base

NESTLE, the international confectionery and foods company, has won the
exclusive right from the Polish authorities to negotiate a joint venture
with Goplana, the last major state-owned chocolate manufacturer. This gives
Nestle its first production base in the country.
The successful bid, mounted only two months ago, thwarts a two-year effort
by ED and F. Man, the cocoa and sugar brokers, working with Elite Industries
from Israel, to establish a joint venture with Goplana in Poznan, which
controls 10 per cent of the domestic market.
Nestle said it would take 42 per cent in the new joint venture, making its
investment worth around Dollars 32m.
This leaves a 5 per cent share with the recently privatised Wielkopolski
Bank Kredytowy based in Poznan, which bid with Nestle.
The level of additional spending by Nestle on developing Goplana has yet to
be negotiated before a final contract is signed.
Poland's other important chocolate manufacturers have already been sold with
Wedel, the best known brand going to PepsiCo Foods International, while
Wawel in Krakow has been taken over by management and employees.
Kraft Jacobs Suchard have also bought Olza, a chocolate and biscuit maker in
Cieszyn. Meanwhile, Pozmeat, a Poznan-based meat processor, was sold
yesterday to management, employees and private investors, including Animex,
a major meat foreign trader, in a deal valuing the plant at 80bn zlotys
(USDollars 4.1m).
The purchasers have pledged to invest 90bn zlotys over the next four years
in Pozmeat, which reported sales worth 358bn zlotys in the first half of
this year with a net profit of 10bn zlotys.
The sale came as the government announced that Rolimpex, Poland's
state-owned grain and farm produce foreign trader, would be privatised
through a public share offer by the end of March next year.
Up to 40 per cent of Rolimpex's shares are to be sold to private investors
with 35 per cent retained by management and employees.
Twenty-five per cent of the equity is to be retained by the treasury and
state-owned institutions.

FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: BHP reveals 50% PNG mine stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BROKEN Hill Proprietary, the Australian steel and natural resources group,
yesterday confirmed that it now has a stake of more than 50 per cent in Ok
Tedi, the large copper and gold mine in Papua New Guinea.
The increase in BHP's stake follows the decision by Amoco, the US oil group,
to sell its 30 per cent interest in the mine. BHP, which already held a
similar 30 per cent interest, is understood to have acquired the Amoco stake
and is expected to pass on one-third of this to the Papua New Guinea
government.
Yesterday's announcement said the government was expected to raise its
holding from 20 per cent to 30 per cent, with effect from January 1 1994.
Metall Mining Corporation, the Canadian subsidiary of Germany's
Metallgesellschaft, has also doubled its interest in the project recently,
to 15 per cent, by buying out the 7.5 per cent stake held by Degussa.
The remaining 5 per cent interest is held by DEG, the German government's
overseas development body.
BHP declined to discuss how much it had paid for the stake, or the terms of
transaction, saying that discussions over final details of the ownership
structure at Ok Tedi were continuing.
There has been speculation that BHP would pay less, on a pro rata basis,
than the USDollars 35m which MMC paid for the additional 7.5 per cent
holding, but would indemnify Amoco against future indemnity claims.
The Ok Tedi project was developed at a cost of USDollars 1.4bn in the 1980s.
Expected life of the mine is expected to be at least 15 years.

<TEXT>
PHILIP Environmental of Canada is buying two US hazardous waste companies
for almost USDollars 100m.
The acquisition of Seattle-based Burlington Environmental for USDollars 75m
and Nortru for USDollars 23m will add hazardous waste, recycling and
environmental engineering revenues of USDollars 120m to Philip's annual
volume. This will increase Philip's total sales to about USDollars 325m.
Philip, based in Hamilton, Ontario, is financing the deal by selling
USDollars 120m of special warrants to underwriters, allowing investors to
buy convertible debentures.
St Lawrence Cement, eastern Canada's biggest cement maker which is
controlled by the Swiss Holderbank group, bought 11 per cent of Philip in
1991 and has the right to maintain an interest up to 22 per cent.
Philip is an industrial recycler, which also collects waste and operates
landfill sites across Canada and in key US markets. It had dropped plans for
an equity issue because of poor first-quarter results. Its latest
acquisition was a Hamilton-based metals recycler.
Philip recorded first-half net profit of CDollars 4.8m (USDollars 3.6m), or
15 cents a share, down from CDollars 7m or 24 cents, a year earlier. It
blamed the first-quarter problems on severe weather and said the shortfall
would be made up by year-end.
Mr Allen Fracassi, president, said Philip would apply the Dollars 22m
remaining from the warrant issue to reduce debt. Belgium's Tractabel has
formed a joint venture with the Montreal property and construction group
Desourdy to introduce new European waste treatment technology to the
Canadian market. Projects worth CDollars 50m are planned in Ontario and
Quebec.

FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: GFSA reaps benefit of higher
average gold price in first term

<TEXT>
A 17 per cent rise in the average gold price received helped Gold Fields of
South Africa lift after-tax profit from its gold mines by nearly 30 per cent
to R396.6m (USDollars 115m) from R306.6m in the first quarter, which ended
in September.
The mid-year price spike in the gold bullion market saw the average price
rise to R41,640 a kg from R35,672 a kg the previous quarter.
Gold Fields does not hedge any of its production, so the price accurately
reflects the spot market.
However, Mr Alan Munro, executive director, pointed out that this price was
still lower in real terms than the price of between four and five years
years ago.
Overall group production rose slightly to 29,258kg in the quarter from
28,775kg in June.
Working profit increased by 45 per cent to R491.3m from R337.8m, but the tax
bill more than doubled to R148.6m from R72.4m, which restricted growth in
bottom-line earnings.
Mr Munro would not comment on whether the better gold price (following the
recent weakening of the rand, it is still trading close to R40,000 a kg)
would encourage any new mines to be developed, but said existing producers
were busy with substantial replacement tonnage schemes.
Driefontein, the group's flagship producer, had a steady quarter, with West
Driefontein continuing to recover from disruptions caused by fire and East
Driefontein again the star performer.
After-tax profits rose to R185.9m from R161.9m, but the tax bill rose to
R142.5m from R67.5m.
Kloof, the other large producer in the group, fared rather better because
the merger last year with Libanon and Venterspost resulted in it paying
barely any tax.
As a result, after-tax profits increased to R187.5m from R114.1m.
Mr Munro also pointed to the turnround at the Libanon division, which would
have been closed but for the merger.
The mine made a working profit of R7.7m, following a R15.2m loss in the
previous quarter.
Of the other two producers in the group, the marginal Doornfontein made a
taxed profit of R4.6m, down from R15.3m, while Deelkraal increased profits
to R18.6m from R15.2m.

ARAB Banking Corp, one of the Middle East's biggest banks, has announced an
agreement to sell 20 per cent of its wholly-owned Hong Kong subsidiary to a
Chinese group, Reuter reports from Manama.
ABC chief executive Mr Abdulla Saudi said that ABC also hoped soon to offer
25 per cent of the subsidiary, International Bank of Asia, to investors in
Hong Kong.
The 20 per cent stake will go to China Everbright Holdings, the Hong Kong
arm of the Everbright group under the control of China's State Council, ABC
said.
The deal is subject to final approval from the Monetary Authority of Hong
Kong.
'We are very soon going to offer 25 per cent on the Hong Kong stock market,'
Mr Saudi said. 'This will hopefully take place in the very near future.'
The sales form part of ABC's strategy of forming strategic alliances around
the world while still maintaining a controlling interest in its
subsidiaries.
ABC was particularly keen to position itself to take advantage of China's
fast growth, Saudi said, and this link-up will enable it to do so.

FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Alcoa of Australia ahead after
nine months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WEAKER Australian dollar and the benefits of expansion at the Wagerup
refinery helped push up profits at Alcoa of Australia, the intergrated
aluminium producer, in the nine months to end-September. Net profits before
abnormal items rose 47.6 per cent to ADollars 300.4m (USDollars 198m).
The results, which were reached on total revenues of ADollars 1.66bn against
ADollars 1.61bn last time, were also aided by lower corporate taxes.
However, even before tax and abnormals, Alcoa of Australia, in which Alcoa
of America and Western Mining Corporation are the largest shareholders,
posted a 37.3 per cent improvement to ADollars 453m.
After abnormals, the company made a net ADollars 360.1m, compared with
ADollars 203.5m in the same period last year.
Alcoa said the results reflected the favourable impact of the alumina
refinery expansion on production, shipments and costs, and the weaker
Australian dollar.
These benefits were partially offset by lower US dollar prices for aluminium
ingot, can sheet and alumina, lower interest income and lower ore grade from
gold-mining operations. Gold production for the period was 103,885 fine
ounces, compared with 124,712 ounces in the first nine months of 1992.

<TEXT>
KRAFT Jacobs Suchard (KJS), part of Philip Morris of the US, this week took
a further step into the eastern European food market by acquiring 67 per
cent of Lithuania's Kaunas Confectionery Company for Dollars 16m.
Mr Bernard Huber, KJS vice-president for central and eastern Europe, called
the deal 'an important part of our east European confectionery strategy'.
The purchase price includes a commitment to invest Dollars 12.5m in the
business, which employs 800 people.
KJS, which expects total revenues of Dollars 9bn this year and is the
third-largest food manufacturer in Europe, has made similar acquisitions in
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland.
The deal marks the second foray into Lithuania by Philip Morris, which in
April beat British American Tobacco to acquire the Klaipeda Tobacco Company
for Dollars 40m - the biggest western investment in the Baltic states so
far.
The Kaunas deal repeats a pattern which has marked Philip Morris' entry into
other east European markets. Shortly after it bought a majority stake in the
Czech Tabak cigarette factory last year, Jacobs Suchard bought Figaro, a
confectionery company in the Slovak Republic.
Last summer Jacobs Suchard, a confectionery and coffee business which is in
the process of merging with Kraft, acquired Dadak, a Czech spice producer.
Inexpensive western consumer products, such as cigarettes and chocolates,
are in strong demand in the former Soviet bloc. It is estimated that 700bn
cigarettes are sold in the region every year.
In Lithuania, Philip Morris and KJS have inherited a virtual monopoly
propped up by high import duties. Kaunas, the country's largest sweets
company with Dollars 10m in total sales, sells 90 per cent of its output on
the domestic market.
But KJS may want to tap the export potential. Though Lithuania is a small
country of 3.7m people, it is often seen as a stepping stone to larger
neighbouring markets. By buying local companies, Philip Morris and its
subsidiary inherit informal trade contacts cultivated under Soviet rule that
may help to smooth any future moves east.
Estonia, Latvia and Belarus are the markets closest to Lithuania. But Russia
remains the most lucrative - in particular the St Petersburg region, which
includes northern Europe's largest city and a population approaching 9m.

Japanese banks, under pressure from mounting bad loans, have increased
efforts to sell collateral taken for the loans.
The move to sell the Hyatt Regency Waikiki, a 1,230-room luxury hotel on
Oahu Island, follows a row earlier this year between Mitsui Trust, Azabu's
main creditor, and Mr Kitaro Watanabe, owner of Azabu.
Mitsui Trust officials said they would gradually try to unload collateral

the first phase of the group's privatisation.
Singapore is to sell between 1.1bn and 1.9bn shares, or between 7.2 and 12.5
per cent of the company, in three tranches.
The basic price of SDollars 2 per share gives Singapore Telecommunications a
prospective price/earnings ratio of 27. The ratio is higher than the market
average of 23, but such a premium is in line with other successful
telecommunications networks in Asia.
'It's priced quite aggressively, but it's a utility stock that's well
managed and it's a play on the Singapore economy,' said Mr Manu Bhaskaran of
Crosby Securities in Singapore. 'I think a lot of people will pile into it.'
Earlier this year, analysts were placing a much more modest value on ST, but
estimates have risen sharply in the last few weeks. A recent rise in the
value of the Singapore dollar has been attributed partly to an inflow of
funds for the purchase of ST shares.
The three-tranche allocation system for ST shares reflects the government's
plans to encourage Singaporean citizens to buy shares and maintain a
personal stake in their economy. Two of the tranches are for Singaporeans
only.
Under Group A, the 1.75m Singaporeans contributing to the compulsory Central
Provident Fund pension plan will be able to buy a maximum of 600 shares
each, at a 5 per cent discount (a price of SDollars 1.90) and with the
benefit of a special 40 for 100 shares 'loyalty' dividend paid in stock over
six years.
The government has set aside 350m shares for this group, but the figure
could rise to 1.05bn shares in the unlikely event that everyone applies for
the maximum allocation.
Under Group B, 200m shares are set aside at a price of SDollars 2 each for
Singaporeans only, including 40.7m shares reserved for ST employees. Each
applicant can buy a maximum of 1,000 shares.
Under Group C, both Singaporeans and foreigners may bid for the remaining
550m shares on offer, subject to a minimum bid price of SDollars 2. The
number of shares could be lifted by 100m to a 650m ceiling if there is
sufficient demand.
Brokers expect the strike price, boosted by foreign investors keen to have a
stake in what will be by far the largest company on the Stock Exchange of
Singapore, to be above the SDollars 2 minimum. ST's flotation will increase
the market's capitalisation by nearly a quarter.
'The competition is going to be for Tranche C. I expect the issue will be
more than fully subscribed,' said one broker yesterday.
Bids will be received from today until October 28, and the shares can begin
trading from November 1 as soon as they are issued.

FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Shareholder threat to
Volvo-Renault deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S small shareholders' association yesterday stepped up its campaign
to block a proposed merger between Volvo's car and truck business and
France's Renault, claiming it had won the support of an institutional
shareholder.
The group, called Aktiespararna, also wrote to Volvo insisting the merger
would require a change in the company's articles of association at the
November 9 shareholders' meeting on last month's deal, a move that would
require two-thirds support instead of the simple majority needed to approve
the merger.
Mr Lars-Erik Forsgardh, chief executive of Aktiespararna, refused to
identify the institution he said was ready to support the association, or
how big a share of votes it held. But he said he had received verbal
assurances it would give Aktiespararna its proxy votes and added that he was
optimistic of winning over more institutional shareholders. However, the
association still appears to have the odds against it.
Volvo is already assured of support from more than 20 per cent of the voting
stock. Aktiespararna said yesterday its members probably held a little less
than the 7.7 per cent of votes they controlled when a survey was last
conducted three years ago. The largest institutional shareholder, a Swedish
state pension fund, holds around 7 per cent.
Volvo will today have a chance to press its case further at an annual
meeting at its headquarters in Gothenberg of a dozen of its largest
shareholders. Apart from Renault, the biggest single shareholder with 8.2
per cent, they include state pension funds, investment companies, bank
pension funds and insurance groups. The company said it did not accept that
the Renault merger required a change in its articles, saying the terms of
the deal were covered under its existing articles.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FT last Saturday incorrectly stated that the NKr526m (Dollars 74m)
profit returned by Aker, the Norwegian cement and offshore technology group,
for the first eight months of the year was due to a NKr702m exceptional
gain, most of which came from the sale of its stake in Valenciana, the
Spanish cement producer. The sale of this stake in fact took place in the
same period last year.

FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Perstorp pays more as profits
surge 45%

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PERSTORP, the Swedish speciality chemicals and plastics group, said
yesterday that profits after financial items rose by 45 per cent to SKr330m
(Dollars 41m) in the year to August 31, compared to SKr228m.
The result includes devaluation gains of SKr66m, although this was partially
offset by SKr40m in restructuring costs. The dividend is being increased to
SKr4.80 per share from SKr4.55.
The group said its North American units had a better year, thanks to a
stronger US economy, but in Europe it had to continue rationalising as
market conditions worsened.
All six of the company's divisions achieved higher sales, helping group-wide
sales to rise 17 per cent to SKr8.58bn. However, while the company's
speciality chemicals, biotec, components, and Chemitec units all improved
earnings, there were declines in plastic systems and surface materials.
Plastics systems was hit by rationalisation costs, while surface materials
suffered from the impact of a weak construction market.
During the year, the group concentrated on strengthening its position in key
markets, by acquisitions and by integrating recently-acquired companies in
France and Germany. The company had lower financial expenses thanks to the
drop in interest rates and currency-hedging measures.

FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Paramount agrees to open talks
with QVC Network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS of Paramount Communications, the besieged US entertainment group,
yesterday bowed to mounting pressure and agreed to open informal talks with
QVC Network, the home shopping channel that has mounted a hostile bid for
the group.
It said issues to be discussed would include any regulatory restraints, the
value of QVC stock, and 'the certainty and time frame of the transaction
being consummated'.
Paramount stressed that it still intended to proceed with an agreed
cash-and-shares offer by Viacom, the cable television company, valuing it at
Dollars 7.3bn.
However, Paramount's directors have had to recognise that QVC's hostile
cash-and-shares offer, worth Dollars 9.5bn, is not only worth Dollars 2.2bn
more than the friendly Viacom bid, but also includes Dollars 30 worth of
cash for each Paramount share, compared with just Dollars 9.10 worth of cash
in the Viacom offer.
QVC, though a fast-growing company, is much smaller than either Paramount or
Viacom, and Paramount has questioned whether the company has the financial
muscle to raise the Dollars 3.5bn necessary to fund the cash portion of its
offer.
Last week, however, QVC said it had secured funding of Dollars 4bn for its
bid: two Dollars 500m equity investments from Liberty Media and Comcast,
cable companies which are shareholders in QVC, and promises of Dollars 500m
each from six banks.
Separately, Liberty Media's former parent, Tele-Communications Inc,
announced that it was in talks with Liberty over a possible buy-back of the
company - a move that would put another large and well-financed company on
QVC's side, since Liberty holds 22.5 per cent of QVC's stock.
Viacom yesterday attempted to shrug off the latest development. It said
Paramount's decision to hold talks with QVC was 'consistent with our merger
agreement and with the board's responsibilities'.
It said the talks would also give Paramount an opportunity to address the
anti-trust issues it alleges have been raised by the QVC offer.
Viacom, which has garnered a war chest of almost Dollars 2bn with which it
could increase its bid through alliances with Nynex, a regional telephone
company, and Blockbuster Entertainment, the video retailer, is expected to
stay its hand pending the outcome of the Paramount/QVC talks.
Shares in QVC were down Dollars 1/4 at Dollars 56 1/4 yesterday, valuing its
bid at just under Dollars 80 1/4 a share. Viacom's A shares were up Dollars
 3/8 at Dollars 56 1/2 and its B shares were up Dollars 7/8 at Dollars 52
5/8, valuing its bid at just over Dollars 62. Paramount's shares were up
Dollars 1/8 at Dollars 76 7/8.

FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Advance in interim results
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MACULAN, the Austrian construction group with substantial interests in
eastern Europe, has reported a 12 per cent rise in operating profit to
Sch141m (Dollars 12.5m) in the first half of 1993 and has forecast a 21 per
surge in net income for the full year to Sch260m.
Interim turnover was up 23 per cent to Sch6.06bn and the group's order book
stood at a record Sch10.8bn at the end of June, 41 per cent higher than a
year earlier.
Maculan, which raised Sch695m through a rights issue in June to help finance
acquisitions in eastern Europe, said that first-half growth was mainly due
to a 54 per cent increase in turnover in Germany. Excluding the first time
contribution of two east German acquisitions, growth in turnover was 16 per
cent.
Work on the group's Sch1.9bn contract to build 3,000 flats in Moscow for
returning Russian soldiers has been disturbed by the recent political
upheaval, but this has not so far resulted in payments, which have been
guaranteed by the German government, being delayed.

FT  12 OCT 93 / International Company News: Maculan looks to central Europe
 -Ian Rodger on the growth hopes of an Austrian construction group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I BELIEVE in central Europe; it will become the most important economic area
in the world,' forecasts Mr Alexander Maculan, chairman of the Austrian
construction company of the same name.
And Maculan, the third largest Austrian construction group, has been acting
on its boss's beliefs in a most aggressive way.
Over the past two years, it has bet its future on the eastern German market,
investing Sch1bn (Dollars 88.6m) in buying six construction companies and a
gravel quarry in the old GDR from the Treuhandanstalt.
The group's German business, 92 per cent of which is in eastern Germany,
accounts for over half of its total turnover, and investment analysts regard
Maculan as the purest investment play on the area known as Europe's largest
construction site.
The big German construction companies, such as Philipp Holzmann and
Hochtief, may do more business in eastern Germany than Maculan does, but
their revenues from there form a smaller part of their overall business.
Maculan's interim report, published yesterday, indicated that the bet still
seems to be going the group's way.
The company reported a 12 per cent rise in operating profits in the first
half of 1993 to Sch126m, and boosted its forecast of net income for the full
year to Sch260m from an earlier Sch240m.
If the forecast proves correct, it will give Maculan a fourth successive
year of double digit profit growth.
The group remains unequivocally bullish. 'Eastern Germany looks like
remaining the biggest building site in Europe medium-term,' Maculan said in
its interim report to shareholders.
Alexander Maculan was an unlikely executive to take such a bold initiative.
The son of the group's founder, he took control of the company in 1962 when
he was only 21, his father having been killed in a small aircraft crash a
few years earlier.
Until the 1980s, he was known mainly for his prowess on the golf course, but
then he suddenly became interested in building the business both inside and
outside Austria.
A contract in Russia and a small acquisition in Germany gave him both the
confidence and the insight to take advantage of the once in a lifetime
opportunities that presented themselves when the Iron Curtain collapsed.
He has financed his bet by taking the company public in 1990 and raising
over Sch2bn in new equity and convertible debt in three operations, reducing
his personal stake to 49.7 per cent (68.8 per cent of the votes).
The biggest question mark over any company making such a rapid expansion,
especially by acquisition, is management capacity.
Mr Maculan seems unworried, saying that the group tries to keep the managers
in the companies it acquires.
'We are a very attractive company for managers. We have a training programme
like no other construction company. Last year, we spent DM20m in training,'
he says.
He also points to his own unusually long training to be a chairman. 'I have
never been involved in the day to day management. Professional managers can
do it better than me. My job is to help our people, to find targets for
them, to make acquisitions.'

THE DUTCH government has appointed ABN Amro, the country's largest bank, as
global co-ordinator and lead manager of next year's flotation of a first
tranche of shares in Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the telecommunications and
postal company.
Two other Dutch banks, ING Bank and Rabobank, will be co-lead managers of
the underwriting syndicate in the Netherlands. The government has not yet
released the names of regional lead managers in other parts of the world but
expects to do so shortly.
The role of lead manager had been widely expected to go to a Dutch bank,
with ABN Amro and ING the main contenders.
Earlier, NM Rothschild was appointed as the state's adviser in the flotation
 -the biggest in Dutch corporate history - while KPN is being advised by
Goldman Sachs.

FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: TI raises Pounds 40m from sale of Dowty
units
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TI GROUP, the specialist engineering company, has sold for Pounds 40m
businesses taken over last year following its acquisition of Dowty.
The businesses formed part of the electronic systems division of Dowty and
supply equipment to the defence and aerospace markets.
The purchaser is Ultra Electronics, a new company led by Mr Julian Blogh, a
former managing director of Dowty Avionics.
TI said the net asset value of the companies being sold was Pounds 24.3m.
Under FRS 3 TI will be taking neither a profit nor a loss through the P&amp;L.
What would have been a profit on the sale under old accounting rules is
offset by the writing back of goodwill already written off directly to the
balance sheet.
Montagu Private Equity and Phildrew Ventures are taking equity stakes in
Ultra while debt is being provided by a syndicate of banks led by Bank of
Scotland.
The businesses being sold have operating profits of Pounds 6m on sales of
Pounds 80m, according to Phildrew Ventures.
Sir Christopher Lewington, TI chairman and chief executive, said the
disposal would raise to Pounds 60m the proceeds from sales this year. TI was
on target to achieve its disposal objectives by the end of 1994.
The proceeds have been used to reduce group debt. Net gearing will fall from
85 per cent ahead of the deal to 64 per cent.
Mr Blogh said the businesses had been less affected by the cut-backs in the
defence and aviation sectors because the projects had long life cycles.
Mr Tim Hart of Phildrew said that while defence was out of vogue, Ultra
would have attractive market shares in a number of good niches.

FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Premier Health losses widen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Premier Health Group - the nursing management company formerly known as
Acsis - had a difficult first half, turning in a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.2m
for the six months to June 30, against a Pounds 285,000 deficit for the
comparable period last year.
There were same-again losses per share of 0.4p and, as last time, no
dividend will be paid. Turnover on continuing activities was Pounds 6.27m
(Pounds 6.53m).
Before the refinancing and restructuring completed in September, the company
had borrowings of Pounds 12.6m and was in breach of its covenants and
repayment agreements.
The group now has overdrafts of Pounds 275,000, cash of Pounds 372,000 and
long term borrowings of Pounds 3.2m.
The pre-tax figure was struck after refinancing costs of Pounds 523,000 and
an exchange loss on long-term borrowings of Pounds 149,000 (gain of Pounds
172,000). Interest charges were reduced to Pounds 179,000 (Pounds 541,000).
There was a profit of Pounds 239,000 arising from the closure of a
discontinued business.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A sharp improvement in trading margins enabled Dublin-based Ryan Hotels to
lift pre-tax profits from IPounds 51,000 to IPounds 526,000, or Pounds
501,000, for the six months to July 29.
At the trading level margins rose from 11 per cent to 17 per cent,
generating pre-interest profits of IPounds 1.99m (IPounds 1.27m). Interest
charges accounted for IPounds 1.47m (IPounds 1.22m). However, these were
expected to be significantly lower in the second half than for the same
period of the previous year.
Turnover of IPounds 11.5m compared with last time's IPounds 11m.
Earnings worked through at 0.55p (losses 0.14p) and the interim dividend is

FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Aminex in Russian oil venture
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Aminex, the oil exploration group which is partly owned by Russian
shareholders, is in advanced talks on setting up a joint venture in the
former Soviet Union with an oil production company.
The group, which also announced more than doubled pre-tax losses of IPounds
124,860 (Pounds 119,000), against IPounds 60,415, for the six months to the
end of June, said it expected the deal to be completed by the end of the
year.
Mr Brian Hall, chairman, said Aminex intended to offset any political risk
by eventually rebuilding the group's US production. The company sold its
operating leases in Texas to help reduce debt and overheads. The disposals
were partly behind the decline in gross revenues from Pounds 198,607 to
Pounds 84,904 in the first half.
The pre-tax losses were exacerbated by the Pounds 73,868 exceptional cost of
a failed bid for fellow Irish oil group, Tuskar Resources, earlier this
year. Losses per share were steady at 0.01p. The shares closed 1 1/2 p down
at 54 1/2 p.

FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Frank Gates rises to Pounds 1.15m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANK G Gates, the Ford distributor, reported profits of Pounds 1.15m before
tax for the six months to June 30, but hit out at the motor manufacturer for
adversely affecting margins on sales of new cars.
The outcome, a sharp improvement on the depressed comparable figure of
Pounds 216,000, came on turnover ahead 34 per cent to Pounds 34.6m (Pounds
25.8m). The east London-based group achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds
886,000 for the full 1992 year.
Earnings per share were 3.6p, against 0.68p at the same stage of last year
and 3.65p for the full year.
Profits on new cars were more than doubled, but Mr Edward Gates, chairman,
sounded a cautious note stating: 'With hindsight, the way in which the
reduction in new car discount was introduced by Ford has had a disastrous
effect on new car margins, the extent of which may not be evident to some
for a few more months.'
In spite of increased volumes, new car departmental profits by the end of
August had fallen to a level similar to August 1992. 'In my opinion the
present difference in profits between new and used cars is exceptionally
distorted,' Mr Gates said.

FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Bouncy Bruce belches forth in Grosvenor
expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID BRUCE, the brewer with a mischievous sense of humour who founded
the unusually named Firkin pubs chain, is aiming to repeat his original
success for the recently floated Grosvenor Inns as head of its new
subsidiary, Belcher Pubs.
Grosvenor announced yesterday that Mr Bruce would join the board as an
executive director under a three year consultancy agreement.
Mr Bruce will be responsible for setting up a pub franchise operation to
complement Grosvenor's Slug &amp; Lettuce and High Street and City Taverns
businesses.
Mr Tim Thwaites, Grosvenor's chairman, said the group planned to buy
freeholds in the south-east which could be franchised.
The shake-up in the brewing industry presented 'real opportunities' for
acquiring reasonably priced freeholds, Mr Thwaites said. In many cases,
prices had halved in the last three years.
Grosvenor announced the acquisition of two pubs to kick off the division.
As part of the deal, Mr Bruce will sell The Water Rat, his freehold pub in
Newbury, to Grosvenor for shares worth Pounds 500,000 at 123p. Mr Bruce will
be Grosvenor's third largest shareholder, with a 5 per cent stake. Grosvenor
has also purchased the Pavilion freehold at Waterloo, south London, for
Pounds 300,000 cash.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Essex Furniture, the USM-traded furniture manufacturer and retailer,
yesterday reported growth of 50 per cent in sales and profits before tax for
the 12 months to June 30.
The pre-tax line rose from Pounds 727,000 to a record Pounds 1.09m, achieved
on turnover on continuing operations ahead to Pounds 10.75m (Pounds 7.16m).
Mr Michael Franks, chairman, said the growth was achieved 'against a
background of spasmodic upturns in the UK economy which is now hopefully
leading to an end of the recession.'
A proposed final dividend of 2p brings the total for the year to 3.5p
(2.75p), payable from earnings of 6.23p (5.03p) per share.

FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Arjo predicts SKr141m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARJO, the international healthcare group based in Sweden which is coming to
the market early next month, has forecast pre-tax losses of SKr140.9m
(Pounds 11.5m) for the year to September 30 1993 in its pathfinder
prospectus.
The group is seeking a listing on both the London and Stockholm Stock
Exchanges.
The loss was struck after interest and dividend costs of SKr127.1m and
foreign exchange losses of SKr189m. At the operating level profits are
estimated at SKr175.2m on turnover of SKr1.1bn, compared with operating
profits of SKr120.6m on turnover of SKr809.1m in the previous year, when
pre-tax profit were SKr15.3m.
The group estimated pre-tax profits this time would have been SKr166.9m
without the interest and foreign exchange costs related to its net
borrowings of SKr1.43bn.
The offering is intended to clear the debt, incurred in the 1990 management
buy-out from Malmros International, by raising between SKr1.5bn and
SKr1.7bn.
The price is expected to be in the range of SKr105 and SKr115 per share,
implying an initial market capitalisation of SKr2.2bn to SKr2.4bn.
Mr Hans Lindstrom, chief executive, said the offering would leave the group
with a strong balance sheet and cashflow, enabling it to expand and invest
in new products. The group claims to be a leader in lifting systems for
elderly and disabled patients.

FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Lloyd's corporate trust scaled down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REA BROTHERS, the small merchant bank, and UBS, a subsidiary of Union Bank
of Switzerland, yesterday published an investment memorandum for Finsbury
Underwriting Investment Trust, one of the first corporate members to be
formed at the Lloyd's insurance market.
The trust aims to raise Pounds 30m, before expenses, by way of a placing and
intermediaries offer. Rea Brothers and UBS originally aimed to raise Pounds
35m when they announced their plans in August, but have subsequently scaled
down the size of their offer to 'ensure a high degree of selectivity in
placing FUIT's capacity,' according to a statement released yesterday.
The group's underwriting will be managed by Wren Underwriting Agencies.
FUIT's investment portfolio, comprising predominantly UK equities and
interest bearing securities, will be managed by Finsbury Asset Management.
The fund is one of a number planned by merchant banks, securities houses and
Lloyd's agencies.
Overall, Lloyd's hopes it could attract as much as Pounds 1bn in fresh
capital from its first ever corporate investors. The market's council
announced rules for new corporate investors last month.
Final approval, however, is dependent on a vote by the market's Names, the
individuals whose assets support the market, at an extraordinary meeting on
October 20.

FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Drambuie abandons strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRAMBUIE, the liqueur company, yesterday terminated a widely-publicised
strategy of diversification by selling Caithness Glass, an ornamental
glassmaker.
Caithness has been bought by its management and employees, with backing from
Bank of Scotland and from Highlands and Islands Enterprise. Negotiations on
the sale began in February. The price was not disclosed.
Drambuie, a secretive company controlled by the McKinnon family, bought
Caithness for Pounds 3.38m in 1991 and said that it would be seeking further
acquisitions outside the drinks business.
However, Drambuie lost Pounds 5.6m in 1991 on sales of Pounds 38.8m and in
1992 Mr Peter Shakeshaft, the finance and development director who was
responsible for buying Caithness left the company.
Caithness itself was badly hit by recession and last year closed one of its
three factories with the loss of 120 jobs. It now employs 240 people.
Last year Mr David Evans became Drambuie's first non-family chairman,
replacing Mrs Mary McKinnon. Shortly afterwards Mr Peter Darbyshire, a
drinks industry executive, became managing director replacing Mr Malcolm
McKinnon and Mr Duncan McKinnon, joint managing directors.
Although Drambuie lost Pounds 6.7m in 1992 it expects to make a profit of
Pounds 2m in 1993. The workforce has been cut from 175 to 125.
In March, Drambuie sold off Cockburn's of Leith, its wine merchant business.
The only company it owns outside the liqueur business is Glenvarigill, a
Scottish motor dealer.

FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Highland profits up but demand is down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHLAND DISTILLERIES, which reported yesterday an increase in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 38.8m from Pounds 28.7m for the year to August, said that
its malt whisky distilleries were working at only 40 per cent capacity.
Against the background of falling demand, the industry could take two to
three years to eliminate its surplus stocks, estimated Mr John Goodwin,
chairman.
Blenders were already adjusting stocks to meet lower estimates of future
sales, causing a 25 per cent drop in Highland's new whisky sales in the
latest year. This offset gains on sales of its best-selling brand, Famous
Grouse, which has been increasing market share abroad, following the
distribution arrangement with Remy-Cointreau.
Thanks to the continuing success of Famous Grouse, Highland's increase in
profits, however, was in marked contrast to lower profits at other
distillers, ranging from big producers such as Guinness with premium brands
to smaller producers such as Invergordon and Burn Stewart Distillers.
COMMENT
Highland continues to outperform the Scotch whisky industry. Its partnership
with Remy-Cointreau has generated consistent export growth for the past
three years and shows every sign of continuing to do so. There is a lot of
untapped potential left in Famous Grouse; only 40 per cent of its sales are
overseas compared with overall industry exports of 87 per cent. In the UK,
the brand has held market share and maintained its premium price despite
increased competition from commodity brands. That augurs well for its
ability to withstand any further bout of price-cutting this Christmas.
Analysts expect only a slight reduction in the rate of growth, forecasting
pre-tax profits for this year of Pounds 41m. On a prospective p/e of 15.6,
the shares stand at a 2 point premium to the sector.

FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Ladbroke brushes off allegations over debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LADBROKE GROUP yesterday dismissed as 'misleading and misconceived' a
weekend press article querying how much of its Pounds 1.34bn debt was
secured against assets.
The article in the Mail on Sunday alleged that Pounds 90m of Ladbroke's debt
had been secured on specific assets.
The newspaper said ABN Amro, the Dutch bank, had taken a charge on a
Ladbroke guilder deposit worth about Pounds 90m.
The company said last week that only Pounds 21m of its debt was secured.
An injunction by Ladbroke against the Mail on Sunday was lifted last week
after the newspaper agreed not to make allegations about Ladbroke's debt
without providing written notice.
The company said yesterday: 'The charge in favour of ABN Amro Bank is a
short term banking arrangement on a back-to-back basis.
'It was entered into as part of the company's international tax planning
arrangements, whereby a temporary loan was granted in Dutch guilders at one
branch of the bank and matched on a back-to-back basis by a company deposit
in guilders at another branch, the latter being available for off-set.
'Aside from this one arrangement, the company's position in relation to
unsecured debt has not changed.'
Ladbroke said yesterday that the arrangement was a common one, which
provided benefits to both the bank and the company. The bank had a deposit
to match the loan it had made.
The company could earn interest on the deposit which could be set against
losses for taxation purposes - reducing the tax paid on interest earned.
The group also denied that Mr Cyril Stein's recent announcement that he
would retire as chairman, followed pressure from institutional investors.

MR ROBERT Montague, founder and executive chairman of Tiphook, the container

Whether Mr Montague will continue with the group is up to the group's
bankers and shareholders. Last week Tiphook's shares fell by 49 per cent
after the lossmaking group issued its third profits warning this year and
said it would breach lending covenants.
Shareholders will vote at an extraordinary meeting on October 25 on a
proposal to allow the group's gearing limit to be increased from 500 to 600
per cent. Tiphook currently has debts of Pounds 1bn and gearing approaching
500 per cent.
Tiphook shares rose by 15p to 138p yesterday after it published its first
monthly fleet utilisation figures.
Average utilisation for September for its operating container fleet was
82.25 per cent, up from 81.99 per cent in August but down from 85.94 per
cent in the same month last year.
The statement showed that at September 30 the operating container fleet
totalled 497,020 TEUs (20-foot equivalent units), down 566 from the previous
month.
Tiphook's European truck trailer fleet stood at 24,825, an increase of 334
over August. Average utilisation for the month was 73.22 per cent, up from
69.36 per cent in August, 1993.
Analysts said the figures were in line with expectations, but were welcome
because they contained no unpleasant surprises. The figures gave no
indication of the rental rates being achieved in a period when the market is
known to be soft.

FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Growing enthusiasm for electronic imagery -
Alan Cane looks at Virtuality's debut and the market for virtual reality
technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS have already had the chance of a punt on 'virtual reality', the
esoteric technology which dresses users in visors and wired gloves to
persuade them they are part of an alternative electronic world.
Division, based in Bristol, came to the market at 40p earlier in the year,
the first VR company to go public anywhere in the world. The shares shot up
to 100p and have since been trading comfortably at about 80p. It raised
Pounds 5m, enough to support its research and development for three years.
Today, W Industries, under its new name of Virtuality, makes its market
debut by way of a placing, hoping to raise some Pounds 10m.
International Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer,
and Motorola, a leading semiconductor manufacturer and communications
specialist, have already taken stakes valued at about Pounds 1m apiece.
Institutions are showing enthusiasm for Virtuality's convincing electronic
imagery suggesting the placing will be a success.
The question remains whether investors understand the significance of what
they are putting their money into or whether they are simply backing a
fashionable but incomprehensible technology.
Mr Charles Grimsdale, chief executive of Division, says his company's
products excite 'tremendous interest but limited understanding'. He believes
the market will be worth Pounds 1bn by the end of the decade, split between
a comparatively small number of companies.
At one level, VR represents immense possibilities for entertainment - 'real'
experiences impossible to reproduce safely or economically by other means.
At another it is the next stage in the development of the way humans
interact with computers; the move from the two dimensional desktop
represented by, say, Apple's Macintosh or Microsoft's Windows, to a three
dimensional workspace. Users become immersed in this workspace; they can
interact with objects in the electronic environment. In one striking
example, developed by Division for Matsushita of Japan, two individuals can
simultaneously wander through a virtual kitchen. They can work together to
move the cooker, the refrigerator or the extractor hood.
Although virtual reality is a new technology, it already can be divided into
a number of different market sectors.
First, there is entertainment - the area which Virtuality has chosen to make
its own. Founded by Mr Jonathan Waldern in 1988, the company had a turnover
of Pounds 5.24m at the end of 1992. Among its achievements is a contract
with Sega Enterprises of Japan, the world leader in sophisticated arcade
games.
Mr Waldern sees Virtuality developing in three directions. First, complete
systems, software and hardware integrated together to create arcade games.
Second, specialised VR software written to customer's specifications. Third,
packaging and licensing the company's skills to third parties.
Division, for example, is already licensing its technology to Virtual
Reality Games of Leeds, a subsidiary of Global Entertainments, to develop
second generation arcade games.
Virtuality will use some of the money it is raising to complete its work on
'second generation' VR products for the latest range of low-cost personal
computers. It raises the possibility of VR machines for the home in the near
future.
Second, computer aided design and manufacturing. The Calibre Institute,
attached to the University of Eindhoven, developed a system for Espeq, a
group of 300 companies in the building trade. It created electronic images
of three houses complete with interiors which house purchasers could walk
through, inspecting the various rooms. According to Espeq, during the two
days the VR system was in use, more houses were sold than in any previous
two-day period.
Division has just developed a Pounds 4,000 tool called dVISE which enables
designers who have created conventional two dimensional designs to turn them
into three dimensional virtual models, giving them the opportunity to view
their work as if it had been manufactured. Mr Grimsdale believes that this
kind of software can be used to ease customers into VR.
Third, simulation and training. Mr Grimsdale says: 'This has exciting cost
implications. Suddenly we can create effective simulations in which the user
gets a full 360 degree view for perhaps one tenth of the current cost'.
Conventional aircraft simulators cost several million pounds and utilise
five large mirrors and a similar number of computers. This can be replaced
by two computers and a headset with display screens in front of the eyes.
Whole battlefield training systems may be only eight years away.
Finally, scientific simulation. Glaxo, for example, uses VR for molecular
modelling, while Matsushita is using a system for air flow simulations.
Shell is experimenting with seismic models.
Entertainment is some 30 per cent of the market today but that is likely to
fall as companies make greater use of VR in computer-aided design and
simulation.
The overall market is currently growing at 80 per cent to 100 per cent a
year from, admittedly, a very small base. The technology continues to be a
primary driver, however: 'What really excites me is the staggering rate at
which graphics technology is evolving', Mr Grimsdale says.

FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Azlan plans stock listing listing this year
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Azlan Group, a distributor to the network computer market, is planning to
seek a listing before the end of the year.
Azlan, which also provides complementary technical services including
support and training, employs 180 people and conducts its activities
primarily from premises in Wokingham and York. It this year commenced
operations in Germany and Denmark.
The company, founded in 1984, was acquired by Logitek in 1989. Two years
later, Mr David Randall, who had been managing director since 1986, led a
Pounds 6.5m management buy-out, supported by a group of institutional
investors led by CINVen.
Sales have grown by a compound 47 per cent a year over the last five years
and in the year to March 31 1993 reached Pounds 41m, with pre-tax profits of
Pounds 3m.

FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Marlowe to acquire Bennett &amp; Fountain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARLOWE HOLDINGS, the electrical distributor, is to buy Bennett &amp; Fountain
in a recommended cash offer valuing its troubled rival at Pounds 2.1m.
Marlowe is offering 2p in cash for each B&amp;F share. It is also negotiating to
buy B&amp;F's Pounds 18m of bank debts at a discount and virtually all the
group's preference shares.
B&amp;F's thinly traded shares briefly touched a low of 1 3/4 p last year. They
stood at 4p last Friday before the offer was made but fell to 2 1/2 p on the
announcement, moving up  1/4 p yesterday.
Marlowe has received irrevocable acceptances from Voltex Holdings, B&amp;F's
South African parent, which holds about 60 per cent of the equity.
B&amp;F, which has yet to publish preliminary results for its year to June 30,
was last year in dispute with its former chairman.
The company's financial advisers, Samuel Montagu, also resigned about a year
ago. Kleinwort Benson is now advising the com-pany.
B&amp;F incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 2.3m profit) on sales of
Pounds 61.4m (Pounds 74.1m) in the year to end-June 1992.
The company's net assets were then Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 16.5m).
The losses came against 'difficult trading conditions and a very high level
of bank indebtedness, repayable on demand'.
The company said: 'In the absence of alternative proposals to provide
additional funds to B&amp;F, the outlook for B&amp;F is very uncertain.'

FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: UB ends unhappy chapter in Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED BISCUITS, Britain's largest biscuits and snacks manufacturer,
yesterday closed a long and unhappy chapter in its European expansion
strategy by selling Ortiz, its Spanish toasted bread business, to the
company's management.
Acquired by UB in 1973 in an early fit of Euro-enthusiasm, Ortiz ran into
problems soon after being taken over. Despite efforts to turn the business
round, some analysts estimate that it incurred more losses than profits
since then. Last year it lost Pounds 1.3m on sales of Pounds 30m.
By the early 1990s, UB's management openly admitted that it had given up any
hope of engineering a recovery, answering all inquiries about the business's
performance with the standard phrase: 'Ortiz continues to disappoint.'
UB had hoped to dismantle Ortiz by buying the biscuits operations of Royal
Brands, a Spanish state-owned company, and merging the two businesses.
However, the plan was thwarted when Royal Brands was sold to RJR Nabisco
earlier this year.
Concluding that Spanish social legislation would make the cost of closing
Ortiz prohibitive, UB unsuccessfully sought a buyer for the business before
deciding to sell it to management for 'a nominal sum.'
UB said the deal would result in an exceptional loss of about Pounds 11.5m
in this year's accounts, but would enhance group earnings.

FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Cooper Clarke improves
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COOPER CLARKE Group, the builders' merchant, yesterday reported some
improvement in interim pre-tax profits but warned that recovery in the
construction sector was likely to be some time away.
Mr Peter Clarke, chairman, said that while turnover had increased, there had
been continued pressure on margins and as a result profitability continued
to suffer.
In the first half of 1993, pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 125,000 to
Pounds 204,000, on turnover of Pounds 15m (Pounds 11.3m). Earnings per share
came to 3.6p (2.2p).
Mr Clarke said that at present there was no likelihood of any improvement in
the construction sector and a number of the company's customers faced the
prospect of falling order books. 'There is little doubt that while 1993 may
see some improvement in the UK economy, any follow on to the construction
sector is likely to be some time off.'

FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Back in the bright lights for Lucas -
Andrew Bolger describes the strategy behind doubled profits of Pounds 50m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUCAS Industries executives reported their results from a specially designed
platform, complete with bright lights and pictures of the components which
the engineering group supplies to the world's automotive and aerospace
industries.
The glossy presentation matched a new confidence on part of the
Birmingham-based company, which said cutting costs had helped it to double
annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 50.3m.
Lucas's share price has also doubled since the dark days of last autumn,
when a recession-induced collapse in profits made it the City's favourite
target for a hostile takeover.
However, Pounds 50.3m is still a miserable rate of return on sales of Pounds
2.56bn, and Lucas once again had to raid its reserves to maintain the
dividend payment. The same executives were yesterday also anxious not to
appear over-optimistic, given the tough state of the continental European
markets which account for 38 per cent of sales.
Sir Anthony Gill, Lucas's chairman and chief executive, clearly had not
envisaged a 16 per cent drop in the European automotive market when he said
last year that he aimed to cover this year's dividend payment from earnings.
Yesterday, he said he now hoped to get back to that happy state in the
current year - but it was again phrased as a 'chairman's aim', rather than a
firm commitment.
Mr John Grant, finance director, said: 'We are bumping along the bottom of
the cycle and probably will continue to bump along for a little while
longer.'
Overall sales rose by 2 per cent, net of currency movements and divestments,
in spite of sharp declines in world aerospace and European automotive
markets. Lucas said this reflected its strong positions in the more
resilient sectors of both industries. It claimed increased market share in
each of its core businesses - aerospace engine control and flight control
systems, and automotive braking and diesel systems.
Automotive, which accounted for 63 per cent of group sales, improved
operating profits from Pounds 42.2m to Pounds 45.1m, with improvements in
costs more than compensating for the group's limited ability to pass on
price rises to customers. Launch costs in the diesel and electrical systems
businesses dampened the pace of profit recovery.
Aerospace sales, which comprise 25 per cent of the group total, were down 7
per cent at constant exchange rates. Cost-cutting helped operating profits
double to Pounds 31m. Lucas said it had been less affected than the industry
generally by softer defence markets and production cuts by leading airframe
makers - mainly because of its strong presence on newer aircraft and engine
families.
Mr Grant said the restructuring programme unveiled last year was about '80
per cent complete', although many of the improvements in efficiency would
continue indefinitely. Employee numbers have been reduced by 20 per cent
since July 1990, and will continue to fall at an annual rate of 2-3 per
cent.
The divestment programme realised Pounds 56m in the year to July, and Pounds
75m to date. The group said further disposals would be made of businesses
which did not contribute significantly to its core strengths.
Mr Grant, who joined Lucas last year from Ford, said capital spending had
been cut by Pounds 7m to Pounds 116m and improved financial discipline had
cut working capital by Pounds 22m.
Sir Anthony said that when the group's main markets recovered, it should be
able to get back towards profit margins similar to those achieved before the
recession - a return on sales of up to 10 per cent. Lucas was aiming for
such a recovery in margins within three years - which was ambitious, but
achievable.
Whatever Lucas's long-term future, it will involve both a new chairman and
chief executive. As expected, the company would not comment on the post of
chief executive, except to say it still hoped to make a formal announcement
at or before the group's annual meeting in November.
Sir Anthony, who last year agreed to stay on until the management succession
was sorted out, ended his review of the trading outlook on a note of
carefully qualified optimism. 'Further reductions in costs and working
capital will provide a platform for the company to continue to enhance value
for shareholders, despite uncertainties over the pace of economic recovery.
Lucas is strong, getting stronger and will be in a powerful position to
benefit from a revival in the global economy when it comes.'

FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Tay Homes upbeat despite fall to Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAY HOMES, the Leeds-based housebuilder, underscored its upbeat trading
statement by announcing plans for another two operating areas despite
reporting a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.85m to Pounds 3.09m for
the year to June 30.
'It is now accepted by almost all commentators that the housebuilding
industry is slowly emerging from its worst period in recent history,' said
Mr Trevor Spencer, chairman.
He added that the company expected 'considerable improvements' in the north
of England and Scotland.
The group had decided to open new operating areas in north-west Birmingham
and north Bristol.
A maintained final dividend of 4.65p is proposed, giving a same-again total
of 5.85p, payable from earnings of 9.5p (13.6p) per share.
Profits were depressed by the adoption of more conservative accounting
policies recommended by the company's auditors. They relate to the sale of
properties to business expansion schemes, to which the company has given
guarantees on future returns, and to the sale and leaseback of an office
building. Without the policy changes pre-tax profits would have been Pounds
3.9m (Pounds 6.1m).
Turnover fell to Pounds 69.7m (Pounds 72.4m), although the company increased
unit sales to 1,107 (1,030). 'We sold a record number of houses last year
which was greatly helped by the surge in demand during the early months of
1993.
'This followed the worst autumn sales period in the company's history, an
experience shared with many housebuilders, which impacted on both selling
prices and margins,' Mr Spencer said.
The company now has a bank of 4,200 plots (4,000) excluding 750 plots on two
sites in Scotland.
Interest charges fell to Pounds 2.17m (Pounds 3.11m). Gearing was cut to 36
per cent (48 per cent) on borrowings of Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 13.5m) although
these had been higher during the year.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Cheap drugs attract the giants: Growth in generics is being
driven by the expiry of patents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hoechst's Dollars 550m (Pounds 364m) acquisition last week of a majority
stake in Copley Pharmaceutical, a US generic drug manufacturer, surprised
the drugs industry only by its price. The deal is one of the largest in the
Dollars 5.5bn US generics drug sector which manufactures cheap medicines
whose patents have expired.
The Dollars 550m price tag values Copley at 87 times net profits of Dollars
12.3m last year, a high multiple by any standards. However, Mr Jurgen
Dormann, Hoechst's finance director, said the price was appropriate in view
of Copley's profitability - it has a net return on sales of at least 24 per
cent.
Hoechst's strategy of entering the US generic non-patented prescription
medicine business was, however, predictable. It is the latest in a series of
moves by pharmaceuticals groups to enter this fast-growing sector. Over the
past two years, the 1980s trend for companies to leave the low-margin
high-volume generics industry has been reversed.
The generics market is growing rapidly as increasingly important drugs lose
their patents, and cost-conscious healthcare providers become more
interested in cheap generic medicines. For the research-based
pharmaceuticals groups, marketing a generic version of their drugs can
extend its earnings stream.
Earlier this month Marion Merrell Dow acquired Rugby-Darby's generic
operations, the largest generic business in the US with sales of about
Dollars 280m. Other drugs groups which have recently joined the generics
industry include Merck, the world's largest drugs group, and Bristol-Myers,
the third largest.
Such companies have been tempted by the rapid expansion of the US generics
sector, which Hoechst expects to grow at 14 per cent a year for the rest of
the decade. Kline &amp; Co, the New York-based industry analysts, estimate that
the sector could double its size to Dollars 10bn a year between 1992 and
1996.
This compares favourably with the entire US prescription drugs market which
grew only 3 per cent in the first six months of this year, according to IMS
International, the market research group. The slowdown is expected to worsen
in the short-term.
The generics market is being driven by important patents expiring. Last year
seven drugs, with combined annual sales of about Dollars 2.5bn, came off
patent in the US. This year, the patents of 11 medicines with yearly sales
of Dollars 3bn expired. The most significant include Syntex's
anti-inflammatory Naprosyn, next month; Seldane, Marion Merrell Dow's
anti-histamine, in April; and SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet, in May.
The biggest will be Bristol-Myers Squibb's heart drug Capoten, which has
sales of about Dollars 1.6bn and becomes vulnerable to generic competition
in 1995.
The pharmaceuticals groups want to manufacture generic versions so they can
extend their products' earnings. Marion Merrell Dow produces a generic
version of its heart drug Cardizem, while Warner-Lambert makes a generic of
its cholesterol-lowering product Lopid. The explosion in generics sales is
also being encouraged by changes in the market, where bulk purchasers of
health are increasingly prescribing cheap generics rather than more pricy
patented medicines. In 1991, 40 per cent of all prescriptions in the US were
generic. The figure is expected to reach 66 per cent by 1995, according to
Kline &amp; Co. Hoechst believes the Clinton healthcare reforms willboost
demand.
The foremost problem facing drugs groups wanting to exploit the US generics
market is how to enter it. The options include acquisition, setting up from
scratch and partnerships.
Some groups have set up their own companies. These include Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer, the Franco-American group, Eli Lilly and Bristol-Myers Squibb, of the
US, and the UK's Zeneca. Merck plans to introduce off-patent versions of 10
products through its West Point Pharma subsidiary.
Others have formed partnerships. Upjohn, for example, has formed an alliance
with Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, a subsidiary of American Home Products, to
market a generic form of Upjohn's hormone replacement therapy. Upjohn has
also signed an agreement with Geneva Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Ciba
of Switzerland, to market Xanax, an anti-anxiety treatment, and Halcion, the
sleeping pill, whose patents expired last month.
Companies such as Pfizer and SmithKline Beecham, which quit the sector, may
now be reviewing their strategy. A few companies, such as Ciba, never left
it.
Research-based pharmaceuticals groups must be quick to market their
products. Generics companies have proved increasingly aggressive in their
ability to market drugs from the day of their patent expiry. As more generic
versions become available so prices fall. Prices for generics of Zeneca's
best-selling product Tenormin fell 13 per cent on the first day of the
patent expiry, 25 per cent within two months, and by 80 per cent once there
were six competitors.
Given the sector's rapid growth, the rush into generics looks set to
continue. Shares in small groups soared following the Hoechst announcement.
Myland's stock rose Dollars 1 5/8 to close at Dollars 30 1/2 while
Pharmaceutical Resources was up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 14 1/8 . Investors
clearly believe these are potential acquisition targets for the
pharmaceuticals giants wanting to follow Hoechst's example.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Storehouse loses finance director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GRAHAM RIDER has resigned as finance director of Storehouse, the retail
group, with immediate effect. His is the latest in a series of board changes
at the company, including four finance directors since 1989 and three chief
executives since 1988.
The shares slipped 4p to 207p yesterday, although the company stressed Mr
Rider's departure did not reflect any worsening of trading performance, nor
a clash of personalities or disagreement with Mr Keith Edelman, the latest
chief executive, who joined in August.
The timing of his departure is sudden, with Storehouse due to publish
interim results on November 18. Storehouse said yesterday nothing had
changed since it said in mid-September that sales at its BhS and Mothercare
chains were up.
Mr Rider is expected to receive some compensation, although not fully
reflecting his two-year contract and annual salary of around Pounds 150,000.
Compensation payments have become a feature of Storehouse's annual report.
The latest said six directors had left during the year, including Mr David
Dworkin, the chief executive who departed in March. He had taken on the role
last July when Mr Michael Julien, chief executive since 1988, left due to
ill-health. Five directors shared compensation of Pounds 1.16m, while Mr
Dworkin took a Pounds 2.71m profit-related bonus which, with his salary,
gave him Pounds 3.29m in the year.
Storehouse's run of finance directors began in November 1989 when Mr James
Power took early retirement. He was succeeded by Mr Bob Mackenzie, who left
suddenly in October 1990, leaving a gap until Mr David Simons joined in
February 1991. Mr Rider, who is 40, joined the group in February 1992 as
finance director of BhS. He was propelled into the group finance director's
role in December 1992 when Mr Simons left to join Isosceles, the Gateway
food retailer.
An outside observer said yesterday that rapid promotion had come too soon
for him.
Storehouse said the successor would probably come from outside the company.
The observer added: 'Keith Edelman probably has someone lined up already,
perhaps from Carlton Communications or Ladbroke.' Mr Edelman previously
worked at those two companies.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Exports of Famous Grouse provide cheer for Highland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHLAND Distilleries, the independent Scotch whisky group, increased
pre-tax profits from Pounds 28.7m to Pounds 38.8m last year thanks to
increased exports of Famous Grouse and a change in the accounting treatment
of its 35.4 per cent stake in the blender Robertson &amp; Baxter.
Equity accounting for Robertson added Pounds 7.4m to profits. Although
Famous Grouse profits rose Pounds 3.6m, this was partially offset by a fall
in contribution from other whiskies.
Famous Grouse, which contributes 55 per cent of group profits, increased
sales in overseas markets by 14 per cent, against an overall increase for
the industry of 1 per cent.
The results showed the benefits of Remy-Cointreau's distribution of Famous
Grouse, with notable market share gains registered in Sweden, Greece, the
Netherlands, Thailand and Venezuela.
In the last three years, Famous Grouse exports have risen from 550,000 to
850,000 cases and 40 per cent of sales are now overseas. In the UK, sales
slipped 3 per cent in line with the market, but the brand maintained its
premium price and 14 per cent market share.
Profits from the sale of new and mature malt whiskies declined as blenders
adjusted stock.
Group operating profits in the year to August 31 were 7 per cent ahead at
Pounds 23.5m, on turnover marginally up at Pounds 171.1m.
The group repaid, at a cost of Pounds 4.9m, a FFr300m (Pounds 35m) loan
raised in 1990 to help finance its investment in Orpar, the Remy holding
company. The repayment reduced gearing from 6 per cent to 1 per cent.
Earnings per share, excluding Robertson, rose to 16.2p (15.1p). A final
dividend of 5p makes a total of 6.6p (from 6p).

FT  12 OCT 93 / Lucas doubles profits after cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Lucas Industries rose by 12p to 167p yesterday after the
automotive and aerospace components group said cost-cutting had enabled it
to double pre-tax profits.
The Birmingham-based group again dipped into reserves to maintain its
dividend and is offering an enhanced scrip alternative.
Lucas announced an extensive restructuring programme last year after
recession caused its profits to slump. The group has recently cut thousands
of jobs and sold several businesses.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 22.5m to Pounds 50.3m in the year to July
31. Sales increased by 7 per cent to Pounds 2.6bn, mainly reflecting
exchange rate movements and increased market share.
Sir Anthony Gill, chairman and chief executive, said the company had not
been immune to recession in the mainland European car markets and in world
aircraft production. But it had nevertheless managed to increase sales 'by
virtue of our strong presence in the more resilient sectors of these
industries, and by success in developing new technologies and winning new
contracts'.
Mr John Grant, finance director, said the group had achieved Pounds 60m of
cost reductions. Employee numbers fell by 4,860 to 45,709 during the year
and were down by 20 per cent since July 1990.
Sir Anthony said the rationalisation programme was on track and cost
reductions were gathering momentum throughout the group. 'Further
improvements in profitability and cash generation will be achieved as plans
already in place come fully to fruition and additional actions are
implemented.'
As expected, Lucas declined to confirm that it had offered the post of chief
executive to Mr George Simpson, deputy chief executive of British Aerospace
and chairman of Rover Group, its vehicles subsidiary. Sir Anthony said
merely that good progress had been made on the selection, and the board
expected to make a formal announcement on or before the annual meeting in
November.
Disposals of businesses brought in Pounds 7.7m of profits and cash proceeds
of Pounds 56m. Further divestments since the year-end realised gains of
Pounds 4.7m and cash proceeds of Pounds 19m.
Gearing was virtually unchanged at 45 per cent, with net borrowings of
Pounds 338m. Interest costs rose from Pounds 37.4m to Pounds 43.2m. Net
research and development expenditure fell from Pounds 98.3m to Pounds 90.8m.
Earnings per share rose from 0.8p to 4.3p.
An unchanged final of 4.9p maintains the total dividend at 7p. There is an
enhanced scrip worth 7.35p per share. BZW will offer a cash alternative of
at least 7.203p.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Bell Atlantic buys into Mexican cellular market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELL Atlantic has agreed to pay Dollars 1.04bn (Pounds 680m) for a 42 per
cent stake in Iusacell, Mexico's second largest cellular telephone company,
and holder of a potentially lucrative concession to own a national wireless
telephone network.
The purchase is the largest foreign stake taken in a Latin American cellular
company and may herald further acquisitions by Bell Atlantic in the region.
Bell Atlantic and Iusacell plan to invest in a national wireless telephone
network. While such a service will initially be limited to local calls,
Iusacell and Bell Atlantic are expected to seek a licence to offer a
long-distance service in August 1996, when Telefonos de Mexico's
long-distance monopoly comes up for review.
Iusacell is controlled by Mexican industrialist Mr Carlos Peralta, who will
continue to run the company, but with operational and technical help from
Bell Atlantic. Under Mexican law, foreign concerns can own up to 49 per cent
of a cellular telephone company.
Bell Atlantic will immediately acquire 23 per cent of Iusacell, and another
19 per cent later. Iusacell will make a public offering of a further 10 per
cent of its capital and seek a listing on various stock markets.
The purchase will dilute Bell Atlantic's earnings by 18 to 20 cents a share
next year, and the company does not expect to break even from the deal for
five years.
Iusacell owns a cellular concession in Mexico City, and controls other
concessions in Guadalajara, the centre and south-east of Mexico. It has
135,00 subscribers, making it second to Telcel, the national cellular
company owned by Telmex. Iusacell's concessions cover about 60m people, 72
per cent of the Mexican population.
The transaction values Iusacell at Dollars 40 to Dollars 44 per person
covered by its concessions, about one sixth of the multiple seen in the US.
However, cellular penetration in Mexico is far lower.
'On a per-population basis Bell Atlantic is over-paying,' says Mr Bill
Deatherage, a telecommunications analyst at SG Warburg Securities. 'But they
are placing a significant value on the nationwide wireless licence.'
The cellular market in Mexico has boomed since it was opened in 1989. While
customers can wait months, even years, to acquire a telephone line from
Telmex, it takes just an hour or so to buy a cellular phone.

FT  12 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On the surface, a 3 per cent underlying growth in output prices in the year
to September must come as bad news for those who believe UK inflation is
licked. The rate. which excludes food, drink, tobacco and petroleum, is
creeping up from levels much closer to 2 per cent six months ago. But there
is some consolation in the reason for the acceleration of the annual rate.
The abnormally low rises of last summer and autumn are starting to drop out
of the index. On a monthly basis there is hardly any acceleration at all:
the rate has fluctuated around 0.3 per cent for some time. On top of that
input prices are falling again, while weak food price inflation is holding
down the overall headline rate.
The good news is thus that these figures do not show inflation about to take
off again. It seems unlikely that the authorities will face a test of their
determination to keep underlying retail price inflation below 4 per cent.
The bad news is that the fall in inflation should apparently have come to a
halt at such a high level despite the severity of the recession. Adjusted
for mortgages, retail prices are growing at around 3 per cent, well inside
the upper half of the official target range. The Bank of England may not
yield unprotesting to demands for lower rates around Budget time unless it
also sees firm evidence of fiscal responsibility.

FT  12 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Italian privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Italy's privatisation programme has taken two steps forward and one step
back. The restructuring plan for Ferruzzi-Montedison emerging in Milan
appears to be winning support from lenders. If a speedy settlement can be
reached, the privatisation of Banca Commerciale and Credito Italiano - both
of which have large exposures to the crumbling Ferruzzi empire - might be
achieved by the year-end as planned. However, the confusion over the
resignation - later withdrawn - of Mr Paolo Savona, the industry minister,
points to deep divisions in government over privatisation.
It is hard to believe that the rift arose from a technical argument about
the most efficient method of selling state assets. Privatisation by public
offer would result in more diffuse ownership than sales dominated by groups
of large investors of the type favoured by Mr Savona. Given the close links
between Italian industry and state, how the argument is resolved will
determine the degree of political influence over privatised companies.
A Ferruzzi solution which met the aspirations of international investors and
bankers would be encouraging. Some important points of principle appear to
have been won. The group's profitable operating subsidiaries will continue
servicing bank debt, which will please the foreign banks that did not lend
at holding company level. The planned disposal of investments ranging from
media to cement looks like a partial victory over family interests. If that
signals a commitment to solutions which avoid favouring narrow
self-interest, privatisation can only benefit.

FT  12 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Lucas Industries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
To say that Lucas had to dip into reserves to pay this year's dividend is
slightly misleading. Rather, it is not paying a dividend at all and is
instead rewarding shareholders in shares for the low returns earned by a
company they already own. Pension fund credits supported the over-generous
pay-out last year, funny money enhanced scrips this. One wonders where Lucas
will look next. The company argues that turnover and margin increases,
combined with a falling tax charge, will allow the payment to be covered 2.5
times over the cycle. Yet for this to be so Lucas would need four times
cover at the peak, which surely implies sufficient UK profits to claim back
its unrelieved advance corporation tax. What need then for an enhanced
scrip?
The answer probably lies with the level of debt. Lucas has already spent
some two-thirds of the restructuring provision it established last year.
That has brought a useful profits improvement, but there is plenty more to
go for. Since the company is already near the self-imposed ceiling for
gearing, it can hardly afford further heavy charges without substantial
disposals or new equity. As it seems keen to avoid either, cash remains
scarce.
All that might change if a respected figure such as Mr George Simpson of BAe
were to sign on, axe operations and raise new funds to pay for
restructuring. Yet Lucas apparently only wants a new chief executive to
implement existing plans. If so it is odd that the company has struggled for
so long to find a leader with what it takes to produce his own ideas.

FT  12 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Tunnel vision
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be nice to think that once the Queen and President Mitterrand snip
the red ribbon and les shuttles start hurtling under the sea that the
gargantuan doubts - and debts - enveloping Eurotunnel will quickly fade.
With the costs known and revenues flowing, the imponderables hampering any
meaningful valuation of Eurotunnel's units will be reduced. It should then
be possible to calculate a present value for future dividend flows - even
though Eurotunnel will remain further away from making a pay-out than it
forecast when it first issued units in 1987.
Unfortunately Eurotunnel is spending cash so fast that investors and bankers
will be asked for new money before the tunnel opens, diluting future
returns. The sums needed are likely to be higher than the market had
previously assumed. But then, what is the odd couple of hundred million
pounds when your debts are as great as Sudan's?
The rights issue will dampen any euphoria stimulated by the opening.
Afterwards, investors will switch attention to how much the tunnel might
make. Eurotunnel is chopping short-term revenue forecasts. The worry is that
its long-term projections may be too rosy too - especially if rival ferry
operators do not quickly cut capacity. Eurotunnel assumes rising
cross-Channel traffic will enable it to lift yields. But ferry operators
have not managed the feat. The theory also flies in the face of the aviation
industry's experience where real prices have fallen steadily despite rising
demand. A burst of inflation would surely help but even this cannot be
relied upon.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Papandreou's health casts shadow over election victory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GREECE woke up yesterday to an uncertain political future under a government
headed by Mr Andreas Papandreou, the 74-year-old socialist leader whose
frail health means he can work no more than a few hours a day.
The return to power of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) is a
personal triumph for Mr Papandreou over his health and the financial and
marital scandals that brought down his government in 1989.
But doubts about his ability to withstand the stress of running the country
loom larger than ever. To protect his fragile health, he is expected to run
the country from his villa in an Athens suburb rather than from the prime
minister's office.
But instead of appointing a deputy premier, who might be tempted to plot his
political demise, Mr Papandreou plans to keep a firm grip on his cabinet.
Loyal followers from the past rather than talented, but possibly
troublesome, younger socialists will get top jobs. Mr Papandreou will
oversee committees of ministers and advisers who will carry out routine
government tasks, say socialist officials.
The 'kitchen cabinet' principle of Mr Papandreou's previous term in office
seems certain to be revived. The prime minister's heart specialist, Dr
George Kremastinos, who has accompanied him on rare trips abroad since his
recovery from heart surgery in 1988, is tipped to become minister of health.
Socialist policies are still unclear, although Mr Papandreou's priority is
the deficit, the result of a shortfall in revenues and a rise in interest
payments on domestic debt to Dr2,200bn (Pounds 5.9bn) this year, some 11 per
cent of gross domestic product.
Greek bankers and businessmen have been waiting in vain for evidence that
Pasok, committed to abandoning the conservatives' privatisation programme,
will not undo their efforts to maintain fiscal discipline.
Moreover, the choice of Mr Giorgos Gennimatas, Greece's most popular
politician, as economy minister suggests that political concerns are
paramount for Mr Papandreou.
Near-final election returns gave Pasok 46.9 per cent of the vote and 170
seats in the 300-member parliament. New Democracy, led by Mr Constantine
Mitsotakis, suffered a worse defeat than forecast, winning 39.3 per cent of
the vote and 111 seats. Political Spring, the conservative splinter group,
won 4.9 per cent of the vote and 10 seats. The Greek Communist Party won 4.5
per cent of the vote and nine seats.

FT  12 OCT 93 / BBC gives go-ahead for 24-hour news, sport on Radio 5
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC governors last night gave the go-ahead for a 24-hour news and sports
service on Radio 5 beginning next April.
The decision marks a final climbdown by the BBC board of management and
governors who wanted to launch an all-day news service on the long-wave
frequency used by Radio 4.
The BBC is now likely to face opposition from sports fans who do not want to
share their service with news.
Mr John Birt, the BBC director-general, said last night: 'I am confident,
after extremely thorough research, that a news and sport network offers an
exciting new programme prospect - which will bring new listeners to the BBC
and extend choice for all licence payers.'
The new service will be aimed at a young audience, which implies a popular
sound to the news.
The BBC's plan to restrict Radio 4 to FM frequencies met opposition in the
UK from listeners who could not get an acceptable FM reception.
There was even more vociferous opposition from those who listened to Radio 4
in continental Europe on long wave but who could not pick up FM broadcasts.
Ms Jenny Abramsky, BBC director of radio news and current affairs, is
expected to run the new service. The position of Ms Pat Ewing, the present
controller of Radio 5, is unclear.
Last night Mr Marmaduke Hussey, chairman of the BBC governors, said the
marriage of news and sports brought together two of the BBC's strongest
assets.
The BBC has not yet said where the new home will be for the children's and
education programmes now carried on Radio 5.
Ms Ann Clwyd, shadow national heritage secretary, said last night the
decision 'flies in the face' of the BBC's commitment to serve all listeners.
The only network showing signs of a growing audience was the one to be
sacrificed for another service dominated by news, she added.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Japan may help fund rail link to Heathrow: Ex-Im bank may
offer Pounds 150m at commercial rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HALF THE finance for the Pounds 300m high-speed Heathrow Express rail link
could be provided by the Export-Import Bank of Japan, a state-owned bank
that specialises in loans to developing countries.
The loan would form part of a fresh drive by Japan to recycle some of its
massive trade surplus into public works projects in industrialised
countries. The UK might be the first Group of Seven country to benefit under
the initiative.
The British Airports Authority, the privatised operator of London's Heathrow
airport, confirmed yesterday that it had been approached by the bank, which
saw the link 'as a good commercial deal'.
A long-term loan from the Export-Import bank, which as a government-backed
institution can borrow on the Japanese markets at favourable rates, was one
option under consideration for financing the 17-mile link from the airport
to London's Paddington station.
'We have not yet chosen a bank or decided whether to raise the finance
through debt or bonds,' the authority said. 'We are still talking to a
number of banks around the world which are interested.'
However, the authority denied reports in the Japanese business daily Nihon
Keizai Shimbun that the bank had offered a low-interest loan for the
project.
'Any loan would be at market rates,' the authority said. 'It would not be
subsidised credit.'
Japan hopes the decision to finance public works projects in industrial
nations will increase the flow of long-term capital and highlight the
country's efforts to reduce its current account surplus, the newspaper said.
This is a fresh development in Japan's six-year-old strategy of recycling
part of its capital surplus in development and aid.
Last month, the bank signed its first deal in a European Community country
when it guaranteed a Pounds 49m private sector loan to modernise Greece's
railways.
'We are interested in doing something to revitalise the world economy,' said
Mr Yoshisiko Morita, Export-Import bank's London representative. 'Our
purpose is to co-operate with industrialised countries if there is a project
that will contribute towards that aim.'
Financing the Heathrow Express would be the bank's first significant project
in the UK. The bank was looking at several similar projects in Europe, he
said.
BAA has already put Pounds 50m into the Heathrow Express, which is due to be
completed by the end of 1997. It intends to raise the balance of the cost
through a mixture of short-term and long-term loans, in the same way as it
finances airport projects.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Touche Ross plays down Treasury ban on employees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOUCHE ROSS, one of the 'big six' accountancy firms, yesterday played down
the impact of government advice blacklisting some of its senior employees
from working on contracts obtained from the public sector.
The Treasury is understood to have circulated the advice in letters to
senior civil servants earlier this year, after its decision in November 1992
to sue the firm over its audit of Barlow Clowes, the fund management company
closed by the Department of Trade and Industry in 1988.
Among the 13 employees affected by the letters are Mr John Connolly, the
managing partner of the firm's London office.
Five of Touche's 370 partners are affected. All are either tax or audit
specialists. Many worked on audits of James Ferguson, the financial company
which acquired Barlow Clowes in 1987. Touche Ross yesterday said it hoped to
continue to build up its public sector practice.
'We are proud to be a major supplier of consulting and other advisory
services to government. We have every expectation that we will continue to
be selected on our merits to serve a wide variety of government
departments,' said Mr John Roques, senior partner.
The firm earned Pounds 58.3m from its consultancy services in the last
financial year, with possibly more than half generated from public sector
contracts. Among the firm's existing government contracts is work for the
BBC reviewing the licence fee.
Partners at other firms, however, believe that Touche's business could be
adversely affected.
The 'big six' earn possibly as much as Pounds 60m a year from public sector
audit work, mainly for local and health authorities. Work on privatisation
and consultancy more generally brings in at least Pounds 200m a year.
Professionals point to the experience of Arthur Andersen, another of the
'big six', which was the subject of a similar 'health warning' nearly a
decade ago. Andersen was auditor of the collapsed De Lorean car company and
is being sued by the government for alleged negligence.
Andersen has a vibrant consultancy practice, but has received no public
sector audit work in recent years.
Touche Ross has claimed it alerted the authorities to the fraud at Barlow
Clowes and has acted professionally. It said last November that the major
responsibility lay with the DTI.
Mr Alistair Darling, city spokesman for the Labour party, said he would
raise the issue in the House of Commons next week.

Andreas Papandreou, the newly elected Greek prime minister, has an
astrologer among his advisers and his wife Dimitra, a former Olympic Airways
stewardess, is a firm believer in the irrational. Could this be why
Papandreou failed to produce a cabinet list the day after his Panhellenic
Socialist Movement won a resounding victory in Greece's general election?
Issuing the names yesterday would have meant swearing in the new cabinet on
a Tuesday - unlucky in Greek eyes, because that was the day Constantinople
fell to the Turks in 1453. Nor
would Wednesday October 13 quite do. With the Socialists in
power, decision-making in Greece is obviously slowing still
further.

Kenneth Clarke's pre-Budget insouciance continues to astound. Far from
hiding away with a wet towel around his head, Clarke is off tonight to the
Mansion House to address a fine, but less than mainstream, gathering, the
Worshipful Company of Glovers.
Observer presumes Clarke will speak off the cuff at the annual banquet of
the 609-year-old livery company, but he should not omit to congratulate one
corner of the rag trade that has handled recession fairly well.
John Wood, a Tory party activist who lives in Clarke's Nottinghamshire
constituency, is probably the first 'master' to secure a chancellor for the
event. But the chairman of Ilkeston-based fabric company W. Ball and Son has
known Clarke for a good 25 years and says he stands out as a 'good, steady'
local politician.
Well done the chancellor, who obviously has one section of British industry
in the palm of his hand.

The British, it seems, are even isolated from their continental cousins when
it comes to pop culture. Swiss mini-media mogul Jurg Marquard, who yesterday
revealed the scale of his holdings for the first time, wants to launch a
British version of his wildly successful pop music, film and fashion weekly,
Popcorn. But he is nervous because of the significant differences in pop
tastes between Britain and the Continent.
Popcorn appears in German, Spanish, Hungarian, Polish, Bulgarian, Rumanian
and Russian versions, with a combined circulation of over 1.1m. Marquard
says he can use much the same material in all of them, because youth in
these countries all follow the same stars. 'But in Britain you have a weird
music scene,' claimed the self-made entrepreneur, before driving back to Zug
in his vintage white Roller.

France's Madame Thatcher is not to be outdone. Her disastrous 10 1/2 months
in office may provide rather less fodder for the historians than Thatcher's
11-year reign, but that has not stopped the publication of a biography of
former socialist prime minister Edith Cresson, attempting to explain her
downfall in terms of an evil male-inspired conspiracy.
In Edith Cresson, la femme piegee, (the trapped woman), Nouvel Observateur
journalist Elisabeth Schemla lays into the likes of Stephane Collaro from
the French version of Spitting Image. In the so-called Bebete Show, Cresson,
whose puppet acted a brainless upmarket tart, was dubbed 'as useless as a
suitcase without a handle'.
Collaro is unrepentant, pointing to the damage she brought upon herself by
ill-guarded remarks, such as asserting that a quarter of British men were
homosexual. Jacques Juillard, deputy director of the Nouvel Observateur, who
called her the dame de fer blanc (tin plate lady) says she failed to
understand the rules of the game, one of which is that the French want
political figures they can respect. Such as health minister Simone Veil,
whose maternal demeanour keeps her well above such spats between the
genders?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Manfred Brunner, former chef de cabinet to Martin Bangemann, the senior
German commissioner, had been attending a machine tool trade fair in
Frankfurt when his sniping at the process of European union came to the
attention of Helmut Kohl back in Bonn.
'I attacked the Maastricht treaty saying it was against the constitution
because it held democracy in contempt,' he recalls. 'I was told I could not
say anything else, or I would lose my job.'
So he signed a call for a referendum in Germany, and sent a copy to
Bangemann with his letter of resignation.
Today marks the culmination of his campaign, as the constit-utional court in
Karlsruhe decides on his legal challenge to the treaty.
He is certainly out of pocket for his efforts. While the challenge to the
court costs nothing, he has had to find some DM100,000 for legal opinions,
not to mention the loss of his Brussels job.
As leader of the minority Free Democratic party in Bavaria for several years
in the 1980s, Brunner is used to being a loser. But if he does not get his
way in court, he will not necessarily give in.
Watch out for a new political party, probably the 'D-Mark party', that would
campaign in next year's European parliament elections. Given that 71 per
cent of the German population said they did not want to swap the D-Mark for
the Ecu, at the last count, could he be on to a winner at last?

FT  12 OCT 93 / Nourishment for an infant industry: Medics increasingly see
value in nutritional supplements - unlike many big drugs companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nutritional supplements are fast becoming a fad in orthodox medical circles.
Doctors who 10 years ago would have been scornful of healthy adults taking
vitamin pills, evening primrose or fish oil are today recommending them
enthusiastically to protect against cancer, heart disease and other common
ailments.
A steady stream of clinical trials is showing that food supplements can
bring health benefits to a wide range of people - and not just to patients
suffering from rare nutritional deficits. During the 1980s, evidence
accumulated that regular consumption of fish oil reduced heart attacks and
that evening primrose oil could treat a variety of disorders from
pre-menstrual pain to eczema.
The spotlight in the 1990s has fallen above all on the so-called
'anti-oxidant' supplements such as vitamins C and E, which suppress natural
chemical reactions that damage cells in the body.
'Over the past three years there has been a tremendous shift in knowledge
and opinion about anti-oxidants,' says Professor Anthony Diplock, head of
biochemistry at Guy's Hospital, London. 'There's now a quite massive body of
evidence, largely epidemiological, that these nutrients can reduce the
incidence of cardiovascular disease, some forms of cancer and also
cataracts.'
Hundreds of studies over the past decade have shown a strong link between
diet and disease - for example, that eating plenty of fruit and vegetables
helps to prevent cancer and that consumption of fish reduces heart disease.
What is new is the convincing evidence that nutritional supplements, in the
form of pills and capsules, can reinforce the beneficial effect of a healthy
diet.
This summer the Harvard School of Public Health published an epidemiological
study of 120,000 nurses and doctors which showed that taking additional
vitamin E for at least two years cut the risk of heart disease by about 40
per cent. And last month a US-Chinese study of 30,000 people in rural China
found a 13 per cent reduction in cancer deaths among those who took
anti-oxidant supplements over five years.
Such evidence is likely to fuel the growth of the nutritional supplement
market, which is already worth about Dollars 5bn worldwide and expanding by
10 per cent a year. (Good international estimates are hard to come by -
partly because the boundaries between nutritional supplements and foods on
the one hand and medicines on the other vary around the world.)
Statistics for the UK, based on figures from manufacturers and market
research companies, show sales of health supplements up 12.5 per cent last
year to Pounds 215m. Evening primrose oil grew fastest - up 80 per cent to
Pounds 32m.
The proportion of the adult population taking supplements has risen from 19
per cent in 1986 to 32 per cent now, says Mr Alan Clements, marketing
director of Seven Seas, the leading UK brand.
Yet the orthodox pharmaceutical industry continues to keep its distance from
nutritional supplements and shows little interest in turning them into
prescription drugs. Indeed the whole thrust of pharmaceutical research today
is in the opposite direction. Most synthetic drugs are designed to block one
specific biochemical process in the body, whereas supplements achieve a
wide-ranging effect by making up for a natural chemical deficit.
One reason why drug companies prefer synthetic chemicals to natural products
is that their patent protection is far more secure. Another is that
licensing regulations are more clear-cut for straightforward medicines than
they are on the borderline between drugs and food supplements - where there
are still radical differences between national policies even within the EC.
Roche of Switzerland is the exception among the pharmaceutical giants. It
manufactures vitamins in bulk for other companies and also sells them itself
as food supplements and medicines. In 1992 Roche's vitamin sales rose by 13
per cent to Dollars 1.6bn. Roche has an active research programme developing
drugs from vitamins, including powerful new treatments for acne and other
skin disease based on chemical derivatives of vitamin A.
Apart from Roche, the world supplements industry consists mainly of
relatively small companies concentrating on national or regional markets.
Very few have the financial resources or the management expertise to develop
new drugs from their products, although these would give them a substantial
new revenue stream from essentially the same ingredients; even with the
current pressure on pharmaceutical prices, drugs have larger profit margins
than food supplements.
A striking exception here is Scotia, an emerging pharmaceuticals company
that is being floated on the London stock market later this month with an
expected capitalisation of Pounds 160m. Dr David Horrobin founded the
company in 1979 with the strategy of selling evening primrose oil as a
nutritional supplement - promoted by clinical studies showing its
wide-ranging health benefits - and ploughing the profits into drug
development.
Scotia now has two prescription drugs based on 'essential fatty acids'
extracted from seeds of the evening primrose; they are licensed for treating
breast pain and the skin disorder, eczema. Others in ad-vanced clinical
trials include drugs for cancer, complications of diabetes, arthritis and
blocked arteries.
Dr Horrobin concedes that some doctors are occasionally suspicious of Scotia
because apparently different medical problems can be treated with very
similar drugs. But he points out two things. 'First, each fatty acid has
highly specific actions, and small differences in structure can lead to
dramatically different effects,' he says. 'Second, the n-6 family of fatty
acids, which are found in evening primrose and other oils, are essential for
the structure and function of every cell membrane in the body. Thus
shortages or imbalances of those fatty acids can disturb the function of
every tissue, leading to a diverse range of symptoms.'
The other group of essential fatty acids, the n-3 family, is particularly
important in the brain, the heart and blood circulation and the regulation
of inflammation. Fish oil is the main source of n-3 fatty acids.
The only medicine in the UK based on fish oil is Maxepa, for which Seven
Seas, a Hanson subsidiary, received a licence in 1987. Doctors can prescribe
it for lowering the level of harmful fats in the blood.
Sales of Maxepa are relatively modest - about Pounds 2m a year in the UK,
compared with Pounds 20m a year for the company's fish oil supplements. But
Seven Seas, unlike Scotia, does not want to change from being primarily a
supplements manufacturer to a drug company, says Mr Clements. 'Scotia is an
R&amp;D-based company, while we're really a marketing company that is more
suited to the consumer marketplace.'
Compared with synthetic chemicals, medicines based on nutritional
supplements tend to be slow and gentle in their effects. That can make it
hard to satisfy regulatory authorities of their effectiveness in small-scale
clinical trials.
Scotia, for example, put in a licensing application for Efabetic, its
proposed treatment for nerve damage caused by diabetes, on the basis of a
trial with 111 patients. It led to a statistically significant improvement,
but the UK Medicines Control Agency told the company that 'convincing
efficacy had still not been demonstrated on a sufficiently large number of
patients'. Scotia is now sponsoring further clinical trials and hopes to
submit a new application late next year with data from 400 patients.
The barrier is just as high in the US. One company trying to overcome it is
La Haye Laboratories of Redmond, Washington - founded in 1986 with a
somewhat similar strategy to Scotia in the UK. It sells Icaps Plus, a
mixture of anti-oxidant vitamins and minerals, as a nutritional supplement,
and has a similar but more powerful blend in the final phase of clinical
trials for treating two eye diseases.
'I believe it will be the first nutritional product approved (as a drug) by
the Food and Drug Administration,' says Mr Larry Laks, the company's
executive vice-president. La Haye is taking no chances; its clinical trials
involve 2,400 patients.
In addition to the epidemiological evidence, scientists are beginning to
understand how anti-oxidants work 'at the basic molecular level', Prof
Diplock says. In very simple terms, they destroy 'free radicals' - reactive
molecules which can damage cells and trigger diseases.
And, even if they do you no good, most supplements are unlikely to cause any
harm. Prof Diplock, who has just completed a scientific review of all the
safety evidence on vitamin E, found that it had no adverse effects even at
doses of 3 grammes a day - 300 times the US recommended daily allowance.
As the chorus of medical voices singing the praises of vitamins and
nutritional supplements grows, the industry seems certain to expand rapidly.
At the same time, it may attract more attention from other large
pharmaceutical companies looking for a source of safe new drugs.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Personal View: Unified Germany no drag on Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By THEO WAIGEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The unification of Germany would not have been possible without the help and
support of our partners in the west. Our neighbours, too, have felt the
effects of unification in various ways, politically as well as economically:
unification initially generated a surge in growth for our EC partners
amounting to 1 per cent of their gross national product in 1990-1991.
But since then, the economic consequences of German unification have become,
for some, a cause for dissension. German unity is being blamed for high
interest rates and flagging growth in Europe.
Is there any substance to these allegations? One fact is that Germany now
has to transfer internally, from west to east, at least 5 per cent of its
gross domestic product each year. In spite of savings of DM30bn-DM40bn in
the federal budget since 1989, equal to about 1.5 per cent of GDP a year,
this has pushed the general government deficit up to 4-4.5 per cent of GDP
(using the internationally comparable national accounts definition); the
deficit amounts to between 5.5-6 per cent of GDP if one includes Germany's
future commitments in assuming the debt of the Treuhandanstalt and the
German railways.
But it is also a fact that countries such as Belgium, the UK, Italy or
Sweden have higher public sector deficits without having undergone such an
unprecedented task as reunification. There are other countries that have run
continuously high deficits for a decade or more, whereas Germany managed to
realise a moderate fiscal surplus in 1989, the year of unification.
The decisive fact is that Germany is now putting into effect, through
legislation, a consolidation strategy that will bring down fiscal deficits
within a clear time-frame. Regional and local governments have now joined
the federal government in following this course. Annual expenditure growth
is to be held to about 3 per cent up to 1997. This is exactly half of the
projected rise in nominal GDP over the same period.
Among the leading industrial countries, Germany is making the greatest
effort to cut its deficit. According to the International Monetary Fund's
most recent estimates, Germany's structural budget position (including the
deficits of Treuhandanstalt and the railways) will improve by about 5 per
cent of GDP between 1991 and 1995. No other Group of Seven country is making
a comparable consolidation effort in such a short period of time. Of course,
as a result of the weak economy, the improvement in the structural budget
has been partly offset by a deterioration in the cyclical component of the
fiscal balance, but by 1996 we expect an actual aggregate government deficit
of 2 per cent of GDP.
And we are not overly optimistic in our assumptions: we have based our
medium-term planning on a real average annual growth rate of 3 per cent. Of
this, about half a percentage point a year is attributable to the
disproportionate rise expected in east Germany. By assuming about 2.5 per
cent annual growth for west Germany we are staying on the safe side, in line
with most international projections.
We have not been dragging our feet in dealing with our financial problems;
indeed, individuals and enterprises in Germany have been called upon to pay
additional taxes and other fiscal charges amounting to some 3.5 per cent of
GDP annually. This is also evidence of our efforts to avoid shifting the
burden on to our neighbours' shoulders, for what we can finance at home from
additional revenue will not weigh down international capital markets.
Our strategy is already paying off. We have put the phase of high interest
rates in Germany well behind us. Over the past 12 months, money market rates
have declined by 3 percentage points. Bond yields have fallen by almost the
same amount, and at below 6 per cent are now appreciably below their
long-term average of 7 per cent.
Germany is not the 'lame duck' of the world economy either. Measured over
the period 1989-1993, aggregate real growth in Germany at 11 per cent has
been more than one-fifth higher than the G7 average. The recession in
Germany is so pronounced because the preceding boom was so much more
vigorous.
We are also aware of Germany's need for structural improvement. Germany is
one of the first industrial countries to have launched a comprehensive
government programme, adopted by the cabinet a few weeks ago, that contains
a far-reaching assessment of the situation and a broad catalogue of action.
Germany is still prepared to work hard and to get to grips with its
problems. And we will continue to do this in co-operation with our friends
and neighbours in Europe and throughout the world.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BLESSED BY 47 per cent of the vote in Sunday's Greek elections, Mr Andreas
Papandreou has achieved one of the most spectacular comebacks in postwar
European politics. Unless he shows more wisdom than during his prime
ministership in 1981-89, his return could prove uncomfortable, costly and
divisive - for Greece and its Community partners.
What counts most against the 74-year-old leader of the Panhellenic Socialist
Movement is not age and poor health. Konrad Adenauer was only a year younger
when he became West German chancellor in 1949, and Ronald Reagan was four
years older when he left office in 1989. The chief reason for scepticism
about Greece's prime minister-elect lies in his 1980s track record of
economic mismanagement. Mr Papandreou's policies were the main reason why -
in contrast to Spanish and Portuguese experience - Greece during the 1980s
suffered a fall in prosperity compared with the EC average. Mr Papandreou
has toned down his left-wing radicalism. Yet it is not clear that he has
drawn the necessary lessons from his previous period in power.
Mr Papandreou has profited from the unpopularity of austerity measures taken
by his successor, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, to correct his own legacy of
high public sector debts and deficits. But during the election campaign he
showered voters with self-contradictory pledges to avoid new taxes while
promising full employment and low inflation. At the same time, he ducked the
urgent question of how to modernise Greece's uncompetitive industry and
inefficient public administration.
Now that he has won, Mr Papandreou will have to set priorities. The most
urgent is to fill holes in the budget caused by recession, tax evasion, and
delays in the privatisation programme, which he has pledged to end. This
year's budget deficit is projected at 13 per cent of gross domestic product,
3 points higher than targeted. Inflation, at an underlying rate of 13.5 per
cent, is grotesquely out of line with EC levels.
In foreign policy, too, there is reason for disquiet. In less than three
months, Greece takes over the presidency of the Community at a crucial time
in negotiations on enlarging EC membership. Greece's refusal to allow formal
EC recognition of neighbouring Macedonia has already irked its partners. Mr
Papandreou has taken a much more nationalist line over Macedonia than Mr
Mitsotakis, whose relative moderation added to his electoral problems.
Difficulties in establishing a coherent Community policy on the Balkans will
increase if Mr Papandreou maintains opposition to UN-sponsored talks with
the former Yugoslav province.
Greece's blocking of EC aid to Macedonia under the Community's eastern
European Phare programme is particularly misplaced. Annual transfers from
the EC make up 5 per cent of Greek GDP. Formal EC monitoring of the Greek
economy, put into place in 1991 after the granting of a Community loan, has
now lapsed.
Mr Papandreou's campaign promises suggest that Greece is likely to remain
heavily dependent upon external finance, including that provided under
Community structural funds. These disbursements should be made conditional
upon Greece meeting appropriate economic targets. The Community is rightly
setting exacting standards for the eastern and central European countries
queueing to join. Greece, as an established member, should expect no less
rigour.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE Channel tunnel officially opens next May, the project will be
nearly a year late and its cost of Pounds 8.8bn almost double the original
estimate. The construction has been dogged by disputes between Eurotunnel,
the operator, and TML, the contractor. Eurotunnel shareholders will also
have been asked twice to stump up extra cash. The impression of financial
disorder in what was billed as a flagship of free enterprise is such that
some observers are asking whether it would not have been better to leave the
project to the public sector.
Such a conclusion would be wrong. First, it is not clear that Eurotunnel has
been such a bad investment. Much will depend on how much traffic it carries,
but the initial shareholders show a modest if unexciting gain on their
investment at yesterday's closing price of 488p. Second, it is almost
certain that the public sector would have done worse in keeping costs under
control. It is hard to believe that Department of Transport civil servants
would have harried the contractors with the same vigour as Sir Alastair
Morton, Eurotunnel's abrasive chief executive.
However, lessons can be learnt from the Eurotunnel experience. Doing so is
also necessary, given the UK government's intention of attracting private
finance for a range of traditionally public sector investments such as
roads, railways, prisons and hospitals.
One lesson is that it is worth the government taking a bit more time and
spending a bit more money defining projects up-front. With the Channel
tunnel, failure to do so meant the operating franchise was awarded to a
group of construction companies. When they floated Eurotunnel off, it was
already saddled with construction contracts with the original promoters - a
structure which has been blamed for many of the subsequent disputes. It
would have been better to have started with an operator capable of
negotiating its own contracts. But to achieve that, the government would
probably have had to prime the pump.
Another lesson is that it may not be efficient to transfer all the risk of
infrastructure projects to the private sector, particularly where the
government itself is the source of uncertainty. In Eurotunnel's case, the UK
government's sluggishness in building more rail and road links to the tunnel
and a tightening of safety regulations have all reduced the project's
financial attraction. If the government indemnified private contractors for
such political and regulatory risks, it would have an incentive to keep them
to the minimum.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT CLINTON may think he has found a face-saving way to extricate US
forces from Somalia by launching a fresh diplomatic initiative, while at the
same time setting a March deadline for a US troop withdrawal. But he is
deluding himself if he believes he is also saving Somalia. In setting a
withdrawal deadline, Mr Clinton is responding to domestic pressures, but the
policy may contain the seeds of its own failure. The warlords at the heart
of the conflict are unlikely to take part in good faith if the most powerful
sanction enforcing their good behaviour is of such short duration. In the
unlikely event that an agreement does emerge, UN troops will be unable to
enforce it without a powerful US component.
The difficulties besetting the UN operation in Somalia result from the
confused objectives of its participants. When President George Bush sent US
troops there last December, the full implications of what was intended as a
humanitarian mission were not taken into account. UN forces have been
successful in feeding hungry Somalis and in restoring stability in many
parts of the country. But Somalia remains deeply divided along regional and
clan lines, and still needs international help to ensure its shattered
society does not sink back into civil conflict. That necessitates a
political negotiating framework with military support in disarming rival
factions and creating a secure environment.
President Clinton's call for a diplomatic initiative - in particular, for
the resumption of talks between a broad cross-section of Somali groups that
collapsed in Addis Ababa in March - deserves support, but comes perilously
late in the day. If there is to be any chance of success, the UN force must
first ensure the conference takes place in an atmosphere free of fear and
intimidation. Gen Aideed and other military leaders will ultimately have to
be present - but only after their armies have been assembled and disarmed
under UN supervision.
Such an effort requires a continuing US presence on the ground, and a clear
UN strategy. In the past few days, however, the confusion surrounding US
policy has only deepened. Washington has vacillated between pursuing its
efforts to capture Gen Aideed and charge him with responsibility for the
deaths of UN soldiers on the one hand, and accepting his shrewdly timed
introduction at the weekend of a ceasefire on the other.
The general's offer could yet provide an opportunity to salvage what has
turned out to be a disastrous intervention - but only if President Clinton
uses it as a means to accelerate political negotiations, not as a pretext
for premature withdrawal.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Easier said than done: Robert Graham on Italy's
privatisation problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the European privatisation race, Italy is moving like a tortoise, rather
than a hare. In neighbouring France, the government has been able to launch
the first of its privatisations - the sale of its stake in Banque Nationale
de Paris - within four months of the programme being announced. By contrast
Italy's programme for the sale of state shareholdings in industry, banking
and insurance, promised since July 1992, is only now beginning to be
formalised amid a messy controversy over methods of divestiture.
Just when plans are reaching a critical phase, Mr Paolo Savona, the industry
minister, has decided to air differences with colleagues in the government
of Prime Minister Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi - especially with the man due to
carry out the largest asset sale, Prof Romano Prodi, the head of IRI, the
state-holding company.
Differences at the weekend over the way the programme is proceeding obliged
Mr Ciampi to take sides. Faced with Prof Prodi's threat of resignation, he
chose to slap down Mr Savona who, in turn, promptly resigned. Even though Mr
Savona last night withdrew his resignation, the incident is an embarrassment
for Mr Ciampi.
The timing could not be more unfortunate. Details of the sale of two of
IRI's large bank holdings - in Credito Italiano and Banca Commerciale
Italiana (BCI) - are about to be released. The two banks are pillars of
Italian banking and the manner in which the disposals are handled will be a
test of whether the Italian government has the will to push through a
privatisation operation comparable to that of France, the UK and Spain.
Superficially the privatisation dispute centres on the means rather than the
ends. On the one side is Prof Prodi, backed by the prime minister, who
favours a British-style approach - divestiture through a public share
offering to encourage wider ownership and ensure a genuine shift of
ownership to the private sector via a quoted company. The Italians call it
'the public company' route.
On the other side, championed at the week-end by Mr Savona, is the 'French
solution'. This envisages the creation of a core of shareholders clearly
responsible for both management and corporate strategy; but which does not
exclude the small shareholder.
But reducing the argument to a straight-forward clash of tactics is
misleading. Mr Ciampi yesterday insisted his government would approach
privatisation on a pragmatic case-by-case basis. He pointed out that
Credito, in which IRI holds 67 per cent, was being floated because this was
the most suitable means of disposal, while Nouvo Pignone, the gas turbines
subsidiary of ENI, the state oil concern, would be sold off by private
tender. A decision on the latter could be announced this week.
The Credito and Nuovo Pignone privatisations were announced by the
government of Mr Giuliano Amato in September 1992 at the height of the
currency crisis to demonstrate Italy's commitment to liberalising the
economy. In the case of Credito, Merril Lynch was hired last October to find
a large domestic institution or a foreign buyer to absorb part or all of
IRI's holding. None could be tempted to make the right kind of offer.
That forced a change of tactics by Prof Prodi last month when he opted for a
public share offering, a policy backed by the government. Details are
expected this week and yesterday the board met to approve a change in the
bank's statutes.
Thus privatisation policy, to the confusion of many, has been marked by
changing ideas dictated more by circumstance than ideology. A consequence is
that it would be wrong to assume the government is prepared to relinquish
all forms of control in cases where it opts for a public share offering
rather than a trade sale.
The government has kept discretionary powers, through a decree on September
24, when floating shares in utilities, banks and insurance companies. In
effect, the government can encourage the formation of a core or syndicate of
friendly shareholders to protect the national interest or the perceived
interests of the company being floated. Or, it could create a golden share.
So what is all the fuss about? The clues lie in the murky world of politics.
Powerful lobbies are at work and the old-guard politicians, no matter how
discredited by scandals, are reluctant to relinquish control of the public
sector after so many years treating it as a play-ground for patronage. These
lobbies were, until now, well-concealed under Mr Ciampi's technocratic
government, which still has the formal backing of the old Christian
Democrat-led four-party coalition.
But last week Prof Prodi talked of flotation through a public company as 'a
once-and for-all opportunity to encourage economic pluralism' in a economy
dominated by four or five big groups in the state and private sector.
In response, Mr Giorgio La Malfa, a former leader of the Republican Party,
said: 'Behind all the talk of privatisation, over which Prodi is the
undisputed master, lies a clear desire by the left wing of the Christian
Democrat Party to maintain control over the public companies.'
Mr La Malfa maintains a public share offering would probably leave unclear
who will actually manage the company. This, he argues, will make it all to
easy for the old politically-appointed managements to retain control. In the
case of the banking system, such control would give the Christian Democrats
a powerful instrument to help their revival.
Prof Prodi considers himself a technocrat but has also been close to some
Christian Democrats. Before the Ciampi government was formed in May, he was
the Christian Democrats' choice for the premiership. Now at IRI, he has
considerable powers of patronage and it is no secret that Mr Gianni
Locatelli, the new head of the Rai state broadcasting corporation, was his
choice.
The manoeuvrings are not one-sided and many would see the anti-Prodi camp as
backing the ambitions of Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, which is
believed to want control of BCI. Observers say Mediobanca has nursed
ambitions of creating a northern Italian financial powerhouse combining its
own talents with those of BCI. Equally, the impending privatisation of BCI
and Credito casts doubt over Mediobanca's future.
Until now, Mediobanca's independence has been assured through a shareholding
arrangement controlled by Credito, BCI and Banca di Roma - all IRIR-run
financial institutions. Privatisation of BCI and Credito could upset this.
The differences are not irreconcilable. The present squabble is a jockeying
for position to ensure that there are gains for all those who would benefit
from state sell-offs. However, this does not encourage transparency; nor
does political wrangling encourage investors to move away from their safe
holdings in Treasury bills to the stockmarket and riskier privatisation
issues.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GORDON HARROW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report 'Receiverships at lowest level for four years' (October 6)
draws some misleading conclusions from the latest figures on receivership
levels.
In my experience with small businesses particularly, there is no conscious
reluctance to expand as we emerge from recession, but rather a suspicion
that the recovery might not be sustained.
Once this suspicion is dispelled, there is the danger that the 'normal'
situation will prevail and business failures increase.
It is the responsibility of business advisers to ensure that their clients
follow a sensible policy, something which was lacking in past economic
recoveries.
The 'rescue' facilities within the British insolvency system have been with
us throughout the recession. It is only recently that preferential and many
secured creditors have come to realise that they stand to lose less by
supporting voluntary arrangements than forcing a company out of business.
Greater publicity of late has created more awareness of this facility with
both creditors and debtors.
The length and severity of the recession has resulted in the closure this
year of those companies which were either poorly managed, badly advised or
most exposed to a reduction in business. A drop in failure levels at some
stage is inevitable - there are not so many left]

Sir, Your article on the coffee bean surplus ('Fight over a hill o' beans',
October 1) highlighted a serious problem for coffee exporting countries. The
article on the consumers' switch to private label brands ('A rose by any
other name', October 6) may offer a partial solution. Part of the growers'
complaint is that, in spite of a surplus of coffee beans, the price to the
end consumer does not reflect the true cost of the raw material.
Growers should take advantage of consumers dropping their brand loyalties
and start processing their own products and selling direct to supermarkets
in consuming countries.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Significant trade source
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BEN COLEMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Andrew Stone (Letters, October 7) is right to claim that British trade
with Israel is significant. A survey we have just published of small and
medium-sized exporters in south-east England reveals that almost a third as
many trade with Israel (9.4 per cent) as with the rest of the Middle East
(26.2 per cent).
Furthermore, almost as many have plans for Israel (4.4 per cent) as for the
rest of the Middle East (5.3 per cent). As the survey was undertaken before
the recent peace agreement, this figure is likely to prove even higher in
reality.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Control tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JAMES POOLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There is one over-riding reason to support an auditors' review of
internal controls in company reporting (Letters October 8). Computerised
accounting and management information systems have transferred more control
of financial reporting back to companies. As cases against auditors in
recent years have revealed, auditors have to rely on these internal systems.
Imposing some formal standards for companies to test these assumptions is
clearly essential if the circle of assurance for investors and others is to
be closed. What still needs to be tested is whether the proposed standard is
adequate for this task.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: The hardest part of managing funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOSEPH ROSEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I must take issue with Mr Alan Greenhorn's somewhat odd and perhaps
disingenuous statement in your Risk and Reward column of October 4 ('Setback
for active quantitative fund management sector') that 'performance
measurement is the most difficult aspect of fund management'. Is not
generating performance the most difficult - not to mention important -
aspect of fund management?
The mutual funds industry (unit trusts in your parlance) learnt long ago how
to measure quite accurately its performance, even with the complications due
to large daily cash flows in and out from many thousands, if not millions,
of customers. One hopes that Mr Greenhorn in fact is confusing performance
measurement with performance attribution and benchmarking.
On this we do agree that 'new forms of measurement are needed' when it comes
to relative, as opposed to absolute, performance, particularly for
non-traditional types of funds.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Hollinger sale of Trinity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From J A BOULTBEE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your article of September 15 ('Company News') concerning Trinity
International Holdings, you refer to Mr Conrad Black as a 'disgruntled
shareholder' and imply that the Trinity shares held originally by Hollinger
Inc and later The Telegraph plc were sold because Trinity 'rebuffed Mr
Black's overtures for a seat on the board'.
Hollinger Inc originally purchased shares in Trinity International with the
intention of eventually deciding whether or not to attempt to take control.
Notwithstanding the limited voting status of the shares, Hollinger always
believed that control could be achieved by virtue of the fact that the
limited voting shares did have the right to vote on any motion to sell all
of the assets of Trinity or to wind up the company. A significant
shareholder, such as Hollinger was, could have called a shareholder meeting
and put such matters to a vote.
We sold the interest in Trinity because the share price had risen and we
believed that any bid to acquire majority ownership would be overly
expensive and also because of the purchase of an interest in Southam Inc. In
addition to the sale of the Trinity interest generating funding for the
Southam interest, the concentration of ownership of newspapers in British
Columbia among Hollinger Inc, Southam Inc and Trinity International would
likely have posed problems for the Hollinger Group under the Canadian
Competition Act.

FT  12 OCT 93 / The patter of tiny ideas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The hot-air balloon launched by the Conservatives at Blackpool last week
must be shot down before it reaches Whitehall. The blather of right-wing
quackery is dangerous. The spectacle of ministers who know better ranting
against picayune enemies, real and imagined, is demeaning. Worse, it
confirms that the government has run out of serious ideas.
I am not disputing the political force of attacks on foreigners, welfare
cheats, criminals, pornographers, single parents, and trendy teachers.
Adverse comments on classroom practice have even appeared in this space.
Elderly voters do like to hear about the regrettable tendency of society to
deteriorate since we moved films of it from black-and-white to technicolour.
But rhetoric of the Blackpool kind is too easy. It is practised on the soap
boxes at Hyde Park corner. Any taxi-driver can do it. The only difference is
that the average cabbie's patter has more intellectual coherence than some
of the calculated demagoguery of Messrs Michael Howard, Peter Lilley, John
Patten and, regrettably, Sir George Young - not to mention the prime
minister.
There is, however, no justice. The trick may work. We have learned from the
United States that an appeal to the ill-informed emotional sensibilities of
the 'moral majority' - Mr Michael Portillo calls it the 'decent majority' -
can be a powerful weapon in populist hands. More to the point, many of the
propositions advanced at Blackpool contain a kernel of validity. When Mr
Portillo gives them support by arguing in favour of individual
responsibility they sound cogent. No wonder the Stupid Party was swept
along.
The whole is, however, less than the sum of the parts. If the social policy
promises of Blackpool were to be delivered, little difference would be made
to the lives of most people in the United Kingdom. The Tories would merely
have cemented their core vote by inflicting unhappiness on a few miscreants
or unfortunates, some of whom may deserve such a fate, and many who would
not. Meanwhile attention would be diverted from the real problems of
fostering employment, stimulating a competitive economy, and trying to avoid
the destruction of the upper atmosphere.
For example, the secretary for social security, Mr Peter Lilley blasted out
in pure tabloidese that 'it made my blood boil this summer to read of
foreign drug addicts feeding their habit by milking our benefits'. This
sounded like the prelude to something big. Mr Lilley's actual rule-change,
promulgated on August 2, may affect 10,000 foreign visitors, an unknown
proportion of whom are drug addicts. There are some 5m British recipients of
income support. The cash saving is put at Pounds 17m a year. Another
rule-change, on housing benefit, is expected to save Pounds 50m; a delay to
benefits applications by EC nationals will save an unspecified further
amount. Set against a social security budget of Pounds 70bn these are
marginal sums. They may help but the facts do not justify their use as a
smokescreen for the government's failure to resolve larger issues, such as
the future of indigenous social support.
Next, law and order. 'I am going to take action. Tough action,' boasted Mr
Howard. It is hard to name one of the home secretary's 27 announcements that
will reduce the number of crimes committed. He himself would demur if asked
to estimate the likely effect of his package on the spectacular rise in
indictable offences. Punishing criminals, which is the essence of his
approach, is a tiny niche in the crime control market. The official British
crime survey suggests that close to 10m misdemeanours were committed in
1991. Half were reported to the police, who recorded 60 per cent of those
reported. In England and Wales the police found some evidence against the
perpetrators of fewer than a third of the crimes they recorded. The number
of offenders 'dealt with' - formally cautioned, fined or imprisoned -
constituted a tiny fraction, about a sixtieth, of the number of offences.
The Home Office expects the prison population to grow from around 47,000 now
to some 60,000 at the turn of the century. Mr Howard should set the latter
figure against 10m crimes and rising. Perhaps he will then stop pretending
that the success of his policies will be determined by the growth in the
number of persons incarcerated. Mr Tony Blair, Labour's shadow home
secretary, has the superior slogan: 'Tough on crime, and tough on the causes
of crime.' The Tory right will admit of no social cause of wrong-doing
beyond the absence of fathers.
Mr Howard delivered a second, less rabble-rousing, speech in Blackpool. He
argued, more closely than he might have done in the conference hall, for the
superiority of the two-parent family. 'Does anyone seriously believe that a
bit more cash - even if we could afford it - could even remotely make up for
no father?' he asked. Every minister had his bit to do to reinforce a sense
of responsibility in individuals. Along came the usually thoughtful minister
of housing, Sir George Young, to ask: 'How do we explain to the young couple
. . . who want to wait for a home before they start a family . . . that they
cannot be rehoused ahead of the unmarried teenager expecting her first,
probably unplanned child?'
Perhaps by acknowledging, first, that whatever the young mother's motives,
the child now exists and needs housing, and, second, that the problem,
though real, has been greatly exaggerated. The Institute of Housing, which
represents managers of local authority and housing association properties,
published survey results last week which indicated that only two out of 30
housing authorities questioned reported a high incidence of homeless teenage
mothers. You can tell if anyone speaking about family policy is serious by
noting whether care is taken to separate the divorced, formerly-partnered
and widowed majority of one-parent households from those in which there
never has been a stable relationship. Even then, ask how many teenage
mothers stay home with their parents.
In short, these matters, important in themselves, are not significant
aspects of a national policy. Exciting a crowd of ignorant pensioners in a
Blackpool hall is no substitute for a programme of government action.
Conservatives will continue to dodge the really important questions until
they enjoy a spell of opposition.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Customers' needs priority in
telephone banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GRAHAM GOULD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Unusually, Lex has missed the point in the column about telephone
banking (October 4). Lex raised the issue of whether 'the efficiency
advantage of a low-cost transaction service outweighs the cost of foregoing
some of the profits from cheap retail deposits'.
To be successful in telephone banking - or the provision of any other
financial service by telephone - the operation has to be built around the
customers' needs, not the short-term operating needs of the bank. It is a
strategic not a tactical investment.
By building the service around what customers want - such as long hours,
responsive service, simple products - a different type of banking will be
created. This will be profitable as more and more customers appreciate its
advantages and profits are generated in new ways.
Direct Line and ShareLink have demonstrated this in their own market
sectors. If the success of First Direct were measured in long-term value
created for Midland Bank's shareholders, I suspect the picture would already
be very positive.
Bolting on operations, as NatWest and Barclays have done, cannot work in the
long term. Bolting on such operations means that they are built from what
currently exists, not from what the customer wants.
As a customer of one of these operations, I was not pleased when both my
personal contacts at the bank were promoted simultaneously and two anonymous
people assigned to my account. This is something that could not happen in a
customer-focused operation, but which could happen easily in a clearing
bank.
Thinking of the opportunities created by the telephone for the provision of
new services in terms of the impact it may have on cheap retail deposits is
precisely what has caused the clearing banks to distance themselves from
real customers' needs and has created opportunities for innovative new
suppliers, such as First Direct and ShareLink, to enter the market.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Arts: Sentiment rules in the US - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Sunday in the Barbican with Ivor Bolton, the London Symphony played a
benefit concert for United World Colleges and the Variety Club of Great
Britain. Even by benefit-concert standards, it was a pretty rum programme.
Two obscure operatic numbers (Massenet, Rossini) for Ruggero Raimondi to
sing, each prefaced with instrumental pieces from those composers' operas;
and then a commissioned piece de resistance: a 'Peace' piece, conducted by
its highly professional composer Marvin Hamlisch, whose scores have
enlivened the musical A Chorus Line and - among many other movies - The Way
We Were, which earned him Academy Awards.
While the LSO addressed itself vigorously to Massenet's ballet music for Le
Cid, I kept thinking how much better it would have been if his contemporary
Chabrier had written it. Both composers began with similarly catchy
trouvailles when aiming at broad, popular effects - but only Chabrier went
on unfailingly to twist and subvert them until they crackled with fresh
imagination. Then Raimondi impersonated Massenet's dying 'Don Quichotte'
with grave tenderness and superbly even tone: if only Massenet's mawkish
strings were less blatantly 'effective', and more elegantly composed] After
that, the great bass enjoyed himself hugely in a patter-aria from Rossini's
Viaggio a Reims (partly spoken); and then he stopped, when we felt we'd
hardly heard him yet.
Hamlisch's Anatomy of Peace, which was having its European premiere, was
commissioned by United World Colleges. (The fund-raising co-Chairs for its
US National Committee are his wife and Mrs Phyllis Rothschild Farley.)
Juilliard-trained as he is, one hoped that 'his first commissioned work for
symphony orchestra' would stretch him at last beyond the limits of Broadway,
but it did not.
We got his own printed scenario. A solo flute line, representing the 'one
law' that should be the salvation of warring nations worldwide, would
contend with noisy dissonances from 'national' factions. Little by little,
the obstreperous ethnic voices would succumb to a deeply American ideal:
plangently wistful, white-note stuff, in a familiar
Copland/Bernstein/Sondheim vein - cf. the 'Somewhere' idyll in West Side
Story, for a start - but eventually finding themselves singing along with
the stalwart boy choristers (from St. Paul's, very good).
The wistfully innocent Big Tune was stamped upon our ears by innumerable
repetitions. Dissenting voices were rendered as mere sound and fury. I was
embarrassed to find my old 1960s paranoias about the US (its well-meaning
moral lust for world domination, its invincible ignorance about what moves
anybody else) so starkly confirmed.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Arts: European at heart - William Packer on the work of
American artist Thomas Eakins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The small but choice study at the National Portrait Gallery of the work of
American painter, Thomas Eakins, brings a significant artist to European
attention for the first time. That in itself is remarkable: for Eakins died
in 1916 aged 72, and though he spent all his working life in his native
Philadelphia and never cultivated a fashionable reputation, he has stood
high in American critical regard since at least the 1930s. A single work in
the collection of the Musee d'Orsay in Paris is the total of his success
abroad.
That this has been a great mistake and, from a European point of view, our
loss, is manifest from the work we now see. But the real problem, perhaps,
lies deeper. He was, after all, an artist of the generation of Sargent,
Whistler and Merrit Chase, who, like them, came to Europe and, in
particular, to Paris to study. It is clear from his work that he took full
advantage of his years away, acquainting himself not only with the work of
the old masters, particularly of Ribera and Velasquez, which he travelled to
Spain to see, but also that of his contemporaries. For Paris in the 1860s
was in a ferment of activity, with the growth of impressionism to set
against the academicism of the Salon, and a general social realism holding
the middle ground.
It is on this middle ground that Eakins takes his rightful place, to be
considered as a realist painter with his peers. For this reason, the quality
of his work needs to be seen in relation to that of his contemporaries in
France and elsewhere. Fantin-Latour, in his capacity as a portrait painter,
Carolus-Duran, and early Degas spring to mind, so too do John Millais for
his later portraits, and GF Watts and the German, Max Liebermann, the
Russian Ilya Repin, to say nothing of the young Sargent. Whether or not
Eakins knew of all these artists' work is not the point: clearly something
was in the air.
That he should then choose to return to America and never go abroad again
would hardly matter except that even now some people make an issue of it.
The very sub-title of this show obliquely raises the question: 'The Heart of
American Life'. The truth is that Eakins painted Americans because he was
living in America and his friends and sitters were American: he painted
rowers because he went rowing himself. The 'Heart' of life he was painting
was not American so much as his own, the commitment not so much
philosophical as circumstantial. His true character as a painter, for all
the apparent provincialism of his material, is far more cosmopolitan than
his apologists allow. Thank goodness he has come into his his proper place
on the international stage at last.
If his American condition has kept him back in reputation for so long, it is
America's fault - for we can hardly celebrate what we have not seen. Indeed,
with American art in general, there seem to be several critical and
emotional forces at work. Sometimes isolation is entered as a special plea,
the uniqueness of the work thus proved and the achievement left beyond
doubt: sometimes, as with the current survey of 20th century American Art at
the Royal Academy, selective myopia ignores the individual contribution and
relies upon a collective authority by which to claim an international
pre-eminence. Awkward Americans who go European, such as Sargent or
Whistler, Tobey or Kitaj, hard to place, are left aside. As in history, so
in art: America stands either quite alone; or first and still alone. The
choice is between an inflated reputation; no reputation at all; or, as in
Eakins' case, both at once.
Eakins is simply a very good painter who complements a somewhat dour eye
with a hand that is vigorous and active. He was evidently serious-minded,
his pictures tending towards the sombre, well thought-out and thoroughly
accomplished. He was particularly interested in the science of perspective,
and science and scientists in general. Yet the composition is always
unfussy, the drawing strong, the modelling firm, the surface of the paint
never dull or turgid. The essential 'manliness' of his work has been
remarked, and while too much should not be made of it, especially in
relation to the images of rowers, yachters, boxers and shooters, there is
most certainly a truth to it in principal, in the quality of its making.
But the greater strength is in the quality of his observation. A portrait is
always something more than an accretion of brush-strokes, and Eakins was a
wonderful painter of portraits, tender and sympathetic in his immediate
address, deep in his personal insight. He was clearly intrigued by
psychological states, and his sitters, men and women alike  - which is not
always the case - are never less than convincing in their preoccupations,
now melancholy, now reflective, now rapt in concentration. He is especially
good with women of a certain age, and ageing men.
He never worked to a fashionable clientele, but set himself, rather as Watts
did in England, to painting distinguished contemporaries - scientists,
artists, academics. The full-length portraits, on the grand scale yet
intimate, are all impressive: the concert singer, Weda Cook; the physicist,
Professor Roland; the surgeon, Dr Agnew; the brother-in-law, Louis Kenton.
Yet, as always, it is in the studies and sketches, heads and half-lengths,
close up and concentrated, the paint fresh and direct, that the truer
artist, the man himself, is revealed.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Arts: Much music making in Zurich - Ronald Crichton enjoys
Henze, Wagner and Verdi operas plus a Cecilia Bartoli recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not many European cities can offer an opera house as pleasant to visit as
Zurich's lakeside complex with its cosy, comfortable, main auditorium. Nor
can there be many where you can see three operas and a star recital in the
space of 10 days. A balance is maintained between the old repertory opera
and the stagione system with only one or two productions on show for longer
than most visitors stay.
New to Zurich was Nikolaus Lenhoff's production of the revised version of
Henze's Der Prinz von Homburg, described by Andrew Clark after the premiere
in Munich last year. This has been transferred, with (except for William
Cochran's authoritative Elector) a new cast and conductor. It was Luchino
Visconti who suggested to Henze an opera on Kleist's play about a dreamy,
impetuous soldier-prince at odds with the traditions of Prussian militarism.
Ingerborg Bachmann condensed the drama into a workable libretto, softening
the military aspect on the way.
When the opera was first given, at Hamburg in 1960 (yes, Homburg in Hamburg)
much stress was laid on the brevity and concision of Henze's new score
compared with the overflowing abundance of its predecessor, Konig Hirsch.
Indeed this short three-acter is not prolix and there is a Stravinskyan
pungency and economy. Yet coming back to Homburg after more than 30 years
the chief impression was of welcome re-immersion in Henze's early, luxurious
sound-world, poised somewhere between Konig Hirsch and the ballet Ondine
which followed soon after.
Gottfried Pilz's dignified single set, saved from monotony by the enchanted
lighting, uses a front gauze, right for the opening and closing scenes but
dulling some important action details, like the business of the laurel
wreath and the glove filched by the Prince from his beloved Princess
Natalie. Sights and sounds of war were so much played down as to be almost
unnoticeable.
The baritone Thomas Hampson is swiftly making the title-role in Homburg his
own. He may not have (few opera singers can claim this) the other-wordliness
concealing inner strength of the actor Gerard Philipe who so memorably
played the Prince in the TNP production of the play in Paris. Yet he is
elegant in bearing and movement, and he deals easily with Henze's
consciously Italianate vocal lines. Already Hampson gives a credible
portrait of a Hamlet-like dreamer with misdirected spurts of activity.
Otherwise, apart from Cochran's Elector, the best singing came from Martin
Zysset as the Horatio-figure, Count Hobenzollern. Eliahu Inbal conducted,
alert and sensitive but inclined to let the brass have its head.
The recitalist was the mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli, who already draws as
much applause when she appears on the platform as many singers do when they
leave it. A first half of Italian old masters and Mozart songs led up to his
'Parto, parto' from La clemenza di Tito. The second half, all Rossini, ended
with the rondo-finale from La cenerentola. Both big pieces were sung with
style, intelligence and the right weight of tone for the size of the house.
The Italian songs included some Paisiello, a composer for whom Bartoli
evidently has a penchant. More, please. Rossini brought five different
settings of some favourite lines by Metastasio, characterised with dazzling
clarity, also French songs in which, flashing eyes and pouting lips
notwithstanding, the words did not tell. Since they are miniature
narratives, this mattered. Gyorgy Fisher accompanied.
I was glad to catch the revival of Robert Wilson's 1991 Lohengrin with his
own Japanese-style abstract sets and stately, hieratic movements. The
treatment suits Wagner's phrase-lengths, slow tempi and extended time-scale
surprisingly well. Anja Silja's baleful, statuesque Ortrud, complete
mistress of the physical style, unobtrusively but firmly dominates the
stage. Her cry in the second act to her heathen gods, filled with rage,
envy, deep sadness and stifled guilt, was unforgettable. She had strong
support the from the wiry, tensely-projected Telramund of Rolf Haunstein.
Gosta Winbergh was a better-than-average Lohengrin, Gabrielle Lechner an
acceptable Elsa. A bald patch somewhere in the middle register conveyed the
girl's hesitations and anxieties rather well. Roland Hermann was a
first-rate Herald.
The conductor Ralf Weikert allowed the brass to play with a blatancy fully
justifying the rude things said about Wagner's loudness in the early days.
No such fault in Carlo Franci's polished, finely-controlled account of
Macbeth - and loud brass can be more conspicuous in Verdi than anywhere.
This was a revival of the 1985 staging by Grischa Asagaroff in Josef
Svovoda's ingenious hanging, swivelling panels of fly-chains. A strong
central couple: Simon Estes in splendid voice with a steely-voiced,
commanding Lady from Mara Zampieri. Laszlo Polgar was a good Banquo. The
final chorus was unusually satisfying and conclusive.

<TEXT>
A little bit of history has been made in London's West End Theatre with the
first Sunday opening, although some of the national newspaper critics chose
to boycott it, not because they are against Sunday theatre in principle but
because it seems that they prefer not to work on Sundays. There is no
suggestion, as yet, that Sunday openings will become a way of life. Sunday
performances, however, should add to the audience. There is after all Sunday
cinema, Sunday sport, Sunday shopping and Sunday practically everything
else. There is a more genuine dilemma for the actors who cannot be expected
to work a seven-day week. The answer may be to knock off on Mondays, as
happens in much of Europe. In New York Sunday openings are frequent.
For my part, I welcomed the London innovation at the civilised hour of 6pm,
which overcomes one of the nagging problems of theatregoing: whether to eat
before, afterwards or not at all. For most theatregoers 6pm is possible only
at weekends, and dinner comes after.
The guinea pig was Vita and Virgina at the Ambassadors. The two Vs are
Vita-Sackville West and Virginia Woolf. How you take to them depends on
whether you want to hear any more, and indeed old lines rehashed, about the
Bloomsbury Set. They sound remarkably precious and insular. Vita's comments
on her travels abroad, as the wife of the diplomatist Harold Nicolson, are
now distinctly embarrassing, especially on the US. And it is no longer
remotely shocking that two women should have had an affair. This must be one
of the best-known liaisons of the 20th century.
Nevertheless, the piece is very well done. It is written by Eileen Atkins
and drawn from the published letters. Atkins also plays Virgina; Penelope
Wilton is Vita. Here is a marvellous combination of actresses. Watch their
eyes where most of the movement takes place. Listen to the nuances of love
and sexual jealousy in their lines. Atkins is moody, intellectual and
introverted. Wilton is elegant, less clever but more passionate. They have a
very articulate script to work on: Bloomsbury may split hairs, but never
infinitives.
It is a good story, but whether it is much of a play I have some doubts.
Vita and Virginia is very repetitive and would be better performed without
an interval. , Wilton wilts, fluffing the odd line, towards the end. Atkins
is in some danger of becoming type cast as an ageing, harrowed woman.
Someone should give her a really funny part.
Patrick Garland directs the piece, as he did last year at the Chichester
Festival. What one would like to see is the two stars playing together in a
more contemporary script.

Messe Solonnelle (BBC2, 9.30) allows us to hear an important musical find.

FT  12 OCT 93 / People: Aitken Hume chief executive resigns
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ziad Idilby, the chairman and chief executive of Aitken Hume who was
appointed three years ago to resolve boardroom dissention, is to resign from
the banking group next month.
Idilby, aged 57, insisted his parting from Aitken Hume was entirely
amicable, and is based on the fact that the tasks he took on when he was
appointed have now been satisfactorily completed.
Over the past three years he has masterminded a wide-ranging rationalisation
programme which left the former international financial services group with
an indepenently chaired banking operation in the UK and Guernsey.
'I am pleased to say I have worked myself out of a job,' he said yesterday.
Aitken Hume has raised an estimated Pounds 26m net cash through disposals
including the US fund management subsidiary, National Securities &amp; Research
Corporation, and the financial services group Bachmann. It is now likely the
group will seek to return that cash to shareholders rather than use it for
acquisition or expansion.
Aitken Hume is more than 60 per cent controlled by the Said Trust, owned by
Syrian-born businessman, Mr Wafic Said, and Allied Group, a Hong Kong
financial conglomerate. Both shareholders are represented on the board,
although there has been speculation over the fate of two directors connected
to Allied following criticism of that company by Hong Kong regulators.

Roger Harrison, who has had wide managerial experience in the media, takes

Ronald Cohen became chairman after Apax Venture Capital took a major
shareholding in Sterling as backers of a management buyout.
Apax sold the final tranche of its original investment in January this year;
Cohen's resignation is as a result of that disposal.
Apart from being chief executive of The Observer and a council member of the

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Chris Clarke, below, has been appointed the new chairman of the Strategic
Planning Society, a charitable foundation of some 2,000 members, including
most of the publicly-quoted UK companies. The society's brief is to promote
strategic management in the widest sense.
Clarke, 44, is a vice-president of management consultants AT Kearney. His
particular expertise is in advising companies on mergers, acquisitions and
alliances.
He feels that one of his prime tasks is more clearly to demarcate the
distinct roles of the Confederation of British Industry or Institute of
Directors and that of his own society.
'Unlike the CBI or IOD, our focus is entirely on strategic thinking,' says
Clarke, an economics graduate from UMIST in Manchester.
Clarke started his career as a brand manager with Barker &amp; Dobson, the
confectioners who once produced a famous comestible called the Everton mint,
which featured a soft centre - something Clarke hopes the society will
avoid.
His view is that the society needs to raise its public profile, since
'although we are well known among the corporate sector we need to have a
bigger influence on government. I hope we will reach a point where the
society becomes recognised as providing 'thought leadership''.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Business and the Law: A revealing dilemma - When should
company secrets be made public in EC competition investigations?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CELIA HAMPTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When European companies are faced with a competition investigation by the
European Commission, they have two interests that are often at odds with
each other. On the one hand, they need as much detailed information about
the allegations against them as they can find. On the other, they want to
keep their own commercial information secret from other companies,
especially their competitors.
This issue of when a business secret should be protected by the Commission
and when it should be disclosed is a matter of debate among competition
lawyers.
In general terms, the secrecy accorded to information is in inverse
proportion to the right of access to the Commission's case file: if the
right of access is increased, the right to protect commercial information is
correspondingly reduced, and vice versa.
By definition, two or more companies - usually competitors - are involved
when the Commission is investigating suspected cartels or collusion. All
companies involved have equal rights both of access and of secrecy. This
results in a conflict of principle. In practice, it may be resolved by the
Commission deleting sensitive information before letting other companies see
documents. But there must be criteria for allowing a deletion, since there
are bound to be cases where other companies have a legitimate claim to see
the sensitive information.
When differences arise, the Commission has to resolve them. It has been told
by the European Court to make a decision that can be appealed there and then
if it decides to disclose a company's business secrets to a company that is
not one of those under investigation.
It is possible that the Court would extend this principle in future to cover
disclosure of information to co-defendants.
Meanwhile, the Commission's refusal to reveal evidence to a particular
company, or its disclosure of evidence when it should not have done so, may
in general only be remedied by annulment of the Commission's final decision
by the European Court of First Instance.
This court is a new force in EC competition law. It takes its duty to
scrutinise procedure seriously. In several cases it has been willing to
strike down a Commission decision because of procedural irregularities. This
is creating a fully fledged legal control of Commission procedure.
The procedural law emerging as a result was reviewed at a seminar organised
in Brussels by the Commission's competition directorate, DG IV, at the end
of last month.
Access to the Commission's case file emerged as the single most contentious
issue. It seems certain to be raised before the CFI before long.
The Commission obtains a great deal of documentary evidence - agreements,
letters, memoranda, notes of meetings, etc - in the course of an
investigation. Companies have little power to resist its broad powers of
seizure, provided it acts lawfully and within its powers.
When the Commission comes to examine the evidence and compile its case
against the company, the process becomes adversarial: the Commission acts as
prosecutor. The company being investigated must be able to defend itself. It
is entitled to know the nature of the charges against it. Access to the file
by companies directly concerned is required by case law as part of their
rights of defence.
The extent of these rights depends on their nature, which was strongly
disputed at DG IV's seminar. Mr G Vandersanden, of Brussels law firm De
Backer &amp; Associes, said the rights of defence existed as a matter of law.
They were not in the gift of the Commission, to be granted in its discretion
on a case-by-case basis.
Mr Peter Duffy, an English barrister, went further. He argued that they were
the fundamental rights to fair trial guaranteed by the European Convention
on Human Rights. Although the Commission is an administrative rather than a
judicial body, the heavy fines that it may impose (up to 10 per cent of
worldwide turnover) are sufficiently serious to give the procedure a penal
character. As a penal procedure, the human rights convention would apply, he
said.
Dr Klaus Ehlermann, EC director-general of competition, did not accept that
the human rights convention applied to the Commission's competition
procedures. But, even if it did, he argued, an administrative procedure
would be evaluated in a fundamentally different way from a criminal
procedure. Also the convention's application to companies should be
fundamentally different from its application to individuals.
Mr David Vaughan QC, took the view that countervailing interests, such as
business secrecy, would almost invariably fall into a lower category of
protection than a right of defence. They could not be put forward as a
reason to deprive a company of its right to defend itself.
The first question that needs to be answered is: what is the file? This is
far from clear. If it consists only of the Commission's statement of
objections against the defendant companies and their replies, no one could
object to its disclosure to all parties.
The file is now generally understood to mean the information in the
Commission's possession on which it is basing a particular case. This may
include vital commercial information about a company. A company's
co-defendants are among the people to whom it would least like to show this
information.
There was no consensus at DG IV's seminar on the underlying legal principles
governing secrecy. The discussion was confined to companies' proprietary
information which could not in principle be disclosed to a wider public.
Disclosure to a competitor complaining to the Commission, rather than being
investigated by it, raises a parallel issue.
Mr Fernando Pombo, of Madrid law firm Gomez-Acebo &amp; Pombo, analysed the
legislation and the principles underlying the scant case law on the subject.
He reasoned that the use of information collected by the Commission was
always restricted in a general sense because the information was
'confidential'.
Information concerning a company that was not public knowledge came within
the category of 'professional secrecy'. The Commission had a duty not to
disclose it except in specified circumstances, which might override a claim
to secrecy by the company affected.
'Business secrets' were a sub-category of professional secrets which could
not be disclosed to anyone without the consent of the company to which the
information related. Such information included industrial property,
information on prices, costs and sales, product development details and
investment plans.
Mr Julian Joshua of DG IV disagreed with Mr Pombo. He argued that
professional secrecy depends not on the nature of the information, but on
the quality of the person holding it.
The degree of disagreement among lawyers on the basic principles affecting
information in the Commission's hands was unexpected, and it seems certain
that, before long, these issues will end up being litigated.
Open dialogue between the Commission and those involved in its procedures is
clearly a good idea. It would be even better if, the next time DG IV debates
the issue, it invites those most closely affected, the corporate in-house
lawyers.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Business and the Law: Pensions and equal pay - European
Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice gave judgment last week in the first of a
batch of cases on the effect on pension schemes of the equal pay principle
in Community law.
The common thread running through the cases was the precise effect of the
Barber judgment. Although the cases were joined and there was a 'joint'
opinion on them by Advocate General Van Gerven, the Court decided to rule on
the first case alone. This left a number of issues with which the Court must
still deal.
However, an important question arising out of the Barber decision has now
been answered.
The case on which the Court ruled concerned Mr Ten Oever and his deceased
wife. Prior to her death, his wife, who had worked in the cleaning trade,
had paid into a collective occupational pension fund, jointly financed by
employers and workers. Until January 1 1989, the pension fund made provision
only for a widow's pension. Mr Ten Oever's wife died in 1988. Mr Ten Oever
applied for a widower's pension, but his application was rejected on the
ground that, when his wife died, the pension fund rules did not provide for
such a pension. Mr Ten Oever then brought an action before the Dutch courts,
alleging the refusal was contrary to the equal pay provisions in the Rome
Treaty. The Dutch court referred two questions to the European Court.
The first was whether the payment of a widower's pension fell within the
Rome Treaty provisions on equal pay. The Court reiterated that the concept
of 'pay' comprised any consideration in cash or in kind, whether immediate
or future, provided the worker received it, albeit indirectly, in respect of
his employment. The fact, thus, that certain benefits were paid after the
termination of the employment relationship did not prevent those benefits
from falling within the concept of 'pay' in the Treaty. Thus, said the
Court, Mr Ten Oever's widower's pension did fall within Treaty equal pay
provisions. The fact that, by definition, the pension would not be paid to
the worker but to the spouse was irrelevant. The point was the pension had
been acquired in the employment relationship and was paid to the surviving
spouse in respect of the deceased spouse's employment.
The second question related to the temporal effects of the Barber judgment.
The Barber case held that occupational pension schemes fell within the scope
of the equal pay provisions of the Rome Treaty. But because of the huge
financial implications of the judgment, the Court decided individuals could
not rely on the relevant Treaty provisions before the date of the judgment -
May 17 1990.
The question before the Court in the present case was the extent of this
restriction. Did it mean only those workers who became paying members of an
occupational scheme after May 17 1990 would be entitled to rely on the
Treaty provisions? Or, did it mean all pension payments made after May 17
1990 would be covered, irrespective of the date of the periods of employment
in which the pension rights were accrued? The Court held the principle of
equal pay should apply only to benefits payable in respect of periods of
employment after May 17 1990, except in the case of workers or those
claiming under them who had before that date initiated legal proceedings or
introduced an equivalent claim under national law.
The Court was no doubt aware of the warning given by Advocate General Van
Gerven that a different conclusion would be superseded when the Maastricht
Treaty came into force.
The Court still has to deal with issues raised by the other cases. These
include whether the Barber ruling applies to occupational pension schemes
other than those envisaged in that case; whether the use of actuarial
calculation factors differing according to sex is contrary to the Rome
Treaty provisions on equal pay; and whether the same provisions can be
relied upon against the trustees of an occupational scheme.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Business and the Law: Litigation too costly and futile, says
Bingham - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Thomas Bingham, Master of the Rolls in the UK, has attacked the cost and
delay in litigation in countries such as Britain, the US and Australia. He
said that judges and lawyers in these countries, which share a common
approach to law, were talking of 'a crisis of epic proportions'.
Sir Thomas told an audience of judges and lawyers at the Centre of Advanced
Litigation, Nottingham Law School, last Friday, that much legal activity was
costly and futile.
'One very often sees actions come to the Court of Appeal where one feels
dismay - I would use coarser language - about how a case has been handled.'
He said that litigation, like complex surgery, would always be expensive,
and for much the same reasons.
The Master of the Rolls said he was trying to make the Queen's Bench
Division, which handles large contract and tort disputes, more efficient by
introducing the judge-directed timetables which have been so effective in
the Commercial and Official Referees' (construction) courts.

FT  12 OCT 93 / People: Broad-based team for new science council
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The new Council for Science and Technology, which will advise the government
on scientific issues of 'strategic national importance', was named
yesterday.
It is chaired by William Waldegrave, the minister for science, with Bill
Stewart, the government's chief scientist, as deputy chairman.
The other 10 members are a strong blend of research managers from industry
and universities.
The prime minister launched the CST with a statement that he would regard it
as 'an important source of independent expert advice.'
If so, it will be more influential than its predecessor, the Advisory
Council for Science and Technology, which produced worthy reports that made
little impact in Whitehall.
The replacement of ACOST with the higher-powered CST was one of the measures
promised in the government's white paper on science in May.
The most powerful businessman on CST is Richard Sykes, chief executive of
Glaxo, who controls Britain's largest corporate research budget.
Glaxo expects to spend Pounds 850m on next year on R&amp;D - only Pounds 250m
less than the government's own research councils.
Other industrial members are: Sir Robin Nicholson, research director of
Pilkington, the glass manufacturer (and chief scientific adviser to Mrs
Thatcher from 1983 to 1985); Sir Ralph Robins, chairman of Rolls-Royce and
head of the Defence Industries Council; Alan Rudge, British Telecom's
managing director of development and procurement; John Towers, group
managing director of British Aerospace's Rover subsidiary; and Peter
Williams, chairman of Oxford Instruments.
CST's academic contingent is somewhat smaller: Sushantha Bhattacharyya,
professor of manufacturing systems at Warwick University; Sir Aaron Klug,
director of the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology;
Bridget Ogilvie, director of the Wellcome Trust, the largest UK research
charity; and Stewart Sutherland, vice-chancellor of the University of London
(and a philosopher by training - the only CST member without a science or
engineering background).
The council is expected to convene for the first time within the next month
and then to meet about four times a year.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Selective reading -
Charles Batchelor samples the latest crop of business books
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Who has time to read even a fraction of the business books which pour from
the publishers' presses every month? Small business owners are particularly
reluctant to trust the printed word when it comes to seeking advice.
And yet, the well-written manual can provide short-cuts and act as a
valuable source of reference. Recent publications have addressed a number of
important issues, some highly topical, some perennial, including quality,
the single European market, customer care and finance.
If any area of business management could be dismissed as the art of the
blindingly obvious, then customer service would come at the top of the list.
Yet for all the self-evident nature of the need to treat your customers
well, this is the one area where many businesses are particularly inept.
The Golden Rules of Customer Care by Carl Sewell and Paul B. Brown (Business
Books, 175 pages, Pounds 15.99, paperback Pounds 8.99) treats its subject in
an instructive and entertaining fashion. Sewell, who runs a Cadillac
dealership in Texas, calculates that a satisfied customer will spend Dollars
332,000 (Pounds 218,000) over a lifetime on cars and servicing. Once you
realise a sale is not a one-off transaction, then it makes sense to keep
customers happy, says Sewell.
Start by asking your customers what they want. When Sewell surveyed his, he
found they valued convenience above price, so he extended his opening hours
and provided a free car while the customer's was being repaired.
Sewell says he cannot guarantee to be the cheapest repair shop around, but
he makes sure customers feel happy by ensuring that the bill always comes in
under the estimate. This involves making an accurate assessment of the
likely cost and building in a buffer of 10 per cent.
He also takes service as far as offering a free call-out to fix a flat tyre
or replace a broken car key. Very few people abuse this sort of service and
the payback in terms of creating loyal customers is well worth it.
Not that saying please and smiling will ensure that the job is done right
the first time. Only having tight operating and financial controls and
well-chosen, motivated staff can achieve that.
This story is that of a car dealer but his advice could be applied to other
sectors. Sewell even has an answer for the sceptics who ask: does the author
practise what he preaches and if he is so smart, why isn't he rich? He does
and he is.
Guides to the workings of the European Community are plentiful, but the
particular advantage of Into the Single Market by Jon Marks (Middle East
Economic Digest, 80 pages, Pounds 24.95.) is the clarity of its lay-out.
However, the decision not to include an index reduces its value as a quick
reference book.
The Community is developing so rapidly that any guide has only a short
shelf-life. The names, addresses and telephone numbers which make up a
valuable part of this handbook are particularly prone to obsolescence.
But the book gives an admirably complete explanation of the Community's
history, institutions and systems. What are the structural funds, the
cohesion fund and the convergence programmes? Community-speak is larded with
terms bleached of much of their meaning by translators.
One section of this book explains how the EC evolved to its present state,
while another goes into the details of doing business in the EC, coping with
issues such as the harmonisation of standards, taxation and public
procurement.
The author also looks at sectors such as energy and the environment,
agriculture and the financial system.
Not as narrowly focused as its title suggests, The Quality Management Manual
by Jenny Waller, Derek Allen and Andrew Burns (Kogan Page, 206 pages, Pounds
24.95), does explain how to write the manual required by formal quality
systems, but it also provides a general introduction to the subject of
quality.
It also contains a wealth of case histories of how companies are coming to
grips with the question of quality. For some companies introducing quality
assurance revealed quite startling gaps in the management procedures.
The authors make clear that they are not providing an off-the-shelf quality
manual. Quality management systems must be tailored to the needs of the
individual organisation, they warn.
Most companies will use a book of this sort on the road to achieving BS
5750, the British quality assurance standard, and its international
equivalent ISO 9000, but it should also prove of value to companies which do
not want the rigours and expense of formal registration.
A quality manual serves a double purpose, the authors point out. It is both
a symbol of a company's commitment to quality - though one which will be
closely scrutinised by the certification company's assessors - and a
practical reference book for staff. It should not be a dry, technical
document, but be designed to be attractive and easy to use.
The Business of Factoring by David Hawkins (McGraw Hill, 247 pages, Pounds
35) combines a practical guide for managers on how and when to use factoring
and invoice discounting, with a critical review of the state of the
industry.
Factoring provides cash against a company's invoices and can represent a
flexible method of raising finance in situations where the bank manager is
unwilling to grant or increase an overdraft. It has not completely shed a
down-market image acquired in the 1960s, but has grown in popularity in
recent years.
This book provides a jargon-free account of how factoring and invoice
discounting work for the client company. But it should also be read in the
boardrooms of the banks which own most of the big factoring companies.
The banks have tended to regard it as a peripheral activity which competes
with their main business of providing overdraft and loan finance. They have
therefore not developed factoring as aggressively as they could have done,
Hawkins suggests.
This might not matter to anyone but the banks' shareholders. But factoring
could prove a valuable additional source of finance to businesses recovering
from the recession, particularly if the banks are more cautious about
extending loans to small businesses.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Start-ups highest since
1990 - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly 107,000 new businesses started up in the second quarter of 1993, the
largest number since the final three months of 1990 and 23 per cent more
than in the same period of 1992, according to the latest edition of Barclays
Bank's Small Business Bulletin.
New starts were still outnumbered by closures, though at 130,000 these were
14 per cent lower than in the second quarter of 1992.
In the first six months of the year, new starts rose 14 per cent to nearly
237,000. This increase reflected improving business optimism encouraged by
low interest rates, falling inflation and the competitiveness of sterling's
exchange rate.
Barclays said it did not expect this rate of improvement to be maintained
throughout 1993. It estimates that new starts this year will reach about
400,000, nearly 10 per cent more than in 1992.
The most buoyant regions in the first half were East Anglia and the
north-west of England.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Taxman tightens grip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ten months into the European single market, many companies are still
struggling to comply with the complexities of the new value added tax (VAT)
regime.
UK Customs &amp; Excise, for one, has given businesses a breathing space to get
used to the new system but will start to tighten up in 1994.
What should companies be doing to ensure that when this happens they are not
caught out? VAT specialists suggest:
Check the accuracy of the sales and trade data you are filing to customs.
You will not want to go back over several months of figures if the VATman
challenges your numbers.
Check that you are only making VAT-free exports to VAT-registered customers.
If you discover later that a customer is not VAT-registered you will be
required to pay VAT on those sales.
Confirm that you have appointed a VAT representative where appropriate in
countries where you make substantial sales to customers not registered for
VAT or you could incur local penalties and a VAT liability. The threshold
levels vary.
'The fixed penalties pale into insignificance compared with the cost of
having to pay VAT of 17.5 per cent on sales when you did not expect it,'
comments John Arnold, tax partner at accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
But VAT is not the only area where businesses should review matters.
Companies may be failing to exploit the operational benefits of the single
market.
Businesses should consider whether they cannot reduce their stock levels to
take account of faster delivery times in the new barrier-free market.
They should review their transport costs to see if their shippers have
passed on all or any of the benefits of the faster delivery times.
They should reduce the size of what are known as deferment guarantees
provided by their banks now there is no longer a need to cover a VAT
liability on EC imports.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Technology: Going for gold in the computer race - At next
February's winter Olympics computers will ease the load of TV and radio
commentators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the global drama centring on the decision to site the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney rather than Beijing, Berlin or Manchester, the next winter Olympics
will take place in the quietest and most unassuming of venues - the little
town of Lillehammer in Norway.
With most of the construction finished - one stadium has been blasted out
inside a hill, another built like an upturned Viking ship - there is little
of the usual last-minute panic and controversy. All should function with
Nordic efficiency when the 2,000 athletes, the 100,000 or so daily
spectators and 6,000 media representatives descend on the area in February.
For winter sports addicts, the games will be a must. Those who cannot be
there will be glued to their television screens or radios. But however rapt
their attention, it will be nothing compared with the concentration required
by the commentators.
In many cases, they, too, will be staring at screens - on computers as well
as TV monitors. As part of its technological contribution to the 1994 winter
Olympics, IBM has developed a touch-screen system of constantly updated data
about timings, rankings and biographies of the events as they take place.
Called the Commentator Information System and based on a more limited
service provided at last year's Barcelona summer games, it provides
real-time information to people who have never been trained on the system.
'TV and sports commentators expect to come in five minutes before an event
starts, sit down and work on the system,' says Erik Andersen, senior
consultant at A/S EDB, a Norwegian computer company which is working with
IBM on CIS. 'There is no possibility of any time for training.'
The system is easy to use. Commentators touch the screen with a finger or
pen to reveal a list of sports, their participants and how they are
performing. Results information is fed in directly from the timing system of
Seiko of Japan.
With an expected global TV audience of around 2.5bn people, IBM has tried to
make it as simple as possible to report on one or more sports - on the spot
or at another site - using information visible on both the TV and computer
screen. 'Our main challenge is the stopwatch,' adds Andersen. 'This is the
1990s and the solution is computers.'
The first thing the commentator will see on the IBM screen is a sparkling
winter scene of a skier slicing though the snow in front of a clump of
trees. A touch of the screen reveals a display of all sports at the games
with their official pictograms. An event held locally is shown in green,
those at distant venues in blue.
Three languages can be selected, the official Olympic ones of English and
French and the host country's Norwegian. Curiously, the German language,
important in winter sports, is not on the system. It could be, says
Andersen, but the International Olympic Committee specifies only three;
German, Austrian and Swiss commentators will have to rely on their
linguistic abilities.
When the event is chosen on the IBM screen, the list of athletes is shown.
In the case of the biathlon, for example, commentators can check on who is
starting, who has finished, what the rankings are during this combined
cross-country skiing and shooting event, and how stragglers compare with
leaders. Athletes of any country can be highlighted and biographies called
up.
TV sports reporters will not need starting lists as all athletes will be on
screen. If anything unusual happens, such as a disqualification, this will
be described. To switch to another sport, the user will have to return to
the original pictogram display; it will not be possible to shuffle between
sports without doing this or follow two events on a split screen.
Even so, CIS is likely to be a big help, especially when combined with Info
94, IBM's Olympic Information System which will store all news about events,
ceremonies and athletes throughout the games. Data will be wiped from the
screens at the 800 CIS stations around the games at the end of each day, but
be stored in Info 94 for viewing on separate terminals in the venues, press
and broadcasting centres and hotels.
The biggest user of CIS will be CBS, the US TV channel which is sending
around 1,000 people to Lillehammer. Both CBS and Norwegian TV will use the
system to produce graphics. Another important user will be Britain's BBC.
'Most TV companies want to send as few commentators as possible and comment
on as many sports as possible,' says Andersen.
Although the IBM system will help both the best and the least expert
journalists, he does not believe CIS will narrow the gap in skills between
them.
'Good commentators stand out anyway, as they tell you things the system
can't tell you,' he says. There will still be plenty of scope for the usual
flow of anecdotes, jokes or criticism.
Although final contracts have still to be signed, IBM expects the system to
be used at the Atlanta summer games in 1996 and the next winter Olympics in
Nagano, Japan. Maybe a few jokes and stories will have been worked into the
computer to liven up those inevitable dull moments when the weather takes a
hand.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Technology: A serious investment - Rob Causey counts the
cost of building today's chip plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROB CAUSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All businesses are under pressure to cut costs, but the problem is
particularly acute in the Dollars 70bn (Pounds 46bn) semiconductor market. A
new computer chip factory needs an investment of up to Dollars 1bn and only
the largest and most profitable players can afford this. Thus medium-sized
semiconductor companies have been changing the way they make chips in order
to stay at the leading edge of technology without paying this vast bill.
In April, Intel, the world's largest chip supplier, announced it would
invest Dollars 1bn in a plant in New Mexico to start production in 1995. Its
US rivals, Advanced Micro Devices, Motorola and Texas Instruments, have all
followed suit over the past six months.
Such large sums have caused even the large Japanese companies to worry about
making a return on their investment. Takao Nakano, general manager of
Mitsubishi Electric's Kumamoto plant, said earlier this year that R&amp;D
investment to produce leading-edge memory devices would rise from 9 per cent
of sales in 1991 to 20 per cent of sales in 2000, if current trends
continued. Investment on production equipment would rise from 13 per cent to
70 per cent of sales over the same period, he predicted.
Gordon Moore, chairman of Intel, put it more bluntly. 'The entry fee to be a
major player in the global semiconductor market of the 1990s is Dollars 1bn,
payable in advance.' This has led even the largest chip companies to form
alliances, such as those between IBM, Toshiba and Siemens, AMD and
Hewlett-Packard, and NEC and AT&amp;T, to share the cost.
The medium-sized companies, which in the chip business means anyone with
sales of less than Dollars 2bn, do not have these options. Micron Technology
of the US has traditionally competed at the leading edge of the memory
business, but had sales of only Dollars 557m last year. Its president, Steve
Appleton, has the problem of keeping up without paying the Dollars 1bn
price.
'You have to target your R&amp;D money,' he says. 'If I give you a shovel and
tell you to dig a 1 sq ft hole, and you come back to me and say it's a bit
tough, will it help if I say: 'Okay, here's 100 more people to help you dig
a 1ft hole'?'
The manufacture of semiconductors is a complex process, involving both
printing and baking. A round piece of silicon, or wafer, is put into an oven
and a layer of silicon oxide baked on to its surface. Some of the chip's
circuit patterns are then printed on to the oxide and the oxide around these
patterns is etched away. Chemicals are then burned into the silicon surface.
This process is repeated, with more circuit elements built up on top, until
the chip is finished.
Each stage requires a specialised piece of equipment, costing about Dollars
4m and adding up to about Dollars 600m of the Dollars 1bn total. One way to
cut the cost of the factory is to buy less equipment; a number of companies
have been working on ways of making more chips with fewer machines.
When Appleton talks about targeting R&amp;D money, he means using as few
printing stages or 'masks' as possible. To make 4Mbit memories, Micron uses
11 masks; some rivals use 21. 'I get twice the output for the same piece of
equipment, because I only have to process a wafer for half the time.'
A Dutch company, ASM Lithography, which makes printing machines (steppers),
is helping to cut equipment costs. Its latest steppers are designed to allow
the lenses that focus the circuit image on the wafer to be replaced when new
technology becomes available. This means companies do not have to buy new
steppers every time technology advances.
Another Dollars 250m of the Dollars 1bn goes on air conditioning. The
circuit designs on most wafers are so small that a microscopic piece of dust
can cause a short circuit. Thus the air has to be extremely clean. ASM's
steppers blow inert gas on to the centre of each wafer. As this gas flows to
the edge of the wafer, it carries dirt away with it, preventing damage to
the circuits.
This technique allows wafers to be kept clean inside machines which
themselves are not standing in the cleanest part of the plant. The chip
maker can then reduce the amount of air cleaned to the highest standard and
keep costs down.
SGS-Thomson Microelectronics has just started making chips at a plant near
Grenoble in France which, when completed, will have cost Dollars 500m and
have 3,400 sq m of floor space at so-called 'class one' cleanliness. AMD's
new Texas facility, with the same output, will use about 8,000 sq m of
'class one' cleanroom and cost twice as much.
Chipmakers are taking this approach further and creating
'mini-environments'. This involves moving the wafers around in an airtight
box, only opened inside the machine. The whole factory does not have to be
kept so clean.
Lloyd Doyle, manager of IBM's East Fishkill plant in New York state,
believes chip making costs will remain high. 'If you're asking me if a
state-of-the-art fab (fabrication plant) costs between Dollars 500m and
Dollars 750m, I'd say yes. But there are ways of getting more devices for
your money.'

FT  12 OCT 93 / BR freight unit sale deplored
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS to privatise British Rail's freight business could inhibit the
development of a competitive market in rail freight, it was claimed
yesterday.
The Freight on Rail group, which represents the rail freight industry and
its customers, said government plans to create three companies to handle
bulk freight would create powerful regional monopolies and deter the entry
of private-sector operators.
The government wants to sell off Trainload Freight, BR's bulk freight
subsidiary, as three regionally-based companies which would be able to
compete with each other.
Freight on Rail said the contracts these companies would inherit and their
control over locomotives and other assets would give them a dominant market
position.
'The government has been concerned to make the companies profitable for
sale,' said Mr Mike Harvey, chairman of the Private Wagon Federation. 'To
us, they look to be unassailable.'
Freight on Rail also criticised the government's decision to retain
Railfreight Distribution (RfD), BR's freight distribution company, in public
ownership until services through the Channel tunnel are established. This
would leave RfD with preferential access to the limited number of Channel
tunnel slots allocated to freight trains, squeezing out new private-sector
operators, the group said.
It would also allow RfD to take business from private-sector companies which
already carry some rail freight. Freight on Rail said a new joint venture
involving RfD is already bidding for car distribution business traditionally
carried on private-sector wagons.
The group wants BR's rolling stock to be handed over to the leasing
companies that will take over passenger wagons, so that they can be leased
to all potential operators.
'The government cannot assume that the private sector will automatically
throw itself into expanding rail freight,' said Mr Harvey. 'If it sells off
the companies with monopoly rights, the customer will not get the benefits
of choice and competition.'

FT  12 OCT 93 / Training targets 'may not be met'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE PEOPLE need to take part in education and training if national targets
are to be met, the Institute of Manpower Studies has warned.
The targets, some of which stretch into the next century, were set by the
Confederation of British Industry and endorsed by the government. Low levels
of technical attainment have contributed to the UK declining to 13th place
in the ranking of world competitiveness.
The targets are criticised in a report prepared by the institute for the
Department of Employment. It says the targets are not incorporated in a
coherent national strategy and have a poor public profile.
The report also says that the deliverers of the targets, including Training
and Education Councils and the education sector, are not working in close
partnership.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Kent and Essex compete for EC aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARTS of London and southern England have been selected for the first time
by the government as areas which ought to be eligible for European grant
aid.
Islington, Tower Hamlets, Newham and Hackney and parts of other London
boroughs, as well as areas of Kent, Essex and Sussex, and parts of cities
including Portsmouth and Plymouth are included on the list of places for
which the government is seeking designation on the European Structural Funds
map.
The government also wants the European Commission to make aid available to
rural areas including parts of Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, the Peak District
and the Yorkshire Moors and Dales.
The European Commission is reviewing which areas should be designated
Objective 2, which covers industrial and urban areas, and Objective 5b,
which applies to rural areas. The new map takes effect from January.
The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday published the list, submitted
last week to the EC, of places it wants on the new map.
Under the existing map Objective 2 covered 35.6 per cent of the UK
population, and Objective 5b, 2.7 per cent. The submission, if approved,
would raise these to 41.2 per cent and 4.9 per cent respectively.
However, EC regional policy commissioner Mr Bruce Millan has said the new
Objective 2 map should cover not more than 16 per cent of the EC's
population in total. Proposals already received from other countries would,
if approved, boost the map's coverage to 22 per cent.
This has raised concerns that inclusion of parts of southern England could
be to the detriment of the traditional industrial areas.
Yesterday areas put forward for inclusion for the first time expressed their
delight.
Tower Hamlets said: 'We're very pleased with this. We were bitterly
disappointed earlier this year when we didn't get assisted-area status from
the government.'
The EC has allocated its members a total of Pounds 10.7bn for Objective 2
grants between next year and 1999, and Pounds 4.17bn for Objective 5b. These
cover up to 50 per cent of the cost of regeneration projects.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, said the Objective 2 list included
places suffering high unemployment and industrial dereliction. The
significant increase in Objective 5b coverage was possible, he said, because
of the Highlands and Islands 'promotion' to Objective 1 - the category for
regions lagging behind in development, and because of the increased
Structural Funds allocation agreed by the EC last year.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Proportion of graduates finding jobs hits 20-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SMALLEST proportion of graduates for 20 years had found employment by
the end of last year, official figures indicate today.
Of those students whose destination was known, only 51 per cent (44.7 per
cent of the total) had entered some form of employment by the end of 1992.
The figures are compiled from returns from all colleges and universities,
including those which were polytechnics until last year.
Total graduate unemployment at the end of last year was 12.9 per cent - up
from 11.5 per cent in 1990-91 and only 5.5 per cent in 1988-89. More women
(33,255) found jobs than men (32,881), although they accounted for only 47.8
per cent of graduates.
A far higher proportion of women than men entered teacher training (6.2 per
cent compared with 2.4 per cent), meaning that total female graduate
unemployment was only 10.6 per cent compared with male unemployment of 15.1
per cent.
The Equal Opportunities Commission said this confirmed a trend which had
been identified in several surveys, showing that male employment had been
hardest hit by the recession.
The fall in graduates moving directly into jobs was partly offset by
increased popularity for further research and training courses.
Fears of a teacher shortage, widely broadcast by teacher training bodies,
were allayed by a 17.7 per cent rise in entry to teacher training courses,
which followed a 30 per cent rise the year before.
The number of graduates finding a job rose by 5.6 per cent, but this was
overshadowed by an increase of 9.7 per cent in the total number of students
taking their first degree. Graduate unemployment is higher for the 'new'
universities, which were polytechnics until last year, at 16.9 per cent,
compared with 10.6 per cent for the 'old' universities.
However, even the old universities are experiencing unemployment at double
the rate of 1988 (5.3 per cent). The employment rate for graduates from
higher-education colleges fell last year for the fourth successive year.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Westland in Pounds 250m Hercules parts deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTLAND, the British helicopter manufacturer, has received a significant
boost to its non-helicopter business with a Pounds 250m order to supply
parts for C-130 Hercules transport aircraft made by Lockheed of the US.
The deal to supply nacelles to house the aircraft's four turboprop engines
could eventually be worth Pounds 1bn to the UK company.
The initial contract, starting in 1995, will cover the next 180 Hercules
sold by Lockheed. Westland will become the sole source of nacelles for the
C-130H variant, now in production, and the new C-130J, which Lockheed hopes
to sell to the UK and other countries as a replacement for existing Hercules
fleets.
Westland said sales of 700 were expected for the new model. The deal covers
product support and upgrading business for earlier Hercules variants,
involving up to 1,400 aircraft.
The contract was won by Westland's aerospace division, based at Cowes on the
Isle of Wight, which is predominantly geared to making components for civil
airliners.
Westland said it would help to offset the impact of recession in the civil
aircraft market but was not expected to lead to extra jobs. Although design
and assembly would be undertaken at Cowes, much of the work would be
contracted out.
The C-130 Hercules, first introduced in the 1950s, has held its place as the
standard workhorse for most Nato air forces. More than 2,000 are in service
with 65 countries worldwide.
The new version is favourite to replace the RAF's current Hercules fleet, on
which a decision is due next year. British Aerospace, however, is
campaigning for the UK to commit itself with six other European nations to a
new joint aircraft programme known as Euroflag.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Leyland to open learning centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEYLAND TRUCKS is to establish a Pounds 430,000 open learning centre for the
unemployed on its Lancashire site.
It will cater for former employees of Leyland Daf, the collapsed Netherlands
automotive group from which the truckmaker was rescued by a management
buy-out in June.
The centre, due to open in the next few weeks, will also be used by Leyland
Trucks' staff, as well as employees of other companies wanting to improve
their engineering skills. It is expected to handle about 70 trainees a day.
The centre is being funded by Lancashire Area West Training and Enterprise
Council from a Pounds 1.2m government grant to support local engineering
partnerships, in which the public and private sectors work on improving
skills.
About 40 companies are set to take places at the centre, where Leyland
Trucks will also run courses in 'lean' enterprise. These will aim to improve
management productivity, using methods used by Leyland Trucks, which has
reduced seven layers of supervisory management to two - cutting costs by
Pounds 10m a year. The company has 620 staff.
Mr John Gilchrist, Leyland Trucks' chief executive, said yesterday:
'Challenging market circumstances overwhelmed our former parent company, but
created here one of the leanest manufacturing operations in the European
automotive industry. Now we aim to share our experience with a wider group.'

FT  12 OCT 93 / Voters cool on council reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOTERS in Derbyshire and Durham have delivered an embarrassing rebuff to the
English local government review.
People in both counties told MORI pollsters working for the
government-appointed Local Government Commission that they preferred the
status quo of two-tier county and district councils to the commission's
proposals for reform.
Last month Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, told the commission
that he expected it to recommend a change from the present tiers of local
government to unitary authorities even if that involved extra costs in some
cases. The findings appear to bolster the view of the Labour-controlled
Association of County Councils that the case for change has not been made.
The commission, chaired by Sir John Banham, had advocated creating two
unitary authorities in each county. But in Durham 56 per cent favoured the
status quo. Nine per cent favoured the commission's recommendation, with 39
per cent supporting the principle of unitary authorities.
Derbyshire produced a less clear-cut result, with 39 per cent giving the
status quo as their first preference. Second with 11 per cent was the
commission's recommendation of two unitary authorities.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Coal pledges still not implemented
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN six months after publishing a white paper on the future of coal,
the government has still to implement the document's most significant
proposals.
Tomorrow is the anniversary of the announcement of pit closures by Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, which caused an outcry and
the apparent change in policy outlined in the white paper.
However, with the 12 pits reprieved in the white paper under renewed threat
of closure the government has yet to fulfil white paper promises to:
Take forward as a 'matter of urgency' its consultations with electricity
generators about strategic coal stocks. Provide subsidies for British Coal
and private operators to sell additional coal to the generators. Ministers
say the money is available but the industry believes the generators are
unlikely to buy more this year. Set up an energy advisory panel of
independent experts to help draw up an annual energy report. Potential
members say they have not been contacted but the DTI says it still plans to
set up the panel.
Launch a review of the nuclear industry. At least three government
departments are disputing the review's terms of reference.
Announce the outcome of a review of guidance to planning authorities on
opencast coal. The guidance will considerably affect the market for
deep-mine coal, which is more expensive to extract than opencast.
The delays can be explained in part by Mr Heseltine's absence for much of
the summer after his heart attack.
At least half the 30 remaining pits are likely to go in the next year or so,
but the government is nervous of a reaction similar to last October.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Touche staff blacklisting to be raised in Commons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BLACKLISTING of senior employees of a leading accountancy firm by the
government is to be raised in the Commons next week.
Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's City spokesman, said he would be asking
questions about the blacklisting of Touche Ross staff from working on
public-sector contracts.
He said: 'The public is entitled to know what allegations are made against
certain Touche Ross staff, and, if there are question marks over any aspect
of this firm, why they continue to be instructed by the government.'
Touche Ross, one of Britain's 'big six' accountancy firms, yesterday played
down the impact of the government's advice blacklisting some of the firm's
senior employees.
The Treasury is understood to have circulated the advice in letters to
senior civil servants earlier this year, after its decision last November to
sue the firm over its role in the collapse of Barlow Clowes, the fund
management company.
Among the 13 employees affected are Mr John Connolly, the managing partner
of the firm's London office.
Five of Touche's 370 partners are also affected. All are either tax or audit
specialists, most of whom worked on audits connected with Barlow Clowes,
which was closed by the Department of Trade and Industry in 1988.
Touche Ross yesterday said it hoped to continue its public-sector practice,
which has been built up over recent years.
Mr John Roques, a senior partner, said: 'We are proud to be a major supplier
of consulting and other advisory services to government.
'We have every expectation that we will continue to be selected on our
merits to serve a wide variety of government departments.'
The firm earned Pounds 58.3m from its consultancy services in the past
financial year. Possibly more than half of this total was generated from
public-sector contracts.
Partners at other firms believe that Touche's business could be adversely
affected. 'If it was us I would be desperate,' said a partner at one firm.
Professionals point to the experience of Arthur Andersen, another of the big
six, which was the subject of similar 'government guidance' nearly a decade
ago. Andersen was auditor of the collapsed De Lorean car firm and is being
sued by the government for alleged negligence. The firm has received no
public-sector audit work in recent years.
Touche has claimed it alerted the authorities to the fraud at Barlow Clowes
and that it acted professionally.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Boots to appeal on dispensing rebuff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOOTS, the retailing and pharmaceuticals group, yesterday said local Family
Health Services Authorities had refused to give it permission to dispense
National Health Service prescriptions at outlets in two J. Sainsbury
superstores. It intends to appeal against one of the refusals.
It said the outlets, each of about 200 sq m, would continue to dispense
private prescriptions as well as Boots' range of toiletries, cosmetics, baby
products, special foods and film-developing services.
Boots set up outlets in Sainsbury stores in July as part of a trial. It said
at the launch that, if successful, the scheme would be extended nationally.
Last month the company also announced it wanted to open 240 new high-street
chemists stores by 1997.
The company insisted yesterday the operations in superstores were viable
without NHS prescription business. In spite of the rebuff from the
authorities, its shares closed 5p up at 494p on a broker's recommendation.
Boots said prescription business typically represented 20 per cent of its
stores' sales and healthcare made up 30 per cent.
Sainsbury, which proposed the collaboration, already stocks several of these
product lines in its stores. The two companies said they expected to compete
on price promotions and special offers.
The applications to dispense NHS prescriptions were turned down at
Sevenoaks, Kent, and Poole, Dorset. Boots plans to appeal over the Poole
decision but believes it would not be successful at Sevenoaks.
Applications at Sainsbury sites at Camberley in Surrey, Dulwich, south
London, Hemel Hempstead and St Albans in Hertfordshire and Ipswich in
Suffolk have not yet been made or are still outstanding.
Family Health Services Authorities, which license pharmacies, assess
applications on the basis of needs and effect on the local community.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Lambeth starts action for damages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAMBETH, the Labour-controlled south London council, yesterday started legal
action against four defendants including one of its contractors, claiming
damages for fraud. The council was accused earlier this year by its district
auditor of spending Pounds 20.2m unlawfully.
The council said the proceedings resulted from 'recent investigations by
Lambeth itself into corrupt practices involving a contractor working with
the disbanded integrated building services unit in the Directorate of
Operational Services'.
The council said the action was 'a major step forward' in pursuing its
policy of 'taking all possible action to eliminate corruption and
malpractice wherever it is found'.
Following an application to the High Court, Lambeth is now empowered 'to
locate and seize all relevant documents and other items from various
premises and to identify and freeze a significant proportion of the assets
of each of the defendants'.
The council said: 'This is the first occasion on which Lambeth council has
sought to utilise these particular powers, and it is believed that this is
the first time any local authority has taken such action.' The defendants
cannot be named for legal reasons.
In June, Lambeth appointed a Mr Henry Gilby chief executive. He said then
that 'significant changes' would be needed 'to put this council on a sound
footing'.
He had collaborated with his predecessor, Mr Herman Ouseley, now chief
executive of the Commission for Racial Equality, in producing a report which
said that corruption and malpractice on an 'unprecedented' scale had cost
the borough more than Pounds 10m.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Deficit increases as exports plummet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK TRADE deficit has deteriorated slowly since the beginning of the
year, with the recession in continental Europe hitting exports hard.
Figures from the Central Statistical Office - including figures for trade
with the European Community - show that in the first seven months of the
year the deficit on visible trade was Pounds 8.7bn. This compares with
Pounds 7bn for the same period last year.
The value of exports to the EC in July was Pounds 4.85bn, the lowest monthly
figure for 18 months, and sharply lower than the June figure. Imports from
the EC were Pounds 5.7bn in July, leaving a monthly deficit of Pounds 848m,
the biggest EC trade gap for two years.
The deficit on trade with countries outside the EC in July was Pounds 698m.
The total deficit was Pounds 1.54bn, the largest total for seven months.
The CSO stressed that the figures for EC trade were provisional and were
likely to be revised as the new system for measuring intra-EC trade settled
down.
However, the provisional figures indicate that sterling's devaluation in
September last year has not been sufficient to offset the depressing effects
of recession in the EC - with which the UK does more than half of its
external trade.
Because of the poor performance in Europe, the value of total exports in the
latest three months was 2 per cent lower than in the previous three months.
Imports over the same period were little changed.
Outside the EC, exports have been more successful. In July the UK exported
Pounds 4.8bn of goods to non-EC countries, slightly less than in June, but
well up on the beginning of the year.
Trade flows measured by volume show the varying fortunes of EC and non-EC
trade. In the three months to July, export volumes to the EC excluding oil
and erratics were 2 per cent down on the previous three months. Underlying
import volumes were up 1 per cent.
Exports to non-EC countries, measured on the same basis, were up 2.5 per
cent, compared with a 0.5 per cent rise in imports.
The figures also showed exporters were raising their prices more rapidly
than importers.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Banks win praise for flexibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLEARING banks are not used to praise these days, but the west Midlands
regional group of chambers of commerce said yesterday there is growing
evidence of a more flexible approach to customers.
The group, representing 13 chambers and more than 600 companies, said the
clearers were looking more closely at balance sheet performance when
arranging loans for finance expansion.
The Bank of England has received complaints in recent months over clearing
banks' lending policies, which have been criticised for linking risk on
borrowing solely to fixed assets, rather than performance. This prompted the
Bank to raise the concerns of employers with the clearers last month.
'Banks are now being more innovative in their attempts to assist companies,'
according to the latest quarterly economic survey collated from chambers of
commerce in the west Midlands. These innovations include banks restructuring
loans, converting overdrafts into term-borrowing and considering taking
deferred equity as security.
Mr Roger Dickens, deputy chairman of the regional chambers, said the change
in tactics reflected determination by banks to reduce receiverships and
associated losses on loans. The main innovators had been Midland and Lloyds,
he added.
Midland Bank said yesterday it was planning to launch a regional enterprise
fund to raise venture capital of between Pounds 75,000 and Pounds 150,000.
Lloyds claimed it had reduced reliance on short-term finance and had set up
'business customer panels' to deal with complaints.
The increased signs of flexibility have been welcomed in the region.
Linread, fasteners manufacturer, said its lenders had put together packages
to help it expand and restructure debt cover. Burra Burra, the
Birmingham-based computer company, said its expansion had been made possible
by its bankers drawing up new loans.
The chambers said expansion in the region had been undermined by a decline
in export orders. According to its quarterly economic survey, orders in the
past three months were flat or falling for most companies.
Companies reporting growing overseas sales fell back from 32 per cent in the
second quarter to 30 per cent. The downturn was partly offset by an increase
in domestic orders, up from 34 per cent to 40 per cent.

THE price of healthy eating is often unnecessarily high, the Consumers'
Association said yesterday.
Shops often put higher prices on healthy foods - although the basic
ingredients of good diet were often cheap, said the association's magazine
Which? Way to Health.
Lean mince might cost half as much again as standard mince, while olive oil
was about four times as expensive as most vegetable oils, it said.
The association also attacked manufacturers for not giving enough
information about the amount of sugar in confectionery and soft drinks.

FT  12 OCT 93 / ITV complains over football ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITV Association has lodged a formal complaint with the European
Commission against a rule allowing the football associations of Europe to
ban at short notice the televising of games.
The latest version of the rule adopted by Uefa, the Union of European
Football Associations, would prevent ITV broadcasting The Match - live First
Division games on Sundays. To protect attendances at live football matches,
Uefa is trying to impose a ban on live televised games between noon and 4pm
(UK time) at weekends.
This would prevent ITV screening The Match, as kick-off is usually at 3pm.
ITV executives believe British Sky Broadcasting (in which Pearson, owner of
the FT, has a stake) could avoid the ban as its coverage usually starts at
4pm, when their Sunday Premier League games kick off.
Mr Andrew Quinn, chief executive of the ITV Association, has written to Mr
Karel Van Miert, EC commissioner for competition policy, arguing that the
Uefa rule is contrary to the Treaty of Rome.
The ITV companies have also referred the new version of Uefa's article 14 to
the Office of Fair Trading.
Last year the Commission issued a Statement of Objections to Uefa saying
that article 14 was illegal, although ITV pleas for interim measures to be
taken against the football organisation pending a full decision were
rejected.
The Commission has not yet taken a decision on the new article 14. But it
has in recent months been emphasising the negative impact live transmissions
can have on attendance.
ITV wants the Commission to declare article 14 inapplicable and unlawful
under Community law. It believes it has an adverse effect on broadcasters
throughout Europe, and on the sport. The broadcasters argue that they often
have to buy rights to televise games years ahead yet transmission can be
stopped at short notice on the grounds that a single local professional
match is being played at the same time.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Brown Shipley starts proceedings against Tottenham Hotspur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BROWN SHIPLEY, the merchant bank, yesterday began High Court proceedings to
force Tottenham Hotspur Football Club to pay more than Pounds 408,000 in
allegedly unpaid fees earned while the bank was the club's financial
adviser, John Mason writes.
The bank took over in September 1990 after the resignation of BZW, Mr
Michael Lyndon-Stanford QC told the court. At that time the club was in
financial disarray. It owed Midland Bank Pounds 11m and Robert Maxwell
planned to buy a 25 per cent stake in the club.
The club's shares were also suspended after suggestions of concealment and
secret profits, Mr Lyndon-Stanford said.
Brown Shipley ceased acting as financial adviser in August 1991 when Mr Alan
Sugar and Mr Terry Venables took over the management of the company.
The club paid Brown Shipley only a Pounds 25,000 retainer, claiming its
agreement with the bankers meant that further payments would be on the basis
of success-fees for potential transactions which never took place.

LOCAL education authorities are spending a greater share of their budgets on

amount of funding, Mr Stephen Byers, Labour MP for Wallsend, said yesterday.
He quoted provisional education department figures which showed that in
1991-92 a total of Pounds 1,415 was spent on each nursery or primary school
pupil, compared with Pounds 2,190 for each secondary school pupil.
However, 76 local education authorities in England had increased the
proportion of funds spent on nursery and primary pupils over the previous
two years, and only 23 had cut back.

Her announcement was at the launch in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, of a national
strategy for flood and coastal defence. It will mean that most spending will
be on flood-warning systems and urban coastal and flood defences. The lowest
priority will be given to rural coastal defence and drainage.
The strategy has been drawn up jointly by the agriculture ministry and the
Welsh Office, with consultation from local authorities.

AIR BRISTOL, a new airline which hopes to run scheduled services from the
British Aerospace airfield at Filton, north Bristol, yesterday said it had
started operations although it has not received Civil Aviation Authority
licences, Roland Adburgham writes.
BAe has contracted Air Bristol to run its daily company flights to Airbus
Industrie's plant in Toulouse. The first flight, using a leased BAC Super
1-11 jet, took off yesterday morning.
The company described the lack of CAA licences as a 'technical hitch' and it
expected to be granted its own licences soon. It added: 'It is our aircraft
and our crew but it is still being technically operated by BAe.'
British Midland airline is suspending its daily Birmingham to London
Heathrow service from next month. The company blamed falling profitability.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Business overdraft law may change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICE of Fair Trading is considering recommending changes to the law to
ensure that many more small businesses with overdrafts of up to Pounds
30,000 would be entitled to at least seven days notice if their banks wanted
to withdraw facilities.
Mr John Mills, the OFT's director of consumer credit, said yesterday that
the proposal was one of a number of possible changes to the Consumer Credit
Act that might affect small businesses.
Under the act, banks are required to give indi-viduals and sole traders at
least seven days notice before withdrawing facilities of up to Pounds
15,000. Mr Mills said the OFT was considering raising the limit to Pounds
30,000 and removing the anomaly that means incorporated companies are not
currently covered by the act.
Ironically, the changes emerge from an OFT review of the Consumer Credit Act
that was inspired by the government's attempts to push back the boundaries
of regulation. If the changes are accepted, it could extend statutory
protection for many businesses.
Alternatively, the changes might restrict the degree to which banks are
willing to lend to companies on overdraft.
Barclays Bank said the needs of individuals and small businesses were very
different and regulation through the Consumer Credit Act was not
appropriate. 'There are plenty of regulations covering lending to small
businesses and we do not need any more,' it said.
As part of the review of the act, the OFT will conduct public hearings on
October 27-28 on the way consumer credit is regulated.
The review is examining whether the act and the regulations under it impose
greater burdens on the providers of credit than are necessary for effective
consumer protection.
Mr Mills said: 'We have to resolve whether detailed and prescriptive
regulations developed in the 1970s remain appropriate or necessary for the
1990s and beyond.'

THE west Midlands regional group of chambers of commerce said yesterday
there was growing evidence of a more flexible approach by clearing banks to

The group, representing 13 chambers and more than 600 companies, said the
clearers were looking more closely at balance sheet performance when

The Bank of England has received complaints in recent months over clearing

FT  12 OCT 93 / Treasury axe poised over housing budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pounds 8bn housing budget is set to become one of the worst-hit
casualties of the government's determination to cut public spending next
year.
With the cabinet's public spending committee, EDX, resuming its meetings
this week ministers expect the Treasury to reduce both the capital and
revenue sides of the housing budget.
In last year's spending round capital spending projects escaped relatively
lightly, to the relief of the recession-hit construction industry. But in
the current discussions, housing expenditure through both the Housing
Corporation - which makes grants to housing associations - and local
authorities is expected to be targeted.
Local council leaders will today ask Mr John Gummer, the environment
secretary, to extend beyond the end of the year the period in which
authorities can spend proceeds from selling property or land. The latest
estimate from Mr Gummer's department is that local authorities will raise
about Pounds 500m less than the Pounds 1.75bn that had been expected.
A sharp reduction of up to Pounds 300m is also expected in the capital
earmarked for the Housing Corporation. A large proportion of its Pounds
1.8bn budget is committed in advance, so any cut would have a severe effect
on the number of projects that could be started.
EDX is also thought to be considering further reducing the proportion of
public money used to fund housing association projects, although this could
not take effect until years two and three of the government's spending
review period.
Mr Michael Portillo, chief Treasury secretary, believes it would be fairer
and more efficient to target subsidy on beneficiaries through housing
benefit, rather than on bricks and mortar through housing association
grants.
The Commons environment committee warned the government in July against
further reducing these grants. The environment department is expected to
publish its response to the committee later this month. Spending on housing
is already set well below 1992-93 levels, when an additional Pounds 750m was
provided in the 1992 Autumn Statement for housing associations to buy 20,000
empty homes.
The department's urban programmes are expected to be hit slightly less hard
in the spending round. This is partly because the government is anxious to
ensure the new Urban Regeneration Agency, to be chaired by Lord Walker, is
not strangled at birth. The agency will aim to reclaim 150,000 acres of
vacant land.
Labour yesterday warned that cutting infrastructure projects could threaten
the fragile economic recovery.
Capital spending in other departments such as transport is also under severe
pressure but ministers and officials are trying hard to use the private
sector as a 'safety valve' by persuading it to take up endangered projects.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Wider EC data controls opposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN will continue to oppose attempts by the European Commission to
extend data-protection legislation to handwritten as well as computerised
files, Earl Ferrers, the Home Office minister, told the House of Lords
yesterday.
He warned that draft proposals, which also include special provisions for
dealing with sensitive information, would add substantial costs to private
and public-sector bodies.
Lord Ferrers said the UK banking sector had estimated that the initial cost
of implementing the commission's proposals would be between Pounds 80m and
Pounds 100m, with annual running costs of Pounds 60m to Pounds 100m.
Government consultations showed that business interests were most concerned
about the proposals concerning handwritten records. If the directive applied
to these, many bureaucratic procedures would have to be introduced 'at very
great cost and for no significant purpose'.
Lord Ferrers suggested that harmonisation of data protection throughout the
European Community could be achieved without the introduction of a new
directive.
Lord Reay, Conservative, speaking for the first time since he took up a
consultancy brief from the Confederation of British Industry, said extending
data protection to handwritten files would impose a 'preposterous burden' on
some industries.
Lord McIntosh of Haringey, chief Labour spokesman in the debate, argued that
the extension of data protection to handwritten files would be 'the right
step to take'. The great virtue of the Domesday Book, for example, was that
its availability to the public enabled the accuracy of its contents to be
checked.

BRITISH GAS is expected to announce price rises today for new medium-term
contracts for interruptible supplies, a category which covers just over 100
large industrial users.
The price rises, ranging from 2.1 per cent to 12.5 per cent, depending on
the volume of gas purchased, will affect three-to-10-year contracts signed
on or after November 2. Existing contracts or companies seeking shorter-term
contracts will not be affected.
Interruptible users, which typically use gas for power generation at large
industrial sites, pay low prices but risk being cut off during periods of
peak demand, when many are able temporarily to use oil or other fuels.
Competition in the market to supply large gas users has seen British Gas'
share of the non-interruptible contract market fall to 40 per cent.
Independent gas suppliers have also captured 19 per cent of the upper tariff
market, which generally includes smaller commercial and large residential
users. No competitors have emerged in the low-margin interruptible market.
Prices for interruptible users were last raised in June 1992.
Last week the Combined Heat and Power Association, a body which promotes the
use of combined heat and power systems, warned that the increased use of
energy-efficient power generation schemes could be jeopardised by higher
prices for interruptible gas supplies.
The association said it feared British Gas would raise prices for
interruptible supplies, which had 'kick-started' its industry. The process,
which produces both heat and electricity, has been promoted by the
government as one of the main ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Textiles jobs 'put at risk by US'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOBS in clothing and textiles are being threatened by US reluctance to
compromise in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, says a report from
the industry's trade body.
The Apparel, Knitting and Textiles Alliance wants proposals agreed in July
to cut tariffs by up to 50 per cent to be adopted. It says the US is
'resisting' full application of the proposals.
Mr Colin Purvis, the alliance's secretary general, said a large reduction in
'these grotesquely high trade barriers' was essential.
He said: 'Last year the UK apparel and textile industry exported Pounds
1.8bn to countries outside the EC. Doubling these exports in real terms
could safeguard 35,000 jobs that would otherwise be at risk.'
The UK and other EC countries have much lower tariffs than the US. The
maximum EC duty is 17 per cent.
In the US, the world's biggest market, it is more than 40 per cent. On wool
cloth, one of the UK's main export products, the rate is 36 per cent.
Countries with high rates other than the US include Australia (50 per cent
to 60 per cent) and many Asian countries such as India, Pakistan, China and
Thailand.
The alliance calls for an agreement based on rules proposed at the G7
meeting in Tokyo in July. These say that peak tariffs, over 15 per cent,
would be halved and others cut by one third.

FT  12 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Japan finds car market hub - Thailand's
demand is growing fast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THIS morning I gave money to support the government
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
25m baht (Pounds 655,000),' says Mr Takuma Sato, president of Toyota Motor
Thailand, during an interview at his office near Bangkok.
His public relations manager hurriedly intervenes to explain that the
Dollars 1m donation to Mr Chuan Leekpai's government is for worthy projects
to alleviate Bangkok's notorious traffic congestion, including the purchase
of a helicopter and funding for research.
Mr Sato's casual remark, however, helps to illustrate the importance
Japanese motor manufacturers attach to Thailand: as a developing market in
which they account for 93 per cent of vehicle sales, and as a potential
automotive industry hub.
Toyota has a 25 per cent share of vehicle sales in Thailand, and its biggest
operation in south-east Asia: reducing traffic jams - Toyota is sponsoring a
second symposium on the problem in November - is good for business.
Three years ago, Thailand was Toyota's seventh largest foreign market and
last year its fourth; this year it will be third or second.
With the economy expanding at about 7 per cent a year, Thailand's middle
class is growing fast. Last year vehicle sales rose by 35 per cent to
362,987 units; between January and August this year they rose a further 36
per cent over the same period in 1992.
Toyota predicts total industry sales of 440,000 to 450,000 in 1993, followed
by more modest growth to bring the figure above 600,000 by the turn of the
century.
Japanese corporations are not the only beneficiaries. Although nearly half
of the vehicles sold in Thailand are still one-tonne Japanese pickups
(dubbed 'the national car' and often adapted for passengers as well as
freight), the luxury car market, dominated by European manufacturers, has
also expanded rapidly, especially since tariff barriers against the import
of complete vehicles and kits were eased in 1991.
A total of 8,459 Mercedes Benz cars were sold in the first eight months of
this year, more than double the number at the same time in 1992.
Suppliers to the industry have done well, too. The Thai affiliate of
Bridgestone, the Japanese tyre company, is planning to build a second
factory and treble production capacity to 30,000 tyres a day. Burmah Castrol
of the UK, known for its lubricants, says Castrol Thailand already ranks in
the top 10 Castrol companies worldwide and could soon become more profitable
than Castrol UK.
Chrysler and GM of the US are both considering establishing assembly
operations in Thailand. Toyota has earmarked Bt14.3bn for expansion in
Thailand, and Mitsubishi and Isuzu also have plans to invest hundreds of
millions of dollars.
'All (Japanese) manufacturers are now considering expansion in this
country,' says Mr Sato.
The idea is not merely to take advantage of the Thai market. Japanese
vehicle and component manufacturers also want to achieve economies of scale
in their regional and global production.
Thailand's modestly-priced workforce, relatively sophisticated industrial
base and large collection of Japanese or Japanese-affiliated component
makers all fit that description. The recent rise of the yen has further
encouraged Japanese companies to shift production to Asia.
'In 1993, the Thai auto industry remains a predominantly domestic industry,'
says a report published this year by Thailand's Board of Investment. 'But
current political reforms and massive Japanese inward investment portend
changes.'
Toyota has made a start. A joint venture with the Siam Cement conglomerate
produces diesel engines for one-tonne pickups which are exported to
countries within the six-nation Association of South East Asian Nations
(Asean), as well as to New Zealand and Portugal. Toyota Corolla body parts
are stamped in Thailand and exported to the Philippines.
In all, Thai automotive component exports grew to Dollars 350m (Pounds
231.7m) in 1992 from Dollars 63m in 1987. But the protectionist policies of
individual Asean countries are making it hard for Toyota and its rivals to
produce parts in such volumes that they are cheaper than those made in
Japan.
Mr Sato, however, believes that Thailand and other Asean countries will
eventually export substantial numbers of cars and parts to each other, to
Indochina, and even to Japan itself. 'In the 21st century,' he said, 'maybe
Asean will be the biggest (vehicle) market in the world, bigger than the
USA.'

FT  12 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Pirated music in sales of Dollars 2.1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 700m pirated music cassettes and 38m unauthorised compact discs were
sold worldwide last year, according to figures to be released later this
week by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.
Unauthorised sound recording sales had a retail value of Dollars 2.1bn
(Pounds 1.4bn) in 1992, or 7 per cent of total sales. This compares with
Dollars 1.43bn in 1991. The increase largely resulted from the federation
obtaining more information about the level of piracy in China, Mexico and
Poland, rather than from a substantial rise in unauthorised sales.
The federation said its figures probably understated piracy, however, as
they did not include the former territories of the Soviet Union or the
United Arab Emirates.
The biggest pirate music market last year was the US, where unauthorised
recordings had a retail value of Dollars 463m. This is a reflection of the
overall size of the US market rather than of a substantial level of piracy.
Only 5 per cent of US sales were unauthorised.
Smaller markets with high proportions of unauthorised sales included El
Salvador, where 86 per cent of units sold were pirate copies, Nicaragua (82
per cent), Peru (81 per cent), Kenya (74 per cent) and Ivory Coast (70 per
cent).

<TEXT>
MR Matthias Wissman, Germany's recently appointed transport minister, has
called for a more aggressive government policy of trade promotion, in the
wake of Siemens' failure to win a big contract for its ICE high-speed train
in South Korea.
He flew to the US last week to support a promotion for the train, which is
now running for three months on an Amtrak test track between Washington and
New York.
He believes a significant factor in the loss of the Dollars 2.4bn Korean
contract - which was won by the Anglo-French GEC-Alsthom consortium with the
French TGV - was the lower level of German government support for the
project.
Mr Wissman called for 'aggressive supporting measures' to back up German
industrial projects, particularly high technology projects such as the
Intercity Express (ICE).
He said all government departments should be involved in working out joint
marketing strategies with German industry, using all possible support
measures in German embassies, trade missions, chambers of commerce and
information offices, to promote high-profile German products.
The campaign would not involve direct subsidies to industry; nor should it
include deals on export quotas or reciprocal trade accords, which would only
result in trade distortion, he said.
Germany's failure to win the Korean railway contract was seen as a blow to
German technological prowess, but the French were praised in Germany for a
more effective marketing effort. This included visits to Seoul by senior
French ministers, such as Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister, and the
prospective visit by President Francois Mitterrand to coincide with signing
the contract. The French embassy also had a special attache dealing
exclusively with railway matters.
Mr Wissman is determined that efforts to break into the US high-speed train
market should not fail for want of official support. He flew to the opening
in Washington of the first test run on the Amtrak line to New York.
Siemens, in partnership with General Motors, GEC Alsthom and Sweden's ABB
are all competing for contracts with Amtrak, expected to be awarded next
spring, for about 26 high-speed trains. A key part of the deal will be award
of significant volumes of sub-contracting to US suppliers.

FT  12 OCT 93 / World Trade News: France wants Gatt to leave farm issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN, DAVID DODWELL and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, LONDON,, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE believes Gatt negotiators should aim to reach an interim trade accord
this year, leaving difficult issues such as agriculture and audiovisual
broadcasting to be resolved later, Mr Alain Juppe, foreign minister, said
yesterday.
The call flies in the face of conviction among Gatt negotiators from the
European Community, the US, and farm exporting countries that exclusion of
farm trade, and a failure to meet the December 15 deadline for completion of
the talks, would trigger a collapse of the Uruguay Round into trade war.
Mr Peter Sutherland, director general of Gatt, asked this weekend during a
visit to Singapore whether agriculture could be hived off from the Uruguay
Round negotiations, was blunt: 'No,' he said: 'There are so many parties
that would walk out of the agreement that it's not possible.
'As some would see it, a partial agreement of that kind would give a free
ride to the developed world in areas of interest to them, but fail to demand
some reciprocal movement in areas of importance to developing countries such
as agriculture and textiles.
The French call for a 'partial Gatt' is a switch of tactics for Paris, which
has been insisting on a global deal with other countries making concessions
in the 14 non-farm areas to balance out any sacri-fices made by France in
agriculture.
But it in no way constitutes an overall concession from France, which always
wanted farm trade kept out of Gatt and still demands an exclusion for
broadcasting.
The tactical change seems designed to avoid France being accused of
obstructing all progress with its demands for a revision of last year's
transatlantic farm deal.
A striking example of France's lack of a pro-Gatt lobby came in answer to a
question posed last week by the Liberation newspaper to 40 leading
businessmen: 'In the interest of its industry, would France be right to sign
a Gatt deal even if it does not full satisfaction on agriculture?'. Only
four bothered to reply, and none in clear terms.
According to one Washington-based trade strategist, a good segment of the US
trade community is so frustrated with the problems of the agriculture
negotiations that it would like to take farm trade off the table: 'But we've
gone over the waterfall in a barrel,' he said: 'There is no backing up. Even
if the US would agree to it, the Cairns group of farm exporters would not.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Eli Lilly to slash workforce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ELI LILLY of the US is cutting about 10 per cent of its worldwide
pharmaceuticals workforce and shedding a further 2,000 staff throughout its
operations, in an effort to remain competitive in an increasingly hostile
industry.
Ten per cent, or 2,000 positions, are expected to disappear by mid-1994
through a combination of voluntary early retirement, attrition and selective
hiring. Lilly hopes to eliminate the second 2,000 jobs by further attrition,
cutting use of temporary and contract workers and consultants.
The move marks the first big initiative by Lilly's new management. Its
former chief executive, Mr Vaughn Bryson, resigned in June after clashing
with Lilly's board. Lilly's failure to produce new, big-selling drugs and
its disappointing results contributed to the resignation. Mr Bryson was
replaced by Mr Randall Tobias, former vice chairman of American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph.
Lilly plans to accelerate the expansion of its European pharmaceutical
operations, but sharply to reduce the size of its London headquarters - from
35 staff to five - and its Vienna regional office.
'These actions are the first in what we expect to be a series of decisions
that will help us achieve stronger long-term growth by reducing our
expenses, improving our efficiencies and expanding our capabilities,' said
Mr Tobias. 'These are among many alternatives we're considering in light of
our changing global markets and the economic realities of those markets.'
The Indianapolis-based company has been hit by pressure to reduce drug
prices, and has been plagued by the absence of important new drugs.
As a result of its early-retirement programme and job cuts in Europe, Lilly
said it would take special pre-tax charges against fourth-quarter earnings.
The company predicted third quarter earnings of 98 cents to Dollars 1 a
share. On Wall Street, Lilly's shares closed Dollars 3 1/2 up at Dollars 53
5/8.

FT  12 OCT 93 / UN threat of Haiti sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations Security Council last night threatened to reimpose
sanctions against Haiti if armed groups continued to threaten US soldiers
waiting to land.
The council said Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali should report
urgently on whether the incidents in Haiti earlier yesterday violated a July
accord providing for the restoration of democracy in Haiti.
The USS Harlan County, with about 200 US personnel on board, was blocked
from docking in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital. Foreign journalists were
beaten up and embassy personnel were turned away from the port by
protesters.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, in a statement accusing
Haitian police and military of breaking promises, later said deployment of
the troops would be delayed. The incident has added to fears among US
politicians that the troops could come under attack like the US force in
Somalia.
The military action in Haiti, sponsored by the UN and the Organisation of
American States, is aimed at restoring President Jean-Bertrand Aristide,
ousted by a coup two years ago.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Canadians warned on regional divide
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG performance by Canada's two fast-growing regional parties in the
October 25 general election could polarise the country and hasten its
eventual fragementation, voters are being warned.
With two weeks to polling day, the popularity of the Bloc Quebecois in
Quebec and the Reform party in western Canada has become the main talking
point of the election.
Mr Patrick Monahan, constitutional lawyer at Toronto's York University,
wrote in a commentary in yesterday's Globe and Mail: 'The election is
shaping up as a fundamental watershed for the country, the domestic
equivalent of the fall of the Berlin Wall in Europe.'
According to the latest opinion polls, the BQ has the support of over 40 per
cent of voters in Quebec, while Reform has pulled ahead of all other parties
in the western province of British Columbia. It also enjoys substantial
support in the three prairie provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and
Manitoba.
Backing for the BQ and Reform has come largely at the expense of the
Conservatives, under Prime Minister Kim Campbell, who are now given only the
longest odds to win a third successive term in office.
The Liberals are favoured to win the largest number of seats, but the
regional parties' performance will largely determine whether the Liberals
have enough seats to form a majority government. The bulk of Liberals MPs
are likely to be from Ontario, heightening regional differences.
The left-leaning New Democratic party, which currently has 43 out of 295
seats in the House of Commons, is facing obliteration in the election.
Mr Jean Chretien, Liberal leader, sounded a dire warning about the impact of
strong BQ and Reform representation in the House of Commons: 'If you have an
English Canada on one side and a completely French Quebec on the other side,
you end up with two nations and eventually two countries,' he said.
The popularity of both groups largely reflects voters' disillusionment with
the traditional parties. An unemployment rate of more than 11 per cent, the
strains caused by a more competitive trading environment, and periodic
reports of politicians' misdeeds in Ottawa have all contributed to a desire
for radical change.
The BQ favours eventual sovereignty for Quebec, but it has drawn support
even from non-separatists with its promise to put the interests of the
francophone province first. The Reform party has a populist, right-wing
platform which includes drastic cuts in government spending, an end to
national bilingualism, and stricter immigration curbs.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Testing three months for Salinas: Mexico is nervous over
Nafta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER and DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST over a year before he has to give up office, President Carlos Salinas
of Mexico faces perhaps the most critical three months of his six-year
presidency.
The fate of his grand project to tie Mexico's economy to that of the US
through the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) is to be decided by
the US Congress before the end of the year; he has to choose the man who
will in all probability succeed him; and he must revive an economy that
ground to a halt in the middle of this year.
Nervousness in Mexico's government and business community is palpable. If
the treaty is rejected, economic revival could be threatened and legitimate
victory for Mr Salinas's candidate in next August's election less certain.
Mr Salinas himself has raised the spectre of a backlash against the US, and
reversal of the improvement in Mexico-US relations.
Mr Salinas's nightmare - that his presidency will be clouded by a final year
of economic and political disarray - looks unlikely to materialise, but it
is still a possibility.
The president says Nafta is important to Mexico, but denies he has
overemphasised the treaty or that the country's economic future is
over-dependent on it. In an interview at Los Pinos, the presidential
residence, Mr Salinas said Nafta 'will provide us with the opportunity to
grow at a higher rate. You must understand that having 85m people in Mexico
and adding almost 2m a year to the population makes economic growth not a
goal but a necessity'.
However, Nafta 'was not the only thing' going on in Mexico. The president
emphasised his government's economic and electoral reforms, advances in the
educational and health systems, and improved trade relations with many parts
of the world, which would continue whether Nafta was approved or not.
Even many of Mr Salinas' critics agree that his reforms have placed the
country's economy on its soundest footing for decades. Inflation is down to
single figures as the government has eschewed deficit financing. The
imminent independence of the central bank should heighten the chances that
this will continue. International reserves are at record levels, reducing
the chances of a currency crisis if Nafta fails.
After several years of fiscal and monetary austerity, the government is
finally pushing more money into the economy to spur growth: under the annual
pact agreed this month with business and labour unions, the budget will move
from surplus this year to balance next, and the minimum wage will be
increased by more than 15 per cent.
However, officials are adamant that they will not push for growth at any
cost, and if Nafta is rejected they will not devalue to try to kick start
the economy. 'For us, zero growth and no devaluation is better than 3 per
cent growth at the cost of a devaluation,' said a senior government aide.
The government was prepared to accept higher interest rates that would
almost inevitably follow a collapse of the trade treaty.
This attitude may be reinforced by the perception among senior officials
that, despite low growth this year, the government and its policies remain
relatively popular. The ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) won a
landslide victory in the July gubernatorial elections in the State of Mexico
 -which it lost to the leftish alliance of Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas in the
1988 presidential election.
Mr Cardenas will again provide the main opposition to the PRI in August's
presidential election and - while he has toned down his own anti-US rhetoric
 -could be expected to make political capital out of a failed treaty and
slow growth. The collapse of Nafta might therefore make the campaign closer
than it would otherwise be.
It is not yet clear who will be the PRI's candidate. The current
front-runner is Mr Lus Donaldo Colosio, the social development minister. His
critics argue that his views are a mystery and his intellect untested, but
Mr Colosio is popular in the ruling party and close to the president, and
has built important alliances within the government, including with Mr
Salinas's powerful aide, Mr Jose Cordoba.
However, in the past, front-runners have ended up losing and although
outsiders cannot be ruled out, Mr Manuel Camacho, the mayor of Mexico City,
is the second favourite and Mr Pedro Aspe, the finance minister, the third.
Mr Aspe's weakness is seen as his aristocratic demeanour and even his
supporters say he would make a better president than candidate. Mr Camacho
is suspected of populist instincts and would probably very soon have to
establish an alliance with someone with good economic credentials such as Mr
Aspe.
The most striking thing though is not the differences between the men but
their similarities - all are US-educated males in their 40s, who worked
under Mr Salinas in the 1980s when the president was budget minister.
Moreover, the alliances among senior politicians are such that whoever wins,
the shape of the next cabinet is likely to be similar to the current one.
The choice of candidate is likely to be Mr Salinas's and only ostensibly the
party's. The next president, Mr Salinas said, 'has to be a person who has
very high political skills and very solid technical formation. In the world
of today no head of state can neglect the importance of understanding the
economic forces working within society and certainly in international
relations.'
He also underlined his view that if the US Congress has not passed the Nafta
treaty by January, he will regard it as dead, and that no renegotiation
would be possible. In saying this, the president is clearly hoping to sway
US congressmen who say they favour some kind of free trade agreement with
Mexico, but not the one currently under consideration.
If the accord does fall, there will undoubtedly be ramifications: relations
with the US will be hurt, interest rates will be higher and economic growth
possibly slower than otherwise. One minister also worried out loud: 'A lot
of people in the bureaucracy are opposed to Nafta and I'm concerned that
they will use the defeat of Nafta to hurt its supporters.' While this
suggests the near-term outlook for Mexico would be difficult, it does not
portend a catastrophe.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US troops on a multinational peace mission to Haiti met hostility yesterday,
adding to fears among US politicians that the troops could come under attack
like the US force now engaged in Somalia.
The USS Harlan County, with about 200 US personnel on board, was blocked
from docking and embassy personnel were turned away from the port by
shouting protesters in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital.
'We don't want foreigners coming here and trying to tell us what to do]' one
man shouted. US officials played down the incident.
The US troops are being sent as part of a plan sponsored by the United
Nations and the Organisation of American States to restore to office
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was ousted by a military coup two
years ago.
The US is playing a secondary role, supplying engineers to help build roads
and clinics while leaving the task of training a new police force to
French-speaking countries.
The US troops, who will eventually number around 700, are to be only lightly
armed, but US officials say they will be able to defend themselves in an
environment much less dangerous than Mogadishu.

THE first private-sector commercial bank opened yesterday in Tanzania,
Leslie Crawford reports from Nairobi.
The opening ends nearly three decades of state banking monopoly in this east
African nation.
Meridien Biao is the first of two commercial banks to set up business in the
city of Dar-es-Salaam.
Standard Chartered bank will have its official opening next month.
The launch of competitive banking forms part of President Hassan Mwinyi's
efforts to liberalise the former socialist economy.
Mr Mwinyi, who has ruled Tanzania since Mr Julius Nyerere's retirement in
1985, has also introduced central-bank dollar auctions with the aim of
eventually liberalising foreign exchange controls.

FT  12 OCT 93 / De Klerk hints at shift in strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor, and Agencies
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT F W de Klerk last night held out the prospect of a critical shift
in the South African government's strategy, warning that the constitutional
talks were in jeopardy and raising the possibility of a referendum to
replace a general election scheduled for next April.
Mr de Klerk, addressing a regional congress of his ruling National Party in
Stellenbosch, said that if political groups were unable to reach agreement
on a new constitution in the next four weeks, before a scheduled special
session of parliament, 'we must come up with another plan'.
He added: 'As a democrat, I believe that there is no better instrument than
a referendum.'
Such a move, unlikely to be followed through without the backing of Mr
Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, reflects a growing concern about
the strength of the Freedom Alliance between right-wing whites and Chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party.
The alliance is refusing to take part in the constitutional talks. Although
its support is thought to be less than the combined constituencies of the
ANC and the National party, it has the capacity to disrupt an election.
A referendum would be less disruptive, allowing the government and the ANC
to campaign as a de facto coalition seeking a mandate to govern as well as
claim international legitimacy.
Mr de Klerk easily won an all-white referendum on his reforms last year,
which temporarily stalled opposition among whites to ending apartheid.
The president was speaking hours after meeting leaders of the Freedom
Alliance, which fears the ANC will win the election, scheduled for April 27,
and impose a socialist system.
They want autonomous homelands where they can govern themselves.
Mr de Klerk said the negotiating process no longer represented the entire
nation. 'The whole process of negotiation is under enormous pressure at the
moment. It would be no exaggeration to speak of a crisis in the future.'
The alliance called yesterday for a summit of all the nation's political
leaders, in an apparent attempt to override the political negotiations led
by the government and the ANC.

INDIA'S central bank, announcing its credit policy for the next six months,
yesterday trimmed the reserve requirements of commercial banks to encourage
lending and support an industrial revival, Reuter reports from Bombay.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said that cutting the statutory liquidity
ratio of the banks by 2.5 percentage points to 34.75 per cent would inject
an extra Rs41.5bn (Pounds 879m) of lendable resources into the financial
system.
The bank left the minimum lending rate of the commercial banks unchanged at
15 percent.
The bank cut the minimum lending rate by one percentage point last month,
the fourth cut in the past 12 months, in an attempt to support India's
economic liberalisation programme.

FT  12 OCT 93 / S Africa open for business: A successful transition depends
on the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Derek Keys, South Africa's finance minister, and the ANC president, Mr
Nelson Mandela, are taking a joint message to the world: South Africa is
back on the international stage, and it is united.
Beneath this banner, the two men will be seeking foreign investment at a
Confederation of British Industry conference in London today, in an effort
to complete a reversal in economic fortunes which has gained momentum with
the African National Congress's call for an end to economic sanctions and a
new convergence between the ANC and the government on economic policy.
The next step is the wooing of foreign investors, with the country needing
foreign investment 'more than ever before', according to Dr Chris Stals,
governor of the Reserve Bank.
The urgency has come with a realisation that a successful political
transition is going to depend on improving the dismal growth performance of
recent years.
The key issue is jobs. In its annual report the Reserve Bank estimates that
the portion of the workforce unemployed, or involved in the informal sector
of the economy, rose to 46 per cent in 1992, from 39 per cent in 1988. While
some argue that this figure is overstated, none disputes that unemployment
is a serious contributor to the high levels of violence in the country.
Although a better agricultural season, a weaker rand and the mid-year flurry
in the gold price should help the economy reverse three years of decline in
1993, there is widespread agreement that only restructuring will produce
sustainable high growth.
This will involve investing more and spending less, restoring investment as
a percentage of GDP to something closer to 25 per cent than the low of 15.9
per cent reached in 1992. It will also require a substantially improved
export performance.
In the first flush of the post-sanctions era, the air has been positively
thick with good will, especially abroad. Back at home, though, the going has
been rougher, with the government embroiled in disputes about the issue of
cellular telephone licences and a rise in the petrol price. Although the
petrol dispute may yet drive the unions to mass action, economic policy is
not the war zone it once was. These latest difficulties are much more a
reflection of the transitional phase in which South Africa finds itself - in
both cases the core objection of the ANC and its trade union ally Cosatu is
that they were not adequately consulted - than of serious policy
differences.
Indeed, the ANC has now turned to soliciting the foreign investor with
fervour. In a series of appearances in the US last month, both Mr Mandela
and Mr Trevor Manuel, the ANC's economics spokesman, went out of their way
to persuade investors that not only would they be 'very, very welcome'
(Manuel) in South Africa, but they would not have to fear 'radical policies'
(Mandela).
As Mr Keys told a Washington investor conference, the 'best move' South
Africa's policymakers can make is to equip a government of national unity,
which South Africa will have after next April's elections, with a 'credible
and attractive' economic policy.
He believes South Africa's chances of achieving this are 'very good' and
cites four recent events as constituting important steps towards this goal.
They are the renegotiation of foreign debt repayments; the revised tariff
reduction offer to Gatt in terms of the Uruguay Round of global trade talks;
the negotiation of an Dollars 850m (Pounds 563m) loan from the IMF; and
agreement on how South Africa will work with the World Bank.
Certainly, finalising the debt agreement, and renewing ties with the IMF -
South Africa last accessed IMF facilities in 1982 - immeasurably improve the
country's creditworthiness.
The Gatt offer is also crucial to South Africa's hopes of improving economic
growth.
All of this is music in the ears of foreign investors hoping for a
business-friendly future under a new government. But the past is not far
below the surface. It is a source of wry comfort to businessmen that the ANC
has now taken to justifying what it describes as anti-trust policy in terms
of the 'efficiency of markets' rather than the whites simply having too
much.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Mandela favours tax incentives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Nelson Mandela, African National Congress president, yesterday held out
the prospect of tax breaks for foreign companies investing in South Africa.
Mr Mandela, on a four-day visit to Britain, said an ANC-led government would
offer fiscal incentives to persuade investors to set up plants and
joint-venture companies in deprived areas of South Africa. Addressing
business leaders in Birmingham, ahead of a conference on the South African
economy in London today, he highlighted the northern Cape and black
homelands such as Transkei as areas where international companies should
launch subsidiary operations.
'There will be tax incentives for the next five years and other strategies
to ensure we spread the benefits of investment to the poorest areas,' he
said.
Mr Mandela said the incentives, part of an investment code drawn up by the
ANC, did not involve an obligation on companies to invest only in areas of
high unemployment and social deprivation.
They would form the centrepiece of an appeal to foreign investors to help
equalise economic disparities between black and white communities.
The investment code also guaranteed that overseas companies could repatriate
profits and dividends. But he warned large-scale state intervention was
unavoidable to overcome structural problems in the South African economy.

high unemployment and social deprivation.
They would form the centrepiece of an appeal to foreign investors to help
equalise economic disparities between black and white communities.
The investment code also guaranteed that overseas companies could repatriate
profits and dividends on earnings made in South Africa.
Acknowledging that the ANC's commitment to nationalisation could prove a
disincentive to overseas investors, Mr Mandela said the emphasis on state
ownership had been diluted by the party's policy makers.
But he warned large-scale state intervention was unavoidable to overcome
structural problems in the South African economy. Areas the ANC plans to
address include 'the 98 per cent of industrial property controlled by whites
and the 86 per cent of shares on the Johannesburg stock exchange held by
just five corporations'.
In London today, Mr Mandela is expected to reaffirm his appeal for economic
aid during meetings with Mr John Major, UK premier, and the Confederation of
British Industry.
He will address the CBI along with Mr Derek Keys, South African trade
minister, and Mr Richard Needham, Mr Keys' British counterpart.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Egypt leads call for OAU Somali summit

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations and Egypt, which holds the chair of the Organisation of
African Unity, have called for a summit meeting of African leaders next week
in an attempt to set in train an 'African solution' for Somalia.
Arab diplomats in Cairo said President Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian leader,
would chair the meeting in Addis Ababa on October 20, which would be
attended by Mr Meles Zenawi and Mr Isayas Afewerki, the presidents of
Ethiopia and Eritrea. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the Egyptian-born UN
secretary general who arrives in Cairo this week, is also likely to attend
the talks.
The Addis summit and a flurry of other Somali-related diplomatic moves in
Cairo this week followed US promptings for Egypt, one of its firmest allies
in the region, to lead the regional response to the country's plight. Both
President Bill Clinton and Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state,
have directly appealed in the past few days for an 'African solution' to
Somalia. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry has been anxious for some time to
demonstrate to the US that it can play a regional role far beyond being a
privileged interlocutor in the Arab-Israeli peace process.
It was unclear yesterday whether invitations to the Addis Ababa talks would
also be extended to the various Somali factions. Arab diplomats said,
however, that the meeting would aim to determine the structure and
composition of a further series of national reconciliation negotiations,
likely to be held in Ethiopia by mid-November.
Mr Boutros Ghali is set to arrive in Cairo on Thursday to meet Mr Mubarak
and discuss the proposed negotiations. He will also meet senior
representatives of the OAU, the Arab League and the Islamic Conference
Organisation. Mr James Jonah, the UN special envoy, last night met last
night Mr Amr Moussa, the Egyptian foreign minister, in preparation for
Thursday's meeting.

FT  12 OCT 93 / China lets off a blast of pique
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WHEN China detonated a nuclear device underground at its Lop Nor test site
last week, it seemed more like a riposte to a world that had not been all
that kind to it recently than a blast in the interests of national defence.
In Beijing, where the mood is decidedly less buoyant than before China's
crushing disappointment over its loss of the Olympics to Sydney, it is
possible to detect a sourness towards the outside world: although Chinese
officials are careful to avoid suggestions they have been bad losers.
The harder edge to Chinese policy statements was apparent in an address by
Premier Li Peng on the eve of the October 1 anniversary of the founding of
the People's Republic. 'We are firmly opposed to all acts of interference in
China's internal affairs and acts of violating China's sovereignty and will
absolutely not accept them,' Mr Li said.
While they might not say so publicly, there is no doubt officials apportion
a good deal of blame to human rights campaigners in the west for the
Olympics loss.
Beijing is finding that constructive engagement with the outside world is
not a simple thing, and brings with it pressures that could be ignored, or
at least shrugged off, in the past. Now, it is not so easy, if China wants
to continue to reap the benefits of its increasing interdependence with the
world economy.
The nuclear test in many ways encapsulates the problem, with Chinese
officials claiming Beijing was being subjected to 'double standards' by an
international community whose mission was to keep China weak. The US, as
officials point out, has conducted 25 times the number of China's nuclear
tests.
'The Chinese Government has always exercised utmost restraint on nuclear
testing and the number of nuclear tests it has conducted is extremely
limited,' an official statement said. Chinese officials also charge that the
west has a vested interested in applying a moratorium on nuclear testing,
since this would preserve its advantage in the nuclear arms race.
China exhibits similar irritation when an issue is made of its weapons
sales, arguing its involvement in the arms business is dwarfed by that of
the US as the world's biggest supplier of weapons. This was the theme of
Beijing's reaction in August to Washington's announcement that it was
imposing sanctions on the export of high-technology items in protest at
Chinese missile sales to Pakistan.
'The US', a Chinese official charged, 'has poured large amounts of advanced
weapons into the region sensitive to China, threatening its security, and
made groundless accusations against it.'
Western officials in Beijing have been monitoring carefully Chinese actions
in the wake of the Olympics vote for signs of a hardening of attitudes.
Indications that Beijing may again be stiffening its campaign against
Governor Chris Patten's proposals for extending democracy in Hong Kong
before China's 1997 takeover are being cited as evidence of Olympic fallout.
Publication on the front pages of Chinese newspapers the day after the
Olympics vote of an 11-year-old directive from Deng Xiaoping, China's
paramount leader, threatening to seize Hong Kong before 1997 if
circumstances deteriorated there, is seen as one of the more conspicuous
examples of Chinese pique.
Domestically, a wave of executions of criminals and the sentencing to death
of officials convicted of so-called economic crimes are also being portrayed
as a sign of a more uncompromising leadership. But what is almost certainly
true is that China's feelings have been bruised, and its responses to real
or imagined slights by the international community are likely to be sharper
in the months ahead.

FT  12 OCT 93 / More held in Japan construction scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE senior executives of Japan's largest construction group, including the
head of the construction industry association, were yesterday charged with
bribery.
The charges bring to a climax a public investigation into allegations of
widespread bribery of provincial government officials by the construction
industry, until recently a big source of campaign cash for Japanese
politicians.
The investigation has so far led to the arrests of 21 executives from
Japan's top five construction groups, in the process hitting their profits
and fuelling US complaints that the construction market is rigged against
competition.
The Tokyo district prosecutors' office yesterday indicted Mr Teruzo Yoshino,
chairman of Shimizu and head of the influential Japan Federation of
Construction Contractors, over the alleged payment of a Y10m (Pounds 62,500)
bribe to obtain public works contracts. Two fellow board members, Mr
Hiroyuki Koyama and Mr Akikazu Matsumoto, were also charged with bribery. Mr
Fujio Takeuchi, former Ibaraki prefectural governor, was charged with
receiving bribes. Mr Takeuchi is already facing bribery charges in
connection with another construction group, Hazama.
An irony of Mr Yoshino's indictment is that he was until his arrest leader
of a campaign against bribery and bid-rigging in the construction industry.
The Shimizu executives were arrested last month on evidence believed to have
been gathered from the papers of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the former political
godfather of the Liberal Democratic party, who is now on trial for tax
evasion on cash received from construction groups. Mr Kanemaru's downfall
contributed to the LDP's recent election defeat.
While Shim1zu is the biggest corporate target in the construction scandal,
the national tax administration agency says its inquiries are widening. The
agency has also asked local tax offices to investigate sub-contractors and
suppliers suspected of concealing payments from construction groups.
The five companies implicated have been temporarily banned from bidding for
some public works contracts, causing most of them to reduce profits
forecasts for this year.
The psychological pressure on executives has been heavy, as was underlined
when a Shimizu regional finance manager was taken to hospital on Sunday
after apparently cutting his throat and wrists in a park outside the Tokyo
prosecutors' office. Prosecutors had questioned him earlier.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Yeltsin arrives to wave of Japanese hostility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, arrived in Tokyo late last night
amid a chorus of criticism from opposition politicians and the press.
Mr Yeltsin, leaving Russia for the first time since quelling last week's
violent rebellion, will today meet Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister,
for the first of three discussions before departing tomorrow afternoon.
Japanese security has called 10,000 riot police to Tokyo in anticipation of
nationalist demonstrations against Mr Yeltsin's perceived intransigence over
four islands north of Japan, occupied by Soviet troops at the end of the
second world war, an issue the visit is not expected to resolve. About 300
loudspeaker trucks are expected to approach the Russian embassy and other
parts of central Tokyo today to broadcast insults to Mr Yeltsin.
Opposition to the Russian president's visit extends to the moderate
right-wing Liberal Democratic party, which plans to issue a tough statement
condemning Mr Yeltsin's use of the army against parliamentary rebels.
Several LDP members of parliament have promised to boycott official
receptions for the Russian leader.
Despite these strains, both sides want to use the occasion to improve
relations. However, Mr Hosokawa will express official regret at last week's
bloodshed.
He will also push for progress on the longstanding territorial dispute,
which arouses passions among Japanese and has prevented Russia and Japan
from signing a post-war peace treaty.
Japanese newspaper editorials yesterday were deeply critical of the Russian
situation and Mr Yeltsin. Any desire to improve relations was outweighed by
'mutual bitterness and mistrust', said The Japan Times. This will not change
unless the dispute over the islands is resolved, on which no breakthrough
can be expected this week, it said in an editorial.
The Mainichi Daily News's editorial warned: 'We could find ourselves in a
delicate position were Yeltsin to utilise his visit here for propaganda
purposes to emphasise his legitimacy.
'Hosokawa will need to urge the Russian leader to return to the authentic
road of democracy and check his high- handed stance.'
Interfax news agency quoted Mr Yeltsin as saying before he left Moscow: 'I
hope that this time the Japanese side will not raise the territorial
question and spoil the visit.'

FT  12 OCT 93 / Vietnam reforms praised by IMF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VIETNAM'S market reforms are working well and the country is on track to
catch up with its South-East Asian neighbours, according to the managing
director of the International Monetary Fund, Mr Michel Camdessus.
Speaking at the end of his first day of an official visit to Vietnam, Mr
Camdessus said the government had coped remarkably well since the collapse
of its main supporter, the Soviet Union. He also told his hosts that the IMF
would help Vietnam reschedule its Dollars 4.5bn (Pounds 3bn) debt in
negotiations next month with the Paris Club of government creditors and with
its former allies in Russia.
Mr Camdessus has long been an enthusiastic supporter of Vietnam's market
reforms, which began in 1986, and has previously described the country as a
model of economic transformation. His visit to Hanoi comes a week after the
IMF announced a loan of Dollars 223m to Vietnam, its first new loan to the
country for more than 10 years.
That became possible after President Bill Clinton said in July that his
government would no longer block attempts to repay the Vietnamese debt to
the IMF. A consortium of governments and banks, led by Japan and France,
helped Vietnam to repay its Dollars 140m debt to the IMF. The World Bank and
the Asian Development Bank have since followed the lead of the IMF,
announcing project loans to Vietnam worth more than Dollars 500m. More
projects, worth as much again, are expected to be submitted for approval by
the end of the year.
Vietnam has implemented many market reforms since 1986, allowing farmers and
other producers to sell their products at market prices, rather than selling
them to the state at fixed prices. Hanoi has managed to bring the resulting
inflation under control and boost exports.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Three banks join forces in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE of the strongest of Russia's many fledgling banks are to merge their
operations. With assets of about Rbs1,500bn - high by Russian standards -
they will form one of the largest banks in the country. Pre-tax profits last
year were Rbs20.2bn.
The three banks - Imperial, Yugorsky and Rossiisky Kredit - are backed by
some of the largest companies in Russia.
Gasprom, the huge state gas monopoly, and Lukoil, one of the biggest of the
newly independent oil companies, founded Imperial. A group of western
Siberian oil associations owns Yugorsky, and Rossiisky Kredit's main
shareholders are the Krasnoyarsk aluminium plant and the Tula small-arms
enterprise.
The merger, announced yesterday by the news agency Interfax, appears to have
been undertaken because the strengths of the banks are complementary. Mr
Sergei Rodionov, chairman of Imperial and a former head of the Russian
central bank's supervisory department, said Yugorsky had a large portfolio
of investment projects, Rossiisky Kredit had one of the most extensive
retail branch networks and Imperial had advanced technology and banking
skills.
This is the first big merger of substantial Russian banks, which normally
preserve their recent independence jealously. It is also aimed at
strengthening the still weak institutions against the feared, and slowly
advancing, foreign competition.
The central bank, although supporting some measures of protectionism, has
opposed a full ban on the operations of foreign banks, as sought by the
former Russian parliament.
Mr Rodionov said one aim of the merger was to cut credit risks, since more
than 70 per cent of future investment projects would be undertaken from the
banks' own portfolios which they would see through 'from beginning to end'.

<TEXT>
THE Balladur government today faces its first serious bout of industrial
unrest since taking power last spring with French airline, railway,
telecommunications and postal workers planning strikes or stoppages.
The public sector companies affected by disputes, triggered by government
attempts to curb its pay bill, include Air France, the railway operator
SNCF, and RATP, which runs the regional transport system around Paris.
Air France has warned that it may be able to provide only half its scheduled
flights. The railway network is also likely to be disrupted by the SNCF
stoppage, as it was last week on some lines. RATP employees plan to stop
work for two hours in the late morning and early evening.
There will also be stoppages among utility workers at France Telecom and at
EDF-GDF, the electricity and gas group, where employees have threatened to
run only a limited service.
Retail price inflation accelerated in September, as prices rose 0.4 per cent
during the month, taking the annualised increase to 2.3 per cent, according
to provisional figures from Insee, the statistics institute.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Yeltsin calls poll for both houses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday issued a decree to hold
elections to both houses of the Federal Assembly on December 11 and 12, in a
further attempt to squeeze opposition in the regions.
He had originally announced that only the lower house - the state duma  -
would be elected, with the upper house - the federation council - comprising
heads of councils and heads of administrations of the regions and republics.
However, the virtual suspension of the councils, and the sacking of a number
of administrators who supported the parliament in the struggle between it
and the president, had rendered the original plan obsolete.
Though details of the decree, signed before Mr Yeltsin left for Japan, were
lacking, the official Tass news agency said two deputies would be elected to
the Federal Assembly from each of the 88 regions and republics in Russia.
With this decree, the president has now largely completed a plan to hold a
range of council elections in December. However, many believe the time is
too short.
So far, the president has decreed elections to the state duma (450 seats,
with an equal number elected from party lists and single-member
constituencies), decreed elections to the Federal Assembly (166 seats), and
recommended elections to the regional and republican councils.
The functions of the councils have mainly been transferred under the control
of presidentially-appointed administrators in the regions pending new
elections. A commission is due to report on reform of the regional councils
by Friday.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Belarus finds breaking up is hard to do: Matthew Kaminski
and Anthony Robinson report on a state which had independence thrust upon it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MATTHEW KAMINSKI and ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British government is giving a high profile welcome this week to Mr
Piotr Krauchanka, foreign minister of Belarus, a state which had
independence thrust upon it by the break-up of the Soviet Union.
The UK side will show appreciation for the Belarus decision to relinquish
its inherited nuclear weapons and give assurances that London values the
independence of the new state. But the Foreign Office will be wary of giving
open support to Belarus in its competition with the Czech Republic for a
seat on the UN Security Council.
Unlike the Baltic states, which were freed to return to their historical and
cultural roots, Belarus never had an independent identity and faces an
unclear future, with few resources and no natural borders or clearly defined
reason for existence.
Until recently, oil and raw materials, imported mostly from Russia at
subsidised prices, fuelled heavy industry, which accounts for 56 per cent of
national income. But trade links with the former Soviet states have been
disrupted, leading to a 10 per cent drop in production and a trade deficit
of 3.6 per cent of gross domestic product last year.
An unstable currency adds to the anxiety of the republic's 10.7m people. The
Belarus payment coupon, printed last year to cover a shortage of Russian
roubles, has lost 30 per cent of its value against the rouble and 120 per
cent against the dollar since mid-summer. Inflation hit 32 per cent in July,
and unofficially went above 40 per cent in August, mirroring the spiral in
Ukraine, another economic basket-case beyond the southern border.
Until the break-up, Belarus boasted the former Soviet Union's highest living
standards and, even last year, GDP fell only a relatively modest 4.6 per
cent. But a lack of monetary control, declining oil supplies from Russia and
a breakdown in the inter-state payments system have contributed to 13 per
cent decline in GDP since January.
Economic hardship has encouraged many of the republic's Soviet-era political
leaders to try to re-establish closer links with Russia and the other former
Soviet states.
On September 7, Belarus signed a currency union treaty with Russia and three
central Asian republics.
On September 24, it joined an economic union pact with nine republics. Under
both arrangements, the government in Minsk would leave monetary, tax, trade
and bank policy to Moscow.
Belarusian politicians across the country's monochromic spectrum openly hope
that economic fidelity will salvage preferential trade treatment, including
an estimated 50 per cent subsidy on Russian oil imports.
This would underline dependence on its eastern neighbour, which supplies 70
per cent of all imports, and take some of the urgency out of efforts to
restructure its economy, particularly the industrial sector. But, with debts
to Russia of around Rbs340bn for oil and Rbs100bn for natural gas, and an
expected Dollars 500m-Dollars 1bn balance of payments deficit this year, the
still largely unreformed economy offers little alternative.
Recent history, however, points against successful reintegration.
The Commonwealth of Independent States, headquartered in Minsk, the Belarus
capital, failed to stem the drop in trade and Moscow seems increasingly
unwilling - and unable - to foot the bill for a return to an expensive
old-style union. The latest economic pacts still have to be approved by the
respective legislatures.
Unlike the neighbouring Baltic states, Belarus has a weak base for
nationalism, although Mr Zenon Pozniak, leader of the opposition nationalist
Popular Front party, has tried to rekindle a sense of nationhood separate
from Russia.
Unreconstructed Communists control the government and economic reform, stuck
in the mud, has not yielded needed tax and bankruptcy laws. A voucher
privatisation programme, passed by parliament this summer after 18 months of
debate, is only due to start next July.
Prices are grudgingly being liberalised. On October 1, rent and hot water
bills rose ten-fold and threefold, respectively, and were accompanied by an
85 per cent minimum wage rise. But higher energy prices last month only
brought them up from 5 per cent to 20 per cent of cost.
Western advisers advocate setting up an independent currency but Belarus
seems scared to take the plunge, largely because old hands at Gosekonplan,
the central planning agency, hold more power than the weak national bank and
Finance Ministry, the two centres of reformist effort.
A heavily militarised industrial base, and broad swathes of farmland heavily
contaminated by the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986, are the main
legacies of the Soviet past which need correcting. Output at military plants
was halved last year but conversion to civilian products lacks money and
ideas.
Unlike Ukraine, Belarus has given up nuclear missiles on its territory,
prompting praise but only Dollars 75.3m in aid from Washington -
strengthening anti-reform and pro-Moscow tendencies in the government which
argue that Belarus has surrendered its potential nuisance value and received
little in exchange from the west.
Mr Vyacheslav Kebich, the conservative prime minister, leads efforts to
forge a military union with Russia, over the objections of Mr Stanislav
Shushkevich, parliamentary speaker and head of state.
However, Mr Shushkevich, a centrist, lacks a political base. A no-confidence
motion, albeit lacking a quorum, gained an overwhelming majority in July.
Parliament may try to topple him from office again this autumn, further
frustrating reform.
Public discontent is rising. A recent survey showed 75 per cent of the
people reporting a falling standard of living and only 1.5 per cent claiming
an improvement.
Mass protest has never been a staple of Belarusian politics. But concern
that economic hardship could push both Belarus and Ukraine back into a
reconstituted Russian imperial structure have jump-started western aid, and
aroused concern among long-term western planners.
The International Monetary Fund in July approved a Dollars 98m credit, the
first tranche of a Dollars 193m systemic transformation facility, for
unspecified use, and the World Bank is continuing negotiations on a Dollars
120m rehabilitation loan.

RUSSIA could conclude an agreement on its commercial debt in a few weeks, Mr

payments on debts to commercial banks which have been subjected to 90-day
rollovers until now.
Moscow had set aside Dollars 500m (Pounds 331m) for London Club debt
servicing this year, to be paid in three instalments of Dollars 166m, Mr
Shokhin said.
Russia had failed to conclude a rescheduling agreement with western
commercial banks in Frankfurt last week because of outstanding disagreements
and the banks' desire to consult further among themselves.

RUSSIA could conclude an agreement on its commerical debt in a few weeks, Mr
Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister for foreign economic relations,
said yesterday. It would then start making payments on debts to commercial
banks which have been subjected to 90-day rollovers until now.
Moscow had set aside Dollars 500m (Pounds 331m) for London Club debt
servicing this year, to be paid in three instalments of Dollars 166m, Mr
Shokhin said.
Russia had failed to conclude a rescheduling agreement with western
commercial banks in Frankfurt last week because of outstanding disagreements
and the banks' desire to consult further among themselves.
One of the problems had been Russia's refusal to drop its 'sovereign
immunity'. This would have given creditors unlimited claim over all
state-owned assets, which were considerably greater in Russia than in other
countries, he said. Russia was prepared only to grant a more limited
government guarantee for debt repayments.
But Mr Shokhin claimed an agreement could have been signed in Frankfurt had
it not been for a desire by the small steering committee of bankers, which
conducted the negotiations, to consult the 600 banks they represent.
He also announced plans to begin dealing with the arrears owed to companies
which had supplied goods to the Russian government. He invited them to form
'creditor clubs' in each country, which would then negotiate on behalf of
all suppliers with a special committee for managing Russia's foreign debts.

Denmark's central bank cut the official discount rate and one of its other
key short-term interest rates from 8.25 per cent to 7.75 per cent yesterday,
writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen.
It is the third discount rate cut since the kroner came under speculative
pressure at the end of July, when the rate was increased by two full points
to 9.25 per cent. The bank said that the latest cut reflected a return to
calm on foreign exchanges. NEWS IN BRIEF

French retail price inflation accelerated in September, as prices rose 0.4
per cent during the month, taking the annualised increase to 2.3 per cent,
according to provisional figures from Insee, the statistics institute,
writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
The figures show a quickening of the recent trend. French consumer prices
were virtually static over the summer, rising by 0.1 per cent in July and
stabilising in August.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Italy rallies to Delors call to close EC ranks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government has thrown its full weight behind the plans of Mr
Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, for a political
initiative to renew the impetus for closer European integration.
This emerged in Rome yesterday after talks between Mr Delors and Mr Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi, the Italian prime minister.
Mr Delors said that without a political initiative or 'at least a
politico-economic' initiative the EC risked becoming little more than a free
trade area 'without a soul or common purpose'.
Mr Ciampi told a joint news conference he was considering proposals to
relaunch the EC via a declaration by the six original signatories to the
1958 Treaty of Rome. Spain, he said, would also be invited to participate
since the Gonzalez government had given a clear demonstration of its
commitment to the European ideal.
It was unclear how far Mr Delors supported Mr Ciampi's idea. Mr Ciampi for
his part has let it be known Italy is keen to play an active part at the
forthcoming EC summit.
The proposal to return to the core signatories of the Rome treaty, plus
Spain, appears a formula whereby Italy reiterates its belief in the aims of
the Maastricht treaty - even if it is unlikely to be able to satisfy the
convergence criteria essential for monetary union. This shifts the emphasis
away from a two-tier Community based on the ability to comply with
convergence criteria and concentrates on those countries, like the UK, whose
political support remain ambiguous.
Mr Ciampi is a convinced European and yesterday made clear he had no qualms
about renouncing national sovereignty in moving closer towards closer
European integration. Although the lira continues to float outside the
exchange rate mechanism, he endorses monetary union and has frequently said
the mistake had been to move too slowly towards this goal.
During his brief period in office he has sought to improve relations with
Brussels and alter Italy's reputation as a partner that talks loudly of the
European ideal yet fails to implement EC regulations.
Italy's industry minister, Mr Paolo Savona, has withdrawn his surprise
resignation at the weekend which was provoked by a row over privatisation
plans for state industries, Reuter reports, quoting national television.
Mr Ciampi had earlier urged him to reconsider his decision. The prime
minister's spokesman said Mr Savona had expressed satisfaction with the
contents of a letter from Mr Ciampi and had decided to change his mind.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Serbs halt relief to siege enclaves

   PALE, BOSNIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SERB fighters yesterday prevented UN relief convoys reaching up to 150,000
people trapped in two besieged Moslem enclaves in north Bosnia.
The inhabitants of Maglaj and Tesanj, northern Bosnia. issued an appeal,
broadcast on Sarajevo radio, for the outside world to relieve their plight.
The appeal warned that the mostly Moslem population was barely surviving
after 'months without water or electricity lacking adequate supplies of food
and medicine'.
It criticised the 'indifference' of the international community and called
for the opening of land routes.
Overland convoys have been blocked by Serb and Croat forces vying for
control of the region from the outgunned, mostly Moslem Bosnian army.
Emergency airdrops have been the only relief supplies to reach the towns,
cut off for more than three months.
David White adds: Lt Gen Philippe Morillon, former commander of UN forces in
Bosnia, yesterday put his weight behind calls for placing the country under
provisional UN control.
'If the present leaders really don't succeed in finding a solution urgently
and if they carry on being overtaken by their most extreme supporters - and
it is a real problem - won't it be time to set up a provisional UN
protectorate?' he asked in a speech to the Royal United Services Institute
in London.
He recognised that this would be costly but warned that if a purely Moslem
state were created in the middle of Bosnia the country might become a
long-term source of tension comparable to the Middle East.
Islamic fundamentalism would be given a chance it never had before in the
former Yugoslavia, he said.
The UN could try to 'freeze' the present situation and prevent the three
proposed states of a partitioned Bosnia from driving out minorities.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MAJORITY of European Community member states yesterday rallied behind
proposals to spend Ecu13.1bn (Pounds 10.1bn) on EC research and development
programmes over the next five years.
But ministers from the EC's biggest paymasters - Germany, Britain and France
 -said they could not agree with the European Commission's proposal for
funding of the 1994-98 'framework' programme.
All three believe Ecu13.1bn is too much. France is said to favour Ecu11bn or
Ecu12bn over five years, while Britain and Germany have not yet put forward
a figure.
The debate was expected to go on as research ministers tried to reach an
initial consensus on the cost and content of the programme, which still has
to be discussed by the European Parliament.
National officials said they expected ministerial discussions on the content
of the framework programme to be even more difficult than agreement on the
budget.
Yesterday's meeting in Luxembourg was the first in what could be a
particularly gruelling series of ministerial meetings, parliamentary debates
and consultations about the fourth framework programme.
The proposal requires unanimous approval of member states. If the European
Parliament disagrees with ministers, the plan could also become subject to
the new and complex conciliation procedure between council and Parliament,
laid out in the Maastricht treaty. That could draw out the legislative
process for more than a year. An EC compromise proposal could help speed
agreement on a 50-nation east-west treaty aimed at encouraging energy
investment in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
Talks on the treaty, which will put the aims of the 1991 European energy
charter into action, have reached 'a decisive stage', according to
organisers of the international negotiations, and agreement may be reached
'early next year'.
Reporting on last week's round of talks, Mr Charles Rutten, chairman of the
energy charter conference, said a number of controversial issues such as
transit rights and disputes settlement procedure had already been settled.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS by Chancellor Helmut Kohl to secure full government backing for his
controversial presidential candidate, Mr Steffen Heitmann, were thrown into
disarray yesterday. The Free Democrats, junior partner in the coalition,
backed another candidate.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister and head of the FDP, said he
would support Mrs Hildegard Hamm-Brucker, a 73-year-old political scientist,
and former state secretary at the foreign ministry, in next May's
presidential election to choose a successor to Mr Richard von Weizsacker.
His announcement ends weeks of speculation and internal debate about whether
the FDP should support Mr Heitmann, or Mr Johannes Rau, the opposition
Social Democrats' candidate. It also means that Saxony's justice minister -
and Mr Kohl's personal choice - could lose, or be forced into a second round
of voting.
Mr Kinkel has opted for Mrs Hamm-Brucker largely because of the controversy
surrounding Mr Heitmann, officials said yesterday. Last month, Mr Heitmann
said in an interview that the Nazi era belonged to a period of German
history which had closed following the end of the cold war. The World Jewish
Congress has also urged opposition to his candidacy.

NORWEGIAN opposition to EC membership has risen to a record 60 per cent, up
from 58 per cent registered just days ahead of last month's general election
which propelled the staunchly anti-EC Centre party to main oppostion status,
writes Karen Fossli in Oslo.
The poll, published yesterday in the daily Dagbladet, saw those in favour of
membership slip to 28 per cent from 31 per cent last month.
Opposition to membership within the ranks of the governing Labour party rose
to 36 per cent (28 per cent).

FT  12 OCT 93 / Ireland invests to create jobs: Government plans IPounds
20bn spending in six years
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SIX-YEAR plan for investment of IPounds 20bn (Pounds 19bn), the largest
and most ambitious in Ireland's history, was unveiled yesterday by Mr Albert
Reynolds, the Irish prime minister.
The package aims to achieve an average 3.5 per cent annual growth rate in
gross domestic product up to the end of the decade.
The government expects to create some 200,000 jobs as a result of the
investment, although the net effect, allowing for job losses in declining
sectors, may be only around 10,000-15,000 additional jobs a year. This is
still a long way short of the number of young people entering the workforce
each year - almost 70,000.
Funding for the plan will be partly from European Community structural and
cohesion funds (IPounds 8bn), matching exchequer funds of IPounds 8bn and a
further IPounds 4bn expected to come from the private sector.
Public and private sector investment targeted under the 1994-99 National
Development Plan will in effect be double that from 1989-93, with over 50
per cent earmarked for the priority sectors of industry, transport, training
and energy.
Private sector investment is expected to concentrate in the industrial
sector, with indigenous industry to receive greater government support than
in the past.
EC funds are to be channelled primarily towards training - with particular
emphasis on the long-term unemployed - and upgrading of the road and rail
network. Public sector investment, sourced from the exchequer and generated
from within public sector enterprises, is to be weighted towards training,
energy, telecommunications and development of small and medium enterprises.
A total of IPounds 3.7bn is earmarked for industry, followed by IPounds
3.1bn to be spent on training programmes. The plan notes that 75 per cent of
the registered unemployed have no school qualifications and 40 per cent have
not gone beyond primary school education.
IPounds 1.1bn is to be spent on the primary road network, including
completion of motorway links around the capital and improved access to
Dublin port, while IPounds 330m is to be spent on public transport,
including IPounds 200m for a light rail transit system to ease traffic
congestion in Dublin.
IPounds 1.2bn is targeted at local development intiatives, in particular
small and medium-sized enterprises, while IPounds 1.5bn is aimed at farming
and forestry.

<TEXT>
CHINA raised the stakes yesterday in its tense standoff with Britain over
Hong Kong when it warned that it would scrap the colony's legislature after
1997 if the two sides fail to reach agreement on arrangements for an orderly
transition.
Mr Jiang Enzhu, China's vice foreign minister, issued what amounted to
Beijing's clearest threat yet that it would not abide by the results of
elections if they had not been held under rules agreed between the two
sides.
'If an agreement cannot be reached, there's nothing extraordinary about that
either. Under that circumstance, the organs elected in 1994 and 1995 will
terminate on June 30 1997,' Mr Jiang told reporters.
China's chief negotiator was speaking before sitting down for the 13th round
of talks on the vexed Hong Kong issue with Britain's ambassador in Beijing,
Sir Robin McLaren.
Hong Kong governor Chris Patten warned last week that within a 'matter of
weeks' he would be obliged to present to the Legislative Council (Legco) a
bill extending the franchise for local elections due in 1994 and Legco in
1995.
China is bitterly opposed to Mr Patten's democratic reforms, claiming they
run counter to agreements reached in the 1980s over the future of the colony
which reverts to Chinese rule in July 1997.
Mr Jiang's threat would mean that, in the absence of agreement between
Beijing and London there would be no 'through train' after the handover.
This refers to legislators elected for four years continuing to serve after
the Chinese takeover.
British and Chinese officials declared that their talks in Beijing on the
future of Hong Kong were at a 'crossroads'.
Sir Robin McLaren agreed that the talks were at a 'crossroads', and said
'the question at issue is whether we can make a success of these talks or
not'.
'We believe that if the political will is there on both sides, and working
within the framework we have set for ourselves . . . it should be perfectly
possible to reach agreement on arrangements for 1994-95 elections which are
open, fair and acceptable to Hong Kong.'

FT  12 OCT 93 / Trade gap widens as exports to EC falter: Rise in producer
prices adds to uncertainty over upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH uncertainties about whether the UK recovery can be sustained emerged
yesterday after official figures showed a widening of the trade deficit and
a gradual increase in prices of manufactured goods.
The deficit on visible trade for the first seven months of the year was
Pounds 8.7bn, compared with Pounds 7bn for the same period last year,
according to the Central Statistical Office.
The deterioration was mainly due to a poor export performance in the
European Community, where Britain does more than half its external trade.
The shortfall in trade with EC countries was Pounds 848m, the biggest for
two years.
Manufacturers' prices, excluding the volatile food, drink, tobacco and
petrol sectors, rose 3 per cent in the year to September. That compares with
a 2.7 per cent rise in the year to August. Month-on-month prices rose a
seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent. The rises came in spite of subdued raw
material costs and low wage costs.
Underlying producer price inflation has been creeping up since April and is
now rising at its fastest rate for 2 1/2 years, according to the CSO. The
market shrugged off the news ahead of a busy week for economic indicators,
including retail price inflation figures tomorrow.
UK government bond prices were marginally lower across the board.
The inflation figures also contained good news. Prices of raw materials and
fuel used by manufacturers rose 3.5 per cent in the year to September,
sharply lower than the August rate of 6.3 per cent.
Month-on-month input prices fell by 1.5 per cent, reflecting a decline in
the prices of raw materials, particularly metals, crude oil and food
manufacturing materials. Seasonally adjusted, the index dropped by 2 per
cent month-on-month, the biggest monthly fall since June 1986.
The input price figure was further subdued by a stronger pound in September.
Sterling rose by 2.2 per cent against the dollar between August and
September, making imported raw materials cheaper. That compares with a 4.2
per cent drop in the exchange rate bet-ween August and September last year.
Overall, producer prices rose 4.2 per cent in the year to September,
slightly lower than in August when the rate was 4.3 per cent. The difference
between the path of the overall index and the underlying index can be
explained by petrol prices, which have been falling.

FT  12 OCT 93 / Salaryman takes on might of corporate Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR HARUO KAWAGUCHI is an unlikely challenger to the might of corporate
Japan. A company man down to his blue suit, white shirt and nondescript tie,
he is fighting for the right not to be selflessly loyal in a society that
counts on it.
Mr Kawaguchi has taken his employer, Teikoku Hormone Manufacturing, to court
to get compensation for a six-year separation from his family that was the
consequence of a standard career move in Japan: a transfer from his
Tokyo-based family to Nagoya.
Mr Kawaguchi, a 47-year-old middle-class administrative officer, has
challenged the fairness of what is known as tanshin funin, in which husbands
are routinely obliged to accept the solitary life of a distant transfer away
from their family.
'I am becoming famous. You know they mentioned me on TV last week. The
commentator said he sympathised with me,' he said.
He has just lost the first round, but the case has touched a nerve in Japan
because of a widespread sense that the traditional contract binding
companies and workers for life is up for renegotiation.
Mr Kawaguchi was seeking compensation for the six years he lived away from
his family, as his wife was unable to leave her job and he would have been
in danger of dismissal had he refused the order to move.
The court found he had 'no justified reason' to refuse the transfer.
'I think it is a terrible thing that a father misses seeing his children
grow,' he says. 'No, I don't believe that work itself is the only thing in
life. You have to enjoy life and share things with your family. The company
told me I was selfish when I first complained, but I think companies are too
strong in Japan. Life has many aspects: your family, the company and the
community, and you can't only devote yourself to the company,' said this
mild-mannered and polite rebel.
A survey of salaried workers of Mr Kawaguchi's kind by Meiji Mutual Life
Insurance suggested 66.5 per cent believed that a merit-based system of
employment will take root in Japan, replacing the hierarchy that rewards
time-serving and suffering in silence.
Asked what they most wanted from their companies, 44.5 per cent of the 800
salaried workers surveyed said 'work worth working for', while 42.6 per cent
wanted employment that used their skills; 35 per cent said 'working at my
pace', which means allowing time for personal priorities. Only 17.1 per cent
selected 'higher salary'.
But the Kawaguchi case suggests change will not come as quickly as the
salarymen would like. The Tokyo district court ruled it is 'not unfair' for
a company to transfer an employee to a distant post: 'A transfer order
cannot be considered illegal on the ground that it harms the stability of a
family or changes the children's educational environment.'
Mr Kawaguchi is likely to appeal against the court's decision, but he will
also keep his job at Teikoku Hormone. He was careful to play by the
company's rules and wants to serve out his time until retirement.
The company says it has no reason to dismiss him, but also no cause to
regret the original transfer.
'We gave a very normal and reasonable order at the time. It is a common
thing in Japanese society and the court judgment naturally reflected that,'
Teikoku Hormone said.
'We have no intention to fire him. He is performing his sales work normally,
doing the average job.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UN OFFICIALS said relief convoys headed for two besieged Bosnian Moslem
towns were held up at the last moment yesterday by Serb authorities in Banja
Luka, contrary to earlier UN reports, Reuter reports from Sarajevo.
Mr Ray Wilkinson, a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR), had said earlier the convoy had left the north Bosnian town of
Banja Luka, but he said Serb authorities halted the convoy despite giving
verbal permission previously.
'We didn't get final approval,' Mr Wilkinson said. 'We got every signature
except one.'
He said the convoy would stay in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Banja Luka
for the night, and was hoping to try again today.
The two convoys were carrying 250 tonnes of aid for the Moslem towns of
Maglaj and Tesanj, which have been cut off from food deliveries by road
since June.
The UN estimates nearly 150,000 people are trapped in the Maglaj pocket in
northern Bosnia, where Serb and Croat forces have encircled Moslem troops.
The convoy left Zagreb for the Maglaj area after lengthy negotiations
between UNHCR officials and Serb authorities.
This would be the first UN aid convoy into the Maglaj pocket since June 1.
The last UN convoy into the area was shelled outside Maglaj and three relief
workers were killed.
The Maglaj region, where hundreds of people were reported to have been
killed in repeated bombardments during the five-month joint Serb-Croat
siege, was shelled again on Saturday, according to Sarajevo radio.

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BONN government plan to rescue loss-making eastern German steelmaker Eko
Stahl was unacceptable but a European Community ministerial meeting next
month might thrash out a compromise, the European Commission said yesterday,
Reuter reports from Bonn.
'The Commission cannot accept the current plan to build new capacity with
more than half the money coming from public finances,' the Bonn mission of
the EC's executive body said in a statement.
It added that the Community's industry commissioner, Mr Martin Bangemann,
thought the aid for Eko, if approved by the meeting of industry and
economics ministers on November 18, would jeopardise EC steel policy.
The Commission wants to broker a deal among EC steelmakers that would
encourage them to slash their combined annual capacity by 30m tonnes in a
sector dogged by slumping demand and cheap eastern European imports. It only
permits government restructuring aid to steelmakers if the help is tied to
plant closures or other capacity cuts. The Eko plan would involve DM1bn of
aid to modernise cold rolling facilities at Eko's Eisenhuttenstadt plant
near the Polish border and build a new but relatively small mill with annual
capacity of 900,000 tonnes.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Finland (13): Apply the birch gently - Christopher
Brown-Humes on saunas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE foreign businessman on a trip to Finland should prepare himself for a
visit to the sauna. The chances are that your host will invite you - all the
big companies have their own saunas, but the venue could equally well be a
hotel or public sauna. It could even be that that vital deal is clinched
over a relaxing post-sauna drink.
The first thing the visitor should understand is that natural modesty needs
to be cast aside. The Finnish custom is to take the sauna naked and any
attempt to conceal business lunch flab or other physical attributes will
only attract strange looks.
In principle, the routine is simple. You shower, you sweat in a
wooden-planked hot-room for a few minutes, you cool down with a swim, and
then you retire to drink, feeling the day's tension palpably ebbing from
your system as you do so. The cycle is usually repeated at least twice.
However, the uninitiated should be on the alert. For a start, there is the
question of how long you can stick the heat. Watch out for the sadist in
your group who delights in throwing water onto the heated sauna stones to
intensify the humidity. The paranoid will conclude he is doing it
deliberately to test your resistance level.
Then you need to know how to handle the bundle of birch leaves which will
almost certainly be thrust into your hand as you enter the hot room of a
country sauna. It is not to be used to thrash your fellow bathers (despite
the temptation to take revenge on the sadist) but gently applied to your own
torso to stimulate circulation of the blood and aid perspiration.
Finally, there is the cold swim routine. In the countryside, that almost
certainly means a plunge into a freezing lake, rather than a swimming pool.
Your hosts will graciously tell you this bit is optional, but in practice it
is as difficult to avoid as an invitation to sing in a Japanese karaoke bar.
Two notions need to be disabused. One is that you will be plied with liberal
quantities of alcohol to assist the perspiration process. At public saunas,
only soft drinks and alcohol-free beers are on sale. In a private sauna, it
is more likely that you will be offered something stronger.
Secondly, you must forget the idea that you will be nudging up to a member
of the opposite sex in the hot room. In all public saunas, men and women are
strictly segregated.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Finland (12): The horse has bolted - Hugh Carnegy
finds caution as well as optimism at the banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN HIS splendidly august office, complete with grand landscape oil paintings
and a loudly ticking grandfather clock, Mr Pertti Voutilainen reflects, in
measured terms, on the prospects for recovery at Kansallis-Osake-Pankki. He
took over last year as its chief executive in the midst of an unprecedented
crisis.
'In February we promised to halve our 1992 losses of FM3.7bn this year. We
anticipate break-even will come at the end of 1994 and that 1995 will be
profitable for us,' he says. 'If we look at developments so far this year,
we are a little bit ahead of that trend. But there are risks still awaiting
us and I don't think I can promise a significantly better development than
we estimated previously.'
Mr Voutilainen's sober assessment of the outlook at Finland's leading bank
catches the mood in the sector as a whole a year after the immense depth of
the losses sustained by the country's financial institutions became clear.
In step with the economy as a whole, there are signs of recovery, thanks
largely to the steep fall in interest rates this year. But the backlog of
credit losses is so large that a return to profit is likely to take another
two years.
'Our non-performing loans have stabilised now and our credit losses are
going down,' says Mr Vesa Vainio, chief executive of Unitas, KOP's main
rival, which ran up a loss in 1992 of FM2.7bn. 'We see a turnaround in our
bank, in spite of a further big loss this year and next year as well.
Banking operations as such are profitable.'
So great was the disaster that overtook Finland's banks - like those of
Sweden and Norway - that the state was forced to step in with guarantees and
infusions of capital to keep the system afloat. 'If we had not, we would
have had no banking system left,' says Mr Jorma Aranko, head of the Bank
Supervisory Authority. 'It would have been a total shambles.'
The crisis erupted when a severe recession, induced in large part by the
loss of Finland's trade with the Soviet Union, pricked a grossly inflated
lending bubble - much of it in foreign currency - that had followed
liberalisation of foreign exchange and other financial regulation in the
mid-1980s. Rising interest rates and sliding asset values then wreaked havoc
on the banks.
None escaped without resort to some government assistance. The two main
players in the savings bank sector, Skopbank and the Savings Bank of
Finland, had to be taken over by the state, which set up the Government
Guarantee Fund to administer the crisis. The government has budgeted some
FM60bn in rescue capital for the fund, much of which has already been spent.
A recent Bank of Finland paper showed the banks as a whole had
non-performing assets of FM55bn at the end of 1992 - nearly 10 per cent of
their loans and guarantees - after write-offs of FM22bn. Nearly 60 per cent
of these bad assets were attributed to corporate lending, with the bulk
spread through real estate, trading companies, tourism and construction.
Just over 21 per cent of bad loans were to the household sector.
A year later, the picture undoubtedly looks rosier. KOP cut its losses in
the first seven months to FM768m, from FM2.3bn in the same period of 1992.
Unitas losses in the first eight months fell to FM1.01bn from FM1.31bn the
year before. Operating profits before credit losses rose fivefold to FM881m.
Both banks believe they will now survive the crisis without resort to state
aid beyond the preference capital each has received. The government has
pledged to guarantee bond issues by the banks. But for now at least, the big
two have successfully turned independently to the markets to recapitalise
and ensure they remain above the 8 per cent minimum international capital
adequacy ratio. KOP has raised more than FM2bn this year in share and bond
issues and plans to raise similarly a further FM2bn. Unitas is meanwhile
raising more than FM1.5bn.
If the economy stays on track for a slow recovery next year and interest
rates remain at the present low levels, the banks should return to
profitability in 1995. The government is also hoping that the
recapitalisation process - both through state and private funds - will avert
a 'credit crunch' that could choke off the much-yearned for upturn in
economic activity.
But several unresolved issues hang over the banking sector. Chief among
these are the savings banks. The government has kept them afloat, but at
great expense, prompting protests of unfair competition from rival
commercial banks and calls for them to be sold off or closed down from some
senior politicians.
KOP and Unitas are both interested in acquiring at least some of these banks
and have had talks to that end with the authorities. But that has prompted
concern about their achieving too great a market share. The issue overlaps
with the question of reducing the generally acknowledged overcapacity in
Finnish banking. STS, the sixth largest bank, was taken over by KOP this
year. But the authorities appear undecided over how to proceed with the
savings banks, the obvious candidates in any further restructuring.
Last, but not least, is the question of whether the system as a whole has
learned the lessons of the past two years. All the banks have tightened the
way they handle credit control. Unitas, for example, has a board member
whose sole task is risk control and a team of 15 credit specialists. The
bank now takes account of cash flow as well as collateral when assessing
loan requests.
The state, meanwhile, has moved to extend the powers and resources of the

for the first time and is acquiring the power to monitor all divisions of a

'It is far too late, in a way, as the horse has already bolted,' says Mr
Aranko. 'But we have got together with the Bank of Finland to be ready for
the next bank crisis.'

FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Finland (14): Daunting task that faces exporters -
Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION that has jolted Finland over the past three years has, among
its other effects, exposed the extent to which the country is now dependent
on its export industries for a return to growth.
'Increasing merchandise exports and the continuation of structural changes
in export production hold the key to the preservation of economic
well-being,' concluded a recent paper on industrial strategy produced by the
Ministry of Trade and Industry.
An encouraging start has been made, with exports rising at an annual rate of
some 13 per cent this year, thanks in large measure to the sharp decline in
the value of the Finnish markka. The current account deficit has been
slashed and should move to a small surplus next year.
Finland's traditional mainstay - the forestry industry - has contributed to
the export revival, despite the continued weak state of the world market for
its products.
The metal and engineering industries, which now make up the biggest part of
manufacturing output, have also pushed up exports, with such companies as
Nokia, the world's second largest mobile telephone maker, and Metra, a world
leader in diesel engines, improving profits significantly this year.
But the task is a daunting one. 'In order for Finland to start reducing its
foreign indebtedness, the balance of trade must for several years run a
surplus of FM30-40bn - about 30 per cent relative to export revenues. Only
Japan and Germany have been able to sustain such sizeable surpluses,'
commented the ministry in its strategy paper. 'In terms of export growth,
this means an average rise in exports of 6-8 per cent per annum all through
the 1990s.'
Achieving such a target will require a marked expansion of manufacturing
output - which fell as a proportion of GDP in the late 1980s from more than
25 per cent to less than 15 per cent - as well as greater diversification
and greater adaptation to new technologies. But it will also require
structural changes in areas such as labour market rigidities, privatisation
and protection of local industries to maintain the competitive momentum
already given by the devaluation of the markka.
The government believes it has an important role to play in this process,
but not through active promotion of new industries or direct channelling of
resources to favoured sectors.
'There is a need for an industrial policy in Finland, but not in the way of
the old days,' says Mr Matti Vuoria, the trade and industry ministry's top
official. 'We don't want to enter a debate on which industrial branches
Finland should be in - the market will make those decisions.'
Instead, Mr Vuoria says, the intention is to concentrate on development of
infrastructure - particularly transport links in a country distant from most
of its export markets - technology and education and the removal of
protection which in the 1980s sucked too much investment into the 'sheltered
sector'. Finland, he says, has no inherent competitive industrial advantages
and must therefore create them through, for example, the fostering of a
highly educated workforce.
Big changes have already been made in the area of foreign investment - an
area in which Finland has historically ranked among the weakest of western
countries. Legislation allowing foreign ownership of Finnish companies came
into force this year, prompting a wave of foreign sharebuying.
The dearth of local operations by foreign companies is still a feature of
the Finnish economy. But this may also change. Norway's Kvaerner Group now
runs the Masa shipbuilding yard, which this year won the country's biggest
ever export order - a contract to build four liquid natural gas carriers for
Abu Dhabi.
Government action on the privatisation of the 20 per cent of industrial
output that is in state hands has been slower. The state's holding in
Tampella, a big metals group, has been reduced from 90 to 50 per cent. Other
majority or wholly state-owned major companies slated for action include
Neste, the oil and petrochemicals group, Kemira, a chemicals producer,
Outokumpu, the mining and metals concern, and Valmet, the paper machinery
and engineering company. But little has been done beyond the commissioning
of privatisation studies.
In the meantime, the main feature of development among private sector
companies outside the forestry sector has been a trend to shift from
diversified conglomerates to more tightly focused operations, with an
increasing emphasis on overseas activities. Within this trend, the diversity
of activity tends to bear out the industry ministry's analysis that there is
no 'natural' sector for Finnish companies to concentrate on.
Nokia is a prime example. Since a spree of acquisitions in the 1980s, it has
restructured to concentrate on mobile and fixed telecommunications systems,
an area in which Finland has no special tradition.
Another group which has restructured since the 1980s is Huhtamaki, which now
concentrates on confectionery, pharmaceuticals and food packaging. It is a
collection which Mr Timo Peltola, the chief executive, cheerfully admits
offers each other little in the way of synergies, but in which, he says,
Huhtamaki has separately built up a store of expertise.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (10): The allure
fades - The cost of employing workers in western Germany looks especially
high compared with the cost of labour in the fledgling democracies of
eastern Europe / Germany
</HEADLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TEN DAYS ago Chancellor Helmut Kohl told the flower of Germany's business
and financial establishment, assembled in Frankfurt to watch Mr Hans
Tietmeyer being anointed as the new chairman of the Bundesbank, that a
'stability-oriented' monetary policy was the best long-term guarantee for
German growth and jobs.
In the long-term, low inflation and a stable D-mark may indeed preserve the
attractiveness of Standort Deutschland - Germany as a place to do business.
But German industry, currently struggling amid the country's worst recession
since the second world war, may be forgiven for judging high short-term
interest-rates and a strong D-mark - the direct consequences of the
Bundesbank's stability policy - as factors which diminish rather than
enhance Germany's attractions as a business location.
On the very day that Kohl was speaking in Frankfurt, newspapers carried the
story of Daimler-Benz's decision to build a factory for its Mercedes-Benz
automobile subsidiary in the town of Vance in Alabama in the south-east of
the US. Following moves by other German companies to set up manufacturing
facilties abroad, this came as a graphic reminder of the disadvantages of
Germany as a business location.
Taxes are high - taxes and social contribution levies are set to rise to a
record 44 per cent of western German GDP by 1995, reflecting the planned
introduction of a higher mineral oil tax, higher contributions to pensions
insurance, a new solidarity levy, increased wealth tax.
Wages are also high. The reunification of the two Germanies in 1990 brought
about a boom for western German companies. Wages were increased as if these
'boomartig' conditions would carry on for ever: but the special economic
circumstances brought about by reunification died away suddenly in the last
half of 1993. The world recessionary cycle caught up with a vengeance and
GDP for the west of the country will fall by 2.25 per cent this year - the
worst recession in Germany's post-war history - 'there are not many things
to make Germany attractive at present,' sums up Mr Joachim Fels, an
economist at Goldman, Sachs in Frankfurt. ' Geographically the country is at
the heart of the European Community and the new markets in eastern Europe.
But against this you have to weigh the fact that costs are too high, in
particular labour costs.
'German labour used to be highly productive, and the workforce remains
highly educated and used to working in a high-tech manufacturing
environment. But both direct labour costs and indirect labour costs - such
as payroll taxes and social services contributions - are very high. Can
productivity keep up with the rise in costs? The answer is no: unit labour
costs are too high.'
The cost of employing workers in Germany looks especially high when one
takes into account the cost of labour in the fledgling democracies of
eastern Europe.
The quality of workmanship in Hungary or the former Czechoslovakia may not
be up to Germany's fabled levels: but it does come considerably more
cheaply. Goldman Sachs calculated in early 1992 it cost an average of
DM6,575 to employ a worker in western Germany - compared to DM662 in
Hungary, DM401 in the former Czechoslovakia and DM367 in Poland.
TO illustrate what this means in practical terms, KPMG Management Consulting
has put together a case study focussing on a proposed Pounds 100m project to
build new television manufacturing facility. The company is seeking a
greenfield site to build a modern factory which will produce 500,000 units a
year and employ 1,225 people.
Key criteria for chosing the investment location are costs; access to new
growth markets - one of which is the east of germany - together with
dependability of production and supply of components and sub-assembly.
Initial calculations show that labour costs for the factory would amount to
nearly Pounds 45m a year in Germany, Pounds 35m in the Netherlands, about
Pounds 25m a year in the UK and Ireland and about Pounds 3m a year in
Hungary. Set against this is the distance fron the manufacturing site to the
companies main markets, weighted by market size. Taking the UK as 100,
Hungary rates as 145 whilst Germany and France are at around 95.
KPMG then assigned weightings to these and other criteria - the question of
labour costs being five times more important than market proximity and
research capability. Hungary emerges as nine times more attractive than the
UK, its nearest competitor. Taking the UK as 100, Hungary achieves a score
of 450. France and Ireland also score 100. Germany is the least attractive
manufacturing location, with a score of about 70.
A short-list of three locations is drawn up: Manchester in the UK,
Dusseldorf in Germany and Budapest in Germany. At this stage the assessment
of the relative merits of the three possible sites becomes more refined,
taking into account qualitative factors such as sub-suppliers, working
practices, productivity, health, unionisation, manufacturing's share of the
country's GDP, as well as proximity to markets and research capability.
It is clear that according to these qualitative considerations, Hungary is
not as attractive as Germany or the UK. But factor in the costs and Germany
remains the least attractive of the three: in pure profits terms KPMG
calculates that the factory in Dusseldorf would make an annual after-tax
return of Pounds 5.4m compared to Pounds 21.3m in the Manchester and Pounds
20.2m in Bundapest.
If incentives were not available, the investment in Germany would yield a
Pounds 7m loss, reduce the UK profits to Pounds 9m and barely change the
Pounds 20m profit to be made in Hungary.
European companies are making calculations such as these every single day of
the week. Even allowing for qualitative factors, Germany looks unattractive.
Recognising this, the German government has started to address the issue of
German competitiveness, this autumn publishing a paper on securing the
future of Germany's economic base. But the process of adjustment will be
slow and, in the meantime, companies will chose to build their factories in
Manchester or Budapest, rather than Dusseldorf. Or even go as far afield as
Vance, Alabama.

THE OLIVE groves of Provence are not the most obvious location for one of
Europe's most successful business parks, yet nestling among the hills behind
Antibes on the Cote d'Azur is Sophia-Antipolis, a Silicon Valley-style
concentration of hundreds of production plants and offices.
Sophia-Antipolis is the sort of business park that governments tend to like
best.
It was founded as a science park in 1969 on a rocky patch of the Provencal
coast where the quality of the soil was so poor that even the lowliest local
farmers disdained it.
The patchy piece of Provence now houses 900 different companies spread
across 2,300 hectares.
Most of its occupants are subsidiaries of large multinational groups. Many
of the employees are senior executives or skilled technicians who have been
brought in from different regions. But the companies at the park have also
created thousands of jobs for local residents.
Sophia-Antipolis is an expensive place to operate. The rents are high and
each occupant is obliged to respect strict planning controls such as height
restrictions and tree replacement.
Yet, even at a time of widespread European recession, there is a waiting
list of would-be new occupants and Sophia-Antipolis is now regarded as a
role model for business and science parks throughout Europe.
The pros and cons of Sophia-Antipolis as a corporate location are, in many
ways, remarkably similar to those of France itself. Both offer the advantage
of good logistics and a high standard of living, but are burdened by the
disadvantage of comparatively high costs.
One of the main attractions of France to incoming businesses is its position
 -bang in the middle, between northern and southern Europe.
Only a few years ago it looked as though the expansion of eastern Europe
might make more central countries, such as Austria or Germany, more
attractive. But those fears have abated - partly because the challenge of
rebuilding eastern Europe has been so much more complicated than expected
and partly because the cost of operating in Austria and Germany can be even
higher than France itself.
Cordis, a US-owned medical products company, set up a production and
distribution centre at Sophia-Antipolis in 1984.
It has operated in Europe for 25 years from its original base in the
Netherlands, but decided in the early 1980s that it needed another base
which would be more accessible to southern Europe.
The company opted for Sophia-Antipolis, according to Mr Jacques Le Guillerm,
chief executive, mainly because it was in a pleasant environment and close
to an excellent airport.
Ease of access was also one of the main reasons that Disney, the US
entertainment group, chose France as the location for EuroDisneyland, its
extravagant theme park.
EuroDisneyland may have had more than its fair share of financial problems
since its launch in spring last year, but Disney has repeatedly defended its
choice of northern Paris as the park's location.
'The choice of France as the location is one thing that I'm sure we got
absolutely right,' said Mr Michael Eisner, Disney chairman.
The high quality of life in France is another factor that tends to tempt
companies to choose it as a business location.
Tepar, another occupant of Sophia-Antipolis, is the sort of company that
could be based anywhere in Europe.
It is a joint venture between five international oil groups, including
Texaco of the US and Elf Aquitaine of France, that operates a pan-European
payment card for truck drivers.
The only considerations for Tepar in choosing its location were good
communications - its executives need to travel regularly and it needs access
to a sophisticated computer system - the availability of multi-lingual staff
to staff its truckers' helpline and there is a pleasant environment for its
employees.
Mr Carl Clump, its British chief executive, says that southern France
satisfied all those criteria. He commutes to his Sophia-Antipolis office
from his home in rural Provence.
However, France has a significant disadvantage as a business location: cost.
One of the main areas of high expense is property, which is still costly
even after the recent fall in Paris property prices. Moreover, French local
government is so bureaucratic, particularly in areas such as planning, that
any company investing in France has to deal with a barrage of rules and
regulations.
THE employment system is also costly and complex. French workers generally
get a reasonable deal in terms of pay and employment protection. They have a
39-hour working week and guaranteed minimum wage, the Smic or salaire
minimum de croissance of FFr5,900 a month. Employers are obliged to make
substantial social security contributions for their workers and to observe a
relatively low retirement age of 60.
Further, the French trade unions are still comparatively strong -
particularly when it comes to defending members' interests. This scenario of
high costs and a potentially stroppy workforce undoubtedly deters some
companies from investing in the country.
This factor has even persuaded some businesses that are already there to
switch to less expensive locations. Earlier this year, Hoover, the US
household appliances company, cited the cost of operating in France as one
of the main reasons for its decision to switch part of the production at its
Dijon plant to a factory in Scotland. France's new centre-right government
has responded by trying to make the employment system more flexible.
Mr Michel Giraud, employment minister, recently unveiled a package of
proposals which included reducing employers' social security contributions
for low paid workers, replacing the 39-hour week with a more flexible annual
equivalent total and measures to encourage part-time working. It remains to
be seen whether Mr Giraud's measures will succeed.
In the meantime, Sophia-Antipolis shows no sign of suffering - it is now in
the throes of doubling in size to try to accommodate its prospective new
occupants.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Finland (11): Big four forge path to profits -
Christopher Brown-Humes on prospects for the country's leading forestry
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINLAND'S four big listed forestry groups have forged a path back to
profitability despite high debt loads and the ravages of a severely
depressed market. The turnround in their fortunes has driven Finnish
forestry share prices sharply higher over the past 12 months. United Paper
Mills (part of Repola), Enso-Gutzeit and Metsa-Serla expect to make a profit
in 1993, after bouncing back into the black at the four-month stage. Kymmene
will make a loss although it will be far lower than the FM1.36bn deficit
sustained last year.
Relative positions are outlined in more detail below:
Market position: With so many factors in common, the performance of the four
groups is being differentiated both by the extent of their exposure to the
most depressed segments of the market and by the scope of their activities
in France, Germany and other hard currency countries. Kymmene loses out on
both scores: it is Europe's leading producer of fine paper, where
overcapacity is particularly serious, and 50 per cent of its paper is
produced abroad, mainly in hard currency countries.
UPM has 30 per cent of its production abroad, with about half its newsprint
capacity based in French and UK mills. Metsa-Serla and Enso-Gutzeit are less
internationally-orientated: Enso has a fine paper mill in the Netherlands
and a board mill in France, but these account for less than 10 per cent of
production.
More stable market segments have afforded some protection. Tissues have
helped Metsa-Serla - it has 45 per cent of the Nordic market - and it has a
strong position in corrugated board in Finland, Denmark and Greece. UPM has
benefited from its paper converting, speciality papers and board activities
while Kymmene has been helped by its plywood operations.
Results: Nearly all divisions will be profitable in 1993. Kymmene,
Metsa-Serla and Enso-Gutzeit will all see a loss from their fine paper
divisions. Enso and UPM say that their pulp divisions will also record a
deficit.
Investments: Enso-Gutzeit has invested more actively than its rivals in the
past 12 months. It bought 100,000 hectares of forest from Ahlstrom for
FM926m; acquired Tampella Forest and Tambox Europe for FM3.6bn (including
debt); and said it will build a DM800m newsprint plant, based on recycled
paper, in eastern Germany. These moves will lift turnover from FM10.3bn in
1992 to an estimated FM17bn in 1995. Net debt will rise to FM13bn.
A project to build a FM3bn pulp mill at Rauma in eastern Finland has been
drawn up by Metsa-Botnia, a joint venture between Metsa-Serla, UPM, and
Metsaliitto, but financing has still to be finalised. Annual production will
be 500,000 tonnes a year, but it is unlikely to be in operation before
1996-97.
Debt reduction: The four companies are highly geared and all have given debt
reduction a strategic priority. Lower interest rates, positive cash-flow,
reduced investment programmes, and, possibly, new share issues will all help
achieve this aim.
Exploiting strong international investment interest in Finnish forestry,
both Metsa-Serla and Repola have launched successful share issues this year.
Metsa-Serla raised FM543m (Dollars 100m) through an offer of 3.25m new
shares while Repola raised FM445m by offering 8m shares held by
subsidiaries.
Mr Harry Piehl, Kymmene chief executive, speaks for many companies when he
says: 'We can keep our investments low without sacrificing our future,'
reflecting the huge modernisation programmes which Finnish forestry groups
carried out in the late 1980s.
Ownership: The ownership bases of the four companies are distinct and
relatively stable. A spree of foreign buying in the last 12 months,
following the devaluation of the markka and the removal of foreign ownership
restrictions at the start of this year, has increased foreign share
ownership.
One big chunk which could find its way to the market at some stage is
Metsa-Serla's 21 per cent stake in Repola, the hangover of an abortive bid
in 1990. It has a current market value of around FM2.8bn, compared with a
book value of FM2.1bn. Mr Timo Poranen, Metsa-Serla chief executive, says
the stake is not 'essential for our co-operation' with UPM (in wood
procurement and marketing) but says Repola is seen as a good investment.
The Finnish government is also looking at ways to reduce its stake in
Enso-Gutzeit, which, directly and indirectly, amounts to 58 per cent of the
shares and 78 per cent of the votes. Jaakko Poyry, the international
consultany group, and Goldman Sachs have been retained to advise on how the
sell-off can be accomplished and over what period. The most likely
development is a step-by-step reduction of the state's holding over the next
few years.
Market outlook: High export rates make Finnish forestry groups highly
dependent on developments in countries where they sell. With the main
European market expected to remain weak again next year, executives are
cautious about predicting anything more than a modest upturn.
'Demand is growing slowly for all paper grades in central Europe because of
very slow GNP growth,' says Mr Juhani Pohjolainen, executive vice-president
of Enso-Gutzeit. However, the picture is brighter in south-east Asia, and in
the US and Latin America.
Most executives feel prices for fine papers and pulp are unlikely to fall
further, but they warn that overcapacity will only fall away slowly.
'Low pulp prices are a disaster,' says Mr Poranen of Metsa-Serla. 'Weak pulp
prices are behind weak paper prices. It is in everybody's interest that we
have higher pulp prices.'

FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Finland (10): On the defensive - The Environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES

<TEXT>
IT IS as much out of self-interest as concern for the country's natural
habitat that Finland's forestry industry has got serious over environmental
issues.
As the world's second biggest exporters of forestry goods, the country's
pulp and paper producers have had to respond to customer pressures to clean
up their act or risk losing key markets. The green lobby, particularly in
central Europe, has been vociferous in calling for tighter environmental
standards, and the success of their campaign is openly acknowledged by
Finland's senior forestry executives.
'If we rape our forests, pollute our rivers, and dirty our land, customers
will say they don't want anything to do with us,' says Mr Jarl Kohler,
managing director of the Finnish Forest Industries Federation. A boycott
could have a devastating effect on an industry that is already under
pressure from adverse market conditions and the trend towards recycling.
The Finnish forest industry feels it has been unfairly forced onto the
defensive on environmental questions because it is sometimes tarnished with
the same brush as countries in tropical climates, which have gained a
reputation for reckless destruction of their woodlands. It believes its
record on tree-cutting, recycling, and emissions compares favourably with
those of its main competitors, Sweden, the US and Canada.
Finland has more wood today than ever before, thanks to a policy of
'sustainability'. Planting three or four new seedlings for every tree
harvested means the country is growing 80m cubic metres of forestry a year,
but only consuming 50m cu m of them.
At the same time there have been significant changes to methods of
cultivation and harvesting, designed to increase bio-diversity and minimise
damage to the landscape. Large areas of forest are now less likely to be
cleared at one go; instead, they will be gradually thinned. Harvesting
techniques have also changed, with an emphasis on lighter machinery.
'Two-thirds of our forests are in the hands of private owners. It doesn't
make sense for them to harm their livelihood,' says Mr Pertti Laine,
director of the the federation's industrial and environmental unit.
It is sometimes suggested that the recycling movement poses a serious threat
to the future of the Finnish forest industry. The threat is overstated,
firstly because recycled fibre can only be used for certain types of paper
grade, such as newsprint, packaging and tissues, and secondly because there
is a limit to the number of times paper can be recycled. With paper
consumption continuing to grow, despite worldwide recession, recycling has
not has yet had a significant impact on the production of virgin fibre.
The Finns see recycling in the wider context of the recycling of carbon.
Because trees absorb carbon dioxide, and therefore slow the greenhouse
effect, wood is regarded as a perfectly natural recyclable raw material,
providing new growth is systematically assured. That is why the Finns get
hot under the collar about developments in some European countries, which
legally require a certain percentage of magazine paper and newsprint to be
produced from recycled sources.
This could force Finland to import recycled paper, as its own paper
consumption is too small for it to be able to base its production on
domestically recycled material. Alternatively, and perhaps more likely,
Finnish companies will continue to set up recycling plants close to big
population centres in Europe. It is significant that the biggest Finnish
forestry investment project announced this year is Enso-Gutzeit's scheme to
build a DM800m newsprint plant, based on recycled paper, in the eastern
German state of Saxony.
Despite the market situation and the heavy losses they have experienced over
the past two years, Finnish forestry groups have continued to make
significant investments in environmental projects. Last year,
environment-related investments totalled FM740m, or 12 per cent of total
forest industry investments, compared with FM815m in 1991 and FM775m in
1990. Some 65 per cent of the money was spent on measures to combat water
pollution, 33 per cent on air pollution control, and 2 per cent on solid
waste management.
Added to the investments they have already made over the last 10 years, the
Finns can now point to a dramatic lowering of emissions of the major
chemical pollutants. Emissions of sulphur dioxide last year were 18,900
tonnes, down 80 per cent since 1980, while emissions of organic chlorine
compounds were down 60 per cent on their 1989 level at 4,900 tonnes.
At the same time, consumption of chemicals like chlorine has fallen sharply,
thanks to the introduction of new bleaching processes. This development has
come largely in response to consumer pressure for 'totally chlorine-free'
pulp and paper.
The process of environmental improvement still has further to go. The next
stage will come with the new generation of pulp mills, which will have
almost totally enclosed water systems and minimal effluent when they start
production in the second half of the decade.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (8): Where to go for
expert help - Cross-border moves by businesses often run into big problems.
Yet good advice on avoiding potential pitfalls is not hard to find, it just

which seemed absurd, as he had only flown in from the US that morning.
Another couple of faces at the table also started to look vaguely familiar.
He was too busy negotiating with an agent over the cost of office equipment
to investigate further, but the puzzle was solved a few days later in a
local bar after a hefty thump on the back and deafening shout.
'They were old Army buddies I had not seen in years,' he says. 'Like me,
they were setting up German outlets and we had all chosen our old stamping
ground. We were stationed together nearby in the 1960s'.
Every consultant dedicated to preaching the science of location analysis has
a similar story to tell: the Japanese entrepreneur who checked potential
sites against a map of Europe's top golf courses; the British chairman who
insisted on a distribution centre conveniently close to a Riviera marina
where his yacht was berthed; and an Italian who rejected several suggested
cities because the hotels and shopping did not impress his mistress.
But most of the 200 or more of the leading inward investments to Europe each
year are a lot more scientific, according to Stephen Bradley of Plant
Location International, a subsidiary of Price Waterhouse.
Around half call in specialists to organise the whole project and the rest
usually farm out at least some of the tasks, ranging from acquiring
multi-million-dollar buildings to advising on the right car to drive in
Spain.
'The worst problem is when a group gets half way through a project and then
finds it can't handle it,' says John Siraut, of Ernst &amp; Young's European
Location Advisory Service.
'Sometimes you have to push them back to square one, questioning whether
they are even looking at the right areas.'
Big international management groups have been handling cross-border
investments for decades but the tempo has accelerated in the last couple of
years.
Both PW and E&amp;Y dealt with around 30 or 40 developments each over the last
12 months as companies rush to set up inside the Single Market or find new
outlets in eastern Europe.
Other advisers are also treading on their heels for a share of this
expanding market, however. Property consultants have built networks of
offices around Europe which can be tapped for the cross-border acquisition
of sites and premises.
Richard Ellis, for instance, has just developed a master plan for
Hewlett-Packard's properties in Milan and bought a new headquarters site for
L47bn.
The Corporate Property Group also helps companies moving into the UK by
helping choose locations and negotiate with local authorities and arrange
finance.
Jones Lang Wootton claims to have broken the traditional link with landlords
and developers to act purely in the interests of occupiers - 'when a company
asks us to recommend a location, we are not looking to buy or sell buildings
on our books but to find the best deal,' says Andrew Burt, of JLW Corporate
Real Estate Services.
They also go further than rents and prices, delving into other factors such
as labour costs, housing and schools.
His team is currently drawing up an appraisal of Lisbon, looking at
facilities, such as restaurants and hotels.
Another client aiming to set up a software centre wants information on
universities which would provide a stream of graduates.
Finance is another significant factor where advisers can prove invaluable.
Every European country has an army of official information centres, ranging
from individual towns through government development agencies to a network
of European Commission offices dedicated to offering the best deal on
grants, incentives and loans.
Trying to work out the best deal can be daunting, however - 'it can be
crucial, for instance, whether you choose to locate on the Swiss side of the
Italian border or vice versa,' says Mr Bradley.
Grants and incentives are so fiendishly complicated that Price Waterhouse's
guide is more than an inch thick and needs updating each two years.
A more immediate source of costs and incentives for each region called
Eurosite is held by PLI on a computer database.
INDEPENDENT researchers also feed in a growing body of information.
Companies can compare the expense of keeping staff in various locations
through indices for every major city compiled by the PE Centre for
Management Research.
It also produces and constantly updates guides to salary levels and European
personnel policies.
'A successful move often depends on detailed knowledge of non-financial
matters such as whether you need to pay maternity benefits in Spain, where
to get health care in St Petersburg or how to deal with industrial tribunal
procedures in Switzerland,' says Anita Saunders of Hamptons Relocation,
which will be providing house-price information for the PE cost index this
year.
Such legal and cultural quirks are constantly on her mind as she deals with
the least predictable factor in cross-border investment - people.
Most of the leading advisers farm-out movement and resettlement of staff to
specialists like Hamptons because they just cannot handle the variety of
demands, and strong emotions, involved.
Finding the right home, the right schools, perhaps the right golf courses -
and simultaneously pleasing a spouse who might not be thrilled about moving
 -requires endless diplomacy, tact and patience.
You may have to tell an executive that driving a flashy company car is not
the done thing in Spain. His wife might need similar persuasion not put too
much importance on the marvellous kitchen which attracted her to a Turin
apartment; the Italians often take such fittings along when they move.
Many cross-border moves turn into a disaster - and two-thirds of those
failures are because businesses choose the wrong location, says Mr Bradley.
Yet advice on avoiding the potential pitfalls is not hard to find: it just
depends on investors accepting that they need guidance.
Rediscovering your Army buddies or playing on the best golf course in Europe
rarely balances out the cost of a false move.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Finland (9): Orders shift towards Asian market -
How the forestry machinery companies have been coping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLLAPSE in pulp and paper prices is being felt beyond the Finnish
forestry groups which it directly affects: the supporting industry, from
forest machinery groups to power plant companies to chemicals suppliers, has
also suffered from the downturn.
Finland's forest machinery companies have seen orders fall sharply from the
levels of three or four years ago, because pulp and paper companies
worldwide have slashed investment in the face of huge losses and
overcapacity in many market sectors. The position may not change much in the
next year or two, with few expectations of a significant improvement before
1995.
There is also something of a hangover effect. Huge investments in the late
1980s and early 1990s were based on the assumption that pulp and paper
demand would go on rising. That simply did not happen. However, it has meant
that the companies which invested heavily then, including the big Finnish
groups, now boast modern equipment which they will not need to replace for
many years.
'There is overcapacity. We as machine suppliers have been too successful,'
says Mr Krister Ahlstrom, president of the Ahlstrom group, a leading
supplier of pulping equipment.
Factors which have helped Finland's machinery manufacturers survive the
crisis have been strong market positions, technical innovation,
rationalisation and the development of new markets and services. Such moves
have enabled Valmet, one of the world's three largest producers of paper
machinery with a 30 per cent market share, to keep its paper machinery
operations profitable in 1991 and 1992, while the group as a whole has
suffered heavy losses.
A noticeable trend has been the enforced shift away from the European
market, which has traditionally been the mainstay of companies' order books,
towards markets in other parts of the world. Significantly, Asia now makes
up the largest segment in the orders of Kone Wood, which supplies wood
handling equipment to pulp mills, after the company's success in winning two
orders in Indonesia and one in Iran. At Valmet, Asia accounted for 9.2 per
cent of sales last year, but 18.6 per cent of orders.
Valmet is also giving greater emphasis to rebuilding and servicing existing
machinery to compensate for reduced orders for new equipment. Mr Matti
Sundberg, its chief executive, says: 'Rebuilds are becoming more important,
particularly for smaller companies which cannot afford to buy new
machinery.'
Niche positions have also helped. Kemira, the state-owned chemicals group,
has been able to increase sales of hydrogen peroxide, a chemical used in
pulp bleaching, thanks to greater environmental concern among forestry
groups. The company estimates hydrogen peroxide sales will grow 10 per cent
in Europe and 35 per cent in the Nordic region during 1993.
Ahlstrom has also benefited from the environmental trend, which has pushed
up sales of chlorine-free pulp bleaching technology. 'Most new orders are
environmentally driven. Modernisations and upgrades to solve environmental
problems or eliminate production bottlenecks have become the guiding factors
for investments,' it noted in its 1992 annual report.
For many of Finland's machinery groups, it is a question of sitting out the
downturn until market conditions improve in the second half of the decade,
when they are hoping there will be a significant increase in orders for new
machinery and rebuilds. That is why they are so reluctant to reduce spending
on research and development, despite the current financial squeeze.
However, it is still far from clear when the upturn will come. Mr Ahlstrom
says pulp prices need to rise 'at least Dollars 100 a tonne before customers
start loosening their purse strings' (the current level is Dollars 400 a
tonne) and orders for pulping equipment are back to more normal levels.
Mr Sundberg is also cautious but he notes that worldwide demand for paper
has continued to rise in spite of the recession. 'Within two years there is
likely to be a relatively good balance in most paper grades. Companies will
have to start talking to machine suppliers quite soon if they want to be
well ahead in the second half of the 1990s,' he states.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Finland (8): Pulp, paper industry turns corner -
Forestry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER TWO years of heavy losses, Finnish pulp and paper companies have
turned the corner. Some groups will remain in the red in 1993, but enough of
them will be profitable to give the industry as a whole a break-even result.
This represents a considerable improvement on last year's combined loss of
FM4.2bn, and 1991's FM5.2bn deficit.
Whatever help the industry has had, it has not come from the market. Hopes
that prices would turn decisively this year have been badly disappointed,
and expectations for next year are already being toned down, particularly as
far as the key west European market is concerned.
Instead, the Finns have had to rely on their own efforts and a hefty 30 per
cent devaluation of the markka to ride out the storm. All the major
companies have rationalised heavily, cutting staff numbers by up to 30 per
cent, and they have conceded little in the way of wage rises in the last two
years. Added to this has been a 32 per cent fall in wood prices since 1991,
which has lowered the raw material costs of the pulp mills significantly.
The depreciation of the markka has also helped, but it has not proved as big
a benefit as originally hoped. Buyers have also wanted their cut from
devaluation's benefits, forcing prices down still further. For some
products, such as sawn goods and fine papers, markka prices today are
virtually the same as they were a year ago.
The collapse in the market, particularly for pulp and fine papers, is the
principal reason why the Finnish forestry industry will manage only to break
even rather than make a profit this year.
The other factor is the high debt load which the major Finnish groups
continue to carry following their hefty investment programmes in the late
1980s and early 1990s. Combined debts at FM70bn are as big as turnover, and
since more than 60 per cent of them are denominated in foreign currencies,
they have risen sharply because of the weaker markka. In 1991 and 1992
around half of the industry's losses were attributable to currency losses.
On the short-term perspective, Finnish groups clearly over-invested on the
back of the boom market conditions of the late 1980s, even though they now
have the world's most modern and efficient pulp and paper machinery to show
for it.
The emphasis was different in Sweden where the big forestry groups
concentrated their expansion more on company and plant acquisitions in
Europe. Some argue that the Swedish tactic was better, because it
facilitated the removal of extra capacity in the market downturn, though it
has also left the Swedes with greater production capacity in hard currency
countries.
The debt burden has forced the Finnish forestry industry to consolidate.
Total investment will fall to an annual FM4.5bn this year and next, compared
with FM8bn a year in 1989 and 1990. There are currently only two major
projects on the blocks: a DM800m scheme to build a newsprint plant, based on
recycled paper, in eastern Germany and a FM3bn plan to construct a new pulp
mill at Rauma in western Finland. Other projects may only see the light of
day as part of a risk-sharing collaboration between different groups.
Balance sheet constraints are also likely to limit takeover activity, unless
industrial logic - or distress - can be cited to justify it. For one thing,
there has already been a considerable shake-out in the Finnish forestry
sector, and for another, the 1980s argument that it made sense to buy in
Europe cannot be sustained today when Finland has become a low cost producer
again.
'Priority number one over the next two years will be repaying debts,' says
Mr Jarl Kohler, managing director of the Finnish Forest Industries
Federation. Enhanced cash-flow, disposals and share offers will all feature
in the drive for a stronger balance sheet.
Mr Kohler acknowledges that 1994 will be another tough year for the Finnish
forest companies, but he nevertheless expects an overall profit for the
industry, thanks to the trends which have begun to emerge.
Firstly, the industry has been able to raise its capacity utilisation from
83 per cent in 1992 to 87 per cent this year. For sawn wood the jump has
been from 81 to 92 per cent, and for newsprint from 82 to 91 per cent. But
some sectors are still very depressed - utilisation for uncoated (SC) paper
has fallen to 77 per cent this year from 83 per cent, while pulp utilisation
rates have climbed only to 85 per cent from 83 per cent.
Secondly, in spite of the recession, worldwide paper consumption is
continuing to grow, albeit at a m o d e s t 1 - 2 per cent a year.
Thirdly, exports have been growing strongly: they are predicted to rise by
10 per cent in volume terms and 14 per cent in value terms during 1993. The
gains have come despite the fact that western Europe, which last year
accounted for 80 per cent of Finnish forest industry exports, has been in
recession. Increased sales to North America, Asia, the former eastern bloc
and Latin America account for all but a tenth of the increased export
volume.
If the short-term outlook is relatively positive, questions remain about how
well placed Finnish forest companies are to meet long-term competitive
challenges. The threats come not just from trends like recycling and greater
computerisation, but from expanded production in current export markets -
such as Indonesia - and from the ability of rivals with stronger balance
sheets to exploit market opportunities.
The Finns do not appear to be unduly alarmed by their position. They point
out that with their emphasis on higher value-added products and their modern
machinery, they are as well placed as any of their competitors to take
advantage of an upturn in market conditions.
The broader question is whether Finland should be trying to reduce its
dependence on an industry which accounts for as much as 50 per cent of its
net exports and which is highly capital intensive. The answer is almost
certainly yes.
Mr Henrik Ehrnrooth, chief executive of Jaakko Poyry, the international
consultancy group, says the country is 'definitely' over-dependent on
forestry. 'But it's hard to change,' he notes, 'when forestry tends to
attract the country's best brains.'

FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (7): Mixing business
with pleasure - Focus on the island republic of Cyprus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAVELLERS with Cyprus Airways are left with few doubts about how many see
the republic's vocation. The current issue of the airline's Sunjet in-flight
magazine contains five-and-a-half pages of advertising from accountancy
firms and several more pages from banks, insurers and business management
services, reports David Lane.
This year nearly two million tourists will have enjoyed the sun, sea and
sand of Cyprus's resorts, and perhaps discovered some of the island's other
attractions.
Those holidaymakers willing to mix business with pleasure, or looking for
entrepreneurial opportunities, are urged by Deloitte &amp; Touche to discover
financial Cyprus. And Grant Thornton member Costouris Michaelides tells
Sunjet readers that 'nobody gets closer to offshore clients.'
Offshore operations is an important and growing sector of the economy -
'last year, the Central Bank issued permits for the registration of 2,039
offshore enterprises, a record number,' says George Georgiou, an official
with the International Division.
By the end of last year more than 10,000 had been issued, about 4,000 of
which were in the past three years.
'Not all the licences are active. But over 1,000 companies have offices,
while between 400 and 500 are brass plate operations,' adds Mr Georgiou.
Gross foreign exchange revenues from offshore enterprises have doubled
during the past five years, reaching CYP95m last year - 'this was about 6
per cent of foreign exchange earnings,' he adds.
The Turkish invasion and occupation of the northern part of the island in
1974 was a stimulus for turning Cyprus into an international business
centre.
The first incentives were introduced in 1975 with enactment of legislation
on income tax and exchange controls.
Corporate profits are taxed at 4.25 per cent and expatriate employees
working for offshore enterprises enjoy tax privileges.
Pointing to the republic's 19 double taxation treaties, Mr Georgiou
emphasises that Cyprus is not a tax haven - 'the authorities vet
applications carefully. Reporting requirements and administrative procedures
are strict, and good corporate conduct is a condition for permit renewal.
Scandal-avoidance is the watchword.'
What types of business chose Cyprus? General trading, marketing,
distribution, regional management and consultancies are high on the list.
Coca Cola, re-locating its Near East offices from Cairo, is an example.
Journalists and news agencies whose Cyprus bureaux cover the Near and Middle
East, are another.
However, shipping is particularly important. There were nearly 100 ship
management and maritime services companies operating in Cyprus at the end of
last year, and they accounted for about one fifth of the total of 4,100
staff employed by the Republic's offshore enterprises.
With 1,700 ocean-going vessels (totalling about 23m gross tons registered
under the Cypriot flag), Cyprus is near the head of global shipping
rankings.
Mr Serghios Serghiou, director of the Department of Merchant Shipping, notes
that Cyprus was historically a maritime power. Indeed, its ships are
mentioned in the Iliad. However, today's position owes little to tradition.
'When Cyprus became independent in 1960, the government looked for sectors
of relative advantage that should be developed, and shipping was identified.
'The republic's first merchant shipping laws were enacted in 1963 and, like
subsequent legislation, were modelled on UK laws,' says Mr Serghiou.
DEVELOPMENTS at the end of the 1970s underlie Cyprus's rise in the
international shipping league. After incidents involving Cypriot-flagged
vessels, the authorities acted to strengthen regulation of the shipping
sector, Mr Serghiou's Department being established in 1980.
'Our 16 surveyors and maritime offices in Piraeus, London and New York
demonstrate the authorities' determination that Cyprus should be a flag of
prestige, not of convenience.
'Enhancement of safety standards is an objective. Though operating an open
registry, Cypriot regulations aim for best maritime practice in vessels
carrying its flag,' says Mr Serghiou.
The republic's favourable tax regime is the determining factor for
shipowners and for third-party ship management companies. But there are
other reasons why Cyprus has been chosen by the shipping industry and by
many companies in other sectors.
The island's position at the junction of Europe and Asia, and close to the
Suez Canal, gives a strong geographical advantage. Good air connections and
excellent telecommunications also draw business.
Competitive rents and costs of labour and services earn points for Cyprus
when location decisions are being made. And a population with a high level
of education, plus an efficient civil service, have also helped to
consolidate Cyprus's popularity as an international business centre.
Though it has been successful in establishing itself as an offshore and
shipping centre, Cyprus has difficulty in attracting investment for
manufacturing. Restrictions on foreign ownership are a handicap. But there
is an exempt Industrial Free Zone in Larnaca for manufacturing for export,
and derogations can be made for some inward investment projects - 'our need
for a more diversified economy and for technological upgrading in
manufacturing has been highlighted by the slowdown in growth,' says Mr
Andreas Charalambous, of the planning bureau.
He mentions that the government established the Institute of Technology last
year with the aim of raising the technological content of goods manufactured
in the republic.
'We are squeezed between developing and developed countries. We need to
shift to higher added value in manufacturing, and to compete on quality
rather than cost,' says Mr Charalambous.
Like other officials, he underlines the republic's commitment to an open,
free market economy.
RELATIONS with the EC, whose members currently take 60 per cent of Cypriot
exports and with whom a customs union will be completed by 1997, are a
central priority. Cyprus has applied for membership and the Commission gave
a generally positive opinion this summer. Meanwhile, the republic's economic
indicators outshine many EC states. Growth has been strong, and the current
account generally in equilibrium.
Though the budget deficit and debt service ratios are low by EC standards,
the government is nevertheless planning to strengthen the fiscal accounts -
'this will permit liberalisation of commercial bank lending rates which are
currently subject to a 9 per cent ceiling,' says Mr Charalambous.
Removing this constraint should help the authorities to check inflation,
which has been on a steadily upward trend, albeit still only 6.5 per cent
last year.
With per capita GDP of Dollars 11,281, Cyprus has a key indicator in-line
with EC aspirations. But there are reservations among future EC partners
about the political situation.
Since the Turkish invasion, the island has been divided by the 'Green Line,'
policed by UN troops. The EC would like a return to normality; however, the
division has not been a deterrent to the many foreign businesses that have
chosen the island republic. Concerns about security, large or small scale,
appear to weigh lightly on businessmen.
Notwithstanding the UN peacekeepers, the social climate is relaxed - and the
fact that street crime is not a problem is evidenced by the local practice
of leaving cars unlocked.
In a corner of the Mediterranean that has been characterised by conflict,
lack of infrastructure and inefficiency, Cyprus offers a haven of
tranquillity and functionality.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (6): Southerly
attractions - The Mediterranean region has much to offer investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON DARK winter mornings in Birmingham or Dusseldorf, how many businessmen
wish for something different in terms of office or factory location?
The idea of working in a more agreeable climate must be attractive to
company managers when they peer down headlight beams in peak-hour traffic on
motorways and autobahns.
Many businessmen would probably prefer to be elsewhere as their cars' wipers
clear snow, sleet or drizzle from their windscreens. And where better than
the Mediterranean?
But it is not only the climate and the accompanying lifestyle, enhanced by
the cultural and historical heritage of Mediterranean countries, that makes
them attractive for companies setting up or expanding their activities in
Europe.
Mediterranean Europe enjoys a strategic geographical position, looking north
towards its own continent, as well as south towards Africa and East towards
Asia.
In addition to serving European markets, factories and offices on the
Mediterranean's northern side are well placed to cover North and East Africa
and the Near and Middle East.
However, climate, lifestyle and geography are not enough on their own.
In taking decisions on where to site facilities, companies must evaluate
many other factors: the availability and cost of skilled and unskilled
labour, quality of services, infrastructure, administrative structures and
regulatory/legislative frameworks, political stability and incentives.
How do Europe's Mediterranean options measure up?
Spain: A leading beneficiary of inward investment in its manufacturing
industry, statistics show that Spain is the world's fourth largest recipient
of direct foreign investment.
Last year's Dollars 10.3bn followed Dollars 11.6bn in 1991, Dollars 12.3bn
in 1990 and Dollars 6.8bn in 1989. Over this period, Spain received more
than twice the foreign direct investment in Italy.
Spain owes its success in attracting foreign business to several factors.
With a population of about 38m, Spain brought a large new market when it
entered the EC at the beginning of 1986. Many foreign corporations wanted to
be close to sales and have established operations in the country.
The abundant supply of skilled and unskilled labour is an attraction. Over
18 per cent of Spain's workforce was engaged in agriculture in the
mid-1980s, offering a pool of labour for factory work.
While the agricultural workforce had fallen to just below 10 per cent of the
total last year, the high level of unemployment suggests that supply
constraints should not be a problem.
However, Spain's advantage in direct and indirect labour costs has been
eroded over recent years, and labour legislation is not market-orientated.
IF the Spanish labour factor has lost some of its attraction, developments
in infrastructure have enhanced the country's appeal for inward investors.
Road and rail networks have been extensively modernised and expanded, and
air services improved. Considerable importance has been placed on upgrading
telecommunications.
Part of the EC's relatively less-developed southern rim, Spain offers a
significant level of investment incentives.
Only a few areas of the country fail to qualify. Incentives are available
from various sources (the state, local authorities and the EC). Some are
targeted at specific industries.
Spain's international image received a boost last year when Barcelona hosted
the Olympic Games, Madrid held the title of Cultural Capital of Europe and
Seville was the location for the Universal Exhibition.
With the coverage given to Barcelona and Seville, few businessmen could have
been unaware of Spain when listing alternatives for new factories and
offices.
Italy: Across the sea from Barcelona, Genoa also put on a major event last
year. However, the 500th anniversary of Columbus's discovery of the Americas
was overshadowed by political and economic events.
Attendance at Genoa's fair was disappointing. Moreover, investigations after
its closure revealed that it had been caught up in Italy's massive
tangentopoli ('kickback city') institutionalised corruption scandal.
Tangentopoli, which has seen foreign companies in the magistrates' net, has
revealed an almost total absence of corporate ethics.
But this is only one of several factors to discourage potential direct
investors from choosing Italy.
The Sicilian Mafia and its Calabrian and Neapolitan cousins is another.
Although there seems to have been progress against organised crime this
year, memories of the car-bomb assassinations of two leading magistrates
last year will take a long time to fade.
Italy's standing has taken a series of knocks, this summer's crisis at the
Ferruzzi-Montedison Group and the liquidation of the EFIM state-holding
corporation providing further examples.
More than a year after the liquidation decision was taken, EFIM's creditors
are still awaiting payment from the state. Also in the queue for government
money are businessmen who have invested in assisted areas and have not
received promised grants.
The crisis in Italy's public sector finances means that the state is no
longer able to honour its commitments. Officials say that all incentives
approved will eventually be paid, but that time is needed.
However, the uncertainty over capital grant payments that has been a feature
of Italy's regional development incentives for many years is now joined by
uncertainty of the development framework itself.
Officials say that a new approach will ration and target incentive finance.
Companies will have to submit projects to the Ministry of Industry which
will rank them on the basis of evaluation criteria.
With the Mezzogiorno (the south) now showing severe cracks in public order,
in addition to suffering from organised crime, it is questionable that it
will be a strong contender for foreign investment.
Distance from main European markets and public services that creak even more
than in the rest of Italy have always been a handicap.
Central and northern Italy will continue to offer interesting locations,
being close to markets and enjoying better services. Particularly north of
Tuscany, the strengths of the country's versatile and flexible labour force
are evident, although inflexible labour laws and high labour costs are a
severe disincentive. But how Mediterranean is Milan?
Greece: There is no doubt about the Mediterranean character of Athens and
other Greek cities, albeit the Levantine flavour is very different from Rome
and Barcelona.
Greece is also different in other respects, being more competitive on labour
and other costs. The country has a longer membership of the European
Community than Spain, having become a full member at the beginning of 1981.
LIKE its Spanish and Italian Community partners, Greece also tries to
attract inward investment. Substantial infrastructure projects are underway
to encourage this.
Law number 1892, enacted in 1990 by the then newly-elected New Democracy
liberal government and ministerial circulars and directives, provide the
framework for encouraging investment in industry and tourism. The levels of
incentive (grants, tax and accelerated depreciation allowances) depend on
the prefectures where the investment is located. However, the whole of
Greece is open to foreign investment.
Malta: Located in the centre of the Mediterranean, 100km from Sicily and
300km from the African coast, the small (250 sq km) island of Malta has been
making large efforts to attract foreign investment. Measures such as the
Industrial Development Act, the Malta International Business Act and the
Offshore Trust Act, passed five years ago, are designed to boost foreign
business activity in the republic.
The emphasis given to electronics, robotics and pharmaceuticals
manufacturing has yielded results. De La Rue, Dowty and SGS-Thomson are
among those present. However, Malta also has ambitions to develop as an
offshore business and financial centre.
The authorities consider that the combination of suitable legislation,
strategic position, good services and infrastructure, and low costs should
put Malta on short lists when foreign companies are considering new
locations.
Balkans: While the former Yugoslavia has been struck off lists of
alternative locations, and seems unlikely to be re-admitted soon, Albania is
a different matter.
The government wants to encourage foreign investment, and enacted
legislation to this effect in August last year.
A diplomat with close knowledge of Albania says, however, that problems over
land tenure are a brake on foreign investment, and so also are Albania's own
cash shortages and lack of a banking system.
Foreign exchange operations are usually through street dealers off the main
square in Tirana.
Albania is certainly a low cost country and this has attracted Italian
businessmen wanting to escape the higher costs at home. However, it offers
little at present for leading international corporations. The diplomat says
that in a few years 'Albania should be a real alternative.'
But businessmen will have to wait several decades before Tirana and Durres
offer that attractive Mediterranean lifestyle that sets the Birmingham
commuter day-dreaming.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Finland (6): Chance of growth again - Interview
with the Prime Minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ESKO AHO, at 39 one of Europe's youngest leaders, has had to steer
Finland through a traumatic recession since becoming prime minister in 1991.
Active in the rurally-based Centre party since the 1970s, Mr Aho entered
parliament in 1983 and became party leader in 1990. He has been criticised
for not being tough enough and his future inevitably rests on the fortunes
of the economy. He discusses its prospects with Hugh Carnegy
WHAT light do you see in the tunnel now for the economy?
We have made major structural changes. Throughout the 1980s our exports and
industrial output went down, relative to gross domestic product. Finland was
only able to preserve its high standard of living by borrowing money from
abroad. When my government took over we had to do something about this
structural problem. Since then, the share of exports relative to GDP - it
was close to 20 per cent in 1991 - has risen to about 33 per cent this year
and next year it could be as high as 38 per cent.
Also, as far as industrial production is concerned, we have had major
changes. That is the reason why I think we have a good chance to return to
growth again. Our net foreign debt stands at the equivalent of more than 50
per cent of GDP, but because of that export growth it is going to start to
go downwards and next year we expect the balance of payments is going to be
in surplus. These are preconditions for solving our other problems.
These changes have made possible the recent fall in interest rates, which
are now low enough for new investments. This creates possibilities for
solving domestic problems and getting some effect also on high unemployment,
which is our major political problem.
How soon do you anticipate that there will be this pick-up in the domestic
economy and what more can you do to encourage it?
We have a special interest to stimulate the domestic economy. But the
problem is that there are very tight limits for stimulation. We cannot use
higher public indebtedness because it will lead to an even worse situation.
That is why the main way to stimulate the economy is to push interest rates
downwards and to keep them down. I believe that we have the possibility to
succeed in that. It depends on domestic decisions - on budget policy, fiscal
policy and labour market agreements. Another factor having an impact on that
is the European trend and we expect that in the longer term European
interest rates are going down.
Is there not more you could do, for example some lowering of Finland's very
high tax regime?
As far as taxes are concerned, the problem is that the deficit in
governmental expenditures is very high and we cannot cope with a higher
deficit. If we are able to get (wage agreements) which are reasonable in
this situation, it would create some possibility to use taxation to
stimulate demand, but this margin is not very large. We have also some
opportunities to concentrate resources in our budget on new investments.
When do you expect unemployment, now around 20 per cent, to peak?
It is very difficult to make forecasts because we have not seen this kind of
situation before. Simultaneously we have structural problems, with branches
like the banking and public sectors having to lay people off, and this
depression. But I have the feeling that later this year or at least next
year, unemployment will be lower.
One of the problems you have run into has been resistance to labour market
reforms, such as lowering minimum wage levels for young employees. How
difficult is this issue?
I have to say that in Finland labour market organisations are very well
developed with the kind of agreements which make our labour market very
rigid. Our intention has been to lower the threshold for the employment of
new people, but we have noticed that labour market organisations, especially
the labour unions, have been very much against these kind of changes because
they fear they will give companies too much power against unions. I think
that is a big mistake because the only way to have a positive effect on
unemployment is to make these structures more flexible.
We made some agreements last May which made it possible to have some more
flexibility in employing young people, but they were not major structural
changes. We have not succeeded in that.
Would you also like to go further in reducing Finland's extensive and
expensive welfare system?
We have undertaken several big savings programmes to reach the goal of zero
real growth in public expenditure from 1991 to 1995. At the present time we
are achieving this target. The problem is that we have some extra costs,
especially in the banking sector. We have not been able to cover these costs
by savings because, if we had tried that, the downward curve in the economy
would have intensified. But the cuts we have made have been very painful,
politically.
People often remark that Finns have been very tolerant of the recession.
There has not been any significant social unrest, despite 20 per cent
unemployment. Do you sense that this public understanding of the crisis
persists?
I have to say that despite many difficulties in realising our programmes -
from the political opposition and labour market organisations - today the
public discussion is much more reasonable than it has been. The atmosphere
in the country is calm - I think most people understand what the situation
requires better than was the case in 1991.
In 1991 Finland and our population did not know where we were and where we
were trying to go. Today I feel that the main goals of economic policy have
been accepted more generally than before.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Finland (7): The European anchor may give security
 -Foreign Policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IF WE are not in Europe, we are in Russia' is how one Helsinki taxi driver
justifies his support for Finnish membership of the European Community.
The view may be a little extreme, but it helps to explain why Finns have
proved to be more enthusiastic about joining the EC than either of their
Nordic neighbours, Norway and Sweden.
Western Europe is seen as an anchor for Finland at a time when the
certainties of the cold war have been lost and traditional concepts of
neutrality no longer carry their former weight. The feeling has been
heightened by the upheaval which continues to afflict the country's giant
eastern neighbour, Russia.
In other words, security questions as well as economic issues are weighing
on the minds of the Finns when they consider the EC. By contrast with Sweden
and Norway, opinion polls have consistently shown a majority of the
population to be in favour of EC membership, although sometimes the margin
has been very narrow. An August poll, conducted by the Taloustutkimus
organisation, indicated 49 per cent were pro-EC, compared with 35 per cent
against.
Negotiations on membership began in February, but the toughest phase of the
talks will come this autumn when the most difficult questions are discussed.
It is already clear that agricultural and regional matters will be the
biggest stumbling blocks, although there is also concern about moves within
the EC to limit the influence of smaller EC member states in
decision-making.
It may seem surprising that agriculture has become so sensitive an issue, as
farming employs only 8 per cent of the Finnish population and contributes
only 4-5 per cent to GDP.
But farming's importance is psychological as well as economic in a land
where the countryside is regarded as an essential part of the national
identity and cultural heritage. As recently as 1960, 36 per cent of the
workforce was employed on farms.
The issue also has particular importance for Finland's Centre party, the
dominant coalition partner, as it traditionally draws its support from rural
areas. Opinion polls have shown that Finnish farmers are more implacably
opposed to EC membership than any other section of society. The Centre
itself is split, with its leaders in favour of the EC and the rank and file
against it.
The need to win over the party membership may explain why Mr Heikki
Haavisto, president of the influential Central Union of Agricultural
Producers and a renowned EC sceptic, was appointed as foreign minister in
May when Mr Paavo Vayrynen stepped down from the position to promote his
candidacy for the presidency. If nothing else, the appointment sent a clear
signal to Brussels about the importance Finland attaches to the agricultural
issue.
In essence, Finland wants hefty EC subsidies - worth about FM3.5bn a year -
in recognition of the special geographical and climatic conditions facing
its farmers in such a northerly location. 'Our natural circumstances are
very different to those of any country already in the EC,' states Mr
Haavisto.
In particular, he draws attention to Finland's short growing season - even
in southern Finland it is only 170 days compared with 230 in northern
Germany - as well as to the small average size of the country's farms and
the distances to market, which are often huge.
But he also makes it clear that agriculture has related regional and
security aspects. The fear is that if farmers are put out of business, whole
areas of the country will become depopulated, a particularly sensitive topic
in the context of Finland's 1,300km long border with Russia.
If Finland can get an agreement on agriculture, it looks very much as if all
other aspects of its membership application will fall into place. The
country has accepted the Maastricht treaty, and it has not made an issue out
of neutrality. For the moment, it wants to remain militarily non-aligned,
with an independent defence, but it has not ruled any options, including
membership of the Western European Union, in the future.
The country is also displaying a more relaxed attitude than either Norway or
Sweden on some other controversial questions, such as alcohol policy.
Mr Haavisto's appointment as foreign minister was certainly not universally
welcomed, as he was thought to be too closely tied to the farming lobby.
However, his critics say that on the evidence of his first five months in
office he genuinely wants to achieve a negotiating result which will enable
Finland to join.
It is hard to predict what will happen if Mr Haavisto eventually decides he
cannot recommend the membership package which Finland is offered. The likely
answer is that it will provoke a government crisis, forcing the Centre party
out of the coalition.
In any case, it is difficult to see agriculture being the decisive issue. Dr
Max Jacobson, a former diplomat, says it is 'inconceivable' that Finland
will reject membership just because the farmers oppose it. 'A majority will
still be in favour of joining,' he claims. A bigger danger could be
developments in the Community itself if these create a negative impression
in the minds of the Finnish electorate.
The timetable is certainly tight. If Finland is to join the Community on
schedule on January 1 1995, negotiations must be completed by next April. A
non-binding referendum will then be held around next September.
That is likely to make Finland the first of the three Nordic states to vote
on the issue, so a Yes vote will be important not simply for Finland but for
pro-EC campaigners in both Sweden and Norway, who believe it will provide a
wider momentum for their own EC membership ambitions.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (5): Inroads to new
markets - Europe's economic centre of gravity is rapidly moving eastward /
Looking East
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a decade when the inclusion of Spain, Portugal and Greece in the
European Community pulled investment southward, the 1990s will be the decade
of rapid growth and fundamental structural changes in the former
centrally-planned economies of central Europe and beyond.
This eastward shift, and the prospect of decades of rapid economic growth
similar to that experienced in most of western Europe during the 20-year
post-war reconstruction boom, has profound implications for the future
location of management offices and factories.
Berlin, for example, will once again be the capital of united Germany,
although there are signs of a growing reluctance to accelerate the expensive
removal from Bonn. This reflects the unexpected cost and difficulty of
re-incorporating the five eastern provinces into the mainstream German
economy.
The problems have arisen mainly because of the artificially high wage and
other costs which followed the decision to exchange the East German mark for
D-marks at par three years ago, and the drive to equalise wages although
east German productivity remains far lower.
Under these circumstances the prospects for long-term economic growth in the
region are probably highest in Poland, where wages are low and whose
population of 39m ensures the largest single market in the post-communist
central and south eastern European region.
This area encompasses 105m potential consumers, if Slovenia, the Baltic
states, and the Balkan states of Romania and Bulgaria are included.
Poland will probably have the fastest growing economy in the whole of Europe
this year after a 31 per cent decline in industrial production since 1989.
The rise in industrial output exceeded 7 per cent over the first half of the
year with labour productivity rising 11-13 per cent.
Hungary and the Czech republic will also resume economic growth this year
after a hiccup caused by two years of drought in Hungary and dislocation
stemming from their January divorce which has retarded growth in the Czech
republic and Slovakia.
Throughout the region, the locations which are showing the fastest economic
growth and the greatest attraction for foreign investors, are those which
are closest to Germany and other European Community markets.
For example, Szceszin, which as the former German city of Stettin, was
developed as Berlin's main outlet to the sea, is rapidly developing as a
regional centre for the western Baltic. It is attracting investment from
Germany and the Scandinavian countries with whom it is linked by fast and
frequent roll-on-roll-off ferries.
THE Gdansk-Gdynia port complex is another focus of rapidly increasing
cross-Baltic trade with good prospects for benefiting from the eventual
revival of trade with the Baltic republics and St Petersburg.
But the most important factor likely to affect future location decisions is
the speed with which Poland's ambitious motorway building plans are
implemented.
Already, the bulk of German investment in Poland has been concentrated in
towns like Poznan and Wroclaw. Both are to be found along the axis of the
two new east-west motorways which will make Poland a cross-roads of
east-west and north-south traffic in the early years of the 21st century.
Longer term, such highways will dramatically improve the economic prospects
of towns like Lodz. This depressed textile town, south west of Warsaw, will
soon find itself at the junction of the main east-west motorway and the
north south route from Gdansk to Czechoslovakia and beyond.
Meanwhile the divorce from Slovakia has underlined the westerly location of
the Czech republic which juts like a wedge into prosperous Germany and
Austria where wages are up to ten times higher than Czech rates.
With its low foreign debt and long industrial traditions, within a decade
the Czech republic will become as closely linked to the German economy as
Austria and Switzerland.
Longer term, the core central European economies of the Czech republic,
Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia, together with the former Yugoslav republic of
Slovenia will also play a key role in extending the market-orientated,
consumer-led transformation of the former communist world further east.
Initially, the experience of economic transformation in central Europe will
help speed the development of Romania and Bulgaria, whose future economic
health is also linked to the growth of trade and investment in the Black Sea
region. Here, Turkey is carving out an important role for itself. Indeed,
Istanbul and Ankara are rapidly becoming key locations for those interested
in developing trade and investment in the oil and resource-rich central
Asian republics of the former Soviet Union.
Strategic investors in central Europe such as ABB, the Swiss-Swedish power
engineering company, Siemens and AEG, are planning to use their new
Hungarian, Czech and Polish acquisitions to supply markets further east
which were formerly part of the now disbanded Comecon market.
In the case of Yugoslavia, Slovenia will have a particularly important role
in helping the reconstruction of the war-torn Croatian and Serbian
economies.
For western companies, this will increase the attractiveness of Ljubliana,
the Slovene capital. Until now, however, Hungary, which began tinkering with
market reforms in the 1960s and enjoys close historical links with Austria,
has been the main recipient of inward foreign investment. It has attracted
over Dollars 5bn of the Dollars 9-Dollars 12bn of foreign equity investment
which has flowed into central Europe over the last four years.
Most of this foreign investment, including the new car and engine plants put
up by General Motors, Audi/Volkswagen and Suzuki of Japan, has been located
either in the Budapest area or inside Hungary's so-called 'golden corridor.'
This corridor runs westward out of the capital along the main rail and
motorway links to the Austrian border, encompassing industrial cities like
Gyor and Esztergom.
Budapest, which straddles the Danube as it passes the wooded Buda hills,
vies with Prague for the title of most beautiful capital in central Europe,
and the most expensive. It shares the universal regional problem of poor
telecommunications. But the telephones are particularly bad in Prague,
despite the fact that the Czech capital is 200kms further west than Budapest
or indeed Vienna. This handicap will disappear as the projected heavy
investment in telecommunications bears fruit.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (4): The deciding
factors - Where to locate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL

<DATELINE>
   THERE is no such thing as the perfect business location
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'whatever the ultimate decision, it always ends up as a compromise,'
according to Dr Wilfried Vossen, managing director of Plant Location
International.
PLI, part of the Price Waterhouse group, has expanded quickly on the back of
the immense complexities facing businesses increasingly forced to consider
the best locations within Europe from which to manufacture, distribute and
manage, writes Michael Cassell.
According to Dr Vossen, although the science of location has improved beyond
recognition in recent years, many mistakes are still being made.
The consequences of getting it wrong can be calamitous,involving crippling
financial costs and heavy damage to relationships with local communities and
customers.
'Many important decisions are still being decided in head office, thousands
of miles away from the action. Remote bosses come up with ideas which are
not feasible. The local, Europe-based management can be excellent but the
people upstairs are still inclined to think they know better.'
Ernst &amp; Young, which has its own location advisory service, also
acknowledges that there are many long-held myths about European countries
which can often cloud corporate decision-making.
According to 'Regions of the New Europe', jointly produced by Ernst &amp; Young
and Corporate Location, the corporate investment specialist: 'Cliches and
stereotypes about countries and their customs can blind a corporate manager
to a particular area's benefits.
'Governments and regional authorities are increasingly active in trying to
play up their area's attractiveness to corporate investors.
'For those companies seeking to set up a new facility it can be all too
confusing as rival locations try to convince you that they are situated at
the centre of Europe and are the best location for your business, regardless
of activity'.
Organisations like PLI and Ernst &amp; Young insist, predictably enough, that no
company is likely to have at its finger-tips the breadth and depth of
information necessary as a pre-condition of taking a decision on where to
locate. Bring in the specialists, they suggest.
But the fact that even the very largest of multinational companies now
resort to the help of outside consultants, at least during some stage of the
process, suggests that they might have a point.
With giants like Ford Motor, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Memorex, Mobil, Ricoh,
Texas Instruments, Wellcome Foundation and Westinghouse all seeking external
advice on the issue, the message is getting home.
Even the Japanese, who began cautiously by using location specialists to
provide limited information to feed into their own decision-making
structure, now increasingly delegate a growing proportion of location work
to outside experts.
So what are the common fundamentals which any enterprise will have to
consider before making a decision which could involve investment running
into many millions of dollars?
Given that the company's overall strategy is clear, most experts agree that
the single most important factor is market proximity.
Quality of transport infrastructure and information systems can have an
impact on market accessibility but crude distances between supplier and
end-market matter most.
It may be an obvious point but it is not the only one. The nearest location
may well be the most populous and expensive, with high labour costs and
skill shortages. Dr Vossen's 'compromise' comes into play.
Labour costs themselves rank high up the list of comparative factors. But
while the peripheral regions of Europe may offer the lowest manpower costs,
what levels of skill and education come with them?
Productivity remains another key factor, with labour attitudes and
performance varying widely across Europe.
So while some former eastern European countries might offer labour rates
more usually associated with parts of the Far East and much closer market
proximity, poor labour productivity might easily outweigh other advantages.
There is evidence, however, that improved productivity performances can be
'imported' by the inward investor, who discovers there is little wrong with
the available, local labour that more efficient machinery and good working
practices cannot significantly improve.
Many other factors also come into play. PLI recently conducted a survey
among more than 300 international companies to establish their priorities
when choosing locations for various operational functions.
The survey demonstrated that the main priorities for consideration by
potential corporate investors centred initially on operating and investment
costs, followed by general and then more specific operating conditions in
respective locations.
When it came to more detailed location factors, companies clearly
demonstrated the crucial importance to them of good business communications.
Respondents repeatedly put telephone, fax and data lines at the top of their
shopping list, ranking their availability alongside any of the supposedly
more important location factors.
A great deal of emphasis is also placed on the presence of a stable
political situation and social climate, low labour costs and reliable power
supplies.
Another vital ingredient in any location decision can be the availability or
otherwise of investment incentives offered by a range of state and regional
bodies.
The packages on offer vary widely, although given the restricted funds
available in many countries and regions, success can depend on how well the
applicant company argues its case.
In most countries, factors determining the level of grant will include the
number of jobs created, the degree of export business generated and the
high-tech content of the particular process. Dr Vossen says: 'Before an
investor gets to an appraisal of incentives, there may be 20 technical
chapters and numerous cost-structure considerations to go through. Only then
will available incentives enter the equation, though they can certainly
prove critical in the final decision-making process.'
But the pattern has been changing. Given the recession and the continuing
drive to reduce investment costs, potential inward investors are tending to
look at the extent of financial help available from outside agencies at a
much earlier stage in their calculations.
More than ever, the financial help on offer locally will help decide which
parts of the community prosper from the next wave of corporate investment.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Finland(2): Weak recovery is forecast - The
economy is in need of structural reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER the past three years, Finland's economy has suffered a juddering
recession spectacular even by the recent grim standards of western Europe.
Real output declined by 10 per cent over 1991 and 1992 and at best will be
flat in 1993. Unemployment reached 20 per cent in July. The banking sector
lurched into losses so severe that the state will spend some FM60bn or more
to bail it out. The budget deficit has ballooned to around 10 per cent of
gross domestic product and foreign debt has doubled to almost 50 per cent of
GDP.
But, at last, there are signs of a respite. 'The Finnish economy is not
going to continue going down the drain,' asserts Mr Sixten Korkman, the
chief economist at the finance ministry. 'Next year there will be some
recovery, even though it will be weak.'
Mr Korkman is not letting optimism get the better of him. In fact, his
projections of 1 per cent GDP growth in 1994 are more gloomy than last
month's OECD report on the Finnish economy, which foresaw growth of 2.1 per
cent next year.
But he is confident that a dramatic surge in exports already under way,
following a 50 per cent fall in the value of the Finnish markka over the
past two years, will drive a return to growth. The current account may move
into surplus, easing the foreign debt burden and underpinning low interest
rates.
The problem is, as Mr Korkman readily acknowledges, that the domestic
economy, which is the only realistic source of significant employment
growth, remains stuck deep in recession.
Much of the explanation for this lies in the continued hangover from an
exaggerated foreign credit boom in the late 1980s which burst when Finland's
mainstay trade with the former Soviet Union disappeared and international
recession hit simultaneously.
Suddenly, interest rates - which generous tax allowances had rendered
negative in many cases - went up steeply, asset values tumbled and foreign
debt soared in markka terms. Savings ratios rocketed and are set to stay
high while thousands of individuals and companies unwind their debts.
The result has been a slump in private consumption. Meanwhile, the
government has embarked on a spending squeeze to try to control its rising
deficits. Overall, domestic demand is set to fall by 5 per cent this year,
the third year of shrinkage in succession. The OECD sees a further small
decline next year.
'I am quite sure the domestic economy will remain slow even when it turns
around,' says Dr Sirkka Hamalainen, governor of the Bank of Finland. 'I am
sure households will remain very reluctant to take on new debt.'
Government policy can be summed up as a mixture of tight fiscal policy and
relatively loose monetary policy. Mr Iiro Viinanen, the finance minister,
has been adamant that the scale of the deficit leaves no room for
expansionary measures in the budget - especially with rising unemployment
and the banking crisis adding heavily to government expenditure. The
government is sticking to its target of holding down public expenditure in
real terms at 1991 levels.
Instead, with inflation at less than 3 per cent, the steep fall in the value
of the markka and tumbling interest rates are looked to as the chief sources
of economic stimulus.
But here, too, the authorities have been reluctant to go too far. The
finance ministry and central bank are now ready to admit that their defence
of the markka's link to the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary
System, which they finally broke by floating the currency in September last
year, was misplaced, given the depth of the recession the country was
suffering.
Still, there is concern about the level of the markka which has restrained
the central bank from letting short-term rates fall below the 6 per cent
level at which they currently stand.
'We could not have pushed down interest rates faster,' says Dr Hamalainen.
'With hindsight, you might say that if we had floated in 1991 then we could
have had lower interest rates. But after we floated the currency last
autumn, in practice our freedom to cut interest rates was low because of the
high levels of foreign debt both in the public and private sector. In many
ways we have been in a trap.'
The policy approach of the authorities was largely endorsed by reports on
the economy commissioned from three foreign economists earlier this year by
the Bank of Finland. All stressed the importance of getting the national
finances back into balance. Two - Professor David Currie of the London
School of Economics and Professor Christian Bordes from the University of
Bordeaux - agreed that, for the time being, controlling the deficit and
lowering interest rates was the way forward.
'A tight fiscal stance coupled with a looser monetary stance offers the best
prospect of economic recovery, of tackling the twin debt problem of internal
and external debt, and of maintaining a competitive level of the markka,
boosting exports in a difficult world trading environment,' wrote Prof
Currie.
The third economist - Mr Hans Tson Soderstrom of the Stockholm School of
Economics - differed by suggesting that unemployment, set to remain above 12
per cent five years hence, was so severe that some loosening of fiscal
policy was justified. He said Finland's gross public debt was not excessive
by international standards and the country could contemplate a demand
stimulus in the form of tax cuts.
However, the clear message from all three economists was that Finland must
also undertake difficult structural reforms to underpin a return to
sustained long-term growth.
Mr Soderstrom identified these as including: deregulation and reduced
subsidies in the sheltered domestic economy; a shift in public spending from
consumption and transfer payments to investment; recapitalisation of the
banking system and increased labour market flexibility. 'The need to combine
demand and supply-side measures and short-term policy action with long-term
policy commitments into one comprehensive policy programme poses a serious
co-ordination and credibility problem,' wrote the Swedish economist.
While there has been a high degree of co-operation between the government
and the opposition Social Democrats in parliament over fiscal policy
recently, there is no doubt that structural reforms raise much greater
difficulties. Already the powerful trade union organisations have curbed
government efforts to lower minimum wage levels. Privatisation has yet to
get seriously under way.
But among policymakers there is a growing realisation that changes are
necessary. Mr Viinanen, the finance minister, recently described Finland's
extremely high levels of unemployment benefits as 'a cancer' on the economy.
Some 60,000 jobs in the public sector have been axed in recent years.
'There is still a long way to go on labour market reforms,' says Mr Korkman.
'But I think there have been many profound changes in the public sector.
Ministries are really cutting expenditure and improving efficiency - even
though the result is to increase unemployment. The mental attitude has
changed.'

FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Finland (3): UN envoy may be president - Politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DURING THE chilly depths of their long, dark winter, Finns will vote next
January for a new president whom they hope will preside over the country's
emergence from three years of national gloom.
All the signs are that they will choose Mr Martti Ahtisaari, who comes from
outside the political mainstream and whose election would mark a break from
the rather stultified ways of the past and an attempt to seek a new path
after the economic and political traumas of the early 1990s.
Mr Ahtisaari is a diplomat whose most striking accomplishments have been as
a United Nations envoy, notably as the head of the operation overseeing
Namibia's transition to independence. Even as the campaign for the January
16 election warms up at home, he has stayed away, intending to remain in his
senior role in the UN's peacemaking efforts in former Yugoslavia until
December.
In other circumstances, that would seem an inauspicious background for
launching into domestic politics. But such is the level of disaffection with
the old guard that Mr Ahtisaari has consistently been streets ahead in the
polls. His burly physical presence and bluff 'folksy' approach - he is from
the rural north - have enhanced his popularity. But above all, he is a fresh
face.
'Ahtisaari has one big thing working for him,' says Mr Jaakko Iloniemi, head
of EVA - the Centre for Finnish Business and Policy Studies. 'He is not a
political figure. In the eyes of the nation he has no responsibility for the
mess we are in.'
Mr Ahtisaari's main policy platform is a clear advocacy of Finland's
application to join the European Community - an issue which has split the
country but so far does not seem to have damaged his popularity. He does
represent a political party - the main opposition Social Democrats. But it
was the potency of his non-party image that prompted the Social Democrats to
choose him over Mr Kalevi Sorsa, the former prime minister, in a primary
election in May.
Altogether, there are nine candidates vying for the presidency, but only two
form a real threat to Mr Ahtisaari. One, Mr Raimo Ilaskivi, of the
conservative National Coalition party, is a former mayor of Helsinki who
defeated Mr Pertti Salolainen, his party's leader, for the candidacy and is
also running on an anti-political ticket. Mr Paavo Vayrynen, until recently
foreign minister, is the candidate of Mr Esko Aho's Centre party and is an
experienced campaigner.
These two will put up a tough fight, attacking Mr Ahtisaari for his lack of
experience in domestic affairs. But Mr Ilaskivi, at least, admits that the
split in the anti-Ahtisaari vote means the only chance to defeat him is to
deny him a simple majority and force a run-off vote in February. 'Ahtisaari
will win on January 16. The question is whether he wins outright the first
time,' he says.
The new president will take over at a time of flux in Finnish political
life. The presidential election itself will be held for the first time by
popular vote, rather than by electoral college, a reform which helped both
Mr Ahtisaari and Mr Ilaskivi achieve their primary victories against
opponents of their respective party establishments.
The direct election of the president seems bound to increase the political
authority of the head of state, who already enjoys considerable
constitutional powers, such as the power to dissolve parliament, appoint
ministers, delay legislation and preside over foreign policy.
The three main candidates have all signalled an intention to be more active
than the Social Democratic incumbent, President Mauno Koivisto, whose
reticence has attracted criticism, particularly during the days of deepest
economic crisis in late 1992.
However, Mr Aho's centre-right government wants to push legislation through
parliament to curb some of the powers of the presidency as a balancing
measure to the introduction of direct election. Mr Ahtisaari has not
objected to such a move in principle, so long as the president's role in
foreign policy is not diminished.
While the constitutional balance between the presidency and parliament is
changing, there are also shifts going on within the parliamentary sphere.
The Social Democrats, under Mr Ulf Sundqvist, have largely gone along with
the tough fiscal policies of Mr Aho's coalition, recognising that public
spending has to be controlled to get a grip on the budget deficit and
foreign debt.
At a deeper level, parliamentary parties must also come to terms with
shifting attitudes among voters. According to an EVA survey, the response to
the collapse of old certainties has been to turn away from left-right issues
and to focus instead on 'traditional' values, with the emphasis on the
family, social justice and environmental issues. 'This means that there is a
desire to bring sheer party politics down from its pedestal - to make it a
servant of the electorate, rather than the master it has always aspired to
be,' EVA commented on the survey.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Finland (4): Cold comfort for the jobless - Half a
million are without work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SITTING IN his fifth floor office high above Helsinki's central Esplanade,
Mr Ilkka Kanerva, Finland's youthful Minister of Labour, offers no quick
solutions to the country's unemployment crisis, which has left one in five
workers out of a job after three years of deep recession.
Indeed, he expects the underlying trend to carry on rising for another year,
in spite of the country's recent export success. He believes the rate may
not start to fall noticeably for 18 months.
'If at the end of the current parliamentary period in two years' time,
unemployment is down to 15 per cent, it will be a good achievement,' he
says.
Finland now has Europe's second highest unemployment rate, with 500,000
people out of a job, but probably nowhere has the total climbed so quickly
in such a short period. Only three years ago, the country boasted one of
Europe's stronger economies and unemployment was just 4 per cent.
The jobless problem has brought remarkably little social tension, and so far
at least, many families have been protected from severe hardship by the
country's generous welfare system which guarantees good rates of benefit
during the first 500 working days that an individual is out of work.
Worldwide recession, the sharp slump in the domestic market and the collapse
of trade with the former Soviet Union have all contributed to the sharp
acceleration in the unemployment rate. The worst hit sector, as elsewhere in
the Nordic region, has been construction, although there has been widespread
rationalisation throughout the manufacturing industry. The good news is that
unemployment has probably reached its peak in the metal and engineering
sectors, but a far higher level of redundancies in the public sector can be
expected over the next 12 months.
Unemployment is undoubtedly Finland's main economic problem, alongside its
budget deficit and rising foreign debt. And therein lies the main
constraint: the government simply does not have the financial resources to
stimulate the economy through major infrastructure and investment programmes
and it is worried that any sign of fiscal relaxation could further weaken
the markka and damage its inflation and interest rate goals. Instead, it is
hoping that unemployment will gradually start to come down as part of a
broader export-led economic recovery, assisted by the fall in interest rates
which are at their lowest level for more than a decade.
The budgetary constraints mean that the type of FM10bn stimulation package
being proposed by the opposition Social Democrats has little chance of
becoming reality. Big infrastructure projects are out for the same reason.
That is not to say that nothing is being done. However, the effort is
reactive more than proactive and is centred on training and education
programmes. Mr Kanerva says that around 250,000 people a year can be offered
some form of training, but he accepts that this will have little impact on
long-term unemployment, which is set to reach 200,000 people by the end of
next year.
The broader government effort has been to overhaul the labour market and
introduce greater flexibility into the wage bargaining process. The need for
such flexibility is a theme which has been repeatedly emphasised by the OECD
and it was taken up again by the organisation in its latest report on
Finland, published last month. 'The present centralised bargaining framework
 -within which the government has, in the past, tended to facilitate wage
negotiations by offering expensive fiscal concessions - now appears
incompatible with the general thrust of government policy based on budget
consolidation,' the OECD stated.
But government efforts to overhaul labour market structures have yet to show
much success. In the spring, it encountered fierce union opposition,
including the threat of a general strike, when it tried to introduce a
package of reforms, including a scheme allowing employers to take on jobless
youths for 30 per cent less than the minimum wage. The measure was
eventually implemented, after agreement with the unions, but in a way which
has meant it has had little practical impact.
Mr Kanerva concedes that the government's approach might have been heavy-
handed, but he insists that the fight for reform will continue. 'The tactic
now will be step by step, rather than grand slam,' he states.
One scheme he wishes to implement would compel employees to operate a more
flexible working schedule, although it would not increase the total number
of hours they worked annually.
SAK, the blue collar union, says it is prepared to compromise, but only as
part of a broader package which tackles unemployment. It believes the
government could afford to expand public spending in the short term if
agreement on medium-term cuts in public spending could be reached as part of
a social pact. It has already identified a number of infrastructure
investments which it says could be funded in this way.
The union says it is ready to discuss wage rises in the context of job
security, investment and training, implicitly linking the question of wage
restraint to job creation.
The main frustration for the union is apparent government unwillingness to
open a dialogue. Mr Kanerva admits that relations are strained, but says
this is because the unions have traditionally been aligned with the
opposition Social Democrats, rather than with the centre-right parties which
are currently in power.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (3): Britain takes
the lion's share - More than 3,500 US companies are located in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL

<TEXT>
THERE is no argument about which EC member-state has been taking the lion's
share of inward investment into the community. Britain has consistently seen
off all competitors in the contest to win foreign direct investment.
Despite the political debate which surrounds the inward flow of foreign
capital - is Britain's success in this respect a sign of its economic
strengths or its exploitable weaknesses? - there can be no disputing its
impact on the UK.
Britain's prowess at promoting its 'open door' policy is confirmed by the
statistics. The country has been taking as much as one third of all inward
investment coming into the EC. There are now more than 3,500 US companies
located in the UK, with 1,000 German companies and around 200 from Japan. By
1991, the cumulative UK share of all US investment made in the community had
reached 36 per cent in value terms. The UK also accounted for nearly 41 per
cent by value of all Japanese investment in the EC.
Last year, another 303 inward investment decisions were taken in the UK's
favour, likely to involve around 56,000 jobs. In the five years until the
end of 1992, 275,000 jobs has been created or safeguarded in Britain by
inward investors.
In the manufacturing sector, overseas-owned enterprises investing in the UK
now provide 27 per cent of net capital expenditure and 16 per cent of all UK
manufacturing jobs.
Britain's attractions to potential investors include flexible working
conditions, relatively low labour costs and, for many, a language and
business culture which is easily adopted.
Though there have been some fears expressed about Britain's attitude to
Europe, most surveys have confirmed that this has not damaged its chances of
continuing to win new investment. Indeed, indications that Europe's
competitiveness is under threat because of its relatively high social and
employment costs could provide a further advantage to the UK as an EC
member-state which has refused to sign up to the EC's social programme.
There has also been concern about the quality of investment being made in
the UK by foreign companies. The arrival of so-called 'screwdriver' assembly
plants has not been greeted enthusiastically by critics, who complain of low
labour rates and the failure of inward investors to import the type of
technology which is badly required.
Supporters of inward investment, however, claim that the beneficial impact
far outweighs any disadvantages. The argument is that, far from spawning
fresh ranks of 'slave labour', new investment creates more jobs, raises the
demand for labour and, in turn, pushes up wage rates. In the final analysis,
it is a brave critic who will reject the notion that any job is better than
none.
A report on the knock-on effects of inward investment, commissioned by the
Department of Trade and Industry, suggests that, apart from offering
employment and training opportunities and new customers for UK capital
equipment, the arrival of foreign companies can bring about significant
quality improvements among suppliers and competitors.
At the heart of UK efforts to attract inward investment against a background
of global recession and increasing competition from other locations is the
Invest in Britain Bureau, part of the Department of Trade and Industry,
which has been operating for 16 years.
The IBB, offering a free and confidential service, is the government's main
inward investment promotion agency. It is the only body which represents the
nation as a whole, as opposed to the numerous regional organisations and
local agencies which champion their own areas. The IBB, which has helped
more than 2,000 foreign investment projects in the UK, sees itself as the
first port of call for any potential investor and the provider of 'honest,
accurate information', according to Mr Christopher Priston, director.
'We are not here to push companies in one direction, unlike some of our EC
competitors. We enable investors to have all the facts and to make the best
possible decision for them. To behave any differently would be
counter-productive,' he adds.
Apart from promoting the general attractions of the UK and providing
detailed location information for individual investors, the IBB is charged
with co-ordinating the efforts of the other, more localised promotional
agencies.
The bureau has an annual budget of Pounds 5.5m to fund the English regional
development organisations - Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are funded
directly by the Treasury - and has its own Pounds 2m promotional budget.
Mr Priston rejects the notion that the English promotional effort would be
better served by the creation of a single agency, as in the other countries
which go to make up the UK - 'I think we get the best of both worlds.
England is a big patch to cover and we have some excellent local agencies,
backed up by IBB at national level'.
The IBB accepts that it faces a tough challenge in maintaining the UK
record. In the year to April 1993, for example, the number of new inward
projects confirmed for the UK declined again from the 1990 peak of 350 to
303, largely because of the recession-associated fall in investment
activity.
The bureau expects the pattern of inward investment to change, irrespective
of the future level of activity. According to Mr Priston: 'The big US
companies are already here. There will be some continuing green field
investment but we now expect smaller investments from smaller American
companies wanting to take advantage of the single market.
'There will be few mega-projects from Japan but a second wave of investment
likely to involve supplier and sub-contractor activities. We also expect
some joint ventures, a route which the Japanese have not readily chosen in
the past.'
In response to complaints that inward investors are abandoned to their own
fate once they have taken the decision to set up in the UK, the IBB has just
started a follow-up programme which will entail visits to 1,000 companies
this year. They will be asked if they have any problems and the IBB will
endeavour to help if it can.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (2): EC remains a
powerful magnet - Inward investment activity from beyond the EC continues to
be dominated by the US and by the Japanese, who are likely to maintain their
predominant position / Countries in the European Community continue to
attract a brisk level of inward investment
</HEADLINE>

DESPITE the global recession, which has inevitably dented the flow of
international investment funds heading for Europe, the EC remains a magnet
for incoming, corporate investment.
The process of starting or expanding investment in Europe by companies based
beyond its boundaries has become a more protracted business as economic
uncertainties have multiplied.
But the evidence shows that, in the face of the growing threat posed by
booming investment centres along the Pacific Rim, the sheer scale and
sophistication of European markets guarantees for many of them a continuing,
high level of inward investment.
Estimates suggest that the EC countries have, in the early part of the
1990s, been attracting in the region of Dollars 65-70bn of new, annual
investment from beyond their boundaries.
The general expectation is that, after some reduction as a result of recent
economic weaknesses, they will continue to attract a major share of all
corporate investment activity.
The Americans - with around 30 per cent of all their corporate assets now
located outside the US - are no strangers to investing in the EC and account
for more than half the total foreign investment pouring in to the region.
But while there are no suggestions the US will cease to become a leading
player in European corporate investment, there are pressures being brought
to bear which will make EC nations a less obvious target for spending by
American corporations.
The free trade agreement signed between the US and Canada, America's largest
trading partner, and the new emphasis being placed on trade between Mexico
and the US, mean that Europe is going to have to fight harder to claim its
stake of North American investment.
The Japanese have come comparatively late to overseas investment markets - a
decade ago only 4 per cent of their total corporate assets lay overseas -
but they have moved impressively to reach 15 per cent. After an initial
period of heavy investment, however, most Japanese corporations have come
under immense liquidity pressures and have moderated the pace of new foreign
investment.
Even so, 20 per cent of Japanese overseas investment is ending up in Europe.
While most US companies appear to have positively based their decisions to
locate in Europe on the scale and potential of the market, the Japanese
seem, initially at least, to have been motivated more out of fear of being
thwarted than by any renewal in protectionist sentiment.
Whatever the motives behind the investment decisions being taken, the
favourite destinations for external investors are clear. The United Kingdom
continues to account for around one-third of all inward investment into the
EC, although the number of projects underway has fallen back recently.
No other EC nation has so far come anywhere near matching the record of the
UK, which now ranks as home for 37 per cent of all non-EC companies
operating within the community.
Germany, despite its most recent economic and political problems, is still
regarded as an important destination for inward funds but growing numbers of
companies now regard the country as an extremely expensive and increasingly
uncompetitive base from which to operate.
German companies themselves have been underpinning the perception by
transferring away from their own, high cost, country into other parts of
Europe.
The main beneficiaries have been the UK, France and Spain. But there is,
equally, a perception that Germany is alive to its problems and that it will
actively seek to protect the country's position as Europe's economic
power-house, so maintaining the interest of foreign investors.
France, which has not always had the most positive image for attracting
overseas investment, has also been performing better in attracting incomers,
not least because of the political priority which the issue has now been
given at the highest levels. See report, page six.
Belgium, which may have tended to expect its location at the political heart
of Europe to stand it in good stead, is widely regarded to have lost out in
the competition for inward investment, although it has now started to take
the issue seriously. Holland, meanwhile, has pursued a very successful
promotion strategy.
Despite its location on the very fringes of the EC, the Republic of Ireland
has also continued to attract a sizeable share of available foreign
manufacturing investment and, in relation to gross domestic product, has
done as well as any other EC member.
Spain, too, has been proving increasingly attractive as investors watch it
emerge as an important, open European market with a rapidly improving
infrastructure.
Although there are always exceptions, the general patterns on inward
investment tend to have matched certain categories of corporate investment
with particular EC regions.
While the main investment activity in distribution has tended to be located
within a belt which stretches from London, Rotterdam and Antwerp through
Luxembourg, Metz and Nancy, European headquarters operations have
concentrated on cities like Brussels, London, Geneva and Frankfurt.
Manufacturing activities by inward investors have been very widely spread
throughout the community, depending on proximity to the ultimate marketplace
for the products concerned.
The UK, Ireland, France and the Benelux countries have been taking the
lion's share of available manufacturing investment.
Given the increasing competition within Europe and beyond for whatever
investment funds are available, it is clear that only the most aggressive
marketing and the most supportive 'after-sales' operations at national or
regional level can expect to succeed.
While the degree of financial help is important - available EC incentives
average around 15 per cent of capital spend by inward investors - it has
become clear that investors are equally concerned about the extent to which
they can seek guidance and advice after they have made their decision to
locate.
Some investors have complained that, while agencies have worked around the
clock for months or years to attract companies, they have been left totally
to their own devices once operations have started.
According to one location specialist: 'Companies can feel very badly let
down when they are feted, wined and dined - and then dropped after their
arrival.
'Those responsible for encouraging inward investment must remember that
investors may have chosen their patch once but that they have the whole of
Europe to choose from next time.
'If they wish to maintain their inward investment, they have to build
relationships which will last'.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Finland: A hard slog lies ahead - The economy
should return to growth next year after a deep depression. But unemployment
will stay high for the rest of the decade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Weary after three years of deep recession and wary of what may still occur
in neighbouring Russia, Finland is looking to the year ahead to establish a
recovery in the economy and to plot the political path it will follow in the
second half of the decade.
Thanks to a resurgence in exports, the economy is set to return to growth in
1994 after a traumatic depression. National output has shrunk by fully 10
per cent since the turn of the decade and unemployment has mounted from
below 5 per cent of the workforce to 20 per cent in a country that in the
1980s had become one of Europe's most affluent societies.
On the strategic front, Finns watched - with more anxiety than most - the
events unfolding across their long border with Russia last week; they will
be hoping that 1994 will see President Boris Yeltsin entrench democratic and
economic stability in the neighbour that has always loomed ominously over
Finland's eastern shoulder.
More than that, the governing centre-right coalition of Mr Esko Aho, the
prime minister, as well as the Social Democratic opposition, intend that
next year will see a successful outcome to Helsinki's negotiations for
membership of the European Community, which they regard as an essential
economic and political anchor for Finland in the post-cold war world.
The beginning of the year will also bring a change of national leadership.
Elections in January for a successor to President Mauno Koivisto will for
the first time be held by universal suffrage, adding political weight to the
office of head of state. The strong favourite is Mr Martti Ahtisaari,
candidate of the Social Democrats and prominent United Nations diplomat, who
enthusiastically advocates Finnish membership of the EC.
But although the outlook is brighter, many obstacles remain which suggest
that Finland still faces a hard slog to restore the prosperity and
confidence it enjoyed in the 1980s.
Already, the government has had to revise downwards its earlier projections
of 3 per cent growth next year. The weaker than expected condition of key
export markets, particularly Sweden and Germany, and the persistence of low
demand and high savings ratios in the domestic economy have combined to push
down official growth estimates for 1994 to around 1 per cent, a level which
will barely make a dent on unemployment.
Mr Aho's government is also constrained by a high budget deficit - running
at around 10 per cent of gross domestic product - and a concern to rein in a
foreign debt which grew rapidly over the past three years to reach 50 per
cent of GDP. Progress has been made, with public spending pegged in real
terms at 1991 levels and a current account surplus anticipated next year
thanks to the recovery in exports.
But the high cost of unemployment payments and the heavy costs of rescuing
the loss-ridden banking system from collapse have slowed the process of
righting the imbalance in the public finances and squeezed out any
possibility of a significant fiscal stimulus for the economy.
'We have a special interest to stimulate the domestic economy,' Mr Aho said
in an interview with the FT. 'But the problem is that there are very tight
limits for stimulation. The main way to stimulate the economy is to push
interest rates downwards and keep them down.'
Interest rates are at their lowest level for decades, steadily reduced since
the markka was floated in September last year and quickly lost more than 25
per cent of its value. But recovery in investment has been slow to appear as
companies and private individuals prefer to play down the debts they still
carry from the carefree days of the 1980s.
The uncomfortable reality is that, even under the most optimistic
projections, unemployment in Finland is set to remain above 10 per cent for
the rest of the decade.
Mr Aho's Centre party and his conservative coalition partners see more
far-reaching structural reforms as a way to engender more long-term growth.
But there is still considerable resistance to the notion of wholesale
changes in Finland's highly-developed welfare and social systems. Attempts,
for example, to lower minimum wages for young workers have been largely
blocked by the labour unions.
A key element in the government's long-term economic strategy for Finland
lies in joining the EC. Helsinki has already signed up to join the European
Economic Area, the open market agreement between the Community and the
countries of the European Free Trade Association. But, like the governments
in neighbouring Norway and Sweden, Finland wants to advance to full
membership to bring the economy fully within the EC fortress, not least to
ensure that Finnish investment does not migrate, and to help attract inward
investment.
The desire for EC membership extends well beyond the economic argument,
however. It is seen in Helsinki as an important strategic repositioning of
the country after the end of the cold war.
Throughout the east-west confrontation after the second world war, Finland,
which established its independence from Russian rule only in 1917, steered a
course of neutrality, which was respected by the US and the Soviet Union
alike. Lucrative trade agreements with the latter were the basis for much of
Finland's surge to prosperity - and a primary cause of recession when the
Soviet Union collapsed.
Now relationships with Russia are less certain. Initial fears of chaos
across the border and, perhaps, floods of Russian refugees, have subsided,
notwithstanding the dramatic events in Moscow this month. Finland has
established strong political and trading ties with the newly-independent
Baltic states, particularly Estonia, which lies less than 50 miles away
across the Gulf of Finland. In a revitalised Baltic region, it sees St
Petersburg, with its 9m population, as a lucrative potential market.
But Helsinki is nevertheless looking to membership of the EC - and
participation in the Community's evolving political and security structures
 -as its strategic anchor in the new order and an insurance policy against
future instability in Russia.
By no means all Finns are enthusiastic about joining the EC, however.
Although opinion is more favourable than in Norway and Sweden, polls still
show a strong hostile minority. Opposition covers issues from the fear of
rural communities that they will lose generous subsidies, to fears of a loss
of Finland's freedom. Opinion divides within political parties, with Mr
Aho's Centre party, for example, split on the issue.
'Finns are used to the idea that freedom and independence are one and the
same thing and that anything which impinges on independence impinges on
their freedom,' says Mr Kaakko Iloniemi, director of the Centre for Finnish
Business and Policy Studies.
The government has promised a referendum on the issue which will be held
sometime late next year if the target of joining in 1995 is to be met. Much
will depend on achieving an accession agreement in the negotiations now
under way with Brussels that the government can 'sell' to the electorate as
a good deal for Finland.
Hence Mr Aho has adopted a tough negotiating stance, demanding EC subsidies
for Finland's farmers and calling on the Community to accept the special
needs of the Nordic region. 'They have to accept, in a way, new policies - a
new approach - like they did when Portugal and Spain joined,' says Mr Aho.
'Then it was the southern approach. Now it is a question of the northern
approach.'
The campaign to win support for Finland's EC membership should receive a
boost in January when Mr Ahtisaari is expected to win the presidency. He,
more than any of his eight opponents for the post, espouses the cause and,
indeed, he is a potent symbol of an active Finnish role internationally.
Finnish presidents have tended to play a less active political role than the
constitutional powers of the office allow, but Mr Ahtisaari has signalled
that he intends to take the lead in foreign policy that the constitution
affords.
His fame is built chiefly on his role as a UN envoy - notably heading the
UN's operation overseeing Namibia's transition to independence. His
popularity at home has undoubtedly been enhanced by the fact that he is not
associated with the disasters that have overtaken the country in the past
few years. His voice could be vital in cementing opinion in favour of EC
membership.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Survey of Business Locations in Europe (1): Companies face
tough decisions - The driving force behind much of the business location

market of 400 million people

WHILE the politicians agonise over the future shape and direction of Europe,
the commercial community which makes up one of the world's most powerful
economies has to get on with its business. The luxury of long-term summitry
is for others; winning the next order is top of the daily agenda.
But as corporate Europe clocks on, it is increasingly obliged to take note
of far-reaching structural changes, proposed and underway, in the political
and economic landscape.
Companies' future success or failure will depend on the strength of their
strategic skills and how they deploy them to best exploit a western and
central European market of 400m people.
Nor will the game of winning in Europe only be played by the huge
multinational corporations who are well used to adapting, chameleon-like, to
local circumstances; more modest-sized businesses will have to raise their
sights to wider, European horizons.
Even without the prospect of an enlarged community, the parameters for doing
business are already changing. The recent creation - by the EC and the seven
member states of the European Free Trade Association - of the European
Economic Area establishes the world's largest free trade market.
Central and eastern European markets, despite the immense difficulties
confronting businesses intent upon capitalising on the new freedoms of
former communist states, add yet another dimension to the marketplace.
Small wonder that there is a growing tendency for companies to abandon the
notion of the nation state and to think in European terms for their markets
and regionally for their manufacturing, distribution and management
facilities.
Still less surprising that companies from the world's most important trading
nations, like the US and Japan, remain keen to increase their presence and
participation in Europe, even if their efforts are temporarily subdued by
liquidity pressures and recession.
The big inward investors are maintaining extensive inward investment
programmes, but the decision-making process is being stretched and in such
uncertain economic times there is a growing reluctance to push the button.
Much has also been made of the threat to Europe posed by the economic
power-house fast emerging along the Pacific rim, with a ferocious rate of
high-technology investment being notched up in places like Taiwan and South
Korea.
The US might also be increasingly attracted to markets on its own doorstep
once it signs a North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.
But does that mean that Europe's best days for attracting global business
are over?
'The idea that Europe as a location for corporate investment is somehow
'over the top' is ridiculous,' according to Dr Wilfried Vossen, managing
director of Plant Location International, the location specialists. 'Europe
is and will remain a huge market, with high education and skills levels and
enormous consumer power. But it is certainly going to have to adapt if it is
not to lose the international battle for investment.
'Europe is becoming a very expensive alternative to other investment
locations and it is going to have to tackle many sacred cows, not least high
social costs which can no longer be afforded and which make it very hard to
create employment,' adds Dr Vossen.
Such comments find a warm reception among critics of the EC social chapter
in the UK, which has refused to sign up. The Institute of Directors recently
described EC social legislation as a 'misdirected and damaging
job-destroying machine'; and the British government is now calling on EC
members to reform their social security systems in order to cut the rising
cost of employment. Germany's most recent experience would tend to support
the theory. According to Mr David Rees, head of location advisory service at
Ernst &amp; Young: 'There is now a flow of outward investment from German
companies into other parts of the community as they migrate away from their
own high costs'.
German investment in the UK now ranks second behind the United States, with
51 investment decisions - involving 16,000 jobs - recorded in the year to
April 1993 by the Invest in Britain Bureau.
THE UK has a lot at stake, given its record as the most successful European
nation in the fight to attract inward investment. In the last decade, the UK
is calculated to have taken nearly 40 per cent of all non-EC investment made
in Europe. The country also accommodates about 30 per cent of all the
Japanese manufacturing plants which have moved into the EC.
Past achievement, even so, is no guarantee of future success and now
competition for foreign investment is intense, with France and Spain, for
example, giving priority to attracting their share of available funds.
With the first wave of large, green field investment over, there may also be
a temptation among many companies to spread risk by selecting a separate
location for second generation projects. The type of investment may also
change, with fewer green field developments and more attention paid to
expanding or modernising existing facilities.
The driving factor behind much of the location activity now underway across
Europe emanates from the search for economies of scale and the need to
rationalise structures established when European markets were more
fragmented - 'the rate of consolidation under way is dramatic,' according to
Dr Vossen of PLI. 'Companies are taking a long, hard look at manufacturing,
distribution and managerial functions at European, national and company
levels.
'It is not proving an easy task. We are talking about kingdoms being
dismantled and everyone fighting to protect their own patches'.
One inevitable, less welcome aspect of consolidation is plant closure and
some international companies have notably failed to underestimate the
problems and costs of shut-down, a process often subject to stringent
national laws.
The image of footloose multinational conglomerates roaming Europe in search
of short-term advantage is largely unfounded but Hoover's decision earlier
this year to close its Dijon plant in France and locate all its vacuum
cleaner production in Scotland provoked uproar. More recently, the tables
were reversed when CPC (UK) decided to move production of its Knorr brand
soups and cubes from Scotland, where it has been based for 30 years, to
France and Italy. But how does a company decide where to go, when there are
so many options and when mistakes can prove so costly?
Though Europe may present itself increasingly as a region which is
interdependent and heading for economic convergence, it remains a widely
diverse trading area, scattered with languages, differing employment laws
and taxation regimes.
Market accessibility continues to be the principal driving factor behind
choice of site but then peripheral locations may offer factors like lower
labour costs and better quality of life.
The availability of financial incentives for inward investors, which vary
considerably throughout the EC, is also emerging as an increasingly
important factor, given the pressing need to limit cost. Not too long ago,
the question of incentives came into the latter stages of the
decision-making process; hard times dictate that more companies are now
anxious to know from the outset where the best cash hand-outs are available.

FT  11 OCT 93 / The FT Interview: Sober after the feast - Felipe Gonzalez,
the Spanish prime minister, speaks to Peter Bruce, David Marsh and Tom Burns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE, DAVID MARSH and TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The march to European union has always been more than a question of mere
politics and economics for Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister.
In the past, it has been a hobby, a spectacle, a feast - as pleasurable as
the cured Spanish hams he still regularly sends his friend, Chancellor
Helmut Kohl of Germany.
Now, however, as the Madrid autumn descends around his red-brick Moncloa
Palace residence, Mr Gonzalez shows a touch of wistfulness about the
European Community and Spain's place in it.
In his first newspaper interview since his fourth consecutive election
victory on June 6, Mr Gonzalez puts on a convincing display of realism - a
product of constraints on his freedom of manoeuvre, stemming from setbacks
both at home and in the rest of Europe.
As Mr Gonzalez speaks, in a salon strewn with white sofas, his deputy prime
minister, Mr Narcis Serra, is negotiating with executives from Germany's
Volkswagen in another part of the Moncloa Palace. They are discussing the
possible closure of the Barcelona factory owned by VW's Seat subsidiary, the
likely consequence both of heavy losses at Seat and VW's general troubles in
Germany.
Mr Gonzalez faces a struggle on several fronts. As he attempts to persuade
his Socialist party of the benefits of a more rigorous economic policy, he
is seeking agreement from recalcitrant trade unions for deregulation of wage
bargaining to increase Spain's industrial competitiveness.
Asked whether large threatened job cuts in Barcelona could help his efforts
to end some of the notorious rigidities in the Spanish economy, Mr Gonzalez
confirms the sighting of a modest silver lining. 'It's difficult to be a
masochist. But sometimes a crisis can act as a purge. It can make people sit
up and take notice.'
Certainly, Spaniards are now taking notice that times are tougher. Infected
by the European recession, Spain this year will register its first year of
economic contraction since 1981. Its hopes that the peseta could become part
of the 'hard core' of European currencies closely linked to the D-Mark were
shattered by three devaluations between September 1992 and May 1993.
After the virtual collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism in
August, Mr Gonzalez admits there is a 'tremendous question mark' over
whether the EC can achieve its aim of economic and monetary union by 1997 or
1999.
Referring to the targets set down in the Maastricht treaty for bringing EC
budget deficits and government debt under greater control, Mr Gonz-alez
admits: 'We have div-erged from the convergence criteria.'
Spain's public sector budget deficit will be over 6 per cent of gross
domestic product this year, double the 3 per cent target set by the
Maastricht treaty. Even though the government has tacitly abandoned its
original plan to reduce the deficit to 1 per cent of GDP by 1996, he says
the EC has no alternative but to press on with the Maastricht convergence
plans.
His hopes for improved European economic co-operation are somewhat slender.
He is pinning them on the new European Monetary Institute to be set up next
year, probably in Germany, as the forerunner to the planned EC central bank.
On the home front, his Socialists in June lost their previous absolute
majority in the Cortes (parliament). This requires Mr Gonzalez to make deals
with two small regional parties, the Basque PNV and the bigger Catalan CiU,
to push through parliament an austere budget presented at the end of last
month. The budget proposes a civil service wage freeze next year as well as
less generous pay-outs of social benefits and pensions.
He says he would have preferred a formal coalition with the Basque and
Catalan parties, but will make the best of ruling with a minority
government.
'This is something completely new in our country,' says Mr Gonzalez. 'People
are not accustomed to the central government doing deals with parliamentary
minorities. It makes for an extraordinary commotion.
'My idea, and it seemed to me the best way to guarantee stability, was a
coalition (but) with this excluded we have to make pacts to govern . . . If
we have to go on negotiating, then we'll just do it.'
The need to improve competitiveness seems to have infused the ever-didactic
Mr Gonzalez with additional zeal for lecturing his Socialist party on the
facts of economic life.
He has started making a number of keynote speeches to take forward his
campaign. The first - to a congress of young socialists - came last night.
He is also scheduled to address a large meeting of supporters in his
Andalucian homeland.
These will be the opening shots of a campaign to reshape the Socialist
party's policies. Noisy arguments among leftwing and liberal factions,
strongly influenced by Byzantine power struggles in the provinces, will
reach a head when the party holds a congress next March, its first in more
than three years.
'I am provoking a debate because what I want to do is to have the problems
defined. I myself will defining my own position and making it clear.'
Mr Gonzalez says parties of 'democratic socialism', now in a small minority
among EC governments, have to face up to their new tasks unflinchingly, but
without undue defensiveness.
'We defended liberty against the communists and we stressed social welfare
against the conservatives,' he says.
Now, however, after the collapse of communism in Europe and the end of the
EC's late-1980s economic buoyancy, the position has changed. 'We can't keep
saying: 'We want what we had in the 1960s'. This is a whole new debate,' Mr
Gonzalez says.
A central focus is the role of the state as a provider of welfare. 'What we
have to do is to relate the capacity of the welfare state to increases in
the country's productivity.' Sounding almost like Mr Peter Lilley, the UK
social security secretary, Mr Gonzalez says: 'We have to define (as
priorities) certain types of welfare benefits and I am worried above all
about certain elements of fraud and abuse in the welfare state.'
Spain's 21 per cent unemployment rate, the highest in the EC, is directly
linked to the inflexibility of the Spanish labour market, he says. Wage
inflation, at more than 7 per cent, has remained around 2 percentage points
above the inflation rate in spite of the recession.
The prime minister is adamant that the trade unions must undergo a 'cultural
change. They have to stop seeing everything in terms of wages and profits
and think instead about how a company can compete in an open market'.
Setting out an agenda for plant-by-plant wage bargaining, and less onerous
hire-and-fire regulations, he says: 'We have to remove and eliminate all the
obstacles to the creation of employment.' Commenting on labour reform talks
that started last week with unions and employers on a three-year 'social
pact', Mr Gonzalez says he will force through the measures whether he gets
agreement or not.
'I hope there will be agreement,' he says. But he points to the unions'
difficulty in reaching a compromise. 'The big problem is that the government
has nothing to give (the unions) in exchange.'
Frequently during the past few years, Mr Gonzalez has espoused tough-talking
free market rhetoric without producing results. Now, in his latest and most
serious campaign to tackle Spain's problems, Mr Gonzalez is throwing into
the breach his authority as Europe's best-respected Socialist prime
minister. The environment, both in Spain and in the rest of Europe, has
become a lot harsher; if he fails this time, that authority will start to
crumble.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Nato's growing pains: Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The crushing of the Moscow parliament raises troubling questions about the
future of Russia and the policies of the west towards Moscow. In the west
the short-sighted have brayed crude applause for the victory of the good
over the bad. Reality is less reassuring. It seems likely that from now on,
events in Russia will present the west with increasingly difficult policy
dilemmas.
The end of the parliamentary-presidential stalemate in Moscow may open the
door to the economic reforms needed to stabilise Russian society; the new
parliament due to be elected in December may help the building of a
precarious democracy.
But events may prove less utopian. If Russia becomes 'democratic', it may
not remain stable; if 'stable', it may not remain democratic. The new
parliament could be as incoherent as the old, and just as obstructive to
government policy. Worse, the bloody and incompetent use of military force
in putting down the parliament, may turn out to be an ominous precedent for
the role of the military in the turbulent years ahead.
As a result, western leaders face new and serious dilemmas. They have
supported President Boris Yeltsin, partly because he faced down the abortive
communist coup against President Mikhail Gorbachev in August 1991, partly
because he has the legitimacy of popular election. Since the parliamentary
shoot-out, western support has become almost unconditional.
Yet this crisis may mark a watershed in east-west relations. The west still
has every reason to hope for friendship with Russia; it still wants and
supports democratic and economic reforms. But the Moscow crisis and its
bloody conclusion, through some uncertain Faustian pact between army units
and the state, contain the risk that Russia may become more unstable
internally, more dangerous externally.
In other words, western security anxieties, which only four years ago seemed
to have evaporated in the heady euphoria following the collapse of the
Berlin Wall, are now likely to move up the agenda again.
These anxieties are already welling up in a new debate on the future of
Nato, which will come to a head at next January's Nato summit. And topping
that agenda will be the most contentious question: should Nato extend its
reach, or even its membership, to include countries in eastern Europe?
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have all pressed their hope of
joining Nato; and the idea of enlarging Nato membership has been encouraged
in Germany by Mr Volker Ruhe, German defence minister, and by Mr Manfred
Worner, Nato secretary-general. Even Chancellor Helmut Kohl has endorsed the
idea that Nato should give security guarantees to eastern Europe, perhaps
short of full membership.
The question of Nato enlargement will be settled essentially in Washington,
but it will also be crucially influenced by events in Russia. In August, in
a public statement in Warsaw, Mr Yeltsin gave the green light to Nato
membership for Poland and other east European countries. Since then,
however, he has reversed tack and privately warned western leaders against
any such enlargement; instead he has proposed that Russia and Nato should
jointly guarantee the security of eastern Europe.
This proposal has no chance of acceptance. The countries of eastern Europe
have only just thrown off the 'security' imposed by the former Soviet Union,
and they will not accept its return by the back door. But it is disturbing
confirmation of other claims advanced by Russia to a right to intervene in
the 'near abroad' - that is, its neighbours in the former Soviet empire.
Senator Richard Lugar, leading foreign policy spokesman for the US
Republicans, thinks enlargement is the best way to give Nato a new lease of
life. But most US policymakers will be even less enthusiastic about
enlarging Nato than the Russians. Their first hope is peace with their new
Russian friends; an extension of Nato to the Russian frontier would look
provocative, even hostile.
More important, the US will be reluctant to extend the real prize of Nato
membership - the ultimate security umbrella of an US nuclear guarantee.
While Russia's stability hangs in the balance, it is implausible that
Washington should extend such a guarantee to new Nato members in the east,
at the same time as it is slashing its troop forces in the west, now down to
100,000 men and falling.
The problem will not go away, however, because enlargement of the European
Community will automatically raise the question of Nato membership. The 12
are now negotiating membership with four countries belonging to the European
Free Trade Association, and they are close to conceding eventual membership
for eastern Europe. The Maastricht treaty commits the Community to the
development of a common security policy. But if Nato cannot be expanded, the
security policy of an enlarged EC would have to be conducted mainly outside
Nato.
This is the epitome of the EC's political dilemma. It can develop as an
independent partner in the trans-Atlantic community in which its security
policy can be the European pillar in intimate alliance with the US. Or it
can develop in the direction of a pan-European structure, in which case its
enlargement towards the east would progressively weaken the link with the
transatlantic alliance.
In some ways, western Europe will have to embrace the east. But it is
obviously not yet ready to take on, by itself, the risks and possible
threats posed by the disintegrating Russian empire.

FT  11 OCT 93 / The social role of savings: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why do many Americans support President Bill Clinton's drive to overhaul the
US healthcare system but oppose his other main legislative priority - the
North American Free Trade Agreement? The answer is that a guarantee of
universal access to healthcare seems to promise greater economic security
for many families whereas Nafta is widely (if wrongly) perceived as a threat
to jobs and living standards.
What the federal government should or should not do to promote economic
security in the face of intensified global competition is being hotly
debated in Washington. Mr Bill Bradley, the Democratic senator from New
Jersey, is urging Mr Clinton to do more than merely improve access to
healthcare. To restore the shattered confidence of middle -income families,
the US needs to create a broad 'economic security platform'. In addition to
universal health cover this would include lifelong access to education and
training - to enable displaced workers to relaunch themselves in new careers
 -and tough regulation of private pension schemes to end discrimination
against workers forced by competitive pressures to switch jobs frequently.
Mr Bradley's remarks are timely. The federal government could certainly do
more to promote adult educational opportunities and make pensions fully
portable. But economic insecurity presents a much broader challenge for
governments everywhere: to foster an improved public understanding of an
individual's responsibilities in a competitive market economy.
With the demise of communism, nearly everybody agrees market capitalism
offers a better hope of improved living standards than alternative economic
systems. But market forces can work their magic only if people are willing
to adapt. No group of workers can be guaranteed indefinite employment at any
particular level of wages. A market economy can deliver steadily higher
average living standards only if everybody accepts an implicit bargain:
changing economic conditions may require them, at some point, to make a
temporary sacrifice. It is failure to accept the risks associated with
capitalism that creates the rigidities that prevent rapid growth.
But why are many people terrified by the pace of change imposed by global
market forces? The short answer is they cannot afford to be flexible because
they lack a financial cushion to carry them through bad times. People
without savings are unlikely to support free markets.
Since antiquity, economists have preached the virtues of thrift. But today
arguments for higher saving are usually couched in one-dimensional
macroeconomic terms. Savings, we are told, will promote investment and hence
lead to faster growth. In the long run, this logic is irrefutable: if people
do not postpone consumption, capital cannot be accumulated. If capital is
not accumulated, an economy cannot expand.
But the crucial role of personal savings in helping individuals cope with
the vicissitudes of a market economy is too often overlooked. The argument
has particular force in the US (and other Anglo-Saxon economies) where rates
of personal savings tend to be abysmally low. The best way to reduce
people's feelings of insecurity and to increase their commitment to
capitalism is to persuade them to save a higher fraction of their income.
This will lubricate economic change more effectively than an extension of
publicly funded social benefits, which tend to undermine individuals'
incentive to accept responsibility for their economic futures.
The commitment to thrift in the east Asian 'miracle' economies shows that
much higher levels of personal savings are possible even for families on low
to medium incomes. The first step western governments should take is to
remove fiscal disincentives to saving. The US, which raises only a tiny
proportion of national revenue through consumption taxes, is one of the
worst offenders in this respect. The US tax code directly penalises saving
by taxing nominal, rather than real, interest income and capital gains. And
it provides huge subsidies for personal borrowing: mortgage interest of up
to Dollars 1m a year is deductible.
A more controversial question is whether governments should mandate higher
rates of personal savings rather than merely level the fiscal playing field.
This is the path now being taken by several developing countries. At first
glance, government-imposed savings requirements may seem an unacceptable
infringement of personal liberty. But it rather depends on their purpose.
Suppose mandated savings were introduced as an alternative to tax-financed
welfare. Governments, after all, could abolish most public sector pensions
and require everybody to save a sizeable fraction of income through portable
private pension schemes. Which would be the greater restraint of liberty:
mandated savings obliging people to accumulate wealth and so take
responsibility for most of their future needs; or taxes forcing people to
finance benefits for others?
A social policy that relies on, or demands, increased personal saving is
bound to be widely unpopular. It is always more pleasant if somebody else
pays. Yet it is necessary both to fuel economic growth and to cope with the
economic insecurity that is the counterpart of market dynamism.

FT  11 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: EMU under scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE future of European currency policy hangs in the balance this week as
Germany deliberates on the Maastricht Treaty on European Union.
Concentration on the implications for currency are likely to come to the
fore as the impact of disappointing US job figures is taken on board.
Barring unforeseen dramas the German constitutional court will tomorrow rule
on whether Maastricht conforms with the country's basic law.
The most damning ruling would be for no move to Economic Monetary Union
(EMU) without some form of vote. As opinion polls suggest more than 70 per
cent of voters would oppose abolition of the D - Mark, a test of Maastricht
at the polls would probably end German participation in EMU.
Mr Paul Chertkow, currency analyst at UBS, said: 'If the court votes no,
convergence goes out the window. Countries with high unemployment and low
inflation would have to cut and run on the UK model. There would be no
anchor and currencies would be assessed on their fundamental value.'
It is more likely that the court will ratify the Treaty but attach strings.
This could prompt heavy selling of the Ecu and affect its constituent parts,
the main currencies in the exchange rate mechanism.
The potential impact of an adverse German decision was overshadowed by
tension surrounding US employment data for September. When the figures came
in on Friday they matched most forecasts but the make-up suggested any hopes
for US recovery were premature. Heavy dollar selling was compounded by
expiry of dollar/D - Mark options expiry and sent the US currency sharply
lower against leading currencies.
Worries about the US economy are likely to be compounded by flat consumer
and producer price statistics this week.
