The Chicago Board of Trade and the US Labor Department are investigating
reports that the September jobless data was leaked to bond market traders
ahead of the official release yesterday, writes Laurie Morse in Chicago.
Treasury bond futures traders at the Chicago Board of Trade became
suspicious when bond futures prices rallied sharply in disorderly or 'fast
market' conditions just minutes before the release.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Bhutto claims she has enough support to form government

MS Benazir Bhutto said yesterday she would form Pakistan's next government
in Islamabad, but her arch rival, Mr Nawaz Sharif refused to concede defeat.
Ms Bhutto's Pakistan People's party won a significant lead in Wednesday's
elections over the Pakistan Moslem League, winning
92 seats to the PML's 72 seats in the 217-seat lower house of the
parliament, the national assembly. Ms Bhutto hopes to widen her alliance by
including other independent members and smaller parties, which would give
her a majority. She said yesterday: 'Mr Nawaz Sharif has lost the battle.
The numbers cannot be played with. There is no way that he can catch up.'
The results have raised fears that the new government could be weak if it is
pulled in different directions by coalition partners. Pakistan's most
difficult challenge is that of putting in place a stable government which
would end a year of crisis in government.
The country's four provinces go to the polls today, with the crucial fight
in the Punjab, Pakistan's largest and most prosperous province. While urban
Punjab is Mr Sharif's territory, the PPP and its allies are strong in rural
districts. In Wednesday's general elections the PPP and its allies won
slightly more Punjab seats than the PML.
Both sides are now hoping to win enough seats to form the government in all
four provinces. Although the PPP is still expected to form the central
government, the provincial election results would establish the extent to
which Mr Sharif could stall Ms Bhutto politically, by hampering central
government policies.
Mr Sharif is also insisting on forming the central government through a new
coalition in order to rally his supporters before today's provincial
elections. Mr Siddiq-ul-Farooq, a senior aide to Mr Sharif, said last night:
'We are confident of forming the government at the centre. We are in contact
with smaller groups and individually elected members to seek their support.'

FT  09 OCT 93 / US lacklustre jobs figures boost bonds
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US BOND prices rose sharply on Wall Street yesterday following the release
of lacklustre employment figures pointing to continued sluggish economic
growth.
The Labour Department said unemployment was unchanged last month at 6.7 per
cent and reported a net rise of 156,000 in non-farm employment, less than
many traders expected.
Analysts had feared that a robust increase in jobs would step up pressure on
the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy. The release of relatively
weak figures relieved the tension. The price of the benchmark Treasury
30-year bond soared 1 3/8 points in early trading, one of the biggest gains
in recent weeks. By midday the dollar was down two pfennigs at DM1.6050.
'It's a respectable job gain, but the details of the report are
disappointing,' said Ms Cynthia Latta, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, the
forecasting group. There was no reason to expect an acceleration of economic
growth, currently 2.5 per cent a year. 'The Fed might as well go on
vacation.'
Mr Robert Reich, the labour secretary, said the jobless rate was still too
high. He said the number of people unemployed for six months or more was
still rising despite economic recovery and a fall in the overall jobless
rate in the past year.
The increase in non-farm employment last month was in line with the average
monthly gain so far this year. It followed a revised decline of 41,000 in
August.
Manufacturing employment fell by 18,000 last month, taking the total loss
since February to 266,000. Service sector employment rose 164,000 with most
of the gains in the government and retail sectors.
The index of aggregate hours worked fell 0.8 per cent, further evidence of
relatively sluggish trading conditions.

FT  09 OCT 93 / China rates squeeze alarms export credit bodies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS by Chinese companies to squeeze interest charges on loans for big
import contracts below internationally agreed 'consensus' rates have caused
alarm this week among leading export credit agencies.
At a meeting of their umbrella body, the Berne Union, the agencies warned
that the Chinese pressure was threatening to blur the higher levels of
transparency being sought in the financing of big contracts in the
developing world.
They said the efforts would raise funding costs rather than trim them.
The 'consensus' interest rate on finance for contracts in China is currently
6.75 per cent. This figure is reviewed twice a year by the Paris-based
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and is intended to
prevent tit-for-tat subsidy wars over the financial terms of contracts in
developing countries.
Pressure from China has come from companies that have to pay a 35 per cent
tax on any foreign contract which carries loan interest rates higher than 5
per cent.
Contractors in certain countries have been willing to 'cosmeticise' their
interest rates by adding to the price of the contract the 1.75 per cent
margin between China's demanded rate and the consensus rate.
This has been condemned by certain countries, among which Australia has been
prominent, because it might give other countries the false impression that
governments were willing to bow to pressure to offer lower loan interest
rates.
It has also been criticised because it increases the danger that corrupt
middlemen might splice 'commissions' into the price of a contract.
An OECD official said yesterday there was no principled objection to
'cosmetic' interest rates. He noted that several Islamic governments
required zero interest rates to conform with Islamic banking laws.
He emphasised nevertheless that the consensus rate would still effectively
be charged, even if it were built into the contract price. The cost of such
loans would be higher as a result, he said, since banks asked to
'cosmeticise' the loan would charge fees for doing so.
China is also at odds with OECD exporters in the telecommunications sector,
where it is insisting that projects are not commercially viable in order to
qualify for 'mixed credits' - cheap loans where commercial credits are mixed
with grant aid.
Many OECD governments insist that telecommunications projects should be seen
as commercially viable. Under the OECD's Helsinki accord, agreed in 1991,
aid funds cannot be used to dilute the cost of loans if a project is
commercially viable.
The spokesman said the same issue had arisen over contracts in India, and
that the power sector was likely to prove as controversial as
telecommunications.
A Bank of China official denied in London it was government policy to press
for interest rates below the consensus rate. Problems had arisen in part
because Chinese importers, ignorant of internationally agreed financing
rules, were 'looking for bargains'. Confusion had also arisen among domestic
banks like Industrial and Commercial Bank, Bank of Communications, and
Agriculture Bank, which have only recently become involved in international
finance.

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S economy will not grow at all this calendar year, according to latest
estimates by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
The Paris-based organisation has revised its provisional 1993 growth
forecast for Japan downward from the 1 per cent predicted last July, said Mr
Kumiharu Shigehara, head of the its economic department.
Growth would be slightly less than 2 per cent next year, he told Japanese
newspapers. This would mark a recovery beyond the 1.5 per cent rise in gross
national product in 1992.
Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister, dismissed the estimate as
'pessimistic', but admitted that economic recovery had been stalled by an
unusually cool summer and a stronger than expected yen. However, he saw no
reason to devalue the yen, in response to question at a news conference.
The OECD will publish its final estimate at the end of this year. Its latest
revision, made by a working group last month, reflects stagnant personal
consumption during the summer, a drop in export volumes and the continued
fall in Japanese asset values, Mr Shigehara was reported as saying.
He believed, like most of Japan's business community, that an income tax cut
was needed. But Mr Shigehara warned that consumers were so cautious that
they might respond by saving rather than spending more.
Last month's cut in official interest rates was effective in bring Japanese
interest rates closer to US ones in real terms, but was unlikely on its own
to promote a rise in bank lending to small and medium sized businesses, he
said. The business recovery would be slow.
Japan's record current account surplus could damage the global economy and
give other countries an excuse for protectionism, a report by the economic
council, an advisory group, warned yesterday.

<TEXT>
FINLAND'S centre-right government yesterday moved to rekindle its faltering
privatisation programme, saying it would shortly seek parliamentary approval
to lower the limits of state ownership in five large companies.
The Ministry of Trade and Industry said it intended to complete strategic
plans for individual privatisation candidates by the end of the year, and
hoped to begin the process of share sales in early 1994, at least in some
cases.
Despite making a commitment in principle to privatise when it took office
more than two years ago, the government of Mr Esko Aho, the prime minister,
has made little progress, held back partly by the deep recession. But a
dramatic rally in the Helsinki stock exchange this year has greatly improved
conditions.
Under the latest plan, legislation will be tabled this month to allow the
state to drop the level of its voting shares in Enso-Gutzeit, the forestry
company, below 30 per cent from 52 per cent now.
It will seek to lower the level in Valmet, the paper machinery group, to
between 30 and 50 per cent from the current level of 73 per cent; the levels
would fall to below two-thirds, but more than 50 per cent, in Neste, the
energy company now 97 per cent state-controlled; in Rautaruuki, the steel
company (87 per cent); and in Sisu-Auto, the truck maker (98 per cent).
The Norwegian government is to reduce its stake in the arms-maker Norsk
Forsvarsteknologi to 51 per cent through a public share issue in November,
it was announced yesterday. Some of the shares will be offered to Statoil,
the state-owned oil company, the engineering company Aker, and the
shipowner, Braathens.

FT  09 OCT 93 / UK may quit central bank race: European Monetary Institute
appears headed for Frankfurt
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN appears ready to drop its claim to base the European Monetary
Institute, the core of the future European central bank, in London.
The pending shift would clear the way for a deal at the European Community
summit on October 29 to locate the EMI in Germany which has recently stepped
up its campaign in favour of Frankfurt.
Officials in Brussels said the UK government's readiness to soften its
position reflects a tactical calculation that it is no longer worth fighting
a losing cause against German claims which are supported by the rest of the
Community.
The same officials said the UK government also appeared to have been
influenced by the faltering momentum behind the EC's goal of economic and
monetary union set out in the Maastricht treaty - a view summed up by Mr
John Major's recent comment that plans for Emu had 'all the quaintness of a
rain dance and about the same potency'.
The British prime minister's statement caused irritation in Brussels, where
the European Commission is trying hard to build up the EMI as an embryonic
European central bank ready to start business on January 1, 1994, under the
so-called stage two of Emu.
EC finance ministers, who are holding informal talks in Genval, near
Brussels, will today hear details of legislation regarding the operation of
the EMI from Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics commissioner.
The legislation bans governments from borrowing indirectly from central
banks; bars privileged access by governments to financial institutions;
encourages governments to rein in excessive budget deficits and debt, and
sets out the various contributions of central banks towards financing the
institute.
It must be given a favourable opinion by the European parliament by the end
of the year to go into effect by January 1, 1994.
Mr Christophersen is said to be determined that the EMI will not be 'a
shell'. He believes that it could serve to draw member states and central
banks into a more formal system of monetary and macroeconomic co-operation.
Last night, Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, gave a
presentation to finance ministers on the economic outlook in the Community
as well as his thoughts on jobs, growth and competitiveness. These are to be
combined in a White Paper to be submitted to the EC summit in Brussels in
December.
At the Genval meeting, ministers will also have a broad discussion on the
lessons of the August 2 currency crisis which led to the virtual collapse of
the exchange rate mechanism. However, diplomats cautioned that it was 'too
early' to expect any conclusions or decisions.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Van Miert calls for Gatt rules on business barriers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE international trade rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
should be extended to cover restrictive business practices, Mr Karel Van
Miert, the EC competition commissioner, said yesterday.
He said a combination of internationally agreed minimum competition rules
and firm enforcement, perhaps through the Gatt dispute procedure, could help
end restrictive business practices.
As tariff and non-tariff barriers were cleared away these 'private barriers
to trade' were increasingly the most important obstacle to corporate
expansion, he told the Euro-American Chamber of Commerce in Washington.
Mr Van Miert used the example of the Japanese and Korean markets, which he
said were closed 'not so much by tariffs but by exclusionary behaviour,
biased distribution systems or other private practices'. It is the second
time in two years that a senior European commissioner has urged the Gatt to
take on a new role in regulating competition. Sir Leon Brittan, then
competition commissioner and now responsible for trade, told the 1992 World
Economic Forum in Davos that the Gatt should draw up worldwide competition
rules covering subsidies, cartels, merger policy and public monopolies.
Mr Van Miert and Sir Leon's proposals may find a sympathetic ear in Geneva,
where their immediate predecessor as EC competition commissioner, Mr Peter
Sutherland, is now Gatt director-general.
Mr Van Miert said that in the initial stage of such a plan, the Gatt would
not handle individual companies' complaints about anti-competitive
practices, but would ensure that countries were enforcing minimum
competition rules.
However, he acknowledged that 'one should not even dream about a worldwide
and independent competition agency at this stage'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH leaders have agreed a compromise on revisions to the constitution on
asylum to enable France to join EC partners in implementing the Schengen
free travel accord.
Both socialist President Francois Mitterrand and Mr Edouard Balladur, the
conservative prime minister, wanted a compromise to avoid having to put
constitutional changes to a referendum on an issue they feared would have
given racists a platform.
The asylum argument arose in August when the constitutional court ruled
against France's participation in an EC convention stating that an asylum
application refused in one EC country is deemed to be refused in the other
11 EC states.
The convention is designed to prevent refugees exploiting the removal of
border checks by 'shopping for asylum' around the Twelve. But France's
constitution, the court held, obliges it to consider all asylum demands.
The compromise revision, to be approved by parliament, would write into the
constitution provisions for France to reach asylum accords with its EC
partners, while giving the government the right, but no longer the
obligation, to examine asylum requests refused by other EC states.

RUSSIA may put a new constitution to a referendum at the same time as new
parliamentary elections scheduled for December 12, Mr Sergei Filatov, head
of the presidential administration, said yesterday.
A final draft of the constitution to replace the communist-era document
defended by the old parliament would be drawn up by November 5 by a
constitutional convention which was set up in the summer. The convention was
formed from parties, interest groups and regional authorities chosen by
President Boris Yeltsin after the old parliament refused to adopt a new
constitution.
Although Mr Filatov expressed a preference for a December 12 referendum, he
said the other option would be for the constitution to be adopted by the
state duma, or lower chamber, to be elected in December. He also held out
the possibility that the federation council, designed as the upper chamber
of a new federal assembly, could be directly elected at the same time.
Thanking foreign governments and international organisations for their
support during the crisis, President Yeltsin yesterday invited them to send
observers to the parliamentary polls, which he has claimed will be free and
fair.
However, the holding of fair elections will depend in large part on whether
the authorities will allow opposition communist and nationalist parties not
involved in Sunday's violence to take part. It will also depend on whether
they keep their promises of 'equal media access' to all participants in the
elections. A council is to ensure equal access to television but it is not
clear how effective this will be.
Mr Filatov said the Russian Communist party, headed by a moderate called Mr
Gennady Ziuganov, may also be outlawed even though it was not included on
the list of eight parties banned last Monday.
Mr Vladimir Solodin, head of the information ministry department which
imposed the censorship ordered and then cancelled by Mr Yeltsin, yesterday
spelt out the authorities' dilemma over banned newspapers.
Although he accepted that Pravda might soon be unbanned, he explained that
the real problem for the authorities would be controlling more extremist
papers such as Den (Day) which openly promoted violence and anti-Semitism.
Part of the problem for the government was that the press law enabled banned
papers to re-register under new names. Mr Solodin apologised to two
newspapers banned by accident because his department had little time to set
up the emergency restrictions.
President Yeltsin won a qualified endorsement yesterday from the leaders of
32 European democracies, meeting at the Council of Europe summit in Vienna,
writes Edward Mortimer in Vienna.
The leaders deplored the loss of life in Moscow 'which resulted from the
resort to violence provoked by the opponents of reform', and declared their
'solidarity with the supporters of the reform' under Mr Yeltsin's
leadership.
Talks on redeschuling Dollars 26bn of Russian debt to western commercial
banks will be continued in the weeks ahead, the Deutsche Bank chairman of
the steering committee representing 600 creditor banks in the 'London Club'
said last night, writes David Waller in Frankfurt. 'Substantial progress'
had been made in talks in Frankfurt on Thursday and yesterday between the
creditors and representatives of the Russian government. President Eduard
Shevardnadze of Georgia brought his war-torn country into the Commonwealth
of Independent States yesterday, risking the anger of many citizens who
accused him of forcing it back into Moscow's grip, Reuter reports from
Tbilisi. Mr Shevardnadze announced the unexpected move after meeting Mr
Yeltsin in Moscow.

THE European Community's smaller member states seem to be winning the battle
to stop the big powers trying to change the EC's decision-making procedures
to favour the large member states.
France in particular, but also Germany and the UK, have been looking at how
to tilt the balance in their favour when the EC takes in up to four new
member states - Austria, Sweden, Norway and Finland - around 1995.
But ambassadors of the Twelve on Thursday night passed on to foreign
ministers without amendment a paper from the Belgian presidency preserving
intact for 16 member states the voting procedures which now apply for 12.
Foreign ministers will have to decide, beginning probably at a special
meeting on October 26, whether to preserve the status quo, or risk intra-EC
confrontation and the alienation of the four applicant countries if the
decision-making balance is altered.
'This is something we are prepared to die in the last ditch for,' said a
senior Irish official, who warned that any strengthening of the larger
member states' position at this stage could tear the Community apart. The
Irish, along with the Dutch and the Danes, refuse to countenance any change
now in the basic chemistry of the EC, which has a weighted majority voting
system giving small states a real voice and influence.
At enlargement negotiations in Luxembourg this week, ministers from the
applicant countries rejected any reform of EC decision-making before they
are inside and able to shape it. If reforms went ahead beforehand, 'we would
end up joining another kind of Community, not the Community we originally
applied to', warned Mr Pertti Salolainen, Finnish foreign trade minister.
The larger member states fear the EC would be paralysed if it takes in a
large influx of small countries under existing rules. But the Lisbon summit
last year decided that the first wave of enlargement needed technical
adjustment rather than reform, which would be put off until aspirant members
from east and central Europe and the Mediterranean start accession
negotiations.

<TEXT>
It would be 'untenable' for the US-EC deal on farm subsidies, known as the
Blair House accord, to be modified in any way without jeopardising the
entire Uruguay Round, Mr Peter Cook, the Australian trade minister, said
yesterday, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. He was speaking before leaving for
trade discussions in Brussels and a Cairns Group meeting in Geneva.
David Owen adds: Mr John Major, the British prime minister, also warned
yesterday of the consequences for the world economy if the Uruguay Round
collapsed,
Speaking at his Conservative party's conference in Blackpool, Mr Major
warned: 'You are playing with fire.' If the talks collapsed in two months'
time, it could unleash 'protectionism, poverty and unemployment on a scale
we haven't seen since the 1930s'.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Steel threat to global trade talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Uruguay Round of global trade talks has received a setback following the
failure of leading steel producing nations this week to make progress on a
multilateral steel agreement.
The 36-nation talks, which began on Tuesday, broke up yesterday with no date
set for the next meeting. The conclusion of a steel agreement by December
15, the deadline for the Uruguay Round, has been made a condition for
eliminating all duties on imported steel between the main traders as part of
a broader tariff-cutting agreement.
In Washington, however, a US trade spokesman said no breakthrough had been
expected at this week's multilateral steel talks. A source close to the
talks said no substantive developments were likely until November.
A multilateral steel agreement would eliminate direct barriers to trade in
steel over 10 years and dismantle most subsidies to the troubled industry,
barring those for environmental improvements, research and development,
plant closure and retraining. However, to the anger of the European
Community and other steel exporters, the US wants to retain the right to
challenge these under its domestic anti-subsidy laws.
Trade officials said the US had shown no softening of its position. This
dashed hopes before the meeting that the decision by the US International
Trade Commission last July to dismiss most of the 72 anti-dumping and
countervailing-duty suits brought by US steel companies would create a
better atmosphere.
Failure to abolish steel duties could upset bargaining in other areas, such
as improving market access across the range of goods and services. Market
access problems are expected to head the agenda when Mr Mickey Kantor, US
trade representative, meets Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, in
Brussels next Wednesday.
EC negotiators claim that the US and Japan have failed to meet their
promises to cut peak tariffs by 50 per cent and others by a third on
average. So far Washington has offered 50 per cent cuts on only half its
peak textile tariffs, and appears to be pinning its hopes on negotiations
taking place between the US and EC textile industries on a tariff-cutting
package.
The US is still pressing the EC to agree to zero tariffs for wood, paper,
non-ferrous metals and scientific equipment, and to reduce duties on a range
of electronic products.
Mr David Woods, the spokesman for Gatt, yesterday rejected claims by the
Geneva-based European Broadcasting Union that inclusion of audio-visual
services in the Uruguay Round would lead to the break-up of the European
broadcasting system.

FT  09 OCT 93 / OECD praises Hungary but urges more reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS DENTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has paid a
back-handed tribute to the maturity of Hungary's reforms by issuing a
comprehensive critique of its economic policy in a survey released
yesterday.
'Many of the issues could not have arisen had not Hungary already made
substantial progress in establishing a market economy,' the organisation
says of its 'partner in transition'.
The OECD sugars its uncomfortable recommendations by saying that their very
detail is 'indicative of progress'. However, the organisation's reproaches
are bound to embarrass the Hungarian authorities.
Singled out for particular concern is the financial system which, despite
rapid development, showed 'weaknesses in its basic structure'.
A 'credit crunch' arose last year in Hungary, the OECD states. Banks,
although highly liquid, curtailed their lending to enterprises sharply
because of new bankruptcy legislation which increased credit risk.
Accompanying the crunch was a steep rise in spreads between deposit and
lending rates from 4 per cent to 11 per cent by the end of 1992.
The survey puts much of the blame on fiscal pressures and high taxation in
the financial services sector; reserve requirements alone are estimated to
have added two percentage points to spreads.
Budgetary economy has also conflicted with attempts to recapitalise the
banks, the OECD says, noting that the government's effort in 1992 was too
limited, and 'partial reconstitutions are simply not workable'. The OECD
accepts that the budget deficit is a product of reforms and the unexpectedly
deep recession which saw GDP fall 11.9 per cent in 1991 and 5 per cent in
1992.
But the survey nevertheless identifies 'serious structural budget problems'
and states that the government deficit, which was 8 per cent of GDP on a
consolidated basis in 1992, is 'the major macroeconomic imbalance'.
Privatisation is a key to recovery and, while the OECD praises Hungary's
quest for 'real owners' through market sales, the organisation argues for an
acceleration of the process.
But the authors come out unequivocally against the proposed privatisation
investment proposals to involve the public in purchases. The scheme, which
went on the cabinet's agenda this week, appears to be 'seriously flawed',
the OECD says.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Greek Elections: Papandreou prepares for power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GREECE'S opposition Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) was four points
ahead in the opinion polls yesterday, on the last day of campaigning before
Sunday's general election.
Mr Andreas Papandreou, the Pasok leader, appeared confident of victory,
promising at a rally in Athens to make Greece 'a modern, democratic state
that will stamp a seal of peace and co-operation on the Balkan region'.
Support for Pasok appeared to have stabilised at around 45 per cent, against
about 41 per cent for the conservatives, according to polling organisations
in Athens. This result would give the Socialists a clear majority in the
300-member parliament.
Political Spring, the conservative splinter group founded three months ago
by Mr Andreas Samaras, the former foreign minister, was projected to win at
least 5 per cent of the vote and a dozen seats.
Mr Papandreou also stressed yesterday that Greece would 'make no
concessions' in foreign policy under a Socialist government, ruling out a
compromise in the dispute with Macedonia over its name, or in the
long-running quarrel with Turkey, a Nato ally, over mineral rights in the
Aegean seabed. He promised real pay increases for public sector workers and
improved welfare benefits, after a three-year freeze on wage and pensions
under the conservatives.
Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the prime minister, was due to conclude his
campaign with a rally of his New Democracy party in Athens last night. The
conservatives have lost most support in the capital, where Mr Samaras's
party has attracted younger voters, according to the polls.
The election campaign has been the biggest, dirtiest and most expensive
media advertising war in the country's history, Reuter reports from Athens.
An estimated Dollars 13m was spent in September alone, according to the
Media Service company. Negative campaigning and personal attacks were seen
as a logical result of the widespread perception that the weakest points of
Pasok and New Democracy were their leaders, both aged 74.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Major urges party to unite behind traditional values: Appeal
on law and order, family and responsibility gives prime minister breathing
space
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR won a breathing space for his premiership last night after a
successful plea to the Conservative party at its Blackpool conference to
unite behind its traditional values.
In a speech tailored to the preoccupation of the party faithful with law and
order, the family and individual responsibility, the prime minister
dismissed speculation about his hold on the leadership.
Referring to the furore this week over Lady Thatcher's forthcoming memoirs,
he joked: 'I'm not about to write my memoirs.' He added: 'There is a job to
be done, a job I was elected to do, and I propose to go on doing it.'
In a thinly veiled rebuke to his critics on the back benches, he continued:
'We cannot have a lobby against every difficult decision. Decisions are what
governments are for and we have to take them.'
Mr Major then made a deliberate pitch to cement an alliance with the Ulster
Unionists that could effectively double his thin majority at Westminster. He
flatly rejected any prospect of negotiations with the IRA or Sinn Fein as
long as they were responsible for, or supported, violence. Emphasising his
commitment to the Unionist majority, he added: 'We are not going to bargain
away the people's democratic rights.'
His closing speech to the conference was rewarded with a 12-minute standing
ovation, an enthusiastic response that marked the end of a week in which the
government has managed to contain the disenchantment of Tory party
activists.
It was also judged by cabinet colleagues to have closed off completely the
remote possibility that Mr Major might face a direct challenge to his
leadership next month.
But cabinet ministers acknowledged that the return of MPs to Westminster for
the reopening of parliament later this month might could mark a renewed
outbreak of internal strife in the party over taxation, spending and the
privatisation of British Rail.
The rightwing tone of the speech - emphasising the Conservatives' commitment
to traditional values and calling for 'a return to basics' in education -
marked a drive to win back disgruntled Tory supporters.
Judging that the voters have become increasingly angry with what he called
'fashionable opinion', Mr Major told the conference: 'It is time to return
to the old core values.'
He reserved his toughest phrases for law and order. The attack on crime
would be the centrepiece of the government's legislative programme, and the
measures announced this week by the home secretary represented only the
first instalment.
He added that the government would introduce new legislation to clamp down
on pornography and impose tougher sanctions against child pornography.
The deliberate attempt to direct the Conservatives' message to the elderly
was reinforced by specific pledges for pensioners. There would be no charges
for National Health Service prescriptions for the elderly, no charges for
hospital stays and no move to stop pensioners receiving their state benefits
at rural post offices.
Mr Major also bowed to the growing mood of Euroscepticism by emphasising
that the Conservatives would fight next year's European elections on a
platform of opposition to a centralised Europe.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Brussels may prosecute UK over television curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is one step away from prosecuting Britain in the
European Court of Justice for imposing too many controls on foreign
satellite and cable television broadcasts into the UK.
The Commission has written to the UK government giving it two months to
comply with the EC's 'television without frontiers' directive or face court
action.
Brussels is considering sending similar letters to France, Italy, Belgium
and Spain accusing them of various potential breaches of EC law. Italy, for
example, is said to have ignored the obligation to separate advertising from
normal programmes, while Spain has not implemented the legislation at all.
The Commission is understood to be worried that the principle of a single
'passport' for satellite and cable TV broadcasters is being undermined by
some EC countries' attempts to impose additional regulations on foreign
broadcasters.
National officials have replied that the original directive was confusing
and ambiguous. They point out that all 12 member states were accused of
breaching the directive when the Commission first threatened court action a
year ago.
The main complaint against Britain is that foreign satellite and cable
broadcasters have to get a licence from the Independent Television
Commission in the UK, even if they have already been authorised by another
member state. But at the same time, companies transmitting to member states
outside the UK do not have to comply with British law and, according to the
Commission, could escape EC regulation.
The directive, in force for two years, sets minimum standards on advertising
and to protect children from broadcast pornography and violence. EC states
can impose stricter standards on their broadcasters but cannot hamper
cross-border TV services from other countries if they meet the minimum
rules.
Britain has also come under scrutiny from Brussels for granting a licence to
the recently launched TNT &amp; Cartoon Network, a US-owned film and cartoon
satellite channel.
France, resisting the spread of US-made films and TV programmes across
Europe, has outlawed TNT &amp; Cartoon Network. Belgium has followed suit. They
believe it does not meet the EC requirement that broadcasters devote a
majority of transmission time to 'European works'.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Palestine scores a winning state debut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOROVITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERICHO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEVER mind secret talks in Norwegian farmhouses, White House handshakes or
the Cairo summit.
The real process of Palestinian self-determination began yesterday at a
Jericho football stadium, a grassless dust-bowl set in the rolling
reddish-brown hills outside the city.
The Palestine national football team took to their home field for the first
time in almost 50 years to play a French national side.
True to the dawning spirit of West Bank enterprise, a light aircraft buzzed
overhead trailing a banner advertising the services of a building contractor
in the neighbouring town of Nablus.
The French fielded a team packed with veterans from their 1980s glory years,
with Michel Platini, once one of Europe's finest players, still the cultured
maestro in midfield. The Palestinians, typically, had their side chosen by
committee - the players picked from their West Bank and Gaza leagues.
'This is more than a soccer match,' said Mr Saev Erakat, the Palestinian
peace negotiator who acted as master of ceremonies from a wobbly wooden
stand at one end of the pitch. 'This marks the beginning of the state.'
'For the first time in most of our lives,' added Mr Nabil Abu-Znaid, a
Hebron university official sitting nearby, 'we can today carry our national
flag, sing our national anthem, cheer our national team. This is the kind of
event that turns people's minds from the depression of the occupation to the
optimism of state-building.'
Inevitably this 'meeting of sport and peace', as it was billed, under the
distant 'patronage of president Yassir Arafat', was a chaotic affair. But it
was good-natured chaos.
The ground is supposed to hold 4,000 spectators, but there were many times
that number present, pushing right up to the touchlines. An attempt by the
Palestinian players to loosen up before kick-off prompted a pitch invasion.
Locals dragged players away for hugs, kisses and photographs. The team beat
a hasty retreat to the dressing rooms.
Half-an-hour after the scheduled kick-off time Mr Erakat and his cohorts at
the microphone were still appealing for the crowd to clear the pitch, but
the drum and bagpipe bands marched on and small posses of Palestinian youths
circled the ground under huge PLO flags.
Finally, to tumultuous applause, the French team appeared, their blue shirts
printed with a special 'Jericho 93' insignia.
Mr Erakat insisting that the chaos did not augur badly for the
organisational challenges Palestine will soon face.
The final score, despite Mr Platini's artistry, was a 1-0 win for the
Palestinians - the French probably the victims of their good manners and the
heat. Asked before the game whether he thought his team would emerge
victorious, Mr Erakat had replied, with a sweeping gesture over the milling
crowds: 'We have already won.'

FT  09 OCT 93 / Postel bid to rescue Greycoat rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pounds 120m plan to rescue Greycoat, one of Britain's most audacious and
acclaimed property developers of the 1980s, was yesterday roundly rejected
by bond and shareholders.
The failure of the bid from Postel, the UK's largest pension fund, leaves
Greycoat on the brink of liquidation and in default on its debts.
The decision is also a setback for Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, Postel's chief
executive, who had taken a particularly high profile in an attempt to
enlarge the pension fund's position in the recovering UK property market.
Greycoat will now have to seek a further waiver to allow it to further defer
interest payments already deferred while investors considered the Postel
proposals.
In heated meetings, two classes of investors rejected the rescue bid:
preference shareholders and holders of zero coupon bonds, which offer
capital gains instead of interest payments.
The dissenting investors claimed that Postel had undervalued Greycoat's
properties, which include the prestigious Embankment Place, above London's
Charing Cross Station, and Britannic House, where BP is the tenant.
They also claimed Greycoat had consistently refused to give investors the
information they needed to evaluate the Postel deal and that it had failed
to take into account the rise in the property market since the bid was first
formulated.
Greycoat's board had warned that rejection of Postel's offer would most
likely lead to liquidation as the company would be unable to meet payments
on some of its bonds. But as the board retreated to lick its wounds,
property market analysts said other bidders could come forward. The
attraction for a bidder is a portfolio of properties considered among
London's most attractive.
But like Rosehaugh and Stanhope, two other property companies that have
recently failed, Greycoat fell foul of the longest recession in the property
market for decades.
Greycoat had also arranged financing of exceptional complexity involving
four classes of share and bondholders. As yesterday's votes showed, these
holders often had competing interests.
Preference shareholders argued that Postel's complex four-part offer was
placing them at a disadvantage to ordinary shareholders - who accepted the
deal and would normally expect to rank behind them in a restructuring.
Mr Geoffrey Wilson, Greycoat's chairman, had repeatedly warned the meetings
that Postel's deal was 'all-or-nothing' and that shareholders could not
modify individual portions. 'It is a rescue package to prevent the company
from having to cease trading and all that entails,' he said.

RA-Hachette, the French defence electronics and media group, yesterday

conclusion of a Taiwan legal case over damages for the delay in construction
of the Taipei metro, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris.
Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, chairman, had previously predicted 'significantly
higher' net profits for Matra-Hachette in 1993 over 1992, when it made
FFr354m (Dollars 61m).
Yesterday the group said the Taipei department of transport was obliged to

FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Trebruk buys Polish paper group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TREBRUK, a Swedish paper producer, yesterday took over Poland's heavily
indebted Kostrzyn pulp and paper manufacturer for 800,000 zlotys (Dollars
40).
The Swedish group will take over a 180bn zloty debt which is to be repaid in
annual tranches over the the next three years. It has promised to invest
Dollars 55m in the plant.
Last summer, a number of local creditors agreed to waive Kostrzyn 275bn
zlotys worth of debts to make the sale possible.
Trebruk's investment funding for Kostrzyn is to come from a Dollars 32m loan
from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) of which at
least Dollars 7m will be syndicated to Polish and foreign commercial banks.
The EBRD financing is conditional on the raising of a further Dollars 20m by
Trebruk from the Nordic Environment Finance Corporation and other investors.
Trebruk is planning to quadruple output at the Kostrzyn plant on the Oder
river, 70km from Berlin, to increase exports to the EC, Mr Olle Grundberg,
the company's chairman said yesterday.
In 1989, Kostrzyn produced 68,000 tonnes of paper compared to 169,000 tonnes
of paper produced in that year at Kwidzyn, the most modern Polish mill which
was sold last year for Dollars 175m to the International Paper Company of
the US.
The deal leaves several more paper companies to be sold including the Kielce
paper works.
The Polish government was advised on the privatisation of the sector by
Hambro's Bank until the end of June this year when Hambro's contract was not
renewed.
Schroders, which earlier this year advised the Polish government on the
privatisation of the Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, has established a
wholly-owned subsidiary in Poland.

FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Central bank acts on Ferruzzi
deadlock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of Italy is attempting to help break the deadlock between the
administrators of the collapsed Ferruzzi-Montedison group and the creditor
banks over proposals to call a temporary moratorium on debt service
payments.
Debts service payments are reportedly in the region of L130bn (Dollars
81.81m) a month. Mr Guido Rossi, the chief administrator of
Ferruzzi-Montedison, is seeking a moratorium of at least until the end of
the year in order to launch a rescue plan for Italy's second largest private
group.
This is being opposed strongly by the 100-odd foreign banks. Without an
agreement there is a risk of one or several of the banks pressing for
bankruptcy proceedings. At the end of last May the Ferruzzi group had
outstanding debts of L28,000bn. Of this sum foreign banks account for
L6,500bn.
Representatives of the 300 foreign and Italian banks are due to meet at the
Bank of Italy in Rome today. This is likely to be one of the last
opportunities to hammer out a common approach to rescuing
Ferruzzi-Montedison in advance of October 14.
Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the principal holding company, is then due to
approve its half-year results. These results were not approved at a board
meeting on September 30 because the extent of losses was liable to alter
substantially, depending on the nature of the agreement with the creditor
banks.
The Bank of Italy yesterday was careful to point out it had not formally
called the meeting but was merely acting as a neutral host.
However, a senior Italian banker said the central bank would be deploying
its powers of 'moral persuasion'. Previously the Bank of Italy had hosted a
meeting between the creditors and Ferruzzi-Montedison at its Milan offices.
The choice of Rome underlines the venue's importance.

FT  08 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: WH Smith steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The strength in WH Smith shares continued, yesterday's unchanged 461p giving
them a 5.2 per cent rise this week. The stock has been lifted by press
reports that Smith and Boots will soon announce a rationalisation of their
loss-making Do It All home improvement business. It is estimated that around
60 sites may face the axe. But there is growing speculation that the
companies may have found buyers for a good proportion of those sites facing
closure and that the exit costs will be less than some analysts had feared.
Boots shares edged forward a penny to 483p.
Good results from Etam were spoiled by a cautious sales statement and the
shares fell 11 to 258p. Lloyds Chemist included a dividend boost with its
results and the shares appreciated 15 to 284p.
Among food stocks, Dalgety was wanted on dividend considerations, the shares
climbing 12 to 496p. BZW was said to be recommending Northern Foods, up 6 to
259p.
Commercial Union firmed 2 to 637p, after it said its enhanced scrip dividend
alternative is to be priced at 630.7p. BZW was reported to have downgraded
several stocks in the sector. These included Willis Corroon which lost 8 to
206p, and Sedgwick, where the shares gave up 7 to 168p.
Among banks, Royal Bank of Scotland succumbed to profit-taking and the
shares ended 6 down at 342p.
A 'buy' recommendation from NatWest Securities boosted MB-Caradon and the
shares moved 7 ahead to 334p.
Worries about its Pounds 250m proposed joint venture with Taiwan continued
to overhang British Aerospace and the shares closed 6 lower at 393p, with
dealers suggesting that 390p had proved a support level.
BAe shares were said to have been in heavy demand in after-hours trading
following an announcement after the market closed that it was to sell
Ballast, its Dutch based construction and international contracting
business, for Pounds 175m.
Dealers said IMI had suffered from a profits downgrade from Smith New Court
and the shares shed 3 to 292p.
US buyers were reported for British Steel and the shares hardened 3 to 128p,
in trade of 6.6m. Profit-taking after the recent strong performance from TI
Group saw the shares relinquish 11 to 360p.
Engineering group FKI continued to find support ahead of an analysts visit
to the US begining this weekend. The shares put on another 3 1/2 to 171 1/2
p.
The departure of Rothmans from the FT-SE 100 sent its stock tumbling 21 to
623p.
Growing interest in next week's presentation in Paris by paper and packaging
group Arjo Wiggins saw a climb of 5 in its stock to 229p in strong volume of
3m.
A rise of 7 was mustered by ICI to take its price to 735p although that was
achieved in very weak volume. One analyst said that such thin turnover was a
sign that the much-talked about interest from US buyers was perhaps not as
strong as may have been thought.
Activity in BOC was substantial and the shares climbed 5 to 631p with 1.7m
shares traded.
BTP continued its steady rise of recent days with a gain of 4 to 285p. The
stock has benefited from a recent buy note from Hoare Govett.
Lucas Industries firmed 2 to 157p, ahead of figures next week and continued
talk of a new chief executive.
The retaining of its FT-SE 100 status by SmithKline Beecham helped the stock
rise 3 to 370p, as did a buy note from Strauss Turnbull. Glaxo, after a
moderate run lately on the back of generally positive sentiment about the
company, fell victim to some profit-taking and retreated 4 to 654p.
Wellcome bounced on a recommendation by Kleinwort Benson to buy and ended
the day 10 up at 708p.
Following good results on Wednesday, Manchester United rallied 38 to 580p.
Ladbroke weakened 4 to 176p. The company announced after the market closed
that it had reached agreement with the Mail on Sunday over the newspaper not
repeating certain allegations.

After worse-than-expected results Campari, the sporting clothes company,
took a battering from the market and its share price fell 49 to 93p. One
analyst said that although the results were far worse than feared the
market's reaction had been 'pretty phenomenal'. The poor results have been
attributed to a combination of poor sales and fundamental problems with
supplies from the Far East.
A similar case in textiles came with Martin International whose results

FT  08 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness slides
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong speculation of imminent changes at Guinness produced hefty turnover
in the shares, which fell sharply to close 10 down at 407p. A variety of
rumours underpinned the retreat, the strongest of which suggested that LVMH,
the French luxury goods group with a 24.9 per cent cross-holding in
Guinness, was ready to announce a restructuring. According to gossip in both
Paris and London, this could involve Guinness taking control of LVMH's wines
and spirits business in return for its stake in the French group.
LVMH shares tumbled in Paris on the speculation, fuelled also by reports of
fund managers returning negative from a trip last week to LVMH's far eastern
operations. Guinness, which also has substantial business interests in the
region, weakened in sympathy too. Further damage was done by speculation
that a meeting with UK analysts by Burn Stewart yesterday left the
impression that Guinness was increasing its lower-margin bulk whisky
presence.
Guinness later denied all the stories. A spokesman said that there were no
plans to change the relationship with LVMH and that the company was reducing
its bulk whisky business, not the other way round.
Burn Stewart shares slipped 3 to 108p on dull results.

FT  08 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Tiphook tumbles further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FREIGHT and container rental group Tiphook's already poor stock market image
suffered another blow yesterday when it surprised the market with the third
profits warning within a year.
The company warned that it expects to make a loss when it reports interim
figures in December, and added that its poor trading had put it in breach of
certain of its banking covenants, although it was in talks with the banks
about putting in place 'appropriate facilities.'
The announcement shortly after lunch sent the shares plunging, making it the
day's biggest fall in the market and at the day's worst they were down a
hefty 94 at 145p.
However, bargain hunters believed to have been from the US moved in, helping
bring about a rally and the shares closed 70 down at 169p, in trade of 2.6m.
Around 60 per cent of the stock is held by overseas investors, the majority
of these in the US.
Mr Mike Stodddart, at Charter House Tilney Securities, a bear of the stock
for the last two years had expected the company to make a loss at the
interim stage and said: 'The statement leaves as many questions as it
answers especially with regard to the dividend.'
Another researcher simply said: 'UK funds are going to continue avoiding
this stock.'

FT  08 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FIRM opening on the FT-SE 100 future quickly dwindled into a weak trading
session as the market lost its enthusiasm of recent days, Christine Buckley
writes.
The mood shifted from one of optimism for early interest rate cuts to one
prepared for little immediate encouragement from chancellor Kenneth Clarke's
speech to the Conservative party conference.
In the main, institutions decided to sit out yesterday's trading session and
volume in the December contract on the FT-SE was a poor 5,347 contracts -
just over half the average amount. Much of the decline in the contract -
which went from a day's high of 3,041 to the session's low of 3,012 - was
done in transactions by independent traders.
With no large sellers evident, one trader saw the slide as a temporary blip
and felt the derivatives market was pausing to gather steam after its recent
buoyancy.
The contract started the day at 3,032 and soon after opening firmed up to
its peak before moving, along with the cash market, into reverse gear. It
closed at 3,122 - a premium of 31 points to the cash market and 10 points
ahead of the fair value premium to cash.
Busy trading was seen in traded options, particularly in the Euro FT-SE 100
which saw 10,795 lots traded. There was significant activity in call spreads
on the Euro FT-SE. Amstrad topped the stock options at 3,571.

FT  08 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie slips from its all-time high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON stock market responded cautiously to yesterday's speech by Mr
Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, to the annual conference of
Britains's governing Conservative party. After moving uncertainly during the
trading session, the FT-SE failed to hold an early gain to close 8.4 down at
3,092.4, abandoning both the 3,100 mark and the all-time high on the Footsie
Index reached in the previous session.
A calmer day in the stock index futures sector, together with a mixed bag of
corporate trading statements took the heart out of the equity market. Early
trading saw the Footsie bounce to 3,110.6 but the stock market then turned
off as the bourses elsewhere in Europe showed unwillingness to extend the
gains of the previous session.
At the day's low the Footsie was down by about 12 points to the 3,088 area.
But selling pressure was moderate and traders expressed little surprise at
what was seen as a bout of profit-taking after a strong rise in UK equity
prices
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which covers a wider range of equities than the
Footise, also lacked support, closing 1.1 down at 3,470.5, still more than
40 points short of the all-time high reached at the end of August.
But trading volume was lower in the market yesterday, with the Seaq volume
total down to 572.1m shares from 697.4m on Wednesday. However, retail, or
customer business, often regarded as the soundest guide to genuine
investment activity, was worth Pounds 1.58bn on Wednesday. This total fully
sustains the improvement in stock market activity which underpins the
recovery in market indices over the past three months.
Interest-related stocks, such as retail and consumer issues, lagged the
market yesterday despite the hopes that the chancellor of the exchequer
might soon sanction a cut in domestic interest rates.
The stock market was also held back by renewed lack of support for the oil
stocks as investors surveyed the prospect for crude oil prices following the
easing of tensions in Russia. Losses in the blue chip oil stocks were
mirrored by larger setbacks among some of the second line issues.
With currency markets also quieter yesterday, the international blue chips
traced a less certain path. Pharmaceutical shares moved either side of
overnight quotations without attracting much activity. Profit-taking hung
over the blue chip sectors as stock index futures played a less active role
in the equity market.
Political considerations continued to overhang the London stock market
yesterday as the Conservative party conference unfolded in Blackpool, in the
north of England. However, expectations of a cut in domestic interest rates
have been largely postponed until the government budget, due in November. In
the meantime, the political future for the Conservative government and for
the prime minister, Mr John Major, remains a matter of uncertainty.
Nikko Europe believes that the UK chancellor of the exchequer 'despite his
protestations' may soon be able to justify an interest rate cut on other
than political grounds, pointing out that the bullish outlook is premised on
the the prospect of falling inflation nd short term interest rates across
Europe.

FT  08 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks decline ahead of
jobs data
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
AFTER TRADING in a narrow range either side of opening values for most the
day, US share prices ended lower after a late burst of selling, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average was down 15.36 at 3,583.63. The more broadly based Standard&amp; Poor's
500 ended down 1.56 at 459.18, while the Amex composite finished up 0.59 at
463.95, and the Nasdaq composite down 2.23 at 762.54. Trading volume on the
NYSE was 255m shares.
Trading was subdued from the start as participants once again chose to keep
their heads down while awaiting the September employment report, due out
this morning. The monthly jobs report is traditionally the most
eagerly-anticipated set of economic figures, and the markets are hoping that
today's numbers will give them a fresh look at how the labour market is
faring in a still struggling economy. The consensus of analysts' forecasts
has non-farm payrolls rising by about 150,000 last month.
Wall Street, however, has a poor track record of forecasting the jobs
figures, and there have been numerous occasions this year when the monthly
employment numbers have surprised the market, usually by producing a more
bearish report than expected. This explains the markets' cautious approach
to today's data, and the lack of much movement in share prices yesterday
until selling in the final hour of trading sent prices to new session lows.
There was some news on the jobs front yesterday - the Labor department
announced that the number of people claiming state unemployment insurance
fell by 9,000 in the final few days of September - but the numbers failed to
move the markets.
Among individual stocks, retailers were in the limelight after some of the
biggest companies reported their latest monthly sales figures. The news was
neither disappointing nor particularly encouraging, and investors seemed
unimpressed. Sears, Roebuck fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 58 1/8 , while JC
Penney gave up Dollars 1 at Dollars 46 1/2 , the Limited eased Dollars  1/8
to Dollars 23 1/4 and Kmart eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 24 3/8 .
Corning plunged Dollars 6 1/4 to Dollars 27 3/8 in volume of 4m shares after
the company warned that of a third quarter charge against earnings of
Dollars 130m.
Motor stocks were in demand amid heavy trading, with General Motors up
Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 43 7/8 , Ford Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 55 7/8 and
Chrysler Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 49 1/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, Liberty Media rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 28 1/2 on
the news that Tele-Communications is considering a Dollars 3.3bn stock deal
to regain full control of the company.
Canada
TORONTO prices showed little movement in moderately active trading as the
the TSE-300 composite index gained 5.31 points, or 0.13 per cent, to
4,060.79, according to preliminary figures.
Advances led declines by 374 to 345. Volume at 62.49m shares was above
Wednesday's 55.52m and amounted to CDollars 582.5m compared with CDollars
563.5m.

FT  08 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris sees 3 per cent decline
in LVMH
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER two days of significant gains, the Eurotrack 100 eased a little
yesterday, following the trend set on Wednesday afternoon, writes Our
Markets Staff.
PARIS recorded a 3 per cent fall in LVMH on renewed selling after the
group's recent disappointing first half results and further sell notes were
issued by brokers. The shares lost FFr119 to FFr3,700 in heavy volume.
The CAC-40 index slipped 17.05 to 2,147.41 as turnover remained firm at
FFr3.5bn.
Peugeot was off FFr11 at FFr640 ahead of reporting a first half loss of
FFr1.12bn, which came in at the lower end of market forecasts.
SocGen was one of the day's best performers, with a gain of FFr14 to FFr676
following an impressive set of first half figures on Wednesday.
FRANKFURT traded above 2,000 for the first time at midsession but the DAX
index lost steam after that. It closed the session 9.99 higher at 1,997.04
after an intraday high of 2,000.38, and eased to 1,991.38 in the
post-bourse. Turnover fell from DM10.6bn to DM9.6bn.
At the close the DAX was still nearly 85 points up on the week after a
significant push from German mutual funds moving out of bonds into equities,
and supported by US buying.
The big winner of the day, the pharmaceuticals group, Schering, made its own
breakthrough with a DM29.20 gain to DM1,022 on one big order, and then
excitement that it had cleared the DM1,000 level.
Other recent special situations like Daimler and Lufthansa were down again,
by DM5.90 to DM747.80 and by DM2.40 to DM159.90 respectively.
AMSTERDAM saw Hoogovens continuing to attract sellers as speculation
persisted over its financial health, the shares ending off 90 cents at Fl
42.10. Many analysts believe that while the steel group remains in a
difficult situation, its longer term prospects are relatively satisfactory.
Goldman Sachs has the stock on its European priority list, although
emphasising that earnings recovery 'is likely to be a bumpy ride'.
The CBS Tendency index finished off 0.2 at 127.7.
Nedlloyd featured among the day's gainers, up Fl 2.40 or nearly 6 per cent
at Fl 43.80. Kleinwort Benson has issued a buy note on the transport group,
based on 'significant changes in top management which. . .in the short to
medium term will focus on debt reduction and cost cutting and should lead to
a gradual allaying of fears over the group's weak financial position'.
MILAN was enlivened by some late speculative buying of Ferruzzi on hopes
that the rescue plan may soon be completed, but the Comit index shed 4.25 to
596.16 as the market's consolidation continued.
Ferruzzi added L25.10 or 8.3 per cent to L325.30 and Montedison was L35.60
or 4.6 per cent higher at L801 ahead of the weekend meeting of creditor
banks.
Analysts were surprised by a L30 fall to L1,924 by Olivetti in heavy volume
of 16.7m shares, noting that there was no news to account for the activity.
On Wednesday, Merrill Lynch commented that in the short-term, the share
price was reflecting expectations such as the probability of winning Italy's
second cellular telephone licence, adding 'there is still scope for
intermediate-term appreciation given the company's repositioning of itself'.
Fiat group companies were lower: Fiat shed L169 to L6,003.
ZURICH edged lower in fairly active trade, the SMI index easing 6.8 to
2,528.0.
Roche and Sandoz were marked down after forecasts which analysts said were
in line with expectations. Roche certificates shed SFr30 to SFr5,390, and
Sandoz SFr60 to SFr3,440.
Banks and insurers remained supported by hopes for lower interest rates. CS
Holding bearers added SFr50 to SFr3,060, helped by Wednesday's cut in cash
bond rates by Credit Suisse and Swiss Volksbank's plan to cut costs by
closing branches.
STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden general index ended a mere fraction below the
all-time high of 1,339,1 it hit on August 18, closing 10.3 higher at
1,337.3.
Domestic and international investors tended to focus on shares which had
underperformed the earlier market rally. The household appliance maker,
Electrolux, rose SKr7 to SKr259 and the mining and metals group, Trelleborg,
by SKr4.50 to SKr45.50, helped by higher nickel prices.

FT  08 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Forestry loses its charms after twelve
month rally - The reappraisal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Look back a year and few sectors of European industry can have performed as
well as Nordic forestry. Look back over the last few weeks, when shares in
most of the region's pulp and paper groups have been drifting, and the
picture is rather different.
The sharp rise is explained by two factors: Swedish and Finnish forestry
groups, because they are such big exporters, were major beneficiaries of the
effective devaluation of their currencies last autumn. There was also a
strong feeling that the pulp and paper market, which had been ravaged by
severe overcapacity and world recession, would finally show a decisive turn
for the better this year.
Disappointment has set in because, for all the Nordic forest industry's new
found competitiveness, it has become clear that the hoped-for market upturn
has not materialised. Pulp prices have drifted downwards since May, and now
languish at just under Dollars 400 a tonne, while the only paper grade to
show any sign of price recovery is newsprint.
Even so, by midweek the Finnish forest index was up 93.9 per cent over the
last twelve months and 65.2 per cent this year. Sweden's forestry sector was
up 86.1 per cent on a 12-month view, but just 13.9 per cent in 1993, a
considerable underperformance on the overall market this year. Norske Skog,
Norway's biggest pulp and paper group, had seen its share price more than
double over the last year.
The reason Finnish forestry groups have generally performed better than
their Swedish counterparts is that they have more domestically-based
production, a higher proportion of exports, and a greater emphasis on
value-added products. The Finnish group, Metsa-Serla, which has proved to be
the region's star forestry performer with a tripling of its B shares over
the last year, is a case in point: it has very little production outside
Finland, and has concentrated on more stable market sectors such as tissues
and corrugated board.
Currency devaluations are not the only reason for the Nordic forestry sector
revival. Extensive rationalisation, lower wood prices and falling interest
rates have also helped the industry weather the market downturn. The
region's groups should be able to return to profit in 1993. Sweden's Stora,
Europe's biggest pulp and paper group, managed a SKr30m pre-tax profit for
the first half, but it had to rely on financial operations to offset a sharp
fall in operating income.
MoDo of Sweden and the Finnish group, Kymmene, look unlikely to return to
the black, however, and their shares have performed less well than those of
their counterparts. MoDo, which has forecast a second half loss on top of
its first half SKr353m deficit, has been hit by the performance of
operations in France, a hard currency country. Kymmene is Europe's leading
producer of fine paper, where prices are particularly depressed, and around
half of its paper production is based abroad, mainly in hard currency
countries.
Few commentators are expecting market conditions to improve decisively in
the next few months. The earliest a stronger pulp price is anticipated is
the second quarter of next year, when inventory levels should be lower. The
new competitiveness of the Nordic producers is, nevertheless, allowing them
to boost capacity utilisation, and lower interest rates are helping to
reduce their debt burdens.
Mr Denis Christie, paper and packaging analyst at James Capel in London,
expects the sector's share price weakness to persist over the next three to
six months, with disappointing statements about the market outlook
accompanying forthcoming results. However, he is much more positive on a
nine to 12 month view, because of the impact which declining interest rates
should have on demand in the all-important European market.

FT  08 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases as Hong
Kong stays at peak
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPECULATION that the Osaka securities exchange will soon announce a new
stock futures index triggered unwinding of arbitrage positions, and share
prices lost 1.1 per cent on selling of small-capital stocks, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 234.62 to 20,265.63 after a high of 20,494.45 and a
low of 20,262.83. Investors and dealers sold components of the Nikkei 225
index, on rumours that the index will be replaced by a capitalisation
weighted average. The settlement of October options contracts today also
prompted selling by traders adjusting positions.
Osaka and Tokyo stock exchange authorities have been working on a
capitalisation weighted average to replace the Nikkei 225, which is a simple
price weighted average and is seen as easily manipulated.
Volume was 300m shares against 330m. Declines led advances by 613 to 382
with 184 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell
6.99 to 1,646.79 and, inLondon, the ISE/Nikkei50 index rose 3.42 to
1,279.93.
Traders sold low liquidity small-capital component issues of the Nikkei, on
expectations that such stocks would be excluded from the new index. Nippon
Kayaku fell Y10 to Y851 and Shinagawa Refractories lost Y70 to Y1,060.
However, Daiwa Securities gained Y50 to Y1,420 and Yamaichi Securities rose
Y10 to Y810 on rumours that they would become components of the new index.
Pharmaceuticals were lower on reports of cuts in regulated drug prices:
Sankyo plunged Y130 to Y2,830 on speculation that price cuts of up to 10 per
cent might be made on Mevalotin, its profit generating anti-cholesterol
drug. Elsewhere, Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical fell Y40 to Y2,410 and Takeda
Chemical lost Y30 to Y1,310.
High-technology issues which gained ground on Wednesday, fell on
profit-taking. Hitachi declined Y6 to Y844, Mitsubishi Electric lost Y11 to
Y575 and Sony declined Y40 to Y4,580.
On the other hand, foreign buying supported car shares, with Mitsubishi
Motors gaining Y6 to Y832, Nissan Motor up Y26 to Y767 and Honda Motor
rising Y30 to Y1,640.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 54.05 to 22,401.76 in volume of 15.9m shares.
Small-lot selling depressed large-capital shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets continued in positive fashion yesterday.
HONG KONG finished at a fifth consecutive record during a session that saw
prices sharply lower after earlyprofit-taking by local investors before US
funds, which have been driving the rally, once again entered the market as
buyers.
The Hang Seng index finished 25.22 higher at 8,066.79 inturnover that dipped
to HKDollars 6.19bn against an adjusted HKDollars 7.18bn on Wednesday.
The index has risen by 8.2 per cent over the last 10 days as strategists,
mainly in the US, have increased their weighting for the market.
Index futures fell sharply in late trade and the lower trend spilled over to
subsequent London trading, where the indicative index shed 71 to 7,996.
AUSTRALIA saw its third consecutive rise with the All Ordinaries index
adding 3.7 to 2,022.5, but off the day's high of 2,031.8. Turnover was
ADollars 612.8m.
Coca-Cola Amatil gained 38 cents to ADollars 8.98 after announcing earlier
this week that it was paying ADollars 70m for a half share in Indonesia's
main Coke bottler.
NEW ZEALAND added to Wednesday's gains with a strong rise in Telecom, up 11
cents to NZDollars 4.24, which was sought by US investors.
The NZSE-40 capital index ended 36.42 higher at 2,018.95.
KUALA LUMPUR saw interest focused on rubber stocks and Genting, the gaming
group, which put on MDollars 2 to MDollars 27 on reports that it was to
commission two floating casinos.
The composite index closed up 8.57 at 874.34 in volume of 657m shares.
MANILA closed higher on steady buying by domestic investors and the
composite index rose 12.35 to 1,961.04 in volume of 516m shares.
TAIWAN extended early gains to end 2.1 per cent higher and turnover expanded
on hopes for the successful passage through parliament of a proposal to cut
the stock transaction tax.
The weighted index closed 80.32 higher at its intra-day high of 3,894.94 in
turnover that rose to a moderate TDollars 18.99bn from Wednesday's thin
TDollars 10.9bn.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Money Markets: UK sees high liquidity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK money markets sailed through their fourth consecutive day of calm
conditions as another unusually high shortage was taken out with no trouble
at the start of official dealings.
The high shortages have been created by the government's speedy exercise of
its funding programme - so far it has raised some three quarters of its
annual requirement through gilt sales and auctions and is only half way
through the financial year.
This anticipation has taken advantage of the exceptionally high price of
government bonds, driven ever upwards by the seemingly insatiable appetite
of overseas buyers. On the other hand, it has drained billions of pounds
from the national balance sheet and left the clearing banks generally short
of funds.
However, as the third quarter drew to a close last week, the banks balanced
their books and were able to operate with more flexibility.
Yesterday's forecast shortage of Pounds 1.85bn, revised by the close of
official dealing to Pounds 2bn, was the highest for a month but was nearly
all taken out at the first opportunity. At the early round of assistance,
the Bank of England bought Pounds 1.7bn of bills for resale to the market on
October 27,28 and 29 at a rate of 5 29/32 per cent. This was followed
shortly afterwards by a further Pounds 100m of assistance via Band One bank
bills at 5 7/8 per cent.
Among the main factors affecting the position were bills for repurchase by
the market which were expected to take out Pounds 921m and Exchequer
transactions which would remove another Pounds 555m.
The Bank did not operate in the money market in the afternoon but came in
with Pounds 70m of late assistance, which is carried out after official
hours and carries an unspecified lending rate. The relaxed conditions
allowed overnight rates to fall as low as 4 1/2 per cent at midday before
climbing back above 6 per cent in the late afternoon.
In the futures market, short sterling closed marginally higher at 94.35 with
turnover of only 12,500 contracts.
The German futures contract for three-month money traded on Liffe saw
reasonable two-way business as the Bundesbank held rates unchanged. The
December Euromark contract closed two basis points lower at 93.77 with
31,000 lots dealt.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Dollar stalled ahead of job figures
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS hung fire over the US dollar yesterday having already taken up their
positions ahead of crucial US employment data today.
The concentration on the latest non-farm payroll figure meant that other
issues took second place. The Tory party conference in the UK, the
Bundesbank council meeting in Germany and possible central bank intervention
in Belgium, all had a muted impact on the relevant currencies.
Economists are looking for a rise of between 150,000 and 200,000 in US
employment as a signal that the country's fragile economy might be regaining
some stamina.
Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency analysts with UBS, said: 'If we get a
figure above 175,000 the economy is back on track and the mentality of the
market shifts. Under 100,000 and the gloom intensifies.'
That nervousness left the dollar unchanged against the D-Mark at DM1.6230 by
the close in London. Against the Yen it fell slightly to Y105.10 from
Y105.60 against the Yen.
The worries allowed the German currency to appreciate quietly against a
range of European currencies.
The fact that the Bundesbank kept its floor level discount rate unchanged at
6.25 per cent and its upper level Lombard rate flat at 7.25 per cent was
neither here nor there - the market would have been stunned if Mr Hans
Tietmeyer had made any change at his first meeting as head of the German
central bank.
But doubts over the US economy have given investors more reason to back the
D-Mark. The currency has been further helped by other European central banks
rebuilding reserves that were severely depleted out by the exchange rate
mechanism crisis at the beginning of August.
The D-Mark climbed against the French and Belgian francs and the Spanish
peseta. Outside the ERM it rose against the Swiss franc and Italian lira.
The French franc was further overshadowed by disappointing statistics on the
Bank of France reserves. A number of economists had expected that it might
have recovered a large chunk of its reserves lost during the the crisis at
the start of August. In the event, the latest figure showed that the Bank
only rebuilt by FFr9.3bn last week, the lowest weekly figure since the
crisis. That still leaves it with an estimated FFr57.7bn shortfall.
The Belgian franc suffered from continuing worries over the state of the
economy and the government's ability to shoulder through its social pact.
The currency hit BFr21.77 against the D-Mark at one stage and dealers said
the central bank was intervening to support it; the central bank denied the
claims. The Belgian franc closed at BFr21.70 down from BFr21.67 previously.
Sterling held on to gains notched up earlier in the week in spite of some
disappointment that Mr Kenneth Clarke the Chancellor refused to scotch
speculation of an early interest rate cut.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Survey of Taiwan (9): Chasing the Chinese dragon - Company
Profile, Acer Group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Acer Group, Taiwan's largest computer company, is pursuing the 'Chinese
dragon dream', aiming to establish itself as the first Chinese company to
become a world leader in the computer market. It is an ambitious goal, but
already the company is among the top 10 in the personal computer field.
Acer's progress has made Mr Stan Shih, its founder, chairman and chief
executive, a hero in Taiwan. As one of the island's most influential
business leaders, he is now playing a central role in efforts to shift the
island's industrial base from low-cost manufacturing to more advanced
product development and marketing, or from 'the bargain basement to the
luxury goods department' as they say in Taiwan.
'In Taiwan we must establish our own technology development and
international marketing capabilities if we are to remain competitive,' says
Mr Shih.
The Taiwanese electronics industry has become the island's biggest source of
exports largely as a result of its ability to provide low-cost, high-volume,
sub-contract manufacturing services to US, Japanese and European personal
computer companies. Yet its future is clouded by rising costs that are
undermining Taiwan's competitive advantages in world markets.
As Taiwan's newly industrialised economy begins to mature, the need for
large-scale investment in technology development and international marketing
is becoming critical, Shih maintains. 'In the long run there is no other way
for Taiwanese manufacturers to compete with China or south-east Asia where
costs are much lower,' he says.
His message has not been lost on the Taiwanese government which is spending
about Dollars 450m a year on research and development programmes, much of it
aimed at the information processing industry. Manufacturers also get tax
credits for investments in R&amp;D, training, automation or international brand
name promotion. Yet many in the business community remain sceptical. The
typical Taiwanese high tech business spends only 1-2 per cent of revenues on
research and development, and another 1-2 per cent on marketing, Mr Shih
estimates. 'That is why they can offer low prices.'
Acer's R&amp;D spending runs at about 5 per cent of revenues, with an addition
outlay of more than 5 per cent on marketing. Even this is well below many of
its foreign competitors.
While there is a broad consensus that Taiwan needs to become less dependent
upon foreign technology, the need for marketing efforts is less widely
accepted.
Spending money on international advertising and promotion is a relatively
new concept in Taiwan where many manufactured products end up bearing the
brand name of a western company. Acer is one of very few Taiwan companies to
have established it own name in world markets. Others include Pro Kennex,
the tennis racquet maker and Giant bicycle.
Four years ago, Mr Shih became the founding chairman of a business group
aimed at boosting the marketing skills of Taiwan's industries. The Brand
International Promotion Association (Bipa) has attracted about 100 members
who can participate in training programs in marketing, public relations,
advertising , corporate identity and image building.
Bipa, initially hailed for its forward-looking efforts, came under fire two
years ago when several of its member companies fell into bankruptcy and Acer
itself recorded losses. 'The general public blamed spending on brand
promotion for the financial problems, but they were unrelated,' Mr Shih
recalls. Brand promotion is considered too risky, and it takes too long to
see a return on the investments, he explains.
'It takes perhaps two years to see returns from manufacturing. Technology
development may take three to four years and require 10 times as much
effort. Image building takes one hundred times the effort. It takes a very
long time.'
Yet from Mr Shih's point of view, establishing Acer's brand name is a matter
of necessity. 'Without your brand name, without a good image, your business
is unstable because you are totally dependent upon the performance of the
companies that you supply.' A mix of brand name and sub-contract business is
ideal, he says, because one offsets the risks of the other.
Acer has also moved faster than other Taiwan companies to establish a
presence in international markets. The group now has operations in more than
70 countries, many of which operate as semi-autonomous business units. Some
are partly owned by local employees.
Acer's approach to 'globalisation' reflects Taiwan's small-business culture.
'The textbooks are all from a US or Japanese point of view, but we have to
do it our own way,' says Mr Shih.
'The Chinese are individuals, but they are not so good at teamwork,' he
explains. 'A chinese manager can lead perhaps 1,000 people; in the US it
might be 5,000; and in Japan maybe 10,000. That is our nature.'
Three years ago, Acer decentralised its management to create independent
business units and began spinning off ownership of subsidiaries to employees
and local investors. The group's Taiwan manufacturing operations were split
into two affiliate companies, while its most profitable sales unit, serving
Latin America and Asia-Pacific, also became independent earlier this year.
In international markets, Acer has formed partnerships with its
distributors, transforming them into local assembly operations by shipping
sub-assemblies from Taiwan and purchasing other components locally.
The goal, says Mr Shih, is to create a consortium of 'real borderless global
companies with a local-touch global brand name.' While prizing
entrepreneurial independence, Mr Shih, unlike many of his western
counterparts, welcomes government involvement in Taiwan's high-tech
industry.
'We need a national strategy,' he says, 'to set a direction for the private
sector.' The government should also create the right infrastructure for the
high-tech industry to flourish, he believes.
'The government is like a parent, motivating its children to study hard, and
rewarding them for their efforts.'
In many regards the Taiwan government has served the industry well, Mr Shih
believes. But 'the most difficult government strategy we lack is on
Taiwan-China relations.'
There is a growing conflict in Taiwan between business and government over
rising Taiwanese investments in mainland China. 'The Ministry of Economics
really understands that China is a great opportunity for Taiwan's business,
but because of political issues this strategy cannot be realised,' says Mr
Shih.
Current government regulations prohibit the transfer of Taiwan's most
advanced technologies to mainland China. Taiwan's computer companies are
allowed to establish assembly operations on the mainland, but are required
to prove that their investments in Taiwan outstrip those on the mainland.
However, the regulations are widely ignored, even government officials
acknowledge.
As one of Taiwan's most visible companies, Acer is moving slowly to
establish itself on the mainland. The group has committed itself to open a
keyboard and computer monitor manufacturing operation in China by the end of
next year and has begun building up a network of service and distribution
offices.
Some of Acer's US competitors are steaming ahead. Over recent weeks both
Compaq Computer and AST Research have announced joint ventures in China.
Ironically, despite their proximity to mainland China, Taiwan's computer
makers may be at a disadvantage in exploiting the potential of this emerging
market.
'Today, the requirement for us to invest in China is not so critical. But it
may be critical next year or in two years,' says Mr Shih. He is optimistic
that the Taiwan government will recognise the problem and ease its
China-investment regulations in the near future.
Mr Shih compares Acer's efforts to achieve its 'Chinese dragon dream' to the
ancient game of 'Go'. It will take patience, endurance and strategic
planning if Acer is to win market share, or territory, away from its
competitors. The Taiwanese are hardly new to this game. The computer market
is merely a new playing field.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Survey of Taiwan (10): A basic guide for visitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DENNIS ENGBARTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VISAS for visitors from most countries are fairly easy to obtain from
Taiwan's official or, more likely, unofficial missions.
Names for the unofficial offices can vary, but are usually economic and
cultural offices containing the catch-words 'Republic of China' or 'Taipei.'
For example, in London, Taiwan's representative is at the 'Taipei
Representative Office in the UK.'
Trade contacts: A useful source is the China External Trade and Development
Council (Cetra) Tel: 886-2-725- 5200; Fax: 757-6653).
Cetra has offices in most of the leading trading nations, often together
with Taipei's unofficial representation, or separately under the moniker
'Far East Trade Service.'
Companies more interested in investment projects can also contact the
offices of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, often known as the 'Economic
Division' of the Taipei representative office. Directory: If possible,
travellers should purchase upon or before arrival the Directory of Taiwan,
which offers a thorough and indispensable collection of important offices,
companies and services for NTDollars 400 (Dollars 17.50) if purchased in
Taiwan.
It can also be ordered at higher prices (including postage) from The China
News (one of the island's two English-language dailies) at 11F, 110 Yenping
S. Road, Taipei, Taiwan. Tel: 886-2-388-7931 or Fax: 381-5987.
Getting to Taiwan now presents even fewer problems for European travellers
with the growing number of direct air connections between European capitals
and Taipei.
In 1993, Taipei entered into reciprocal air traffic right pacts with the UK,
Germany and France. EVA Airlines now has a direct service, via Bangkok,
between Taipei and London and will soon start a service to Paris. China
Airlines (CAL) in September initiated a Taipei-Bangkok-Amsterdam-Frankfurt
service.
Subsidiaries of British Airways and Air France also now operate flights to
Taipei. Where to stay should be determined by the visitor's centre of
activity.
Lobbyists should consider hotels close to Taipei's key centres of political
influence. The Taipei Hilton or the Lai Lai Sheraton are both a short walk
from the Executive Yuan (or cabinet) and the Legislative Yuan and near to
other key agencies such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Central
Bank of China, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of the Interior.
The main disadvantage of their locations on Chung Hsiao West and East Road,
respectively, is that a main line of the Taipei mass transit system is now
being built under this six-lane avenue.
Executives rushing from the Hilton or Lai Lai to business appointments in
eastern Taipei will learn first-hand why most residents complain daily about
the 'black age' in city transport.
A compromise choice for those whose schedules are weighted with both
political and corporate appointments are a number of hotels on Chung Shan
North Road, including the Formosa Regent, the Fortuna, the Ambassador, Royal
and the President.
Transportation from these hotels to the political zone is quick, and many
local and foreign companies have offices on Chung Shan N. Road, along the
city's main north-south corridor. These north-side hotels are also close to
the city's traditional night-life zones.
Businessmen whose agenda is dominated by corporate appointments should
choose a hotel on the east side, where most key companies and business
organisations now have their headquarters.
Among the superior hotels in this region are the Ritz, Howard Plaza,
Sherwood, Asiaworld, Brother, Magnolia or Holiday Inn. Businessmen whose
main purpose is to participate in trade shows, international conferences or
make trade contacts should consider the Hyatt near the World Trade Center on
the extreme east of the city.
Most local hotels offer tour packages for businessmen or their families who
have time to take in some of the island's sights.
Outside Taipei: Visitors should not think that the rest of theisland
resembles Taipei. Taiwan's coast and mountain regions have a number of
attractive scenic locations, including Alishan (Mount Ali) and Taroko Gorge.
Time off: The most notable of Taipei's museums is the National Palace
Museum, which contains many art treasures removed by the Nationalists when
they fled to Taiwan in 1948-49 (Tel: 886-2-881-2021; Fax: 882- 1440).
Taipei now boasts several fine venues, including the National Concert Hall
and the National Theatre in central Taipei's Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Park.
Visitors interested in local handicrafts may consider a visit to the Taiwan
Handicraft Promotion Centre on 1 Hsu Chou Rd, Taipei (Tel: 02 321-7233).
The best part of a visit to Taiwan is the food. Visitors are strongly
advised to get out of their hotels and explore.
Various Chinese regional cuisines can be enjoyed - and may be ordered by
simply pointing at menus by those lacking Chinese linguistic skills.
An ideal place to try Taiwanese food is 'Green Leaf' (Ching Yeh) on Chung
shan North Road. An alternative is a later competitor, 'New Leaf' (Shin
Yeh), which has several locations in Taipei.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Survey of Taiwan (8): Important role in PC revolution -
Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAKE the lid off a personal computer and the chances are very high that the
main circuit board inside will have been manufactured in Taiwan.
The island now boasts a 70 per cent share of the world market for PC
'motherboards' and is the largest producer of the latest 'notebook PCs',
prompting some to rename it the 'Republic of Computers'.
Information technology is now the cornerstone of Taiwan's economy,
reflecting a rapid shift away from its traditional labour-intensive
industries towards advanced technology including semiconductor chips,
computers and computer peripherals. Last year, with sales of Dollars 8.7bn,
electronics products became Taiwan's biggest export.
The personal computer is at the core of Taiwan's emergence as a world player
in information technology. Last year Taiwan's exports of PC hardware reached
Dollars 6.6bn, according to Dataquest, the market research group, which
predicts an 11.7 per cent increase to Dollars 7.4bn this year.
PC circuit boards alone accounted for Dollars 980m in exports last year,
while exports of computer monitors (displays) totalled Dollars 2.3bn. Taiwan
is also the top producer of the computer 'mouse' - the device used to move a
cursor around a computer screen - with an 80 per cent share of the world
market, according to government statistics.
Yet Taiwan's role in the PC revolution has gone largely unnoticed outside
the computer industry. With the exception of Acer, Taiwan's largest PC
producer, most of the computers made in Taiwan are sold under the names of
foreign companies such as IBM or Apple Computer.
'Taiwan is the arms dealer to the warlords of the PC industry,' says Mr
Robert Lo, manager of the Taiwan operations of Intel, the leading US
semiconductor manufacturer.
But why Taiwan?
Ironically, IBM, whose original personal computer design gave birth to an
industry of 'PC clones', played a central role in the creation of the
island's PC industry.
IBM established a procurement office in Taiwan in the 1960s, when the
island's economy was based on low-cost, labour-intensive manufacturing.
Tatung, now one of Taiwan's largest PC manufacturers, was an early partner
of IBM , manufacturing parts for its mainframe computers.
Following the introduction of the IBM PC, in 1981, IBM chose TECO, a leading
Taiwanese television manufacturer, to mass produce personal computer
monitors. Other Taiwan companies followed TECO into the monitor market ,
sparking an export boom and fuelling Taiwanese interest in the PC business.
In the same period , the Taiwanese government was actively encouraging the
establishment of high technology enterprises through its Industrial
Technology Research Institute (Itri). Seizing the opportunity created by the
standards-based IBM PC, Itri designed one of the first 'clones' of IBM's PC
XT , thus providing a fillip to Taiwan's fledgling PC industry.
Over the past 10 years the Taiwan government has continued to play an
important behind-the-scenes role in the island's computer industry,
representing Taiwan manufacturers in their negotiations with foreign
companies, undertaking research and development efforts, and providing
training and market research assistance.
Taiwan's semiconductor industry, which supplies components to its PC and PC
board manufacturers, provides another example of the blend of
government-sponsored initiatives and private-sector ingenuity.
Its foundations were laid in the early 1970s by K T Li, then the minister of
finance and widely known as the 'father' of Taiwan's information industry. A
frequent visitor to the US and Japan, Li established a government-funded
semiconductor development project in Taiwan under the auspices of the newly
formed Itri.
'Without Itri's early involvement, Taiwan's semiconductor industry would
probably not exist today,' says Morris Chang, Itri chairman, who credits K T
Li with recognising the critical role that semiconductor technology could
play in Taiwan's industrial development.
In the late 1970s, the Itri semiconductor research and development project
was expanded to incorporate a pilot production line which was spun off in
1980 to form United Microelectronics, Taiwan's first - and still largest -
semiconductor company. This move was critical, Mr Chang believes, because it
demonstrated the commercial feasibility of semiconductor production in
Taiwan, encouraging private sector investment. Six years later, another
semiconductor producer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, was spun
out of Itri to provide production facilities for the island's burgeoning
chip design industry.
A third Itri semiconductor spin-off is under consideration as the institute
nears completion of a five-year advanced 'submicron' semiconductor
technology development project which included the construction of an
ultra-clean wafer fabrication laboratory with state-of-the-art semiconductor
production technology.
In addition to these official 'spin-offs', former Itri engineers have
populated numerous other chip design and manufacturing companies in Taiwan
formed with funding from the private sector, several of them formed by
Taiwanese entrepreneurs who returned to their homeland after working in
California's Silicon Valley.
Typical of these is Miin Wu, president of Macronix, one of Taiwan's most
promising semiconductor companies. Mr Wu returned to Taiwan four years ago
after over 20 years in the US, where he studied at Stanford University and
then worked in Silicon Valley. He brought 40 other Taiwanese engineers back
with him from the US to form the core management and engineering team at
Macronix.
This 'reverse brain drain' is fuelling the growth of Taiwan's electronics
industry, says Mr Chang. Chinese American engineers are attracted by the
opportunities in Taiwan's burgeoning industry, in contrast to the slow
economic growth in the US over the past few years, he notes.
'About two thirds of the 400 PhDs working at Itri have returned from the US.
And the people with working experience in the US has also increased
dramatically.'
The abundance of well-qualified engineers is one of Taiwan's key advantages
in the high technology industry, says D C Chien, general manager of IBM
Taiwan. 'Even though Korea has a population 30 times that of Taiwan, we have
far more engineers.'
He also praises the adaptability and responsiveness of Taiwan's relatively
small enterprises. 'When IBM wants something made on short notice, they
deliver.' IBM, for example, turned to Taiwanese manufacturers for its
recently-introduced low-cost Ambra PC product line.
For all of its strengths, however, the Taiwanese electronics industry
remains heavily dependent upon foreign technology and is subject to the
vagaries of foreign markets. As costs rise in Taiwan, its manufacturers are
increasingly shifting their operations off-shore, to China and Malaysia.
The biggest challenge, says Morris Chang of Itri, is to upgrade Taiwan's own
technology base. Until that happens, the Taiwanese information industry will
not be the master of its own destiny.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Survey of Taiwan (7): An eye on world aircraft markets -
Aerospace Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN'S aerospace industry has reached a watershed in its development.
Within two or three years, it should become clear whether or not it will be
able to extend its engineering expertise into world markets for passenger
aircraft.
Taiwan is an established components supplier to big western civil aircraft
manufacturers. It is also able to produce its own military jet fighters.
Now the government is seeking to marry the two and create an industry that
manufactures whole aircraft for domestic and foreign civilian markets.
The most important talks now under way are with the UK's British Aerospace
and Dassault of France.
BAe wants to improve its profitability: the RJ series of regional jet
passenger aircraft, which would be built partly in Taiwan, lose money for
the company.
Unfortunately, talks with Taiwan have encountered difficulties since a
contract to establish a joint venture was signed in London in January.
Doubts have been raised by Taiwanese banks lending money to finance the
joint venture, called Avro. They are concerned that the aircraft could lose
money as easily in Taiwanese hands as British.
The main hurdle, the financing of the deal, was cleared in August. But the
apparently less important details of the amount of technological expertise
that would be transferred to Taiwan have proved to be almost as difficult to
overcome.
If, and when, these matters are settled, manufacturing could begin as early
as next spring.
Talks are at an earlier stage with French aircraft builder Dassault. Taiwan
is buying Dassault military jet aircraft and missiles and wants some
aerospace manufacturing skills transferred to Taiwan.
Dassault is keen to keep such transfers confined to civil sector skills
associated with its Falcon series of executive jets.
But Taiwan may insist on some of the Mirage work moving to the island.
Taiwan is in a strong position to demand such concessions. In Dassault's
case, the deal was its first export order for four years, while BAe is still
struggling to improve its profitability after a period of heavy losses.
Taiwan has two further inducements, beyond its experience in the components
business, with which to persuade foreign companies to share their know-how.
It has huge reserves of capital, thanks to its successes in exports of
manufactured goods. And it offers proximity to the world's fastest-growing
air transport markets in south-east Asia and China.
Taiwan also wants a foreign partner as it struggles to emerge from decades
of relative economic isolation thanks to China's claim over the island.
That isolation prevented the government from importing military aircraft.
Instead, it went ahead with production of its own designs. Taiwan initially
moved to piston-engined training aircraft and then jet trainers. Now it has
advanced far enough to oversee production of its own supersonic jet fighter,
the IDF (Indigenous Defence Fighter).
Yet as production of the IDF got under way last year, France and the US
decided to risk Beijing's wrath by allowing the sale of General Dynamics
F-16 and Dassault Mirage 2000 fighters to Taiwan.
Taiwan's air force promptly halved its order for the IDF to 150 aircraft,
leaving 200 or more local aerospace manufacturers and the design and
manufacturing arm of the defence ministry with spare capacity.
This spare capacity has added impetus to the drive to find foreign partners
for aerospace manufacturing.
To that end, the government this summer announced the progressive
privatisation of the country's military aircraft manufacturing operations,
which builds the IDF, at Taichung on the island's west coast.
The first stage, scheduled for next summer, is the creation of an autonomous
but state-owned company. It could lead to complete privatisation within five
years, say government officials.
The move to privatise the Taichung operations follow the establishment by
the government of Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC) in October 1991.
This company, with a minority state shareholding, has the aim of becoming 'a
major Asian aerospace company by the year 2000'.
It intends to accomplish this through partnerships, and it was TAC that led
the Taiwan side in plans to establish the Avro joint venture with BAe.
Yet two years after its birth, TAC is still finding the aerospace industry a
tough one to enter.
Although it has plenty of cash and some engineering expertise, Taiwan still
lacks several essential skills specific to the civil aircraft business:
integrating components, designing interiors, marketing and leasing.
And the providers of the cash, Taiwanese investors, are discovering that
aircraft manufacture is a high-risk business in which they may not see a
return on an investment for a decade or more. Taiwan's banking community has
been among the most wary of TAC's backers in assessing whether prospective
deals should go ahead.
They were partly behind the failure last year to launch a Dollars 2bn joint
venture with McDonnell Douglas to design and build a new large passenger
jet. Government officials blame that failure on the country's inexperience
in aerospace: TAC was only a few months old and its financial backers were
daunted by the prospect of investing huge sums in an aircraft whose design
did not yet exist.
McDonnell-Douglas may yet come back to Taiwan for another deal. Unofficial
reports from Taiwan suggest that the government is having talks with the
company over the possibility of establishing a joint venture to develop
helicopter technologies.
And the fear of being seen as a country that cannot do joint venture deals
with foreign partners is certainly contributing to the survival of the BAe
talks.
So it is a measure of Taiwan's determinations to establish itself in
aerospace that it is prepared to enter into talks simultaneously with
several large foreign companies in the field. If the drive fails to spark
rapid growth in aerospace as a consequence, it will not be for lack of
trying.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Survey of Taiwan (6): Big clean-up effort is under way - The
Environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAIWAN is paying the price for failing, until recently, to address
environmental problems during its rush to industrialisation. 'We started
late,' admits Lung-Sheng Chang, head of Taiwan's Environmental Protection
Administration.
Evidence of unregulated pollution is all too apparent on the streets of
Taipei. Rubbish collects on pavements and in back alleys. On a hot and humid
evening, the smell of sewage is pervasive in the older parts of the city and
the air is yellowed by a seemingly permanent pall of smog.
A big clean up effort is under way, amid mounting public pressure. Last year
Taiwan's spent more than Dollars 22bn on environmental protection, with
similar spending expected to continue for the next five to six years.
'We have come to realise that economic development is not, in itself, our
goal. Our aim is to raise the quality of life of our people, says Mr Chang.
'Unless we clean up air, water and solid waste pollution, then growth in the
gross national product or per capita income becomes meaningless.'
Last year a constitutional amendment revised the republic's public spending
priorities to rank environmental protection and ecological conservation
along with economic development.
Yet the problems created by Taiwan's rapid economic growth are immense.
Rising incomes have enabled millions of Taiwanese to buy cars and
motorcycles. With a population of just over 20m, Taiwan boasts 4m motor
vehicles and 10m motorcycles. In the past 12 months, 500,000 new cars and
almost 1m new motorcycles crammed on to the already heavily congested city
streets.
High levels of vehicle emissions are accentuated by bumper-to-bumper traffic
jams. 'We have double digit growth in motor vehicles per year, but less than
a one per cent increase in parking spaces and road area,' says Mr Chang.
To combat air pollution, Taiwan has adopted the tightest emission
regulations for motorcycles in the world, and is matching California's
exacting standards for car emissions.
More than half of petrol consumed is now lead-free and the EPA has a target
of phasing out leaded petrol by 1999.
Initial results are encouraging. Last year the number of days when air
quality in Taipei remained within acceptable standards increased by 5 per
cent to more than 88 per cent. Lead content in the air was reduced by 90 per
cent last year.
Consideration is also being given to 'pollution taxes' on petrol. 'Our gas
prices are very low,' says Mr Chang. 'We are encouraging our people to use
the gasoline.' Yet proposals for an increased tax on petrol are
controversial because of fears that it could fuel inflation and have a
negative impact on the economy.
Enforcing anti-pollution measures is difficult, especially when they
conflict with business interests, Mr Chang says. Industrial development
plans, for example, are now subject to strict environmental impact reviews,
severely restricting waste disposal and emissions. But business executives
complain that environmental rules are too harsh, increase costs and place
them at a competitive disadvantage in world markets.
Water pollution is another serious problem in Taiwan. Less than 8 per cent
of the population has sewage processing service. Even in Taipei, only 18 per
cent of sewage is fully treated. The rest is funneled into river beds,
creating a health hazard. The problem has become particularly acute over
recent months because Taiwan is suffering a drought. Heavy rainfall during
the typhoon season normally flushes the river beds, carrying waste out to
sea.
Construction of a metropolitan sewage treatment plant costing NTDollars 1bn
has begun, but is not expected to be completed for another two years.
Government plans call for a huge expenditure of NTDollars 100bn on sewage
treatment systems throughout the island over the next seven years.
Yet local government agencies, which are required to raise half the cost of
treatment plants for their districts - mostly through higher local taxes,
have been less than enthusiastic. Local politicians put higher priority on
more visible public works, such as the construction of roads and bridges, Mr
Chang explains.
In an effort to push the projects forward, the EPA has proposed that the
national government increase its share of the cost to 70 per cent, lowering
the burden on the regions. While the public seems ambivalent towards the
sewage treatment problem, proper disposal of household and solid industrial
waste has become an issue of widespread concern.
'The people are demanding that we clean up the streets,' says Mr Chang. The
Taiwanese government plans to build 22 large scale 'resource recovery' waste
incinerators at a cost of NTDollars 100bn that will process more than 80 per
cent of household waste and produce electric power in the process.
One incinerator in Taipei is already operating and contracts for the
construction of six more will be put out to public tender by the end of the
year.
Taiwan is also buying many garbage collection and street cleaning trucks.
'We are making quite a lot of progress and we believe that within five years
our solid waste problem will be solved,' says Mr Chang.
Education is another important element of Taiwan's environmental efforts. A
schools programme has been so successful that children have become the 'Red
Guards' of the environment, Mr Chang says.
Recycling is on the rise, with Taiwan leading the world in the recycling of
waste paper. 'We have a long tradition of valuing and re-using paper,' Mr
Chang explains. Fifty five per cent of waste paper was recycled in Taiwan
last year.
Although the primary thrust of Taiwan's environmental policies is to address
its domestic problems, the republic is also keen to play a role in
international environmental efforts by encouraging neighbouring developing
Asian countries to recognise the importance of environmental protection
before they encounter the problems faced by Taiwan.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Survey of Taiwan (5): KMT supremacy challenged - Domestic
politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REMARKABLE change is under way in Taiwanese politics. The old order,
represented by one-party authoritarian rule, is giving way to more plural
multi-party politics. It is still too early to say where the change will
lead. What seems certain is that there is little chance of Taiwan peacefully
returning to the past.
The island has embarked on a process of democratisation which, when the
president is popularly elected in 2 1/2 years, will further underline its
separateness from mainland China.
And therein lies the risk for Taiwan's politicians. Taiwan's new politics
has opened up debate on the island and 'Taiwan independence' is now openly
advocated. Beijing has resolved to prevent the island's secession from the
mainland and has threatened to move quickly, using military means, to stop
it from doing so.
For the time being, however, these considerations have given way to a
contest for power and influence in one of north Asia's most dynamic
economies and societies. In this period of transition, the supremacy of the
ruling Kuomingtang (KMT), which has governed Taiwan since the end of the
Second World War, is being challenged.
Business leaders and even some senior officials of the KMT now openly
speculate that the government may fall from power. Five years ago the
thought would have been impossible, and probably seditious; what is
genuinely surprising is the apparent equanimity with which they view the
prospect.
Says Mr Chi-Chu Chen, senior vice-president of the International Commercial
Bank of China: 'It's my view that in three years the KMT will be out of
office. People are sick and tired of the status quo. In general people do
not trust the DPP (Democratic Progressive Party), but they just might take
the risk and vote them in. The KMT is not forever.'
At the top level of the KMT, officials are phlegmatic. Says Mr James Chu,
the party's spokesman: 'We are concerned but not worried. Take a look at
what has happened to ruling parties in other countries. Conservatives in the
UK had a hard time - the same in the US and Japan. This is an era of
diversity and dynamism; people want change.
'I think we are doing well. But we can't expect always to get 70 per cent
and 80 per cent of the vote in elections when we are going through a process
of democratisation. Some day we may be the opposition party; we know that is
a price we may have to pay. That is not a failure of democratisation but the
success of it.'
Universally known as 'the party', the KMT remains very powerful and is
likely to do so for some time to come. It supplies Taiwan's president, prime
minister and head of the judiciary. Moreover, more than 90 per cent of
Taiwan's civil servants are party members.
It is also very rich. Companies controlled by the KMT's Central Investment
Corp had at the end of February assets valued at NTDollars 963.9bn (Dollars
37bn), making it Taiwan's largest business group. One of its important
financial and political assets is its ownership of television. It is seeking
to expand that control into cable TV when the government approves the
establishment of cable networks.
In spite of this appearance of control, the KMT is facing pressures from
many directions. Internally it is riven by faction and is showing signs of
fracturing. Moreover, the Democratic Progressive Party, which advocates
'Taiwan independence' and is its main external threat, has been skilful in
exploiting these divisions to score a number of parliamentary victories,
notably the passage of a law requiring politicians and senior government
officials to reveal their personal wealth.
Although the ruling party's financial strength is a huge asset, it has
become a political liability. Voters in Taiwan, especially among the
educated middle classes in the cities, are tired of 'money politics'
(corruption). They are also questioning the efficacy of a political party
playing such a powerful role in industry and commerce and the potential
conflicts of interest this poses.
In last December's elections for the Legislative Yuan, Taiwan's law-making
body, a group of concerned citizens formed a lobby called the Clean Election
Campaign. Its purpose was to monitor vote-buying by politicians of all
parties. The support the campaign received underlined the extent of voter
dissatisfaction with corruption in Taiwanese politics.
Mr Jack Huang, managing partner of the US law firm Jones, Day, Reavis &amp;
Pogue and a leading member of the campaign, says: 'Initially we did not
invest a lot of hope in the success of the campaign, but to our surprise we
received 700,000 letters from voters who said they would not sell their
vote.'
Next month the KMT will face a further test of its popularity and unity when
elections for 21 county mayors and magistrates are held across the island.
The party currently controls 13 of these positions, but it is widely
expected that it will fare less well this time around, possibly losing the
simple majority it currently enjoys.
Its rival, which controls seven localities, expects to win 11 or 12 of the
local government positions. Winning a majority of the positions has become
make-or-break for Mr Hsu Sin Liang, chairperson of the DPP. He has said he
will resign party leadership if the party does not win more than half the
seats.
The DPP sees these local elections as a chance to cut its rival off from its
grassroots support through its own access to the patronage power in Taiwan.
Mr I-Jen Chiou, deputy secretary general of the DPP, says: 'We think we can
win the coming the coming elections and if so them I think we can, through
the mayors, build our power and weaken the special interests of the KMT.'
At a national level, defections from the KMT to the China New Party - formed
after the KMT's 14th party congress in August by a faction disaffected with
the China policy - have seriously affected its ability to govern. 'Ours is a
large party', says the KMT's Mr Chu. 'We do have a caucus in the legislature
but it has become more and more difficult for us to hold them in line . . .
We hope the situation will improve.'
Because of the split, the KMT's strength in the 168-seat legislature has
been cut from 102 to around 95 as former party members have left. Its
strength there is likely to be eroded by further defections to the New
Party.
This party, led by Mr Chao Shau Kang, a former environment minister and
senior KMT member, promotes a curious blend of populism and conservatism. On
one hand, it has taken up the battle for clean government and a clean
environment; on the other it wants a more accommodative policy towards
mainland China.
'We think we should have government-to-government talks and direct trade and
communications links with the mainland,' says Mr Chao.
In this inchoate political climate, the KMT is pushing ahead with internal
reforms in an attempt to answer its critics' complaint that it is still too
authoritarian. It is also considering reforms of Taiwan's legislature to
change it from a forum which screens the executive's proposed laws to one
which can originate legislation.
This reform would allow for a separation of the executive from the
legislature, raising the possibility of an opposition-controlled legislature
and a KMT executive. The reform will also pave the way for the direct
election of the president in May 1996.
As Taiwan moves towards the greater use of the ballot box in determining
political power, so it moves closer to independence. That may prove too much
to stomach for China's Communist rulers who have never renounced the use of
force to reunify the nation.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Survey of Taiwan (3): China issue is most divisive - Foreign
Relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RELATIONS between Taiwan and the Chinese mainland were, until recently,
relatively straightforward. Both sides laid claim to the other's territory
and both were locked in a theological debate about who were the rightful
rulers of 'all China'.
Taiwan's rapid industrialisation, as well as China's economic reform, have,
however, significantly complicated the issues. Cold War-era antipathies are
being submerged by today's booming - although officially indirect - trade
across the Taiwan Straits with mainland China.
At the same time, Taiwan, with its new-found wealth and democratic liberties
is anxious to achieve western recognition and play a fuller role in the
world community. Yet movement on this front is largely dependent upon
Taiwan's status in relation to China.
The simplicity of the past has been replaced by hand wringing and confusion
in Taiwan about how to deal with the 'China question'. No longer
incommunicado, Taipei and Beijing are committed to promoting greater
understanding between their peoples. Yet critical questions remain. Taiwan
is asking itself at what pace contacts with mainland China should proceed,
and what the ultimate result of increasing contacts will be.
Relations between Taiwan and the mainland have become the most divisive
issue in Taiwanese society and politics, leading to the recent fracturing of
the ruling Kuomingtang (KMT) party and weakening business support for the
government.
To fully understand what is happening in Taiwan, one needs an acute sense of
the difference between appearance and reality, of words and deeds. The
current KMT leadership under the guidance of President Lee Teng-hui says its
wants a reunited China. But its every action suggests that what it really
seeks is an independent Taiwan, in part to placate the increasingly powerful
DPP opposition party. This was best exemplified last month by Taiwan's
abortive attempt to seek membership of the United Nations, from which it was
ejected in 1971 when the communist government of the mainland replaced it as
the representative of China. Re-entry into the UN represents Taiwan's
ambition to achieve broad international recognition of its sovereignty.
In the event, China voiced strong objections, saying that admitting Taiwan
to the UN would set an 'abominable precedent' and would interfere in China's
internal affairs. The steering committee of the UN General Assembly declined
to put Taiwan on its agenda, dismissing the issue without even voting.
Taiwan's was backed by a handful of Central American nations with strong
economic ties: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and
Nicaragua. These, together with several African nations, constitute the rump
of the international community which still affords Taiwan full diplomatic
recognition.
Most western countries have only de facto relations with Taiwan, stationing
officials in Taipei at quasi embassies called trade offices and limiting
official diplomatic contacts.
The US and Europe (with the exception of the Vatican) recognise Beijing as
the sole legal government of China, including Taiwan. Western democracies
are keen to take full advantage of the huge potential for trade and
investment that China's economic reforms have created. Rather than risk
conflict with China, the US, which is Taiwan's greatest supporter in the
developed world, has warned the Taipei government that its attempt to
penetrate the UN and its system of multilateral agencies is ill judged.
'It would be unwise (of Taiwan) to confront the Clinton administration with
a choice between Beijing and Taipei,' said Professor Ralph Clough of Johns
Hopkins University at a recent conference. 'Taiwan's long-term interests
will be better served and US support more easily maintained by continuing
the existing policy of pursuing economic and other interaction with mainland
China, while at the same time seeking an improved position in the
international community.'
Nevertheless, Taiwan is not giving up. 'We are fully aware that it would be
extremely difficult for us to achieve our goal to join the UN,' said
President Lee Teng-hui,' but we will. . . continue to work hard for our
cause.'
Echoing the sentiment, Mr I-Jen Chiou, a senior opposition DPP official,
says: 'We do not think we can join the UN easily. Maybe we will need 10 or
20 years of effort. We quite understand we have a long battle to fight, but
we want to take the first steps.'
The government's decision to push for UN membership and alleged foot
dragging on closer commercial contacts with the mainland is cited as one of
the reasons for this summer's split in the ruling KMT. A number of leading
members left to form the China New Party.
Mr Chao Shau Kang, leader of the New Party, believes that the government is
wasting precious time in delaying more substantive talks with Beijing. 'We
have the advantage now; if we wait another three years then our advantage
will be less and we will lose our bargaining chip,' he says.
His view finds widespread support among business people who believe the
government is powerless to stop economic integration across the Taiwan
Straits. Trade between the two is growing rapidly. China is now Taiwan's
fastest growing export market - exports were 20 per cent up in the first
eight months of this year compared with a year ago - and the second-largest
market in terms of size. It is forecast to be worth more than Dollars 8bn
this year.
Where trade flows so, too, does investment. There are no reliable figures on
the actual amount of Taiwanese investment which has flowed to the mainland
since restrictions were relaxed, but the Mainland Affairs Council thinks it
could be as much as Dollars 20bn.
The intensity of interest in China is underlined by recent mainland figures
putting Taiwanese investment in Shanghai at more than Dollars 1bn in the
first eight months of the year, more than the entire stock of Taiwanese
investment in the previous eight years.
It is further underlined by Taiwan's retailers organising for a big push
into mainland retailing. Well-known stores such as 7-Eleven and less well
known ones such as Wua Shin Steak House, will soon be trading in especially
designated 'Taiwan shopping streets' in Beijing and Shanghai.
Mr Jack Huang, managing partner of the US law firm Jones, Day, Reavis &amp;
Pogue, says: 'The government should lift restrictions on investment. They
were a nice idea - a nice try - but it is clear today that China can get
investment from anywhere in the world. Our investment is not that critical;
our technology is not more advanced than what China can get from elsewhere.
The fact is that Taiwan business has a greater need to go into China than
China needs the business.'
Like many business people who value the political liberalisation of the past
five years, he thinks the challenge facing the government is how to prolong
the process of inevitable integration to ensure that when unification comes,
it poses no threat to Taiwan's newly won liberties. Others fear that
Taiwan's economy will become increasingly linked to that of the mainland,
intensifying its dependency upon the Chinese market and giving Beijing
unacceptable power over Taiwan.
Clearly, Taiwan's relations with China, and therefore the rest of the world,
are now being shaped by economic trends rather than the territorial disputes
of the past. It is not clear that Taiwan knows quite what to do about it.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Survey of Taiwan (2): Growth rate slips below target - The
Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT many countries would be dissatisfied with real output growth of 6 per
cent a year and inflation below 4 per cent. Add to that a government deficit
and official debt which account for just 1.6 per cent and 8 per cent of the
economy respectively and most European finance ministers would be lining up
to receive the William Gladstone prize for fiscal rectitude.
Not so in Taiwan. A sluggish world economy has caused the island's growth
rate to slip below the government's target of a 7 per cent annual expansion
for most of this decade. The economy's under-performance, relative to
expectations, has meant the deferral of an ambitious plan to rebuild and
extend Taiwan's industrial and social infrastructure. The government now
puts Taiwan's long-term potential growth at 6.5 per cent.
Private economic forecasters have also revised downwards their predictions
for the economy's short-term economic outlook. In July, Baring Securities, a
British brokerage, expected growth in excess of 7 per cent next year. Now it
is looking for 6.5 per cent in 1994 and has deferred until 1995 its hope for
even faster expansion.
Mr Peter Kurz, head of Baring in Taipei, says: 'Taiwan is an investment,
supply-side-led economy. We expect 6 per cent growth this year and see it
picking up to 6.5 per cent in 1994. If exports also pick up - and a lot
depends on the US economy and China - then we could be looking for 7 per
cent in 1995.'
Growth in company profits, he says, tends to be sluggish, below 7 per cent
growth in gross national product (GNP), Taiwan's favoured measure of output
which includes net income earned abroad. 'Above that, corporate earnings
rise by 20 per cent to 30 per cent,' he says.
Taiwan's economic development has been one the great success stories of the
post-Second World War era. The island's economic planners have pulled off a
rare feat in economic management: rapid growth in output, full employment
and price stability.
From 1984 to 1991 the island chalked up a growth in real GNP of 8.6 per cent
a year, while consumer prices inflated by just 1.8 per cent a year. The
average unemployment rate during the same period was 2.1 per cent.
This performance is made all the more remarkable given that Taiwan, along
with the rest of the capitalist world economy, participated fully in the
asset price inflation of the 1980s.
Mr Lee Kao Chao, director of economic research department, Council for
Economic Planning and Development, says: 'The result of our economic success
has been sweet but the problems created by the trade surplus have been more
bitter. The trade surplus of the 1980s created excess monetary growth and an
asset bubble. The stock market index rose from 650 in 1985 to 12,650 by
1990. Land prices rose by four times. The bubble has now burst, but we have
been left with high land prices and high wage levels. The 'money game' has
produced a poor climate for investment.'
Official figures underline the impact that the 'money game' has had on
Taiwan's manufacturing sector. Since 1986 average earnings in manufacturing
have nearly doubled. Employment in manufacturing peaked at 2.8m workers in
1989 since when more than 300,000 jobs have been shed. Yet the story of
manufacturing on Taiwan is not all gloomy.
Productivity has grown nearly 60 per cent between 1986 and the end of last
year, keeping the rise in manufacturers' unit labour costs to 26 per cent
over the seven-year period. In some industries, notably electronics,
productivity has risen by more than 80 per cent, while the rise in unit
costs has been negligible: just 13 per cent.
'Taiwan is an economy of small companies,' says Mr Kurz. 'If you are
dedicated to making one product then you make sure you are the most
competitive.'
The government can do little directly to affect wages but where it can have
an impact is in land prices. Since the summer it has announced plans to sell
state-owned land at reduced prices for existing and new-entrant
manufacturers, especially those engaged in high technology.
Those parts of the production process where Taiwan's manufacturers have lost
competitiveness are at the labour-intensive end of the manufacturing
process. These jobs have migrated to mainland China where, since 1989,
Taiwanese industry has made great inroads, especially in footwear and food.
The government is particularly concerned that investment on the mainland
will lead to a shortage of capital for investment on Taiwan. Another concern
is that wholesale migration of industry will lead to a 'hollowing out' of
the manufacturing base on Taiwan and a compensatory increase in the island's
dependency on the mainland economy.
Elements of dependency have already become a reality - Taiwan's trade
surplus is sustained by its trade, via Hong Kong, with the mainland - but
Taiwan is a long way from being hollowed out, or from being totally reliant
on the mainland for its economic well being.
A lot of 'investment' has been speculative property investment. It has been
estimated that more than Dollars 5bn has been pumped into China's property
market, mainly in Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou (Canton). With the
tightening of economic policy in China since the summer, many believe that
these investors may get their fingers burnt.
The tightening in monetary policy in China and a corresponding easing of
monetary policy on Taiwan is expected to give a fillip to private investment
on the island. After a recovery in growth last year, private investment is
expected to rise by nearly 13 per cent this year and about 10 per cent in
1994.
In the meantime the government has taken a fresh sighting and is trying to
chart a course for the Taiwanese economy which envisages becoming
'Asia-Pacific regional operations zone'. The government has promised
NTDollars 3bn of tax credits for industry - to encourage investment - and
earmarked a further NTDollars 20bn in state support for the island's high
technology industries.
Overhanging this strategy, however, is Taiwan's troubled relations with the
mainland. Until both arrive at a modus vivendi it is debatable whether this
latest chapter in Taiwan's economic development can be as successfully
realised as past policies were.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Survey of Taiwan (1): An island in search of its identity -
Taiwan has much to gain from developing an economically rational
relationship with the Chinese mainland. Closer contacts must be properly
managed and conducted in tandem with further liberalisation on Taiwan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
TAIWAN is an island in search of its identity. In the process of
rediscovering its past and trying to define what makes itself special,
Taiwan faces the future full of uncertainty.
In one sense this is nothing new for the people of Taiwan. They have lived
with the threat of invasion from communist China ever since the creation of
the People's Republic in 1949, four years after the Kuomingtang (KMT,
Nationalist) government took control of the island from a defeated Japan.
But what makes the uncertainty of today different is the confusion within
government, business, and society more generally about where the nation's
future lies and what Taiwan's proper role in the world should be. Taiwan has
come to a crossroads and is unsure which way to go.
Taiwan's search for identity - the result of the political liberalisation
which has occurred over the past 10 years - has produced a flowering in
letters and the arts. Modern Taiwanese painters are blending western
technique with an oriental sensibility to produce work of great originality.
The Taiwanese are also delving deeper into their recent past - no longer
off-limits for academic and popular research - and the culture of the
indigenous people who have lived on the island since well before permanent
Chinese settlement.
This awakening in Taiwan has thrown more starkly into relief the divisions
within Taiwanese society about the way forward. That future used to be
fairly simple: as part of a united China, some day. But no longer; the
island's cultural development and its rapid democratisation have produced
among the people a reaction against reunification with the mainland, and
active pockets of proselytes for independence who dream of a Republic of
Taiwan.
Perhaps the soul searching presently under way is the inevitable consequence
of an authoritarian government releasing the constraints on participation in
public life and lifting the prohibitions on private expression. But unlike
much of Latin America or South Africa, which went through a similar process
of political and social change in the 1980s, Taiwan is not a pariah state
ready for international rehabilitation. It is recognised by a diminishing
number of states in the international community. Less than 100 miles to the
west of the island lie 1.2bn Chinese people ruled by a government which
wants what it regards as its territory back.
If the indecision within the Taiwanese mind were confined to Taipei's
chattering classes then it would be of little consequence, but it is not.
The government is deeply divided over policy towards the mainland. Many of
its own current and former supporters believe that the KMT government's real
agenda is not reunification - as it proclaims - but independence. The latest
piece of evidence is Taiwan's abortive attempt last month to have its status
reconsidered by the United Nations General Assembly.
Businessmen - many of whom value the new-found freedoms that democratisation
has brought - are convinced that closer economic ties with the Chinese
mainland are not only inevitable, but desirable if Taiwan is to prosper. The
government's prohibition of direct trade and communications links with the
mainland - the absence of which cost Taiwanese business dearly and enriches
Hong Kong greatly - cannot, however, go on indefinitely.
In mid-1997, Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty and what was once an
indirect trade route with the mainland becomes a direct one. In spite of
itself, the government soon will have to face up to reality.
The conundrum posed by the mainland - especially its recent opening to the
outside world and the urgency with which the government on Taiwan has to
deal with it - was summed up, but not faced, by a paper published this July
by Taiwan's Council for Economic Planning and Development, (CEPD).
'The high degree of complementarity in economic conditions on the two sides
of the Taiwan Straits, as well as special factors such as geographical
proximity, blood affinity, and cultural background, have resulted in a rapid
increase in economic and trade contacts between Taiwan and mainland China,'
it noted.
'In the long-term, the further integration of the two economies is a trend
that would be difficult to stop. The important question for Taiwan,
therefore, is how to face up to the situation across the Taiwan Straits,
grasp the initiative, strive for mutually beneficial development and secure
Taiwan's position of economic leadership.'
Fine sentiments, but unfortunately few solutions. The CEPD, which is part of
Taiwan's cabinet, did not depart from the government's mainland policy. All
it could do was urge a relaxation of some restrictions, such as those which
apply to imports of semi-manufactures from the mainland, not a fundamental
reappraisal of the policy.
This is the fatal flaw in the CEPD's economic revitalisation programme, a
plan which aims to increase the economy's competitiveness through
deregulation and opening it further to international economic forces to
create on Taiwan an Asia-Pacific regional operations zone.
In outline, the plan attempts to cure the problems inherited from the
explosive growth of the 1980s in asset prices by bearing down on rising
labour and land costs. Looking forward, it seeks to raise the economy's
level of technological sophistication, free access to international capital
markets, and develop sea and air communications so that Taiwan can become a
regional hub for trade.
But realising the government's hope of remaking Taiwan anew may prove to be
the most difficult feat to pull off for the island's hitherto impressively
successful planners. Without direct access to mainland China the willingness
of international business to locate on Taiwan would appear limited.
'What the government cannot bring itself to do is take a pragmatic approach
and find a more effective way to deal with the situation,' says one local
businessman, articulating the prevailing view. 'I do not agree that greater
contacts will lead to dependency. Taiwan's businessmen are not stupid; none
want to be dependent on China. In any event, the investment on the mainland
cannot be stopped. It is like water; you cannot stop it flowing, so you'd
better direct it.
'The question is how to prolong the process as long as we can so as to
ensure that when unification comes it is not a problem for us.'
Taiwan has much to gain by developing an economically rational relationship
with the mainland. But it has much to lose as well. The struggle for
political rights, to which the KMT-led government was forced to respond in
the mid-1980s, was hard won. Taiwan, along with South Korea, is giving the
lie to the assertion that Asians cannot govern themselves through free
institutions but have to be ruled by an iron and unforgiving hand, lest they
run amok.
Multi-party democracy - still rough around the edges - is taking root on
Taiwan, giving voice to popular demands for a cleaner environment and better
social services and welfare. Given Beijing's attitude toward Hong Kong's
democratic aspirations, Taiwan has much to fear from a closer embrace with
the Chinese communists.
But of the many things which distinguish Taiwan from Hong Kong three stand
out. Taiwan is able to feed itself; it is able to govern itself; and it has
an independent military deterrent. Closer contact with the mainland, if
properly managed, and conducted in tandem with further liberalisation on
Taiwan, ought not be a difficult trick to pull off. All it needs is the
political will.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ecuador's banana exports defy
crisis fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAY COLITT

   QUITO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONTRARY TO forecasts by industry experts, Ecuador's banana exports did not
plummet in response to the European Community's import restrictions. In fact
exports up to the end of September were slightly up on the same period last
year.
The recovery of the world's largest banana exporter came after sales earlier
this year slumped considerably in anticipation of the EC restrictions.
Between January and September 1993 exports totalled 1.978m tonnes, compared
with 1.977m tonnes exported in the first seven months of 1992.
The sales increase for Ecuadorian bananas in the world market is partially
in compensation for production losses in central America, where Hurricane
Gert destroyed large tracts of banana plantations. Meanwhile, new markets in
Asia and the Middle East helped offset losses caused by EC restrictions.
At the same time Ecuadorian bananas have become more competitive worldwide.
According to Mr Jose Riofrio, head of promotion and marketing for bananas in
the ministry of agriculture, the government's price cut of 40 US cents a box
 -nearly 9 per cent - in June has had a beneficial effect on sales of the
country's fruit.
In addition, Ecuador has increased its productivity by phasing out
inefficient plantations and has reduced the cost of fumigation. While the
area cultivated was reduced from 140,000 hectares last year to 103,000
hectares by this September, production during that period actually increased
slightly.
Earlier this year the Union of Banana Growers and Exporters, representing
central America and Columbia, had criticised Ecuador, which had increased
its banana cultivation area by 30 per cent since 1991, for oversupplying the
market.
Reductions in unit costs will not be sufficient to enable the producers to
sustain the June reduction in the price they are paid by exporters.
Producers and exporters are to meet shortly with the agriculture minister,
Mariano Gonzalez, to discuss the new price adjustments.
The National Banana Association has demanded that the reference price paid
to producers for a box of bananas be taken back to USDollars 4.50 from
Dollars 4.10. It is unlikely, however, that this will happen.
While producers have taken a cut in revenues the country has not experienced
anything like the forecast sales crisis. Government estimates had placed
potential losses resulting from EC import restrictions at Dollars 70m a
year. The government now forecasts total exports for this year will be
between 2.52m and 2.55m tonnes, up from 2.51m in 1992.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Inco announces 16% output cut
for next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INCO, the world's biggest nickel producer, yesterday announced a 16 per cent
cutback in 1994 production to help bring supplies of the metal into line
with demand. The Toronto-based company said output at its operations in
Ontario and Manitoba would be cut by 60m lbs, starting in December, from a
projected 380m lbs this year. Two-thirds of the cuts will take place in the
first three months of 1994.
Nickel prices continued this week's rally at the London Metal Exchange
yesterday as speculation grew about Inco's announcement. The three months
price touched Dollars 4,555 a tonne before being trimmed back by
profit-taking to close at Dollars 4,487.50, up Dollars 170 on the day,
Dollars 375 on the week so far and Dollars 447.50 from the 6 3/4 -year low
reached seven days before. An Inco official said talks begining today with
unions on ways to achieve the output reductions were expected to be
completed next week. Measures under consideration include a four-day working
week, extended Christmas shutdowns and workforce reductions.
Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch group in London, suggested that
such moves might hold the market at present levels but would not be enough
to lift it out of its depression. 'What the market needs is a convincing
cutback announcement,' he said. Mr Wiktor Bielski, at Bain and Company,
agreed. 'These would not be real cuts. They could quickly be reversed if
prices started rising.'
There appears to be some disagreement, moreover, among unions at Thompson,
Manitoba and Sudbury, Ontario, on what form the cuts should take.
'We're going to try and satisfy different people with different things,' the
Inco official said. The 1,700 workers at Thompson last month ratified a new
three-year contract that included a three-year wage freeze.
The nickel market has been suffering over the past two years from persistent
overproduction as demand for the metal has sagged, especially from stainless
steel manufacturers, which account for about 60 per cent of consumption.
This has swollen world stocks to a level equivalent to 22 weeks'
consumption.
The resulting price slide has eliminated profit margins for all but the
lowest-cost production units. 'No western producer is making money at these
levels,' said Mr Bielski. Inco suffered a USDollars 2.2m loss in the second
quarter of this year when the nickel price averaged USDollars 2.93 a lb - 90
cents above the current level.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia's Black Sea oil
shipments fall by 20 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VOLATILITY which has characterised Russian oil exports this year appears
to be continuing, with shipments from the Black Sea in the first week of
October down about 20 per cent from the September average of 700,000 barrels
a day, according to shipping agents in London quoted by the Reuters news
agency yesterday.
'The Russians are not able to confirm dates when customers can lift crude
from Novorossiisk,' an Italian refiner said.
The weather in the area has been bad and Novorossiisk, the leading crude
export terminal, was closed on Tuesday because of high winds and swells.
Weather problems have also hit liftings of oil products, mainly gas oil,
from Tuapse and Odessa, other Black Sea ports.
Traders also reported that there were logistical problems at Russian
crude-gathering centres and local transportation difficulties, although one
analyst at a western oil company said he 'didn't see why logistics should
have suddenly broken down'.
He added, however, that 'we don't expect exports to be smooth under present
conditions' affecting the Russian oil industry.
Precise data is unavailable but lack of investment and technical problems in
many Russian fields has caused production to decline steadily this year.
In September an oil industry forecasting group, Asotek, predicted that
Russian production in 1994 would be 327m tonnes, a long way below below this
year's forecast range of between 340m and 350m tonnes.
The Miskar gas field off Sfax on the Tunisian coast was inaugurated
yesterday by British Gas, which is developing the Pounds 492m project.
Completion of the project should make Tunisia self-sufficient in natural
gas.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Silver takes the lead in
precious metals market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SILVER continued to outshine other precious metals at the London bullion
market yesterday as prices responded to overnight, options-related buying at
the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex).
The London price ended at 435 US cents a troy ounce, up 15.5 cents, after
Wednesday's 16-cent advance.
Many investors see the outlook for the silver market as bullish, based on
the present supply deficit, variously estimated at between 350 and 500
tonnes a year.
But Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain and Company, said stocks in Comex
warehouses amounted to about 275m ounces, equivalent to about six months'
supply of the metal.
And he suggested that before continuing deficits ate into this total
significantly, rallies in the prices of lead and zinc might have brought
brought mothballed lead/zinc mines back into production - and with them
extra silver by-product.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa 'bloodbath' continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COCOA FUTURES prices fell sharply again in a continuation of what one
analyst called this week's 'bloodbath'.
As the March position at the London Commodity Exchange fell to Pounds 911 a
tonne, adding Pounds 39 to Wednesday's Pounds 21 setback, Mr Lawrence
Eagles, of the GNI trading house, said some traders were talking about the
slide continuing to about Pounds 850 a tonne. 'And when they talk about a
figure it usually goes further,' he said. 'I would not rule out a fall to
Pounds 830.'
He said there had been no change in the market's fundamentals, which were
still clearly bullish in the long term. But actual supply shortage  - as
against bouts of temporary tightness - resulting from the continuing stocks
drawdown could not be expected to make itself felt until 1995.
Mr Eagles suggested that many operators thought the market had become 'a bit
overblown' as the March position climbed to Monday's 40-month high of Pounds
983 a tonne. The final push to that level appeared to have been fuelled by
'the last of the bulls', he said, and when there was no follow- through the
selling began in earnest.
An extra margin call was made to all long-holders in the cocoa market after
it fell the Pounds 40 permissible daily limit in the morning, clearing house
and exchange officials said.
'This is entirely normal, however, when the move in one day exceeds the size
of the margin,' one told the Reuter news agency.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia insists on reciprocal
aluminium cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA, which later this month will host an international conference of
major aluminium producers and consumers to thrash out a multilateral
solution to the row over its exports, denies that it has offered to restrict
its own exports unilaterally.
Officials say Russia has told the European Commission, which has imposed
curbs on Russian imports, that it is prepared to cut its exports only if
western producers undertake similar 'self-restrictions'.
'This problem cannot be solved unilaterally,' said Mr Eduard Borovikov, the
foreign trade ministry's specialist on relations with the European
Community.
Mr Vladimir Kondratiev, an official at Concern Aluminiy, which groups major
Russian aluminium plants, said that Mr Sergei Znamensky, its director for
foreign trade, had told commission officials in Brussels last month: 'We
agree to cut our production of aluminium only if at the same time other
producers do the same.'
Mr Kondratiev also categorically denied rumours that the Bratsk and
Krasnoyarsk plants had left Concern Aluminiy, and added that Mr Igor
Prokopov, the company's president, had not been present at the Brussels
talks.
The so-called 'safeguard action' imposed by the commission in August
restricts Russian imports to 60,000 tonnes until the end of the year. The US
and Canada protested against the EC restrictions, saying it would simply
divert a flood of cheap metal their way. The EC measures have had no effect
on world aluminium prices, which have fallen because of continuing excess
supply the world over.
Asked to clarify Russian production figures, Mr Borovikov said the EC had
already agreed that negotiations on any production cuts would cover only
Russian exports of aluminium destined for end-users - amounting to an annual
300,000 to 350,000 tonnes - and exclude another 182,000 tonnes destined for
further processing at metallurgical plants within the European Community.
Mr Borovikov said that an initial conference, to be held on October 20-21,
would bring together Russia, the EC, the US and Canada.
Russia had already agreed with the European Commission to establish system
of 'double checking' to monitor illegal exports through other former Soviet
republics, he said, estimating that these totalled about 150,000 tonnes a
year.
Mr Borovikov laid the blame for the appearance of cheap Russian aluminium in
Europe mainly on these exports, which Russia had been unable to control
partly because of the absence of effective border controls following the
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
'This is a very big problem,' he said. 'Any trader from Latvia can come to
Moscow and buy aluminium at the lower domestic price and then ship it
through Riga (Latvia's capital and a major port).'
He admitted that another problem was corruption among Russian customs
officials, who could be bribed to turn a blind eye to unlicensed exports
from Russia.
But he said that Russia had a much better grip on the situation than before,
partly because the gap between Russia's internal price and world prices was
rapidly narrowing as a result of higher Russian energy prices. Cheap Russian
energy and lax environmental standards were cited by EC producers as giving
Russian producers an unfair advantage. Many Russian plants are badly in need
of re-equipping to meet Russia's existing environmental standards. But at a
time when the country is undertaking radical market reforms being urged upon
it by the west, officials say it is unrealistic to expect it to make
unilateral sacrifices.
The closing of western markets to competitive Russian exports, especially
when Russia has opened its market to competitive western goods and services
such as banking, is also seen as hugely hypocritical on the part of western
countries.
A wider conference on the aluminium problem in November would include
producers such as Ukraine, the only other major producer in the Commonwealth
of Independent States, and other western producers such as Norway.

JOHNSON MATTHEY executive director Mr CRN Clark believes the world platinum
will be largely in balance this year but slightly in deficit in 1994,
reports Reuter from Tokyo.
He said global 1993 platinum demand would be about 4m ounces, compared with
3.8m ounces in 1992.
'I heard from our expert that there are no more surplus stocks (in Russia)
and they are merely selling what they usually mine in a normal year,' said
Johnson Matthey chairman Mr David Davies.
Johnson Matthey officials said normal annual production there was estimated
at about 500,000 ounces.
Russian platinum sales would continue lower because of lower world prices
and lower national stocks, Mr Clark said. 'Russian sales will be slightly
depressed from the level of the last two years.'
The country sold 1.1m ounces of platinum in 1991 and 750,000 ounces in 1992,
an exceptional release of stocks in order to obtain hard currency, said Mr
Davies.
Mr Clark and Mr Davies are in Japan to attend the opening of a technology
centre in Tochigi prefecture north-east of Tokyo.
Demand for rhodium, the rare metal recovered with platinum, should begin to
pick up as buying from car manufacturers resumes, Mr Clark said.
'Now that worldwide stocks of car makers have been reduced and are at
minimum levels, buying should start again,' he explained.'

FT  08 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Total launches feasibility
study for second refinery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Total, the French oil company, yesterday launched a feasibility study for
the construction of a second refinery unit to make up to 50,000 tonnes a
year of the ETBE 'green fuel' additive out of surplus crops, writes David
Buchan in Paris.
The company had already started, in July, a study for a joint project with
Eridania Beghin-Say, the food company, and the French associations of wheat
and sugar beet growers to build a first refining unit of 50,000 tonnes a
year of the additive, which can replace lead as an octane-enhancer in petrol
and is seen as an increasingly useful outlet for French farm surpluses.
Total's partners in the second project, which would also be in one of the
oil company's existing refineries in Normandy or northern France, are the
beet and wheat growers, plus the Ethanol Union, a group of 19 distillers of
ethanol from sugar.
Total said yesterday that it would next month be making a final decision on
the two projects, which are roughly estimated at costing about FFr50m
(Pounds 5.7m) each. If both projects get the green light, Total's
biocarburant output might eventually overtake that of its French rival,
Elf-Aquitaine, whose Feyzin refinery near Lyons currently has a capacity to
turn out 75,000 tonnes of ETBE a year.
But Total warned that it first wanted some long-term assurance from the
French government that the present tax exemption for biocarburants, first
introduced in the 1992 budget, would be maintained for the life of its ETBE
units.

COPPER prices held in a narow range at the London Metal Exchange and ended
slightly lower, with the three months position at at Dollars 1,695 a tonne,
a loss of Dollars 4. The market now looks to be trying to consolidate at
present levels following its recent inability to overcome overhead
resistance and producer selling above Dollars 1,700. Three months ZINC at
one staged reached a low of Dollars 898 tonne but sizeable trade buying
aided a recovery back up to Dollars 906, a loss of Dollars 8. ALUMINIUM,
boxed in a narrow Dollars 4 range found little impetus to move away from
recent levels amid the lack of metal-related news and producer action. Last
business for three months was at Dollars 1,112 a tonne, a loss of Dollars 3.
Support on dips to around Dollars 1,110 remained evident. LEAD edged higher
on short-covering following recent trade buying attracted by recent low
levels. Last business was at Dollars 381 for three months metal, a gain of
Dollars 5 from Wednesday's finish. TIN finished higher following dealer
short-covering, with the sharp rise in nickel appearing to aid the rise. The
continuing strike at Brazil's largest tin mine also helped to underpin the
market.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Government Bonds: Investors lengthen maturities as hopes of
rate cuts fade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CONNER MIDDELMANN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE's bond markets caught their breath after the recent rally and prices
drifted lower on moderate volume.
However, traders reported little selling of cash bonds - if anything, some
investors were picking up paper as it cheapened. A key feature continued to
be maturity-lengthening by investors who felt further cuts in European
short-term rates are unlikely in the near term.
International investors' appetite for long-dated debt supported the auctions
of 30-year bonds in the Netherlands and France.
THE LONG end of the Dutch curve steamed ahead following the government's
issue of Fl 2.8bn of the 7.50 per cent 30-year bond at 114.50. When the
result was announced, traders who had sold the bonds around 114.20 ahead of
the auction scrambled to cover their short positions, pushing the price as
high as 114.85. It eased later on profit-taking, closing at 114.40.
The long end of the yield curve flattened substantially, with the 30-year
yield ending 51 basis points over 10-year yields, compared with 59 basis
points on Wednesday.
FRANCE auctioned FFr4.09bn of 8.5 per cent 30-year bonds and FFr9.26bn of
6.75 per cent 10-year bonds, which also met solid international demand,
traders said.
But prices drifted lower on widespread disenchantment over the Bank of
France's reluctance to cut rates. As expected, it left its 6.75 per cent
intervention rate unchanged at yesterday's repo.
THE BUNDESBANK also left key rates steady at its latest meeting. German
bonds slipped in lacklustre trade and are expected to make little headway
before next week's bund issue.
Once that is out of the way, the December bund future is expected to reach
for new highs, targeting the key 100.00 level. It ended yesterday at 99.58,
down 0.08 points from Wednesday.
UK GILTS eased on profit-taking across the curve on disappointment that
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke offered no new policy hints in his Conservative
party conference speech. 'It was very much a speech geared to a party
conference audience,' said Peter Fellner, gilts strategist with NatWest
Markets.
US Treasury prices were little changed in subdued trading for the third day
running, as traders and investors remained on the sidelines awaiting today's
employment figures.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was down  1/16 at 103 9/32 ,
yielding 6.007 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up 1/32 at
100 3/32 , yielding 3.808 per cent.
Once again the market was virtually on hold ahead of the September
employment report, which will give the latest reading on the labour market.
The market is looking for an increase in non-farm payrolls of about 150,000.

FT  08 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: US/German legal gap bridged
by World Bank offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD BANK's forthcoming D-Mark global offering represents a triumph
over the seemingly irreconcilable legal and fiscal differences between
Germany and the US.
The main difference between the two is that in Germany, securities are
issued in bearer form, whereas in the US they are issued in registered form.
Mr Kenneth Lay, director of financial operations at the World Bank, said
that it was important to find a way to bridge these two legal traditions so
that the bonds could trade freely in US but also be eligible to act as
collateral for loans by the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank.
The World Bank found a startlingly simple solution but one which took more
than a year to gain approval by the US and German authorities.
This is how the structure works. The bonds will be represented by two
permanent global certificates which will not be exchangeable for individual
bond certificates.
One certificate, to be held by the Deutsche Kassenverein (DKV), the
Frankfurt-based clearing and settlement agency for German securities, will
be issued in bearer form. This certificate will represent the bonds held by
investors through institutions which are participants in DKV. Bonds held
through Euroclear and Cedel will be included in the DKV certificate.
The other certificate, issued in registered form, will be held by the
Frankfurt branch of Citibank as custodian for the Depository Trust Company
(DTC), the central depository for securities in the US. This certificate
will represent the bonds held by investors through institutions that
participate in DTC.
When the bonds start trading in the secondary market, any sales will be
reflected by respective increases and decreases in the two certificates.
Therefore, the bonds represented by the two certificates will equal the
total amount of the bonds outstanding at any time.
Mr Lay said that this structure would enable the bonds to trade freely
across the world, thus fulfilling one of the main aims of the global bond
concept. In addition, transaction costs would be significantly reduced.
The World Bank will raise DM3bn later this month through its first D-Mark
global bond offering, which will be jointly lead-managed by Deutsche Bank
and Salomon Brothers.
The bonds will have a maturity of five or 10 years and the spread over the
yield on underlying German government bonds will be in single digits.
The World Bank intends to make two D-Mark global offerings a year and the
next issue is likely to come early next year. 'This will allow us to freshen
up the coupon and allow investors to trade into the new bonds,' Mr Lay said.
The World Bank pioneered this form of capital-raising in 1989. Since then it
has issued 13 global bond offerings in dollars and yen with maturities
ranging from five to 30 years.
Mr Lay said that a large part of the bank's annual borrowing programme of
Dollars 10bn to Dollars 12bn would be funded through global bond offerings
in these three currencies.
Several sovereign and provincial borrowers have also started issuing global
bond offerings, culminating with the Republic of Italy's record Dollars
5.5bn offering in mid-September.
Mr Lay, who was in London yesterday to market the DM global bond offering to
investors, said that the World Bank's global bonds had achieved the high
level of liquidity he had hoped for.
The World Bank's dollar global bonds were among the 10 most actively traded
bonds in Euroclear some 20 months after their launch and its yen global
bonds currently accounted for 70 per cent of the turnover in the yen sector
of the international bond market.
The Bank's next aim is to encourage Japanese investors to use its yen global
bonds as a tool for increasing their total returns.

FT  08 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Barclays Bank in first UK personal loan
securitisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS BANK opened up a new sector in the UK's growing asset-backed market
yesterday when it raised Pounds 280m through an issue of floating-rate notes
(FRNs) backed by personal loans.
The widely-expected offering marks the first securitisation of personal
loans by a UK bank and follows on the heels of National Westminster's Pounds
300m issue of mortgage-backed notes launched last week.
Securitisation is a funding process which allows banks to take loans off
their balance sheet, thereby removing the risk of default and freeing up
capital.
This is achieved by the banks placing the assets in a special-purpose
vehicle which then raises money by selling debt securities to investors.
Interest payments on the 'mortgage-backed' or 'asset-backed' securities are
funded by the loan repayments.
The securitisation of personal loans has been widespread in the US but is
just catching on in the UK. Syndicate managers could only remember one such
securitisation prior to Barclays' offering, an issue of FRNs made by Cardiff
Auto backed by car loans.
Syndicate managers said many banks and companies, especially those which
have leasing or hire-purchase activities, were keen to securitise the loans
they had made to individual or business customers.
'Most are looking to securitise high-volume, low-value loans,' said one
syndicate manager.
Barclay's notes, which have an average life of 1 1/4 years, were issued
through Gracechurch Personal Loan Finance.
The portfolio backing the two-tranche offering consisted of unsecured loans
of not more than Pounds 7,000 to Barclays' credit card customers, around 95
per cent of whom are of at least three years' standing and have not been in
default for more than 30 days.
The lion's share of the offering was made up by a Pounds 250m tranche of
class A notes which paid 22 basis points over the London interbank offered
rate (Libor). The pricing was seen to be on the tight side and the whole
issue had not been placed by the end of trading yesterday.
Lead manager BZW said that the notes were targeted at corporate investors
rather than banks because of their 100 percent capital adequacy risk
weighting. By contrast, NatWest's mortgage-backed notes, which yielded 20
basis points over Libor at launch, were only 50 per cent weighted.
The remainder of Barclays' deal was made up by class B or subordinated
notes, launched by UBS, which were priced to yield 85 basis points over
Libor. The higher yield reflected the higher risk associated with these
notes.
Bank of Scotland also tapped the Eurosterling sector with a Pounds 200m
undated issue of subordinated notes. They were priced to yield 130 basis
points over the 8 per cent UK government bond due 2013, in line with
secondary market levels for similar paper.
Joint lead manager Hoare Govett said the bulk of the issue had been placed
with pension funds and insurance companies. The bonds were re-offered at the
99.204 issue price and were trading inside fees at 98.95 in the late
afternoon.
Fisons, the UK pharmaceuticals company, is thought to be looking to raise
Pounds 100m through an issue of 10-year Eurobonds at a spread of around 100
basis points over UK government bonds. Turkey is also likely to raise
10-year paper in the Eurosterling sector next week at a spread of 200 basis
points.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD &amp; POOR'S, the US credit rating agency, has downgraded the debt
ratings of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, a leading Japanese commercial bank.
The move is the most recent in a line of credit downgrades for the big
Japanese banks. They face increasing bad loans due as the prolonged
recession pushes up the number of bankruptcies.
DKB's senior debt rating has been lowered to 'single A plus' from 'double A
minus' and the rating agency has lowered DKB's short-term debt rating to A-1
from A-1 plus.
S&amp;P said increasing problem assets at the bank were hurting its asset
quality.
At the end of March, loans to bankrupt borrowers and loans six months past
their due date totalled Y1,300bn (Dollars 12.3bn), or 3.81 per cent of
outstanding loans.
While Japanese financial authorities claim that bad loans at commercial
banks average around 3 per cent of total lending, industry analysts reckon
the figure rises to 10 per cent when measured in US terms.

FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Better tanker market sparks
Bergesen recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETTER tanker market conditions, a stronger US dollar and gains on share
sales helped Bergesen, the Norwegian shipping group, bounce back to profit
for the first eight months of 1993.
The group offset heavy foreign exchange losses and a weak performance from
its liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) activities to record a pre-tax profit
NKr171m (Dollars 24.14m). That compares with a NKr32m deficit for the same
period in 1992.
Operating revenues rose to NKr1.97bn from NKr1.64bn, with the dollar up 13
per cent against the krone since last year and average daily tanker rates up
20 per cent at Dollars 18,000.
Operating profits climbed to NKr195m from NKr61m. The tanker division halved
its operating loss but LPG profits were lower. The group does not expect
significantly improved rates in any of its market segments in the last four
months of the year.

FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Investment gains enable Orkla to
move into profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ORKLA, the Norwegian industrial and investment group, rebounded to a NKr907m
(Dollars 13m) pre-tax profit for the first eight months of 1993 from a
NKr161m loss in the same 1992 period.
The group said the result was helped by a better operating performance but
the main difference was in the development of financial activities.
Last year it sustained losses of NKr642m on share deals but this year had
realised gains of NKr230m. Investment activities contributed NKr202m to the
pre-tax result, compared with a NKr722m loss last year.
Operating revenues rose to NKr11.28bn from NKr10.99bn, while operating
profits increased by 12 per cent to NKr852m from NKr759m.
Branded consumer goods lifted operating profits by 5 per cent to NKr659m,
despite strong competition and little growth in the Norwegian groceries
market.

FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Battle for Australian dairy

THE BATTLE for control of Associated Dairies, the Victoria-based dairy
products company, intensfied yesterday, with Queensland's QUF Industries
saying it was prepared to improve its offer to ADollars 2.97 a share. It had
previously offered ADollars 2.95, valuing its target at ADollars 72m
(USDollars 46.4m)
QUF said its move followed advice that Australian Co-Operative Foods, a
rival suitor, was increasing its bid to ADollars 2.96 from ADollars 2.85.
QUF also said it had held further talks with the Trade Practices Commission,
and expects a favourable recommendation next week.
The takeover battle follows a spate of consolidations in Australia's dairy
industry. Estimates suggest QUF will control about 24.5 per cent of the
dairy market nationally if it gains control of Associated Dairies, against
27 per cent for National Foods which recently won control of United Dairies.
Australian Co-operative has a 22 per cent market share.
Applications for shares in Austoft Holdings, the sugar cane manufacturer
being floated on the Australian stock market by its UK-based parent, BM
Group, have closed early, the issue being oversubscribed.
BM Group, the engineering company engaged in a programme of disposals and
debt reduction measures, announced plans to float off Austoft at the start
of September. Lists for the 39.7m Austoft shares on offer opened three weeks
ago, and were due to close on October 15. Austoft shares are being sold at
ADollars 1 each, raising almost ADollars 40m.
George Weston Foods, the bakeries and biscuits company which is part of the
Associated British Foods group, yesterday reported an after-tax proft of
ADollars 52.4m for the year ended July, compared with a ADollars 49.7m
surplus last time. Sales rose from ADollars 969.5m to ADollars 1.026bn.
Weston said that the bread industry had remained very competitive in the
second half of the year, but that profits in this division, as in the cakes
and biscuits, had been helped by new products.

FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Fall in markka helps Outokumpu
back to the black

THIS year's steep fall in the markka helped Outokumpu, the Finnish
state-owned mining and metals group, to a FM133m (Dollars 23m) profit before
extraordinary items in the first eight months of the year, a sharp turnround
from a loss of FM62m in the same period last year.
But Mr Jyrki Juusela, chief executive, warned that metals markets were in
worse shape than had been predicted earlier in the year. 'In this market
situation, a continued positive development of the result depends on the
impact of measures taken to enhance efficiency and on improved
competitiveness due to exchange rate movements,' he said.
Group sales, at FM10.5bn, were ahead 29 per cent compared with last year's
FM8.15bn. Operating profits grew even more strongly, rising to FM706m from
FM384m. Profits after extraordinary items were FM391m, against a loss last
time of FM62m, due to a FM258m contribution from a debt restructuring in
Spain.
Sales were up in all four main divisions - base metals, copper, stainless
steel and technology products. But the growth in base metals sales from
FM2.3bn to FM3.07bn was inflated by the inclusion of OM Group of the US, now
96 per cent owned by Outokumpu, but which it intends to sell.
Outokumpu, 57.5 per cent owned by the Finnish government, postponed the
planned sale of OM group earlier this year because of poor market
conditions. But it said it now intended to complete the sale, by public
offering to US investors, by the end of this year. The sale is expected to
raise up to Dollars 170m.
Despite low prices, particularly for nickel and zinc, and losses in both
base metals and copper divisions, Outokumpu said it had begun work on a
FM1.8bn programme to modernise and expand its copper smelter and nickel
production line at Harjavalta in Finland.

FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Swedish forestry groups plan to
merge

<TEXT>
ASSI and Doman, two state-owned Swedish forestry groups, yesterday announced
plans to form Sweden's fourth largest pulp and paper company through a
merger.
The government said it favoured the move in principle, noting that the
combined group would be stronger and easier to privatise, but has taken no
final decision.
It would be one of three state-owned groups, alongside the power group
Vattenfall and the pharmaceutical company Procordia, which could be sold off
next year.
Assi and Doman have combined sales of nearly SKr13bn (Dollars 1.6bn) and
employ 11,000 staff, 4,000 of them outside Sweden. The aim is to effect a
fusion from the start of next year, 52 years after the companies were split
apart and after 30 years of on-off merger talks.
The two companies have no overlapping activities, and together would form a
financially strong group with an equity-assets ratio of some 80 per cent.
Doman is Sweden's biggest forestry owner, with 3.4m hectares of land, and
its biggest sawmill owner, with a capacity of 800,000 cu metres a year.
Assi, which acquires 35 per cent of its wood from Doman, is predominantly a
packaging group, producing 1m tons of packaging paper and board a year, and
640,000 tons of corrugated board and boxes.
It has operations in eight European countries, excluding Sweden.
Assi and Doman said they might eventually be interested in bidding for NCB,
another forestry group which is majority-owned by the state, but they
stressed there were no ongoing talks.
Forvaltnings AB Ratos, the investment group, has sold its shareholding in AB
Industrivarden for a total of SKr840m. The stake, about 10 per cent of
Industrivarden's capital, was bought by a number of Swedish and foreign
investors.

HOPEWELL Holdings, the Hong Kong property and infrastructure group
controlled by Mr Gordon Wu, yesterday announced a 25 per cent increase in
net profit to HKDollars 2.03bn (USDollars 172.5m) for the year ended June,
up from HKDollars 1.62bn previously.
The growth in profits came primarily from the sale of investment properties,
which contributed HKDollars 2.1bn to operating profit compared with
HKDollars 516m last time.
Hopewell plans to increase its dividend to 34 cents a share from 30 cents.
The group has been selling properties to fund its push into China and
south-east Asia. Phase one of its Guangzhou-Shenzhen superhighway is due to
open at the end of the year. The company plans to develop properties on
sites adjacent to the road, and construct a second stretch from Guangzhou to
the Macao border.
Hopewell plans to float off its power interests as a separately listed
company.

FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Caribbean groups look north for
investors - Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago can now trade in ADRs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE progressive deregulation of the economies and the financial markets in
Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica has triggered a second wave of corporate
forays into foreign territory.
The state-run Trinidad and Tobago Unit Trust has been granted permission by
the US Securities and Exchange Commission to seek investments through US
dollar-denominated portfolios. And the SEC has given the go-ahead for
Jamaica's privately owned Ciboney hotels group to trade its shares through
American depositary receipts on the US over-the-counter market.
Local bankers and stockbrokers say these forays into the US market would not
have been possible had not barriers to the movement of money been dismantled
and currencies floated, giving business the room and confidence to
successfully operate.
The SEC's green light for the Trinidad and Tobago Unit Trust will allow
international investors to buy into the government-sponsored Chaconia income
and growth fund. The 60,000 existing unit holders will benefit from a wider
investment brief. The minimum initial investment is USDollars 1,000 with
subsequent investments a minimum of Dollars 250.
'This will allow local and US investors to place in their investment
portfolio a US dollar-denominated security sponsored by a Trinidad and
Tobago entity, but operating under the strict surveillance and supervision
of the US regulatory system,' according to Mr Henry Sealey, executive
director of the United Trust.
The fund will have to conform to the operational, disclosure, reporting and
prudential requirements of US regulations which govern mutual funds in the
US. 'These requirements should make the prospective investors feel
comfortable and secure,' Mr Sealey said.
The fund will invest in US government securities, investment grade corporate
bonds, investment grade foreign government bonds, equity securities in US,
UK and Trinidadian companies, certificates of deposit and money market
funds.
'It is perhaps the giant step towards creating in Trinidad and Tobago a
dynamic and flexible financial institutional network necessary for the
establishment of the country as the financial centre of the Caribbean,' Mr
Sealey said.
Jamaica's Ciboney has jumped into the US over-the-counter market with an
issue of depositary receipts that will allow the company's shares to be
traded in the US. The receipts will be issued by Citibank.
Ciboney owns 90 per cent of the Ciboney Radisson Hotel and 34 per cent of
Sandals Ocho Rios Hotel, two of Jamaica's larger holiday resorts. The group
turned in after-tax profits of JDollars 77m (USDollars 3.46m) for the nine
months ended February 1993, against a profit of JDollars 12m a year earlier.
Mr Ivor Alexander, executive director of Ciboney, said the depositary
receipt registration could be upgraded to a full listing on a US stock
exchange. And he said that was a move that the company would eventually
consider.
'Although trading will take place on the over-the-counter market, Ciboney
can apply, in due course, for listing on a US stock exchange, and the
depositary receipt registration is a natural step in this direction,' he
said.
Mr Alexander said Ciboney, which is listed on the Jamaican stock exchange,
had 13,000 shareholders, and the 'broad-based public ownership' was
conducive to 'vibrant' trading of depositary receipts.
According to Citibank, trading in depositary receipts in the US in 1991 was
valued at USDollars 91.1bn, representing 4 per cent of the value of trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, Amex and Nasdaq.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOW Jones &amp; Co, the publishing group which owns the Wall Street Journal,
yesterday reported a 31.6 per cent improvement in third-quarter operating
income, which it said was due mainly to increased advertising revenues at
the Journal and its other business publications, writes Karen Zagor.
The company reported a 50.9 per cent rise in third-quarter net income to
Dollars 29.7m, or 30 cents a share, from Dollars 19.6m, or 19 cents, a year
earlier. Operating income rose to Dollars 67.9m from Dollars 51.6m. Revenues
rose 7 per cent to Dollars 468.7m from Dollars 438.1m.
The earnings were better than the 24 cents a share most analysts had
expected. On Wall Street, its shares climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to a 52-week high
of Dollars 35 1/4 .
For the first nine months, net income advanced 29 per cent to Dollars
100.4m, or Dollars 1.01, from Dollars 77.8m, or 77 cents, the previous year.
Earnings for the first nine months of last year have been restated to
reflect a one-time net charge of Dollars 10.8m for accounting changes.
Stripping out last year's charge, earnings rose 13.3 per cent in the first
nine months of 1993.

'fitness'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Frank Lorenzo, the controversial former head of Continental and Eastern
airlines, yesterday won a second chance to persuade the US authorities of
his fitness to start a new low-cost airline serving the US east coast.
The Transportation Department ordered an administration law judge to re-open
a hearing of Mr Lorenzo's application because the public interest required
'a fuller examination of the important questions raised in the case'.
Last month the judge recommended that Mr Lorenzo's application be turned
down, saying that although Mr Lorenzo's company, ATX, had financial backing
and management skills, it lacked the 'proper compliance disposition'.
The Transportation Department said the judge's decision 'insufficiently
develops such important issues as the managerial competence of key officers
and the relevance of past safety violations of carriers operated by ATX
principals'.
Mr Lorenzo's attempt to re-enter the airline business has created
controversy because of his bitter battles with the airline unions at
Continental and Eastern in the 1980s.

sales

COOLER weather in September drove US customers into stores and helped lift
same-store sales for many of the bigger US groups.
However, Dayton Hudson's Mervyn's stores fared poorly in the month, with
same-store sales dropping 10 per cent.
Dayton Hudson's warned that third-quarter earnings would fall short of last
year's results, reflecting price cutting and other measures aimed at
clearing inventory at Mervyn's. The department store division posted a 1 per
cent rise in comparable store sales in the month.
Sears, Roebuck, the Chicago-based department store group, maintained its
position as one of the best performers by posting a 10.3 per cent
improvement in comparable store sales in the five weeks to October 2.
Wal-Mart, the nation's top- selling retailer, notched up a 9 per cent rise
in same-store sales for September. Same-store sales for its Sam's Clubs,
however, fell 4 per cent.
Kmart, the discount store and specialty retailer, recorded a 7.2 per cent
rise in its domestic general merchandise stores, while overall, same-store
sales grew a more modest 3.9 per cent.
May Department Stores reported a 7.1 per cent rise in its main department
store division on a store-for-store basis.
Woolworth reversed its recent misfortune with a 1.4 per cent rise in
domestic comparable store sales in September. August comparable stores sales
fell 2.6 per cent after a 3.3 per cent drop in July.
JC Penney attributed the 4.6 per cent improvement it its comparable store
sales for September to cool weather in the north-west and north-east.
In contrast, Federated blamed warm weather early in the month for weak sales
of autumn season women's clothing. Comparable stores sales fell 0.7 per
cent. Itsaid September sales were measured against an unusual autumn season
in 1992 when South Florida sales were bolstered by post-hurricane buying.

FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Laidlaw's ADT stake in question
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ABRUPT departure of the chief executive of Laidlaw, the North American
waste services and school bus operator, has raised a question mark over the
Ontario-based company's stake in ADT, the international security services
and vehicle auction group.
Laidlaw is the biggest single shareholder in ADT, with a stake of 24 per
cent. Analysts predicted yesterday that the ADT investment will be an early
candidate for disposal as part of the shake-up which is expected to follow
the installation of a new CEO.
Mr Donald Jackson, 49, who has been chief executive for almost four years,
will sub-mit his resignation at a board meeting on October 13.
His departure follows what the company described as 'differences of opinion
concerning Laidlaw's strategic direction'. A spokesman declined to give
further details, beyond saying that Mr Jackson has returned to his native
province of Alberta for a few days.
A successor will be named after next week's meeting, indicating that someone
has already been chosen. Laidlaw is 47 per cent owned by Canadian Pacific,
the Montreal-based transport and resources conglomerate.
News of Mr Jackson's departure was generally welcomed in the investment
community. 'I don't think anyone is going to be disappointed that he's
leaving,' one New York analyst said. 'He always managed around the edges
without cutting into anything.'
Laidlaw's share price edged down 13 cents to close at CDollars 7.88 on the
Toronto stock exchange yesterday.
Mr Jackson earlier this year described Laidlaw's stake in ADT, which was
acquired under his predecessor Mr Michael DeGroote, as a 'portfolio
investment'.
ADT's businesses are completely different to Laidlaw's, which has reinforced
speculation that the Canadian company would be willing to part with its ADT
shares.
The new CEO is also expected to review Laidlaw's relations with Attwoods,
the UK-based solid waste handler in which it has a 35 per cent interest. It
is uncertain however, whether the review will result in the sale of the
Attwoods stake or closer links between the two companies. Laidlaw is the
third biggest solid waste and recycling operator in the US, while Attwoods
ranks fourth.
Laidlaw was one of Canada's fastest-growing companies in the 1980s, but has
suffered in recent years from the slump in the North American waste
management business and the legacy of its earlier rapid expansion. It
suffered a USDollars 33.6m loss in the three months to May 31, including a
Dollars 120m write-down on its solid waste business.
Fourth-quarter earnings are due to be published after next week's board
meeting. One analyst predicted that the company will do little better than
break even.

FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Liberty Media shares surge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Liberty Media, a cable television programming company, rose
strongly yesterday amid Wall Street speculation that its former parent,
Tele-Communications Inc, was in discussions to buy back the business.
Such a move could have important repercussions on the takeover battle for
Paramount Communications, since QVC Network, the television home shopping
company making a hostile Dollars 9.5bn bid for Paramount, is 22.5 per cent
owned by Liberty.
The re-acquisition would thus thrust TCI, a large and well financed company,
much more directly into the battle for Paramount, and could give additional
muscle to the bid by QVC, which is substantially smaller than Paramount.
The QVC bid is contending against a smaller, Dollars 7.5bn agreed bid for
Paramount from Viacom, the cable television company best known for its MTV
pop music channel.
No comment was immediately available from TCI on the rumours surrounding
Liberty, though the speculation could be useful to the two companies in
testing Wall Street attitudes to such a deal.
The role of TCI in the Paramount bid is already a matter of some
controversy. Viacom has launched a legal suit seeking to block the QVC bid,
alleging it is the latest in a series of efforts to monopolise the cable
industry by Mr John Malone, who is president of TCI and also heads Liberty.
TCI says the suit is frivolous but Viacom has also been suggesting the QVC
offer could face problems in Washington with anti-trust regulators.
TCI spun off Liberty in 1991, in part to deflect political criticism that
TCI was too powerful.
Shares in Liberty closed in New York yesterday 1 1/2 higher at Dollars 28
1/2, on top of a rise of almost 6 per cent on Wednesday.

FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: CPC re-enters S African market

CPC International, one of the biggest US and international food
conglomerates, yesterday said it was re-entering the South African market
following last month's call by Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African
National Congress, for a lifting of remaining sanctions against the country.
The company has signed an agreement with Tongaat-Hulett, the diversified
South African group, licensing Tongaat-Hulett to make and market CPC brands
such as Mazola corn oil, Skippy peanut butter, Ambrosia desserts and
Mueller's pasta for the South African market.
Tongaat-Hulett will set up a company called Tongaat Consumer Foods to make
and sell the CPC brands. This company will export CPC brands such as Knorr
soups, Hellman's mayonnaise and Marmite spread to sub-Saharan Africa.
First-year sales of Dollars 260m are expected.
CPC pulled out of South Africa in 1987 on political grounds. Its decision to
re-enter the market comes a week after Pillsbury, a US subsidiary of
Britain's Grand Metropolitan group, said it was bringing its Jolly Green
Giant and Pillsbury Doughboy brands to the South African market through a
joint venture with a local company called Foodcorp.
Mr CR Shoemate, CPC's chairman and chief executive, said: 'Now that Mr
Mandela has called for a lifting of remaining sanctions, we are eager to
return to South Africa, which was a very good market for us.'

<TEXT>
ABBOTT Laboratories, the US drugs and healthcare group, met market
expectations in the third quarter with a 15 per cent growth in earnings per
share to 38 cents, from 33 cents a year ago.
Sales advanced by 4.7 per cent to just over Dollars 2bn in the quarter, with
sales of drugs and nutritional products showing the strongest growth.
International sales, held back by the strong US dollar, grew by less than 1
per cent, to Dollars 769m.
Future sales are likely to be boosted by Food and Drug Administration
approval at the end of September for one of Abbott's leading drugs, Hytrin,
to be used in the treatment of a prostate gland condition. Analysts predict
this could eventually double sales of the drug, which reached Dollars 250m
in 1992.
R&amp;D spending rose to Dollars 225m in the third quarter, or 11 per cent of
sales, from Dollars 191m a year before. Net income in the period, at Dollars
316m, was up from Dollars 278m in the 1992 period, while nine-month
after-tax earnings rose 13 per cent to Dollars 1.01bn.

FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: 'Poor performers' list gives
ammunition to institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, RJR Nabisco and Bethlehem Steel were named
yesterday as being among the financially worst performing large US companies
in a survey which will provide powerful ammunition to institutional
investors involved in America's fast-growing corporate governance movement.
The movement seeks to improve corporate performance, and board
responsibility to investors, by pressing for changes in the framework
governing the running of companies. One of its main weapons is the
shareholder resolution, or 'proxy' vote, at a company's annual meeting.
The Council of Institutional Investors, an umbrella organisation for US
pension funds, whose members have more than Dollars 600bn in assets,
yesterday issued a list of 50 companies which it said had been identified by
an independent research agency as the poorest performing among America's
largest 1,000 companies, according to various investment criteria.
The list has been sent to council members together with a profile of each of
the 50 companies' attitudes towards various corporate governance issues,
such as executive compensation and the role of non-executive directors.
The information is meant to be used by funds in deciding their attitude
towards individual companies on corporate governance issues.
Ms Anne Hansen, deputy director of the council, stressed yesterday that 50
companies did not form a council-approved 'hit list'.
Some large US institutional investors already have their own
computer-generated financial screens which identify poorly performing
companies. The council's list is designed to disseminate such information
much more widely, among funds which could not afford to gather this data on
their own.
Other companies near the bottom of the list include Borden, the foods group,
the New York Times publishing company and Black &amp; Decker, the tools
business. The list was released at the council's semi-annual meeting of
members.
The list is an example of the increasing sophistication of the corporate
governance movement in targetting poorly performing companies.
Institutions have also been given more power to launch concerted action
against problem companies by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which a
year ago changed its rules to allow easier communication among investors.
However, in a change of tactics over the past year or two, shareholder
activists have been seeking more to negotiate change with companies in
private, before attacking them head-on with proxy contests.
A further demonstration of growing investor sophistication came this week
with the release by TIAA-CREF, the US teacher's fund which is the world's
largest pension system, of a comprehensive set of corporate governance
principles.
The fund believes this may be the first all-inclusive document of its kind
in the investment industry and it has sent copies to all 1,500 companies in
which it holds stocks.
An unusual feature of the document is its belief that a board should be
composed of people 'who reflect diversity of experience, gender, race and
age'.

FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Corning issues earnings warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORNING, the US glass and high technology group, warned that its
third-quarter results were falling short of expectations and earnings before
special charges could be 10 per cent lower than last year's 53 cents a
share.
The company intended to expand upon its previously announced restructuring
charges to cover the cost of reducing assets and overhead expenses. The
charge would total some Dollars 130m.
Mr James Houghton, the chairman, also said: 'Earnings before unusual items
for the full year are currently not expected to reach last year's level of
Dollars 1.66 a share.
'The principal shortfall,' he added, 'has been in the consumer products
business and other cyclically sensitive businesses, especially in Europe.'
In addition, the group's MedPath healthcare related business had seen a
slowdown in its rate of growth in recent months.
However, the group was enjoying a continuing strong performance in the
optical fibre business and improved operating earnings in information
display, science products and pharmaceutical services. Earnings from equity
interests were also expected to improve over last year.
He added that the group was aggressively responding by getting its cost
structure better aligned with current business conditions.
Corning expects to release its results on October 19.

FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: ITT to build resort complex in
Las Vegas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ITT, the conglomerate which owns the Sheraton hotel chain, said that it
planned to build a Dollars 1bn, 5,000-room resort complex in the Nevada
gambling city of Las Vegas on land being bought from Mr Kerk Kerkorian, the
billionaire investor.
The resort, to be built in phases over a decade, would be on a 35-acre site
next to the Desert Inn.
Sheraton bought the site for around Dollars 160m from Mr Kerkorian last
June.
ITT has been making a push into the booming US gambling industry. At the
time of the Desert Inn deal, Mr Rand Araskog, the group's chairman, said
that the group wanted to build a 'tremendous showplace' in Las Vegas to
rival the city's biggest and most profitable resorts.
Mr Araskog said that the company was undaunted by the fact that several
competitors were gearing up to open new theme resorts in the desert city.
The 5,000 rooms envisaged for the ITT resort would match the number at a
Dollars 1bn hotel-casino being built in Las Vegas by MGM Grand, which has
claimed that this will be the world's largest hotel.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, the Hollywood film studio owned by the French bank
Credit Lyonnais, announced the resignation of Mr Charles Meeker, president.
Mr Meeker's departure is the latest in a string of executive changes as the
French bank tries to resuscitate the studio before selling it. In July, the
bank ousted Mr Alan Ladd Jr, who had run MGM for more than two years, and
brought in Mr Frank Mancuso, former chairman of Paramount Pictures, to take
his place.
Credit Lyonnais took control of MGM and United Artists, its companion
studio, in 1992 after foreclosing on loans it made to Mr Giancarlo Parretti,
an Italian entrepreneur who bought the company in 1990 for Dollars 1.3bn.
The bank is trying to make MGM more attractive to buyers before 1997, when
it must sell the studio.
In August, Mr John Calley, a Warner Brothers executive in the 1970s, was
named head of United Artists Pictures, a studio which had been inactive for
years.

TREBRUK, a Swedish paper producer, yesterday took over Poland's heavily
indebted Kostrzyn pulp and paper manufacturer for 800,000 zlotys (Dollars
40).
The Swedish group will take over a 180bn zloty debt which is to be repaid in
annual tranches over the the next three years. It has promised to invest
Dollars 55m in the plant.
Last summer, a number of local creditors agreed to waive Kostrzyn 275bn
zlotys worth of debts to make the sale possible.
Trebruk's investment funding for Kostrzyn is to come from a Dollars 32m loan
from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) of which at
least Dollars 7m will be syndicated to Polish and foreign commercial banks.
Schroders, which advised the Polish government on the privatisation of the
Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, has established a wholly-owned subsidiary in
Poland.

FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Roche sees profits growth as
9-month sales rise 11%
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ROCHE, which has just surpassed Merck of the US to become the world's most
highly valued pharmaceutical group, has reported an 11 per cent rise in
sales in the first nine months of the year, to SFr10.7bn (Dollars 7.1bn).
The figures reflected an 18 per cent increase in sales in the third quarter,
more than double the growth rates achieved in the first and second quarters.
The Basle-based group said it expected a further good increase in sales in
the fourth quarter and added: 'Barring extraordinary circumstances, another
significant increase in group profit is expected for the current business
year.'
Roche shares, both the widely held genussschein or dividend right
certificates and the more closely held bearers, have more than doubled in
value in the past year, bucking the general trend of investors losing
enthusiasm in pharmaceutical shares because of increased political pressure
on drug prices.
Yesterday's midday prices valued Roche at SFr52.3bn. At Wednesday's close in
New York, Merck, the largest US drug group, was valued at Dollars 34.35bn or
SFr48.9bn. Glaxo of the UK stands at Pounds 19.9bn (Dollars 30bn).
Roche said all its divisions contributed to the growth in sales. Revenues of
the pharmaceutical division, which accounts for just over half the total,
soared 29 per cent to SFr1.9bn in the quarter.
The group said its drug sales had not been affected as much as those of some
competitors by political action against high prices in some countries.
Its products were heavily oriented to the hospital sector, where competitive
forces have long been strong in the US. In Germany, another country where
government pressure on drug prices has been stepped up, the emphasis has
been on doctors' prescriptions rather than hospital purchases.
Roche pointed out that its sales figures were flattered in the third quarter
by the weakening of the dollar against the Swiss franc.
It said its new products; Aurorix, the anti-depressant; Inhibace, for
treating high blood pressure and Neupogen for preventing chemotherapy
related disorders, showed particularly high growth rates.
The diagnostics division had a 19 per cent jump in sales in the third
quarter to SFr432m mainly due to the good performances of its US service
laboratories.
Sandoz, the Swiss pharmaceutical group, is hoping for double-digit profit
growth in 1993.
'Double-digit growth is likely, but certainly not on the same scale as we
had last year,' Mr Daniel Wagniere, the new chief operating officer, said.

China
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER four decades of being judged for their political worthiness, Chinese
will now be assessed for their creditworthiness under a consumer finance
joint venture launched yesterday by Orix, the Japanese leasing company.
The Shanghai-based venture, claimed to be China's first consumer credit
company, will introduce consumers to instalment payments, which have
generally applied only to housing purchase schemes and Communist Party
members.
'We will be judging Chinese consumers in the same way that we judge the
creditworthiness of Japanese consumers. We are aiming at a managerial class,
people who can afford consumer durables,' Orix said yesterday. 'There hasn't
really been a system of giving credit ratings to people in China, so this an
historic thing.'
Credit has been slow to be accepted in China, which first created its own
plastic, the Great Wall debit card, seven years ago and has done business in
awkwardly large wads of renminbi or people's money, the Chinese currency.
Shanghai Yintong Trust, which opens next month, is a joint venture between
Orix and three Chinese partners: the Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China, the Shanghai Number One Department Store, and Shanghai Friendship
Overseas Chinese Company. Orix and the bank each hold 41.67 per cent of
Yin-Xin Credit, as the company is known in short, while the other two
Shanghai partners share the remaining ownership. Yin-Xin has a registered
capital of Dollars 2.1m and an initial contract life of 20 years.
The Japanese company has a long-term vision of Chinese customers borrowing
from Orix-linked loan shops and carrying a pocketful of credit cards, if the
Chinese government approves. The credit will be provided through state-owned
and foreign-backed stores and the sales agents of the Japanese consumer
electronics companies.

</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PEUGEOT-CITROEN plunged into a net loss of FFr1.12bn (Dollars 193m) in the
first half of this year, the French car group announced yesterday. It said
there was no sign of a pick-up in demand.
The first-half loss compared with a FFr2.3bn net profit in the first six
months of 1992, and a total 3.37bn profit last year. The car group blamed
the sharp deterioration on the 17.3 per cent drop in west European car
demand in the first half of this year and the effects of currency
devaluations in Britain, Italy and Spain.
The adverse effect of currency variations between the first halves of last
year and of this year amounted to FFr1.28bn, Without this factor, the
results would have showed a slight profit, the group claimed.
Forecasting an industry decline of 16 per cent in sales in Europe this year,
Peugeot-Citroen said it would 'significantly' reduce output in the remaining
months of this year by short-time working and more permanent redundancies
'which it is no longer possible to delay further'.
The group. headed by Mr Jacques Calvet, has long criticised the European
Commission for giving Japanese car makers too free a run in the European
market. Yesterday's statement complained that the Japanese had increased by
nearly one percentage point their share of the European market.
However, the group noted it had maintained its 11.9 per cent portion of the
overall west European market in the first half, gaining market share in the
individual UK and German markets.
It pinned hopes on the newly-launched Peugeot 306 and the Citroen Xantia.
Group turnover fell by 11.4 per cent in the first half, less than the
general industry decline. The company said the decline was only 7.1 per cent
if the effects of currency devaluations, reducing the return in franc terms
of UK, Italian and Spanish sales, were factored out.
The downturn caused a deterioration in the group's cash flow to FFr5bn in
the first half of this year from FFr7.8bn in the same period of 1992. But
this enabled the group to cover 83 per cent of its FFr6bn investment in
plant and equipment in the first six months of this year, with net financial
debt standing at FFr17.5bn at June 30, 1993.

<TEXT>
PHILIPS of the Netherlands is to sell all its 430 video and music retail
stores in the US to Blockbuster, the US video rental and retail group, for
Dollars 150m.
The Dutch electronics group, which owns about 7.5 per cent of Blockbuster's
share capital, said that its shareholding could rise to about 10.5 per cent
if Blockbuster decided to pay for the stores with its own shares.
However, Blockbuster, the world's biggest video retailer, may choose to pay
cash, or in both cash and shares. The deal is expected to be completed by
the end of next month.
Philips said the disposal reflected the dominance of the US market by a
handful of large companies such as Blockbuster, which operates more than
3,250 video rental shops, most of them in the US. Philips said the US stores
would be better off in the long term under Blockbuster's ownership.
The 430 stores being sold belong to Philips' Super Club subsidiary, and they
account for about three quarters of Super Club's annual turnover of Fl 850m
(Dollars 465m).
After the sale, Super Club will consist of 320 video rental shops in the
Netherlands and Belgium.
The US stores are profitable, but those in the Benelux are loss-making.
The European market is more fragmented than that of the US, and Philips said
it had no plans to sell off the stores in the Netherlands and Belgium, where
Super Club is the market leader.

Premium income at Allianz is likely to rise by 14 per cent this year to
DM62bn (Dollars 36.5bn), Mr Mr Henning Schulte-Noelle, the group's chief
executive told Wednesday's shareholders' meeting, writes David Waller.
At the same time, the level of losses on the group's mainstream insurance

level, he said.
Total profits, which include earnings in interest income as well as the
technical result, would increase in 1993. Last year net profits dropped by
18 per cent to DM857.9bn while the technical result was DM1.68bn,
fractionally lower than in the previous year.
Barring unforeseen catastrophes in the final months of the year, this would
probably enable Allianz to pay the same level of dividend as last year, Mr
Schulte-Noelle said. The 1992 dividend was DM13.50 per share.

FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Allianz disclosure helps clear
fog - The unveiling of the insurer's financial might
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIANZ'S decision to disclose its holdings of 10 per cent or more in
financial and industrial companies is a milestone in the history of the
Munich-based insurer.
The significance of the move lies in what was disclosed - large stakes in 11
German financial and industrial companies and five foreign ones - and
because the disclosure was made at all.
It serves to flesh out the contours of Allianz's role as a dominant force in
German corporate and financial life, a position the company shares with the
Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank. It demonstrates the shareholdings
that criss-cross corporate Germany.
There has never been any doubt about Allianz's financial might. Its
portfolio of investments was worth DM184bn (Dollars 108bn) at book value
alone at the end of last year. As Mr Emilio Galli-Zugaro, the group's
Italian press officer, likes to joke, this would be enough to settle his
home country's national debt.
Some of the bigger equity holdings have been known for some time. For
example, the 25 per cent stake in Munchener Ruckversicherung, the world's
largest reinsurance company, 22 per cent in Dresdner Bank, Germany's second
biggest bank, and more than 20 per cent in the Bayerische Hypo-Bank, another
large bank.
The size of other stakes could previously only be guessed at.
Now we know that Allianz owns 14.4 per cent of the BASF chemicals group,
12.9 per cent of the RWE energy-based conglomerate, 14.8 per cent of the
Linde engineering group, 12.1 per cent of the Veba conglomerate, 16.9 per
cent of BHF-Bank. In total, Allianz revealed stakes worth DM8.9bn at the end
of June. This is only part of the portfolio, as only stakes of 10 per cent
or more were disclosed.
Allianz's tradition of secrecy was the hallmark of Mr Wolfgang Schieren, the
architect of the company's spectacular expansion over a number of decades.
Two years ago he stepped up from his position as chief executive to the
supervisory board, succeeded by Mr Henning Schulte-Noelle.
Mr Schulte-Noelle would have had to make the dislosures anyway: new
securities market legislation to be introduced in Germany next year is
likely to set a 5 per cent threshold for disclosure of share stakes,
compared with 20-25 per cent at present.
That is not to underestimate the new chief executive's break with the past
in releasing the information. Many big German companies are reluctant to
make such disclosures. Siemens revealed two large holdings last month only
after it lost a court case brought against it by Professor Ekkehard Wenger,
a well-known champion of shareholders' rights. (One of those holdings was a
3 per cent stake in Allianz.)
Prof Wenger had intended to pursue Allianz in the courts as well but was
silenced by Mr Schulte-Noelle's decision.
Allianz's decision to provide more information is not an isolated act. It
has to be seen in the context of moves by a number of large companies to
enhance their disclosures to shareholders.
The most obvious example was Daimler-Benz's move to publish its accounts
according to US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP), a
precondition of the mould-breaking listing of its shares on the New York
stock exchange earlier this week.
German banks have also taken steps to bring standards of disclosure up to
what Mr Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche Bank's chief executive, has jokingly
described as the standards of the 'civilised' (ie non-German) world.
German corporates are increasingly keen to engage in investor relations
activities. This was brought home again this week as retailer Kaufhof
Holding announced plans to establish a sponsored American depositary receipt
programme for its ahares in New York, thus becoming only the second
non-financial German company to woo US investors community in this way.
These developments show a decisive, if not all-pervasive , shift in the the
attitude of the management of big German companies to minority shareholders
 -predominantly the foreign institutional investors whose interests have not
tended to be paramount in German corporate decision-making.

FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Tax worries undermine Etam's advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Etam yesterday fell 11p to 258p in spite of doubled interim
profits as the women's wear retailer warned that uncertainty over tax
increases in the November Budget could affect trading in the second half.
'We are really quite cautious,' said Mr Keith Miles, finance director.
'November is the peak trading period for us and we have no idea how the
consumer is going to behave with the government making noises about tax
increases,' he said.
Etam is heavily weighted towards the second half. Last year it made some
Pounds 10m of its total Pounds 11m profit in the second six months.
On a brighter note, Mr Miles said the Pounds 1.21m rise in pre-tax profits
to Pounds 2.41m for the 28 weeks to August 14 reflected steady progress in
the restructuring programme begun some three years ago and better margins
through tight control of costs.
Pre-tax profits were also helped by the absence of a Pounds 461,000 charge
for withdrawing from lossmaking shops. Sales were 2 per cent higher at
Pounds 108.2m.
'Holding to our strategy is beginning to pay dividends,' Mr Miles said.
Two years ago management fought a fierce battle to retain control of that
strategy by opposing a hostile Pounds 121m bid from Oceana, a vehicle for
Foschini, the South African fashion retailer.
The group's three divisions enjoyed mixed fortunes. Snob, which targets
younger, more fashion conscious women, incurred a small loss. Mr Miles hoped
it would be back in the black for the full year after restructuring and
management changes.
The core Etam business, which caters for the 20 to 55 year old age range,
had shown progress, while Tammy, the children's wear operation, had done
'extremely well'.
The interim dividend goes up 6 per cent, from 1.65p to 1.75p, payable from
earnings ahead from 0.52p to 2p per share.

FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Rothmans and Vendome shares excluded from
indices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW SHARES to be issued by Rothmans and Vendome following the reorganisation
of the tobacco and luxury goods empire will not be included in the UK stock
market indices, including the FT-SE 100. However, both of SmithKline
Beecham's classes of shares - A shares and equity units - will remain in the
indices.
The FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices steering committee decided not to approve
a change to the rule on the definition of a UK company, proposed in
September, at a meeting on Wednesday.
The proposed change would have excluded both the new Rothmans companies and
the SB units, and caused an outcry from the companies and from stock market
practitioners.
Mr Mark Makepeace, secretary to the steering committee, said that the SB
units were a secondary line of a recognised UK company, and should therefore
be included.
The new Rothmans and Vendome capital structures each involve two companies,
of which one will be UK registered.
Mr Makepeace said that as investors will be able to choose not to take any
franked dividends - that is dividends on which UK tax has already been paid
 -it was hard to decide what percentage of the new companies would be
British, and the percentage could fluctuate.
Mr Hugh Collum, finance director of SmithKline Beecham, said yesterday he
was delighted that the units would remain in the indices, although he was
'disappointed that this anomaly has not been resolved once and for all'.
An adviser to Rothmans said the decision was 'eccentric'. Currently Rothmans
is regarded as a UK company for indices purposes. The two new companies will
encompass the businesses of the old Rothmans but will not be counted as UK
companies. The adviser said that when the reorganisation takes effect on
October 25, 'some people will feel they have to sell the shares'.
Fund managers compare their portfolios' performance to the stock market
indices.
One broker said, 'a lot of institutional fund managers are cross that
Rothmans is not in'. He added that, in the longer term, companies not
included in the indices became 'orphans' with few followers.

FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Prestwick tumbles as operating costs bite
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESTWICK Holdings, the printed circuit board maker, tumbled Pounds 3.97m
into the red in the year to July 31. There were profits of Pounds 91,000
last time.
In July the company's shares fell 12p to 29p when it warned of the loss.
Yesterday the shares shed 3p to close at 27p.
Although turnover improved to Pounds 36.1m (Pounds 30.4m) operating costs,
mainly in the group's smaller businesses, had risen dramatically, Mr Hugh
Laughland, chairman, said.
The pre-tax result was after an exceptional Pounds 1.5m charge, being
reorganisation costs and the loss on disposal of obsolete fixed assets. Net
interest payable rose to Pounds 652,000 (Pounds 456,000).
Mr Laughland said the group had been reorganised into three operating
companies, the benefits of which were beginning to show through. The group
had returned to profitability in September.
Losses per share amounted to 19.8p (0.5p) and there is no final dividend,
leaving the total for the year at 0.5p (1.5p).

FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Bulmer to distribute Amstel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMSTEL LAGER, one of Europe's top five selling beers, is to be distributed
for the first time in the UK next year by HP Bulmer, the cider maker.
Heineken, which owns the Dutch lager, has appointed Bulmer sole UK
distributor of Amstel, which will be launched into the take-home sector
early next year with an on-trade launch in 1995.
Amstel will be an important addition to Bulmer's expanding portfolio of
premium lager brands which already includes San Miguel, Red Stripe and DAB,
and further strengthens the cider market leader's position in the beer
market.
The new agreement will also help compensate Bulmer for the loss of the
Perrier and Buxton mineral water distribution agreement in the UK from March
next year.
Bulmer, which retains distribution rights to the fast growing Volvic mineral
water brand, lost the Perrier brands distribution agreement to Coca-Cola
Schweppes Beverages after Nestle's acquisition of Perrier last year.
Commenting on the Amstel agreement, Mr John Rudgard, Bulmer's chief
executive, said, 'Amstel is one of Europe's most famous beer brands with a
long established heritage.
'Heineken's choice of Bulmers as sole UK distributor and agent is an
endorsement of our marketing, sales and distribution skills and further
proof of our reputation and track record in the promotion of new brands in
the UK market.'
Amstel, which is sold in 60 markets worldwide, has been sold in the UK for
the past 12 months on a limited basis through a specialist off licence chain
and has reportedly achieved high rates of sale.

FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Higgs &amp; Hill back in black with Pounds
525,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGGS &amp; HILL, the construc-tion and property company, returned to the black
with pre-tax profits of Pounds 525,000 for the six months to June 30, an
improvement on full-year losses of Pounds 22m but a small decline from the
comparative figure of Pounds 673,000.
'Last year's losses were very much a function of the provisions we made
against both the housing land bank and the property portfolio. I would very
much hope that the provisions are behind us,' said Mr John Theakston, chief
executive.
He said Higgs had done 'some particularly good property deals' in the first
half of last year. 'Clearly it is difficult to buck the trend in some of the
markets but I do think we are in a strong position.'
Sales fell to Pounds 125.5m (Pounds 150.1m) with the decline in turnover
reflecting 'reduced workload in construction'.
Mr Theakston said construction margins remained under pressure. 'There has
been as yet no volume recovery and there is a lot of capacity out there.'
Housing sold 196 (128) units and prices were generally stable.
The company received Pounds 72,000 in interest compared with charges of
Pounds 500,000 last time as it reported a cash balance of Pounds 7.4m
compared with borrowings of Pounds 4.7m this time last year.
Higgs has a 50 per cent liability for borrowings of Pounds 15m held
off-balance sheet in a joint venture.
Net cash from operating activities fell to Pounds 2.72m (Pounds 15.2m) as
the company invested in land and made two small acquisitions. 'Our cash
position on the balance sheet will fall and we may draw down some borrowings
in the course of next year essentially as we re-invest back in the
business,' Mr Theakston said.
The board declared a maintained dividend of 1p, uncovered by earnings down
at 0.7p (1p) per share.

FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: FT-SE share indices changes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOLLOWING notice was issued yesterday by the FT-SE Actuaries Share
Indices steering committee:
The FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices steering committee has met to consider the
issue of the eligibility of the SmithKline Beecham units, new Rothmans units
and Vendome units in the indices following the proposal to change the rules
defining a UK company.
The committee has decided, pending a review, to make no changes.
SmithKline Beecham A shares and units will remain unaffected and, upon the
restructuring of Rothmans International and Dunhill, the new Rothmans and
Vendome units will not be admitted to the indices.
The steering committee felt that defining a UK company for index purposes
was a complex issue and reaffirmed its commitment to three important guiding
principles, namely:
Integrity of the indices as a benchmark of the performance of UK companies.
Objective and equitable treatment of all constituents.
Continuity and stability of index constituents.
In light of the complexity of the issues involved and the impending ruling
on foreign income dividends anticipated in the November budget, the steering
committee decided not to make changes to the rules governing the indices at
this time but to conduct a further review to assess the nationality
qualifications for membership of the UK indices and to examine the problems
posed by complex cross-border capital structures.
In the meantime the committee agreed to make no changes to the rules.
SmithKline Beecham units will remain in the indices as will the SmithKline
Beecham A shares which are unaffected by this issue.
Because Rothmans International's capital structure is undergoing significant
change, Rothmans International will no longer exist as a corporate entity
from October 25 and will, therefore, leave the indices on its restructuring
on October 22.
It has been decided that neither new Rothmans units nor Vendome units will
be admitted to the indices at that time.

FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Margins squeezed as Pochin's drops 38%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POCHIN'S, the building, plant hire and property group, saw pre-tax profits
tumble 38 per cent, from Pounds 2.46m to Pounds 1.53m, over the 12 months to
May 31.
The pressure on margins was underlined by the group's turnover, which,
boosted by a large design and build contract, expanded some 42 per cent to
Pounds 46.6m.
Mr Nicholas Pochin, chairman, said: 'The long awaited and much heralded
recovery is still a figment of the imagination within our industry.
'Capacity far exceeds demand resulting in extreme competitive pressure on
prices,' he said.
Nevertheless, investment and rental income was described as 'healthy'. The
group had retained all its tenants, Mr Pochin said. 'All things considered,
I believe that the pint pot is half full rather than half empty,' he stated.
The recommended final dividend is held at 21p for a maintained total of 29p,
covered nearly 3.5 times by earnings of 100.2p (167.6p) per share.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIED LEISURE, the ten pin bowling and night club group, yesterday
announced pre-tax profits up from a restated Pounds 2.21m to Pounds 2.94m
for the year ended July 16 1993.
However, the dividend is cut from 4.75p to 3p, with a reduced final of 2p
against 3.25p.
At the interim stage a profit fall of 25 per cent to Pounds 1.24m was
reported.
Of the figures, which were adjusted in accordance with FRS 3, turnover was
down from Pounds 27.8m to Pounds 24.8m, while excluding a figure for
wholesaling of Pounds 4.1m last year and Pounds 700,000 this year,
underlying turnover increased by 1.9 per cent.
Earnings per share rose to 5.22p (5.02p).
Mr William Davis, chairman, said that he was confident although trading
remained difficult throughout the company.
Bowling activities continued to expand but operating profits were down
reflecting pressure on discretionary spending.
Mr Davis said night clubs performed well and profits rose in a difficult
market. Some of the rights issue proceeds have been used to reduce
short-term debt with the effect that net borrowing has been halved to 25 per
cent.

FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Lamont doubles to Pounds 4.05m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Lamont Holdings climbed 15p to 384p as the Northern Ireland-based
carpets and textiles group announced almost doubled pre-tax profits in the
six months to June 30.
On turnover ahead to Pounds 65.8m (Pounds 52.6m), including Pounds 3.18m
(Pounds 4.25m) from discontinued operations - pre-tax profits jumped to
Pounds 4.05m (Pounds 2.18m). The figure would have been higher but for
exceptional charges of Pounds 643,000 relating to the disposal of the
computer division and an increase in net interest payable to Pounds 449,000
(Pounds 40,000).
Sir Desmond Lorimer, chairman, said the increased interest charge derived
from the assumption of the Pounds 7m debt of Rochdale-based Alexander Drew,
the furnishing fabric printer acquired for an initial Pounds 16.4m in April
1992.
The non-carpet textiles side had operating profits of Pounds 5.43m (Pounds
1.5m) on turnover of Pounds 38.1m (Pounds 25.5m). Sir Desmond said that some
Pounds 2.5m of the profits came from Drew.
In the carpets division, of which Shaw Carpets has been responsible for the
group's declining fortunes of late, turnover rose to Pounds 23.4m (Pounds
21.8m) and operating profits of Pounds 81,000 last time turned to losses of
Pounds 660,000 after Pounds 433,000 (Pounds 109,000) redundancy costs at
Shaw.
Shaw, which Sir Desmond said served the middle market, had lost market share
in a disruptive Pounds 4m capital expenditure programme. He expected it to
return to profitability in 1994. However, at the lower end of the market,
Northern Ireland Carpets had lifted sales 16 per cent.
Shifting the property interests into a joint venture - which retained Pounds
3m - had improved cashflow by some Pounds 6.5m and helped Lamont back to its
textiles core, where Sir Desmond said it would look for bolt-on
acquisitions.
The interim dividend is held at 3.5p, payable from earnings of 8.48p (5.61p)
per share.

Clarke, Nickolls &amp; Coombs, the property group, returned to the black in the
six months to June 30 with Pounds 141,000 pre-tax.
The outcome compared with losses of Pounds 218,000 at the same stage of 1992
and Pounds 47,000 for the full year.
The pre-tax line was struck after an exceptional provision of Pounds 25,000
(Pounds 126,000) against properties held for resale.
A charge of Pounds 346,000 covering withdrawal from property development
activities was taken below the line: it will be taken at the operating level
in the full year figures.
Earnings per share emerged at 0.68p (losses of 1.02p).

TJ HUGHES, the USM-quoted multiple discount store group, reported a 19 per
cent fall in profits before tax in its unseasonal first half to July 31.
The decline - from Pounds 143,000 to Pounds 116,000 - came on turnover ahead
9 per cent to Pounds 19.5m. Mr Gurth Hoyer Millar, chairman, said that
like-for-like sales growth was 2.3 per cent, reflecting poor weather in May,
June and July.
Nevertheless, gross margins were maintained despite 'aggressive pricing by
many national retailers,' he added.
Earnings per share emerged at 0.39p (0.16p) reflecting the redemption of the
preference capital in May 1992. The interim dividend is maintained at 0.75p.

FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Burn Stewart drops to Pounds 8.12m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Burn Stewart Distillers fell a further 3p to close at 108p
yesterday, continuing a steady decline since peaking at 160p in May last
year, as the company announced pre-tax profits down from Pounds 10.3m to
Pounds 8.12m in the 12 months to June 30.
The company, which floated its shares at 140p in 1991, showed sales down to
Pounds 38m (Pounds 42m).
Mr Campbell Stirrat, finance director, said Burn Stewart was changing its
mix of business away from the quasi-commodity bulk sales and attempting to
replace these with higher margin sales of cased bottles, some branded and
some 'own label'.
Mr Stirrat added that 'there was a bit of a decline in our export bulk
shipments with the balance being pressure on the cased business'. He said
trading would continue to be tough next year.
Bulk exports had fallen 23 per cent with average prices falling 34 per cent.
Cased sales rose 21 per cent and average prices fell 7 per cent.
Operating profits fell to Pounds 9.66m (Pounds 12.5m).
Interest charges fell from Pounds 2.13m to Pounds 1.54m reflecting the funds
raised from the flotation which hit the balance sheet part way through the
comparative period.
Gearing now stood at 72 per cent (36 per cent) a slight increase since the
year end when it was 70 per cent.
There was a cash outflow from operating activities of Pounds 4.8m, compared
with an inflow of Pounds 3.71m last time, as Burn Stewart increased stocks
to Pounds 50.5m (Pounds 41.8m).
On an annualised basis the total dividend is virtually maintained with a
final of 3.3p (3.33p) to give a total for the year of 5p. Earnings per share
fell to 9.53p (13.16p).

FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Malaysian dollar lifts plantations
companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE strengthening Malaysian dollar against sterling and improved results
from other plantation companies were factors in the interim figures of three
groups in which Rowe Evans Investments has substantial holdings.
Beradin Holdings reported pre-tax profits up 49 per cent at Pounds 248,869
(Pounds 167,386) on turnover of Pounds 450,624 (Pounds 371,215). Earnings
per share were 0.9p (0.59p).
The company said that the oil palm crop and the average price was similar to
last year but the Malaysian dollar had risen by 19 per cent. The results
included net investment income of Pounds 24,346 (Pounds 378).
Singapore Para Rubber Estates saw pre-tax profits of Pounds 215,919, a rise
of 79 per cent on the comparable Pounds 120,757. Turnover was Pounds 361,405
(Pounds 278,716). Earnings per share were 1.3p (0.77p). Net investment
income was Pounds 51,863, against a charge of Pounds 48,678.
Lower crops of oil palm and rubber were blamed by Padang Senang Holdings for
a fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 39,257 (Pounds 57,267) on turnover of
Pounds 210,940 (Pounds 224,847). Earnings per share were 0.36p (0.47p).
However, the fall was mitigated by the currency rise and higher investment
income of Pounds 30,932 (Pounds 6,361).

FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Rowland pressure forces delay to Lonrho
plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE APPOINTMENT of Lonrho's first non-executive directors for 20 years was
yesterday postponed for 12 days, as a result of pressure from Mr Tiny
Rowland, the international trading company's joint chief executive.
Mr Dieter Bock, the other joint chief executive who at the beginning of the
year acquired an 18.8 per cent stake in the company, had been hoping that
yesterday's board meeting would approve the appointment as non-executive
directors of Mr Steven Walls, chairman of Albert Fisher, the food group, and
Mr Peter Harper, a director of Hanson.
Mr Bock had recruited them as part of his campaign to transform Lonrho into
a more open and conventional company, in the hope that this would rebuild
the confidence of institutional investors in its shares.
However, the meeting refused to ratify the appointments. One of Mr Bock's
advisers said that Mr Rowland had insisted that all the executive directors
should meet Mr Walls and Mr Harper before the decision is taken.
'He (Mr Bock) was shocked', the adviser said. 'But the outcome should not be
seen as victory for Tiny. It was a draw'.
Mr Rowland has been opposed to non-executive appointments since the
'straight eight' directors tried unsuccessfully to remove him in 1973.
Lonrho's current board consists of 12 executives.
Lonrho put out a terse one sentence statement after the meeting, which
lasted all morning, saying that 'the board resolved to announce the
appointment of two non-executive independent directors by October 19'.
Though the statement does not name either Mr Walls or Mr Harper, Mr Bock
remains confident they will be appointed. He is planning to push through
other radical changes in the coming months, including a reduction in the
number of executives on the board, the appointment of one or two further
non-executives and a cut in head office staff.
Mr Rowland is expected to resist some of these changes.

FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: J Bibby plans Pounds 75m float-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J BIBBY &amp; Sons, the heavily-indebted conglomerate which is 79 per cent owned
by Barlow Rand of South Africa, plans to raise about Pounds 75m next year by
floating off its paper, agricultural and science businesses.
The move is designed to reduce Bibby's debt, incurred largely as a result of
the hostile Pounds 82m takeover in July 1992 of Finanzauto, Spain's only
Caterpillar distributor.
Since the takeover, the Spanish construction market has declined more
sharply than Bibby had expected.
Mr Richard Mansell-Jones, Bibby chairman and a board director of Barlow
Rand, said the construction market in 1993 was just 25 per cent the size it
was in 1991. 'It has hit the wall', he said.
The sharp decline has forced Bibby to incur higher than estimated costs to
restructure the lossmaking dealer.
Bibby reported net debt of Pounds 155m at the interim stage. Borrowings are
expected to be somewhat lower when the group reports in November.
Bibby is aiming to float the three divisions as one company in February
under the Bibby name through an offer for sale. The newly-listed group is
expected to be floated with some debt.
It will take some directors from the original company, but is likely to have
an independent non-executive chairman.
This division accounted for 48 per cent of Bibby's total of Pounds 416m
sales and about 52 per cent of Pounds 15m operating profits in the 26 weeks
to March 27.
The original company, containing the Spanish and Portuguese Caterpillar
operation and the Hyster materials business, will be renamed Stratford.
Barlow will retain 79 per cent of Stratford and 20 per cent of the new
Bibby.

FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Merivale Moore sees better trend
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After a year of advance Mr Grenville Dean, chairman of Merivale Moore, the
property company, felt able to give an upbeat message with the results for
the year to June 30.
'At the half year I was brave enough to indicate that the company was no
longer helplessly bleeding to death. I am pleased therefore to have some
good all-round news and progress to report, albeit not yet meriting the
ringing of bells.'
The shares rose 17p to 55p.
Net assets per share were 76.7p, against 77.3p a year earlier. Net debt was
cut from Pounds 49.3m to Pounds 29.6m, resulting in gearing of 283 per cent.
There was a pre-tax loss of Pounds 939,000, after an exceptional credit of
Pounds 2.36m relating to the settlement of a damages claim less exceptional
charges. The comparative loss was Pounds 23.6m, restated for FRS 3 and after
an exceptional charge of Pounds 19m.
Turnover was Pounds 24.3m (Pounds 30.3m). After a tax credit of Pounds 2.71m
(Pounds 1.14m) earnings per share were 12.9p (losses 164.5p).
Mr Dean thought the company had been able to achieve its initial objective
of rebuilding the balance sheet and now expected growth. Merivale had
started the present year in better financial health than the last and in a
'far more promising business climate'.

FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Lloyds Chemists ahead 40% - Advance to
Pounds 49.7m helped by full-year contribution from Macarthy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACQUISITIONS helped boost annual profits and sales at Lloyds Chemists, the
acquisitive retailer and healthcare wholesaler which yesterday reported a 40
per cent increase in the pre-tax result to Pounds 49.7m.
The shares closed 15p up at 284p.
Sales were 58 per cent higher at Pounds 802m for the year to June 30. This
was mainly because of the inclusion for the first full year of Macarthy, the
drugs wholesaler acquired in March 1992 for Pounds 92.5m, and other
pharmaceutical and veterinary drugs supply companies.
Mr Allen Lloyd, chairman, said the year had been 'very successful', with
progress in all divisions. He stressed the organic growth achieved by
Lloyds, particularly in the wholesale distribution division. The profits
increase had been achieved, he said, after a Pounds 6.3m government clawback
on the discounts given on generic drugs, and amid the 'most difficult
trading conditions in the company's history'.
While optimistic about growth in the current year, Mr Lloyd stressed that
the group would move ahead at a slower rate. Like-for-like sales in the
first 13 weeks were 6 per cent up in the chemists division, 3 per cent ahead
in drugstores, and flat in the healthcare chain Holland and Barrett.
Barclay Pharmaceuticals increased turnover by 49 per cent to Pounds 503m and
overall, the pharmaceutical division increased sales by 63 per cent to
Pounds 583m. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 8.4m higher at Pounds 11.4m.
The retail division, which includes the core chemists chain, the Holland &amp;
Barrett shops and Supersaver drug stores, showed a 14.5 per cent profit rise
to Pounds 44.9m. Sales were up 33.5 per cent at Pounds 569m.
Veterinary sales rose by Pounds 41.7m to Pounds 49.2m and profits from
Pounds 364,000 to Pounds 2.1m.
The interim dividend was increased from 4p to 5.25p for a total of 7.25p
(5.55p). Fully diluted earnings per share rose by 13 per cent to 26.84p.
COMMENT
Focus on the short term and Lloyds looks like a winner. There is more margin
improvement to come from acquisitions and the wholesale division is growing
impressively. Further out, however, one has to question the potential for
Lloyds' core chemists business, with little prospect of price improvements,
and a significant number of mature stores. Government restrictions will
cramp outlet expansion and the group seems to have snapped up most of the
attractive chains. Lloyds will also have to watch out for the inevitable
counter-attack in wholesaling from giants AAH and UniChem. Forecasts are for
pre-tax profits of Pounds 56m, leaving a prospective p/e of 9.6 times. While
there is likely to be room for improvement in the short term, the attraction
may fade in the longer term.

FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Ferranti warns of higher losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST-HALF losses at Ferranti International, the struggling electronics
group, are likely to be higher than in the corresponding period last year,
Mr Eugene Anderson, chairman, warned yesterday.
Mr Anderson told shareholders attending an extraordinary meeting, called
under Companies Act requirements because its net assets had fallen to less
than half its Pounds 96.8m share capital, that it was too soon to report on
the performance for the half year to September 30.
However, he added, 'we will incur another loss during the period which will
almost certainly be larger than the comparable loss last year'.
In the 1992 period Ferranti, which came close to collapse following the 1989
discovery of huge fraud in International Signal and Control, its US
subsidiary, managed to reduce its interim pre-tax losses to Pounds 10.9m.
Mr Anderson, who was brought in to try and turn Ferranti around following
the ISC fraud, told shareholders that despite the technical requirement to
call the meeting, the board recommended that no action should be taken to
implement a reduction in capital at this time.
Instead, he said the company would continue to focus on its priorities of
strengthening the balance sheet by equity injection or through strategic
partnership while seeking to win new orders.
'Liquidity continues to be painfully tight, making supplier relationships
more difficult', Mr Anderson said. He added that 'to alleviate this problem
we have continued to seek an equity injection or a strategic partnership'.
Although the chairman said the group had continued to be successful in
winning new orders and ended August with an order book of Pounds 178m and
outstanding bids for Pounds 740m of new business, he said the group was
still waiting for confirmation of several large orders.
The shareholders, who met in London, overwhelmingly supported the proposal,
although some were critical of the management's performance.

FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Galliford cuts dividend to 1p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GALLIFORD, the Midlands-based contractor, has cut its total dividend from
4.3p to 1p as part of a plan to expand its housing business which could see
its long-cherished net cash position become debt over the next three years.
The company announced this at the same time as revealing pre-tax profits
sharply down from Pounds 3.03m to Pounds 412,000 for the year to June 30
1993.
Mr John Livingston, finance director, said: 'In the short term it would be
difficult to make adequate net margins on construction so we intend to
increase profits by expanding private housing building activities. We
believe the housing market will see steady, undramatic, improvement which we
want to exploit.'
The company would spend up to Pounds 4m on land this year and about Pounds
2m on development.
Galliford sold 170 (156) housing units in the year to June 30 at an average
price of Pounds 53,000 (Pounds 50,000) and expects to exceed 200 in its
current year with a target of 500 in three years time.
Mr Livingston said the company would countenance 'modest gearing' as well as
drawing cash from future retained profits from other businesses to achieve
its target.
Sales were Pounds 217.2m (Pounds 213.2m). Profits were hit by losses of
Pounds 512,000 (profits of Pounds 393,000) in specialist contracting
stemming from National Power's Drax project. These are now subject to claim.
Pre-tax profits in contracting have declined over the last three years,
falling to Pounds 408,000 (Pounds 1.62m) on sales of Pounds 127.4m (Pounds
128.9m).
A recommended final dividend of 0.5p (3.35p) gives a total of 1p (4.3p),
uncovered by earnings of 0.33p (2.37p) per share.

FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: MR-Data expands 6% to Pounds 8.8m - Three
acquisitions bolster full-year profits and turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACQUISITIONS helped MR-Data Management, the data transcription and document
image processing group, report a 6 per cent increase in annual pre-tax
profits yesterday.
The surplus in the year to June 30 increased from Pounds 8.23m to Pounds
8.76m on turnover up 21 per cent to Pounds 40.8m (Pounds 33.7m).
Earnings per share were unchanged at 10.6p but the final dividend is
increased to 3.46p, making a total up 20 per cent at 5.19p (4.32p).
At the operating level the group, which changed its name from Microfilm
Reprographics earlier this year, reported profits of Pounds 8.09m (Pounds
7.3m), bolstered by Pounds 900,000 from three acquisitions which also added
Pounds 4m to turnover.
The three acquisitions were Atlanta-based Fort Knox Secured Data which
provides high security storage for paper and magnetic media and was acquired
in July last year; the UK COM Service Bureau of NCR which was acquired in
September last year, and Taywood Data Graphics which was acquired from
Taylor Woodrow in January.
Mr Michael Elliott, who took over as chief executive in July, said trading
conditions had continued to be difficult and that it was only recently that
the group had begun to see more promising signs of an upturn in the level of
orders.
Mr Elliott said that a new divisional structure had been introduced to
provide a more focused approach to business development. He added that all
the businesses traded profitably during the year.
Despite the acquisitions and capital expenditure totalling Pounds 6.7m the
group ended the year with Pounds 6.88m in net cash, down from Pounds 8.5m a
year earlier.
COMMENT
Despite a relatively lacklustre performance MR-Data's performance is still
underpinned by long term contracts which are still highly profitable and
should benefit from the recovery in the US and UK. Some of the acquisitions,
and developments in the software division, will take the group into new and
potentially fast growing businesses like Geographic Information Systems. The
management team is a little thin following recent resignations including
that of the finance director, although no sinister implications need be
drawn and the issue is being addressed. Pre-tax profits of about Pounds 10m
look possible this year producing earnings of 12.8p and a prospective p/e of
17.

FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Shares in Campari fall on Pounds 3.1m loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reflecting the impact of recession, devaluation of sterling and delivery
problems with suppliers, Campari International, the designer and marketer of
leisure wear, incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.1m for the first half of
1993, against profits of Pounds 1.03m.
Mr Christopher Cheng, chairman, said that against the background of a
hostile trading climate in the majority of the group's markets 'we do not
anticipate a return to profitability until the second half of 1994 at the
earliest'.
The shares reacted strongly and closed 49p down at 93p.
There is no interim dividend - last year's was 3.25p - and directors are to
delay a decision on any payment until preliminary results next March.
Turnover was Pounds 20m (Pounds 18.73) but Mr Cheng explained that after
eliminating currency translation effects and the impact of sales by new
operations in France and Italy on a like-for-like basis it was 6 per cent
lower.
Losses per share amounted to 29.01p (7.27p earnings).
Mr Cheng stated that profit margins were squeezed by the continuing impact
of recession, particularly in the UK where the group was unable to pass on
cost increases arising from the weakness of sterling.

FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Martin Intl shares dive following interim
loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES OF Martin International Holdings tumbled 38p to 49p yesterday after
the garment manufacturer and Marks and Spencer supplier reported a first
half loss and a sharply reduced interim dividend, writes Graham Deller.
And Mr Michael Kidd, chairman, warned that following closure costs,
estimated at Pounds 500,000 in the second half, the group was likely to
incur a small loss for the full year.
Results for the six months to June 30, compiled under FRS 3, showed a
pre-tax deficit of Pounds 270,000, against a restated profit of Pounds
142,000. Turnover was little changed at Pounds 33.9m, including Pounds 1.22m
from discontinued operations.
Losses per share deepened to 1.6p (0.2p) and the interim dividend is cut
from 1.7p to 0.4p.
Mr Kidd said the outcome 'illustrated the general pressure on margins in
what remains an extremely competitive trading environment throughout the
world'.
The UK operations produced a 'disappointing' result, he said, although
business with Marks and Spencer progressed well and underwear and leisure
wear achieved a 'good' profit.
Overseas operations were adversely affected by a unexpected reduction in
demand from customers in the US and the Middle East, factors that will also
affect the second half.

FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Renishaw down 21% to Pounds 7.14m as
foreshadowed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENISHAW, the engineering group which makes specialist measuring equipment,
reported a 21 per cent drop in pre-tax profits for the year to June 30 as
its main markets remained deeply affected by recession.
The profits fall, from Pounds 9.09m to Pounds 7.14m, foreshadowed in a
warning three months ago, left the shares 5p down at 275p.
Earnings per share fell from 13.1p to 10.3p and the recommended final
dividend is held at 4p for an unchanged total of 6.5p.
Sales grew 10 per cent to Pounds 48m but almost all the increase was due to
the effect of currency translation.
The group confirmed that had it sold foreign currency when it received it,
rather than hedging forward with sales ahead of the devaluation of sterling
in September last year, pre-tax profits would have been Pounds 1.3m higher.
Mr David McMurtry, chief executive, said sales in the first quarter of this
year were ahead of last year but trading remained difficult.
At the operating level, before net earned interest of Pounds 2.2m (Pounds
2.4m), profits were down from Pounds 6.69m to Pounds 4.94m, representing a
slide in the operating margin to 10.3 per cent (15.2 per cent).

FT  08 OCT 93 / An offer that investors could scarcely refuse: The pricing
of the first French privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN and JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
French economy ministry officials could barely disguise their glee when they
announced on Wednesday that the FFr8.3bn (Pounds 960m) institutional tranche
of the Banque Nationale de Paris share sale had attracted applications for
FFr100bn of shares in just two days, and was closing a week ahead of
schedule.
The reason for BNP's appeal is obvious - the offer price. Analysts had been
expecting a share price of between FFr250 and FFr275 for BNP. But the
government pitched it at only FFr240, valuing BNP, one of Europe's biggest
banks, at FFr43bn.
BNP is the first of up to 21 companies scheduled for privatisation. The
issue will set the tone for the other sales. Yet the closure of the
institutional issue prompted the accusation that the government was
over-cautious.
'Is the price too low? Of course it is,' said Mr Thierry Tamers, head of
North American equity sales at Baring Securities in Paris. 'But it was not a
financial calculation, it was political scheming. The Balladur government
can't afford to risk its first privatisation being a fiasco.'
There are several reasons to believe the price was set too low. The most
obvious is that the only tradeable shares in BNP, the non-voting Certificats
d'Investissements, yesterday closed at FFr282. As it will cost CI holders
FFr5 to buy voting rights, this implies a share price of FFr287.
Second, the strength of capital flows from US and Japan means that a more
tightly priced issue would still have attracted interest. 'It was not so
much under-valuation as the fact that there is a lot of capital around,'
said Mr James Alexander, an analyst at Daiwa.
Third, BNP shares some characteristics with banks which have drawn investor
interest in the US and the UK. That is, it is suffering from asset quality
problems and indifferent management, but has strong recovery potential.
Evidence is provided by the pricing of the equity at 78 per cent of net
asset value, compared with a 120 per cent valuation for Societe Generale,
which is regarded as better run.
According to this view, the installation of Mr Michel Pebereau as chairman
will allow BNP to release some of the value trapped in its large franchise.
Reforms such as cost-cutting and refocusing the business should combine with
falling provisions to allow a sharp recovery.
However, other analysts argue that the government would have been unwise to
price the issue closer to the level implied by the CI value. One reason is
that BNP's share price could yet fall. The second is that there are larger
questions about privatisation at stake.
The rally in bank shares this year might come to grief. Investors have
already discounted considerable earnings recovery, and some analysts regard
French banks as over-priced compared with those of other countries.
Shares of banks such as National Westminster, in the UK, and Citicorp, in
the US, have rallied as investors have calculated the potential recovery in
earnings, as burdens of bad debt fall away. These 'normalised' earnings
levels - expected in two or three years - are similar to late 1980s figures.
The ratio of share prices to bank earnings in France are already more
demanding than in some other European markets. The multiple for BNP CIs last
year was 17.4, compared with an average multiple for Spanish banks, which
have performed better than French ones, of 7.7.
This implies that French bank shares are at least capable of a correction
later in the year. This is particularly true given the poor state of the
French banking market, which is suffering heavily from poor asset quality in
the recession.
The government's need to allow a suitable margin is made more pressing by
the fact that investors in future privatisations will be able to see BNP's
fortunes. 'The government isn't an ordinary seller,' said Mr Thierry
Aualgnon, the Tresor official in charge of privatisation. 'It needs to
maximise the revenue from its entire programme.'
The Balladur government badly needs the income from its proposed share sales
to stem its rising budget deficit. Official estimates suggest the deficit
will reach FFr317bn this year. However, private sector economists suspect it
could go higher. Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, chief French economist at Salomon
Brothers, expects this year's deficit to grow to FFr345bn.
The government is also aware that it faces competition from other European
privatisations - the estimated total value is Dollars 100bn.
Finally, it may have been concerned about public ambivalence towards share
ownership. France's last privatisation drive was halted by the October 1987
crash. The misgivings this caused helped cut the number of individual
investors from 5.5m to 4.5m.
This helps to explain why the administration opted for a safe BNP price. But
some analysts are concerned that investors will have been encouraged to
expect similarly low prices for other issues, thereby raising the risk of
reduced returns.
'Everyone loves a great deal,' said Baring's Mr Tamers. 'But the BNP issue
might have set a bad precedent in that the market may expect sharp discounts
for the other privatisations.'

FT  08 OCT 93 / BAe to sell Dutchbuilder for Pounds 180m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace has agreed in principle to sell Ballast Nedam, its
Dutch-based construction subsidiary, to the Dutch dredging company Boskalis
for around Fl 500m (Pounds 180m).
The transaction is effectively a reverse takeover, as Ballast Nedam is more
than twice as large as Boskalis in terms of turnover.
Boskalis, the world's leading dredger, will finance part of the acquisition
through a Fl 300m share issue. It gave no details but said the tie-up with
Ballast Nedam was expected to lead to higher earnings per share in coming
years, provided that market conditions remain stable.
The deal ends a period of uncertainty about the future of the Dutch
construction company. BAe wanted to dispose of the business as part of
efforts to restructure and focus on core activities.
Last month, Ballast Nedam and Boskalis disclosed that they were looking into
'possibilities of co-operation', including the option of a full equity
link-up between them. Earlier, Ballast Nedam's management had attempted to
arrange a flotation, but BAe objected, prompting the Dutch company's
chairman to resign. The sale to Boskalis, which is listed, will fulfil
Ballast Nedam's hopes of gaining access to the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.
BAe acquired Ballast Nedam in 1987 for Dollars 90m (Pounds 59m), mainly for
its expertise in modernising airfields in Saudi Arabia, where BAe had won an
order for Tornado aircraft. The three companies said there was room for
continued co-operation.
BAe said the sale was not expected to lead to an extraordinary book gain
because the proposed price was roughly equal to Ballast Nedam's asset value.
The Dutch companies, both of which are active abroad, are largely
complementary, with Boskalis concentrating mainly on dredging and marine
construction and Ballast Nedam specialising in civil as well as marine
construction. Boskalis had 1992 turnover of nearly Fl 1bn, slightly less
than half of Ballast Nedam's sales of Fl 2.4bn.
Ballast Nedam has a strong reputation in the Middle East with the
construction of the 25km causeway linking Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Tiphook down 30% after warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Tiphook, the container leasing and transport rental group, fell
nearly 30 per cent yesterday after the loss-making group warned that it
would breach its banking covenants.
The UK-based group, which currently has debts of Pounds 1bn and gearing of
more than 470 per cent, is forbidden by articles of association from
allowing gearing to exceed 500 per cent. Shareholders will be asked to
approve new borrowing limits, and the company said it had begun to negotiate
new facilities with its bankers.
The announcement, combined with a warning that Tiphook expected to make a
small loss in the six months to October 30, was the latest in a series of
shocks from the former stock market star. These have caused its market value
to collapse from Pounds 630m in 1991 to Pounds 186m at last night's close.
This latest setback calls into question the future of Mr Robert Montague,
Tiphook's executive chairman, who founded the group in 1978. It now operates
in 38 countries and has the world's second-largest fleet of containers -
after Genstar - and Europe's biggest fleet of trailers.
The company insisted that all the advisers were sticking by Mr Montague, who
was criticised recently for receiving a pay rise from Pounds 842,000 to
Pounds 851,000 in the year to end-April, a period when changes in
accountancy policy caused Tiphook to plunge into net losses of Pounds 66.5m,
against a retained profit of Pounds 31.7m in 1992.
Last month directors told a highly critical annual meeting that they
intended to take pay cuts of between 25 and 30 per cent this year.
Analysts said the need for the group to obtain shareholder approval of new
borrowing limits at an extraordinary general meeting would give investors an
opportunity to depose Mr Montague, if they wished. The banks, which are
negotiating new facilities, could also demand his departure.
Since 1991 the proportion of the group's equity held as American Depositary
Receipts has risen from 2 per cent to more than 50 per cent. Several UK
institutional investors lost patience with Tiphook's record of seeing sharp
movements in its share price before announcements were made to the market.
Utilisation of Tiphook's containers has not recovered as quickly as the
group had hoped, and rental rates have fallen slightly.
Moody's, the US credit rating agency, said last night it might downgrade the
rating on about Dollars 700m (Pounds 463m) of the group's debt from Ba-2,
which is already a so-called speculative grade.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Postel gains support for Greycoat rescue bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POSTEL, the UK's largest pension fund, was last night closer to clearing the
most serious obstacle in the way of its Pounds 120m rescue bid for Greycoat,
the property company.
With holders of Greycoat securities descending on London for today's crucial
votes on the rescue plan, Goldman Sachs said it would use its 8 per cent
holding of Greycoat preference shares to vote in favour of Postel's bid.
Postel has faced the fiercest resistance from holders of preference shares,
one of four classes of bond and shareholders which will vote on the
controversial offer today. Some preference shareholders have said the Postel
offer greatly undervalues Greycoat's properties.
Greycoat denies the valuation claim and says rejection of the bid would
probably lead to liquidation and a fire sale of assets.
For the deal to be approved, Postel will require 75 per cent of the vote
from holders of the preference shares, the zero coupon bonds and the
so-called Britannic House bonds, and a straight majority from ordinary
shareholders. If all four classes agree, Postel will take control of a
company acclaimed for the daring and quality of its developments in the
1980s, if not for its finances.
As hopes faded of a last-minute intervention from another bidder, Mr
Alastair Ross Goobey, Postel's chief executive, turned up the heat on
Greycoat's dissenting shareholders. In a letter to Mr Geoffrey Wilson,
chairman of Greycoat, he said Postel would not increase or amend any part of
its offer.
Earlier in the day Salomon Brothers said holders of more than 75 per cent of
the Britannic House bonds supported Postel.
Until yesterday Goldman Sachs had not said why it had built its preference
share stake after Postel announced its bid, nor how it intended to vote.
Gruss Partners, of the US, with 14 per cent of the prefs, had still not
shown its hand.

FT  08 OCT 93 / New classification for companies in FT-SE indices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPREHENSIVE review of the companies and sectors which make up the FT-SE
Actuaries Share Indices has been undertaken for the first time since 1970.
As a result 303 companies have been reclassified and a number of new
economic groups, industry sectors and sub-sectors created.
The new system will take effect from January 4 next year, replacing two
existing classification methods, the FT-Actuaries and Stock Exchange
indices.
Mr Nicholas Fitzpatrick, a partner of Bacon &amp; Woodrow, the actuaries, who
chaired the classification committee for the new model, said the system was
universally accepted by fund managers.
He said it was intended to provide a service to investors by grouping
companies together in homogeneous industry sectors and sub-sectors.
Companies were informed of their new classifications by letter yesterday.
RTZ, Rank Organisation and Inchcape, three large companies thought to be
unhappy about the new sectors to which they have been assigned, each said
they were considering the implications of their moves.
The review takes account of the decline in the UK's industrial base, the
growth of service industries and the birth of a utilities group as a result
of the government's privatisation programme.
For the first time, the ground rules on which classification decisions are
made have been published. Companies are placed within sub-sectors on the
basis of the derivation of their published, audited profits. The rules say
'no changes in industry classification will be made on the basis of promises
of action or assertions by directors'.
Conglomerates have been defined as companies with at least three distinct
activities, none accounting for more than 50 per cent of profits, and each
contributing more than 10 per cent. Mr Fitzpatrick said the committee had
'at last found a way of getting BTR and Hanson in the same pot'.
All 2,375 listed and USM-quoted companies have been pigeonholed. Companies
have until October 31 to appeal if they feel mis-classified, and appeals
will be heard in November. After that changes will be considered quarterly.
Once the final list has been produced, histories of sector performance will
be back-dated to 1985.
The system has three tiers:
Seven economic groups, which replace the six existing groups. Out goes
'capital goods', which had been shrinking as a proportion of the total. New
groups include 'mineral extraction' and 'utilities';
40 instead of 35 sectors. Health and household and oil and gas, which had
become large sectors, are each divided into three. Others have been merged,
some have disappeared, and some been created: to be reviewed annually;
76 rather than 77 sub-sectors, with 18 new sub-sectors and 38 renamed
sub-sectors. Editorial comment, Page 19; New classifications, Page 42;

FT  08 OCT 93 / Thatcher role alleged in arms-for-Iraq affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LADY THATCHER was drawn into the arms-for-Iraq affair yesterday when the
Scott inquiry disclosed evidence for the first time that as prime minister
she appeared to have approved the export of British machine tools used to
build up the Iraqi military capability.
A memorandum in December 1988 from a senior Whitehall official to Lord
Trefgarne, the then minister for defence procurement, reported that the
government had approved the export of 50 lathes which intelligence had
indicated were to be used for making shells and missiles.
'The prime minister agreed that in order to protect the intelligence source
the licences already granted should not be revoked,' said the memorandum,
which was written by Mr Allan Barrett, a Ministry of Defence official.
The Scott inquiry obtained the document from the Ministry of Defence, which
with the rest of Whitehall and ministers has been told by Mr John Major, the
prime minister, to co-operate fully.
Lord Justice Scott's office said last night that the involvement of the
former prime minister had not been referred to in any of the documents
provided by her advisers or Downing Street. Lady Thatcher, Mr Barrett and
Lord Trefgarne are to be pressed to provide an explanation.
It also emerged that the document was not made available by Whitehall during
the trial last year of three executives of Matrix-Churchill, the Midlands
based machine tools company whose exports are the subject of the memorandum.
The three executives, one of whom, Mr Paul Henderson, had worked for British
intelligence, were charged with breaching export controls. Their defence
argued that they had done so with the full knowledge of the government. The
trial collapsed following an admission by Customs and Excise that they could
no longer sustain a case against them.
Mr Kevin Robinson, solicitor for Mr Henderson, said last night: 'I cannot
understand why the document was not disclosed at the trial.'
Mr Henderson described the apparent withholding of the document from his
trial as 'disgraceful'. He said that in February 1989 his company had
exported further machine tools for munitions. A third batch was approved
just before the invasion of Kuwait.
Lady Thatcher is due to give evidence to the Scott inquiry in early
December.
The MoD said last night it had no comment as to why the document had not
been available to the Matrix-Churchill trial.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Irish PM welcomes peace initiative by Hume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRISH government responded positively yesterday to the peace initiative
of Mr John Hume, leader of Northern Ireland's Social Democratic Labour
party, and Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader.
The initiative, launched 11 days ago in Belfast, is aimed at ending the
paramilitary violence in Northern Ireland.
Mr Hume spent almost two hours explaining the initiative to Mr Albert
Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, and Mr Dick Spring, the foreign
minister.
Mr Reynolds said afterwards: 'John Hume gave us a document setting out the
broad principles, which all of us agree could be a just and a lasting peace
process to be established and worked upon. We will evaluate what we have
heard today with our colleagues in government and we will consider how, in
our discussions with the British government, this can contribute to the
building of a peace process.'
Government officials confirmed that the document was the same report
referred to by Mr Hume and Mr Adams in their joint statement launching the
peace initiative. The foreign ministry said: 'We will certainly contemplate
discussing it with the British government as part of a wider process leading
to a settlement (on Northern Ireland)'.
Mr Reynolds said the document itself would not be presented to the British
government.
Mr Hume said: 'I gave a very detailed briefing on a strategy for peace that
I believe now exists and I am quite happy with the (government) response.'
Neither he nor the Irish government is likely to release any further details
of the initiative. Mr Hume appealed to the media for patience, saying: 'The
less speculation and more confidentiality the better. As they showed in
Norway (in the Middle East peace process) secrecy helped create agreement
there.'
The Northern Ireland Office did not wish to comment, but Mr Ken Maginnis,
deputy leader of the Ulster Unionist party, was deeply suspicious of the
secrecy surrounding the initiative.
'Is it reasonable that we should be expected to react positively on the
basis of some hypothetical document that in fact was probably cobbled
together on the way back from John Hume's trip to America?' he asked.
The Irish cabinet is to discuss the proposals next Tuesday. Mr Reynolds said
on Wednesday he believed any negotiated settlement should be put to a
'simultaneous' referendum north and south of the border, but he reaffirmed
the Unionists' effective right to veto any new constitutional arrangement
for the province, as established in the 1985 Anglo-Irish treaty.

FT  08 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Tiphook
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tiphook's sunny disposition has let it down once more. Less than six months
ago the company was cheerily brushing away worries that it might breach its
banking covenants. Now those limits stand at risk and gearing is likely to
exceed the level allowed by the company's articles of association. Nor are
its constraints particularly conservative. Tiphook's main covenants are set
at 1.25 times interest cover and gearing is already permitted to rise to 500
per cent. Loading up the truck with debt has certainly exacerbated the
company's difficulties, but its high capital spending is not just a thing of
the past. Tiphook recently committed itself to buying Pounds 378m of
trailers over the next five years.
From now on, cash flow rather than reported profits will determine the
company's fate. Banks may decide that renegotiating the loan agreements is
preferable to more drastic action, but a much less expansive management
style will be needed to contain the situation. Working off Tiphook's
mountain of debt will also need the kind of recovery in Europe which is all
too clearly absent at present.
In the near term the dividend must look vulnerable, removing one prop from
the share price. The net assets per share are an apparent comfort, though
the prospect of selling large numbers of trailers and containers in the
current market is hardly appealing. There is a good business inside Tiphook,
but there remains a risk that the weight of debt will break its axle.

FT  08 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: French privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whether BNP's offer price is objectively cheap or not, both French private
investors and international fund managers clearly seem to think so. The
scramble for BNP's shares will help create a suitably frenetic psychological
climate. Tax benefits and loyalty shares will provide more material
incentives for domestic investors. Foreign fund managers may grumble they
have been unable to buy meaningful shareholdings. But it was always the
government's intention to treat them mean and keep them keen for subsequent
issues.
The French government is either being astonishingly nave or extremely
sophisticated in this approach. Arguably, giving away too much premium now
will only depress the prices achievable for forthcoming issues. But
maximisation of revenue is not the government's sole priority. It has
broader aims to encourage wider share ownership and develop France's
securities markets. Moreover, it could reckon that what it loses now can be
made up later, in the same way as the UK government achieved a strong price
for the third tranche of BT shares.
The trouble with this theory is that investors may prove smarter than the
government anticipates. Of necessity, the privatisation programme has had to
be front-loaded with attractive assets most likely to appeal to foreign fund
managers. The government, though, may receive a nasty shock if it
subsequently aims for fatter prices on less appealing propositions like Bull
and Air France.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is no coincidence that Barclays and National Westminster should launch
asset-backed bond issues in the space of two weeks. The Accounting Standards
Board was brought on side earlier in the year, clearing a potential obstacle
to this method of taking loans off balance sheet. After a period of doubt
prompted by the travails of issuers such as National Home Loans and Leyland
Daf, investors have also recovered a thirst for bonds backed by mortgages
and other loans. New issue spreads have narrowed as a result, presenting the
banks with an opportunity to raise cheaper funds.
Even so, clearing banks could still raise money more cheaply in other ways.
The real gain arises from the transfer of risk to bond holders, which frees
capital against which new loans can be made. Selling bonds backed by
mortgages might allow the banks to continue building market share in the
housing market, for example, without cramping their style elsewhere.
Unsecured loans tie up even more capital than mortgages for regulatory
purposes, so Barclays' issue of bonds backed by personal loans brings even
greater benefits in this regard.
While neither bank is under immediate pressure to raise capital, testing the
water now might pay off later if loan demand recovers in line with the
economy. Even if capital remains plentiful there is virtue in keeping the
loan book balanced between different types of risk. Having expanded in
commercial property lending in the 1980s, Barclays in particular will
appreciate the danger of having too many eggs in one basket.

The abolition of purdah has not made it easy to discern what Mr Kenneth
Clarke actually plans for his Budget in November. Yesterday's conference
speech, with its emphasis on spending restraint, looked more a rallying call
than anything else. Mr Clarke has already said there is no room for cutting
spending below the totals already proposed. But he was hardly gushing in his
enthusiasm for higher taxes either. The suspicion remains that tightening in
November will be kept to a minimum.
With financial markets in their present mood this may not matter much in the
short run, especially since the recovery appears strong enough to reduce the
PSBR below the Treasury's forecast of Pounds 50bn. One risk is that this
could delude Mr Clarke into thinking there is no need for much action in
November. He could then find himself having to address the structural part
of the deficit much closer to the next election.
Another risk is that over-hasty tax increases would reduce the pressure for
more desirable spending cuts. But some perks like mortgage interest relief
and universal child benefit look ripe for reconsideration. Offsetting such
change with lower interest rates could make the recovery more sustainable.
Since the full benefit of rate cuts would not be passed on to mortgage
borrowers, growth would be less dependent on consumers. Investment and,
assuming a modest decline in sterling, exports would be stimulated instead.
And Mr Clarke did say at the outset that he wanted to be a pro-business
chancellor.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Bhutto seeks minority party backing to form government

MS BENAZIR BHUTTO, claiming a victory in Pakistan's general election which
would return her to power after a three-year gap, was last night trying to
form a minority government amid continuing uncertainty about the country's
political future.
Ms Bhutto's Pakistan People's party won 86 seats in Wednesday's poll for the
217-seat national assembly, emerging as the largest party but failing to win
a majority. Mr Mohammed Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan Moslem League leader, who
supplanted her as prime minister in 1990, won 72. The rest were mostly
shared by Islamic and provincial parties, religious minority groups and
independents.
To take power, Ms Bhutto needs the support of about 25 independent and
minority party members, who tend to back the government in return for
political and financial favours.
Mr Sharif refused to concede defeat, insisting: 'I am confident that with
the help of other smaller parties and independent members the PML can muster
sufficient support to form a government at the centre.' But his chances were
thought to be remote compared with Ms Bhutto.
The next test for all parties is tomorrow's provincial elections. Attention
will focus on Punjab, the most populous province, where Mr Sharif is thought
likely to win and so prove a thorn in the side of the new government.
Ms Bhutto's success in the third general election in five years follows
months of political turmoil which culminated in the resignation of Mr
Sharif's government in July. The interim government has pledged to transfer
power to a new administration on October 19.
The lack of an overall majority is likely to hamper efforts to achieve
political stability. The recent upheavals have hurt business confidence and
Pakistan's prospects of attracting foreign trade and investment.
Businessmen in Karachi said yesterday they were glad the election was over,
even though Ms Bhutto rather than Mr Sharif, their favourite, had emerged
with the most seats.
Ms Bhutto claimed that vote-rigging had robbed her of a majority, though she
made no specific allegations.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Personal View: Palestinians need home-grown prosperity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STANLEY FISCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the signing of the PLO-Israeli agreement, the international community
and the Israelis have acquired a big stake in the economic success of the
Palestinians. The initial response has been encouraging. The October 1
donors' conference in Washington garnered aid pledges of more than Dollars
2bn over the next five years, with about Dollars 600m pledged for 1994. It
was also agreed the World Bank would have the main responsibility for
co-ordinating aid.
The aid numbers game is essential to focus the minds of the donors. But the
aid effort will fail to foster sustained Palestinian economic development
unless:
the Palestinians manage their own economy, including establishing an agency
to deal with the donors;
aid does not exceed the Palestinian economy's capacity to absorb it;
donors co-ordinate aid effectively; and there are rapid and visible
improvements in economic conditions in Gaza and the West Bank.
Not enough attention is being given to helping Palestinians develop a
capacity to manage their own economy and rely on their own resources to
finance development. A Palestinian economic administration will start by
taking over the economic functions of the Israeli civil administration, now
staffed by Palestinians with Israelis in upper management. Future
Palestinian managers should begin working with the Israelis as soon as
possible. They need to be trained now to deal with the massive challenges of
running and redesigning the system.
To avoid becoming too dependent on outside aid - a sure way of losing
economic independence and eventually retarding economic growth - the
Palestinians must develop their own sources of revenue. They currently pay
about 13 per cent of gross national product in taxes, half to the civil
administration. The Israeli-PLO agreement specifies that direct taxes in the
territories be transferred to the Palestinian administration. They should
also receive the remaining revenues, which include customs duties. Both
economic independence and responsible government spending are enhanced if
revenues come from taxation rather than foreign aid.
The aid agencies, and the governments they represent, are powerful and could
easily impose their priorities on the Palestinians. Thus the Palestinians
need urgently to create an agency to set their own aid priorities and
co-ordinate donors. Technical assistance to do this could be provided by
university affiliated advisers. The assistance may be financed by aid
agencies, but should not be provided by them.
The overall size of the aid package should be guided by the capacity of the
Palestinian economy to absorb it. With Palestinian GNP at less than Dollars
4bn and GDP at less than Dollars 3bn, massive amounts of aid (more than
12-15 per cent of GNP) could overwhelm the fledgling Palestinian
administration and lead to greater economic dependence.
The Palestinians and aid agencies will have to draw up detailed plans for
economic assistance, for financing specific projects and for general
budgetary support, before aid figures can be trusted. The World Bank's
estimate that the infrastructure needs of the next 10 years amount to
Dollars 3bn is only one element of the calculation. But it would be
surprising if much more than Dollars 500m a year could be productively
absorbed in the next few years.
In eastern Europe, competing aid agencies overstretched the capacity of
recipient governments and reduced the effectiveness of the aid effort. Donor
governments in principle now recognise the need for aid co-ordination. They
need to agree on an overall total for general assistance, to divide the
total among them, and to select an agency to deliver the aid with
appropriate conditionality. They also need to avoid an unseemly scramble for
projects. The World Bank could handle both parts of the co-ordination task.
It remains to be seen if governments permit it to do so.
There is an urgent need for short-term financial assistance that produces
visible improvements for Palestinians. Labour-intensive projects, improving
roads and sewers and housing, can get under way within months.
For the longer term, the economic policies of the Palestinian entity are
more important than the amount of aid it receives. With free trade and
economic co-operation with its neighbours, access to European and US
markets, a well-designed aid programme and good economic policies, the
Palestinian economy can gradually become economically independent and
generate the prosperity that can sustain peace.

FT  08 OCT 93 / A caravan lost in the sands: Hard thinking on prospects for
European monetary union has begun
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In a secluded hotel outside Brussels, European Community finance ministers
gather today for a strategy meeting that could also represent a session of
revelatory group therapy. For the first time since the summer monetary
crisis which led to the virtual collapse of the European exchange rate
mechanism, the ministers will discuss what went wrong, and what happens
next.
Although French and Belgian politicians have made intermittent statements
blaming 'Anglo-Saxon speculators' for the currency unrest, the public debate
on the lessons of the July-August debacle has barely begun.
But in private, there has been plenty of hard thinking about the future of
European monetary co-operation and the goal of economic and monetary union.
The question is whether the EC has the political will to chart a new course
to restore confidence in the project for economic and monetary union - or
whether European currencies will continue to drift apart.
The emergency agreement on August 2 on wider 15 per cent fluctuation bands
in the ERM brought the EC a breathing space after the successive currency
upsets since autumn 1992.
Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, has forecast a slippage of 'a year or
two' in the Maastricht timetable. The Bonn government and the Bundesbank,
however, maintain that the band widening leaves the EC fundamentally on
track for the Maastricht aim of achieving Emu by 1997 at the earliest and
1999 at the latest. In spite of discomfort in Paris over the weakening of
the French franc's link with the D-Mark, this view is backed by the French
government.
Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, has struck a jarring note by saying
the Emu plan has 'all the quaintness of a rain dance and about the same
potency' - a statement which has caused irritation in the EC Commission in
Brussels.
In some German business and financial circles, there is agreement with Mr
Major's view that the Maastricht timetable is unrealistic - but this is a
long way from the official line in Bonn.
One point seems to be undisputed: there will be no return to the old ERM, in
which most currencies fluctuated around a 2 1/4 per cent band, until the
recession on the Continent has clearly come to an end. Earlier hopes of a
progressive narrowing of the 15 per cent fluctuation bands by the end of the
year have been quietly dropped.
Yet the common European interest in monetary stability should not be
under-estimated. Most member states want to avoid competitive currency
devaluations - shown by the way that ERM members have not used their
new-found flexibility during the last two months to lower their currencies
significantly against the D-Mark.
Far less common ground exists on what might replace the old narrow-band ERM
which was supposed to represent the route to Emu.
Mr Jacques Delors, the EC Commission president, has toyed with the idea of
curbing currency speculation by placing exchange controls on speculative
borrowing. His sentiments are fairly widely shared on the continent, but his
suggestion has drawn criticism from the UK, and even the French government
regards it as a non-runner.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC Commissioner for external affairs, has meanwhile urged
states to stick to the Maastricht objectives but to make use of their
greater exchange rate flexibility. He has called on countries such as France
and Belgium to take advantage of the looser ERM arrangements to cut interest
rates and promote economic recovery.
In Brussels, the Commission is pinning its hopes on the European Monetary
Institute. It is to be set on January 1, 1994 - at the beginning of
so-called 'stage two' of Emu - as the forerunner of a future European
Central Bank.
One idea circulating in Brussels is that individual central banks should
pool resources so the EMI can intervene to defend embattled currencies. This
idea is, however, rejected by the Bundesbank, which wants to retain complete
autonomy before the planned establishment of a fully-fledged EC central
bank.
A broader goal of most EC governments is to use the EMI to help persuade the
Bundesbank take other countries' economies into account when taking interest
rate decisions. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, said this
week he hopes the EMI will ease the 'frustrations' of having to wait 'week
by week' for the Bundesbank to lower interest rates.
So far, member states have failed to agree on the EMI's location or its
president. EC leaders will try to break the deadlock at a special summit on
October 29, when the Community is expected to place the EMI in Germany.
However sensitive the question of where to site the EMI, the real issue is
the drive by other EC members to draw the Bundesbank into a more formal
system of monetary co-operation.
Much will depend on the state of the Franco-German alliance, which was badly
bruised during the summer. Mr Horst Teltschik, former foreign policy adviser
to Chancellor Kohl, and now a board member with the Munich-based BMW motor
group, describes French requests for unlimited support for the franc during
the monetary upset as irritating: 'They sometimes confuse our interests with
theirs,' he says.
One senior member of the Bundesbank council singles out for criticism Mr
Edmond Alphandery, the French economics minister, over his much-publicised
call in June for the Bundesbank to lower interest rates: 'He is a beginner,
and he made a beginner's mistakes.'
France wanted to take advantage of Germany's perceived economic weakness
caused by reunification to push for greater monetary co-ordination. The
signs are that Paris has not abandoned this strategy.
In August, Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, persuaded Mr Kohl
to agree to a 'convergence' programme which Brussels and Paris officials
believe could pave the way for more institutionalised co-operation.
The immediate outlook, however, for progress along the path towards Emu
appears gloomy. Three obstacles are apparent.
Germany's own post-unity problems. Large fiscal transfers from west to east
Germany - currently more than DM150bn a year - will be needed for at least
another decade to maintain east German living standards. During this period
of strain for the 'anchor' economy in Europe, Germany is unlikely to be
politically or economically ready to subsume its D-Mark into a single
European currency.
The diminishing chances that member states can meet the Maastricht
convergence targets, set down as conditions for Emu. This year, general
government deficits across the EC will average about 6 per cent of GDP -
double the 3 per cent target set at Maastricht.
The increasing temptation for European countries to see exchange rate
flexibility as a means of solving economic problems. Britain, Italy, Sweden
have shown that devaluation can be the clue to lowering interest rates and
restoring modest economic growth.
France's position is crucial. It remains torn between its desire to maintain
a tight link with the D-Mark and its need to engineer an economic recovery.
The Paris government's cautious monetary policy since August has allowed
French long-term interest rates to fall again to German levels. France is
hoping for a faster lowering of German interest rates next year, and a
corresponding weakening of the D-Mark. But this is a gamble for the Balladur
government as France heads towards the 1995 presidential elections.
The French strategy underlines how the Bundesbank remains the EC's supreme
monetary arbiter. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, its new president, last week signalled
that the central bank's policies would remain geared to Germany's economic
priorities, not the rest of Europe.
Thus for all the ERM's new-found flexibility, the Bundesbank's
anti-inflation stubbornness could still cause difficulties. Some EC
Commission officials worry that members of the ERM 'hard-core' such as
France, Belgium and Denmark will be unable to maintain their recent currency
stability unless they soon act to restore economic growth through more
aggressive cuts in interest rates. If these cuts do not materialise, these
Brussels officials believe, another currency upheaval could be in store - an
event which would postpone Emu until the next century.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Securitisation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S BANKS are showing strong interest in 'securitisation'. The
process, common in the US, involves selling packages of mortgages, personal
loans and the like to third-party investors in the form of bonds.
Yesterday's Pounds 280m issue of securitised personal loans by Barclays Bank
followed a Pounds 300m issue of mortgaged-backed loans by National
Westminster Bank last week.
It is easy to see the advantage to financial institutions of selling on
their loans. Securitisation shifts the risk of default to the new investors,
so freeing up capital which banks can use to make other loans. But is the
process also beneficial to borrowers and the wider economy?
Some borrowers may experience an initial queasiness at the thought that the
ultimate owner of their mortgage is not the high street bank from which they
originally borrowed but an anonymous Belgian dentist or multinational oil
company. Could the new owners jack up interest rates or take a tougher line
in the case of arrears?
Such concerns are unfounded. Under a typical securitisation deal, the
original lender continues to manage the relationship with the borrower, and
commits itself to treating securitised loans in exactly the same way as
ordinary loans. A Barclays or a NatWest would have no incentive to crack
down especially hard on borrowers whose loans it had securitised as that
would damage its reputation without enhancing profits.
Another concern is that securitisation may simply be a clever piece of
financial engineering, artificially driven by regulation. The reason for
being suspicious is that the banks' main motive for securitisation is to get
loans off their balance sheets and hence avoid onerous capital adequacy
requirements imposed by the Bank of England.
While it is impossible to dismiss this concern entirely, the Bank's capital
adequacy requirements seems sufficiently flexible to avoid such capital
market distortions. Moreover, securitisation could provide real
macroeconomic benefits by promoting a more efficient capital market.
Traditionally, banks both originate loans and carry the risks associated
with them. Investors, on the other hand, have no way of investing directly
in mortgages or other personal loans. The best alternative is to invest in a
bank, but that carries all sorts of other risks they may not wish to bear.
Securitisation allows banks to concentrate on originating loans and the
ultimate investors to select more precisely the type of assets they wish to
buy. The overall upshot could be lower capital costs and a greater pooling
of risk.

According to Stuart Toole, managing director of software house CASW, which

How badly does a Commonwealth member have to behave before being asked to
stay away from the club's biennial get-together which opens in Cyprus later
this month?
One might have thought that ignoring the result of a presidential election
was a pretty severe infringement of the Commonwealth's new code of conduct,
drawn up during the last conference in Harare, Zimbabwe, which underlined
the importance of the 'democratic process (and) . . . fundamental human
rights'.
When Nigeria's General Ibrahim Babangida annulled the result of the June
presidential elections, and extended the life of a military regime fronted
by civilians, there was a stern rebuke from the Commonwealth
secretary-general Chief Emeka Anyaoku, himself a Nigerian. Poor show, was
his message, as he called on the military regime to 'return the nation to
the democratic road' and 'restore Nigeria's standing in the wider world'.
But let's not poop the party. An invitation to Cyprus has gone off to Ernest
Shonekan, leader of Nigeria's military-backed government, and he has
accepted with alacrity.

After a week of stylish farewells to the town that first welcomed him as a
junior international banking officer back in 1955, Sir William Purves left
Hong Kong last night bound for London, from where, in accordance with the
wishes of the Bank of England, he will now run HSBC Holdings.
His last public act was at a luncheon at the Foreign Correspondents' Club.
All other ceremonies had proceeded smoothly, but the normally unflappable
Purves began to look a little queasy as club president Philip Bowring kicked
off his introduction by mentioning the 1982 Carrian property scandal.
Recalling a confidential memorandum of a meeting between Sir John Bembridge,
Hong Kong's gruff and tough financial secretary of the day, and a Malaysian
government investigator, Bowring told how Bembridge had roundly libelled
many of the colony's great and good implicated in the scandal. Purves's name
had, of course, come up, Bowring related to a hushed audience. 'Honest' had
been Bembridge's summary appraisal.
Sir William's integrity has long been a legend in a town notorious for sharp
practice. At a farewell for him and Lady Becky earlier in the week, Gordon
Wu, managing director of construction group Hopewell Holdings, who has known
him for more than 20 years, spoke of a great loss to Hong Kong. 'He's as
straight as an arrow,' Wu added. Nervous staff at the London headquarters,
who have heard also of his irascibility, are presumably even now burnishing
their shields.

EC finance ministers meeting today near Brussels to ponder the aftermath of
the summer ERM crisis should have packed their history books.
For there is a strong sense of deja vu imparted by that early August
communique announcing that member states would be widening 'temporarily' the
bands within which their currencies fluctuate. In September 1931, when
Britain left the gold standard, Downing Street explained that the Bank of
England would 'suspend for the time being' its obligation to exchange
sterling for gold.
Forty years later, it was Richard Nixon's turn to tell his country that he
had decided to 'suspend temporarily' the dollar's convertibility into gold.
In his celebrated TV broadcast of August 1971, Nixon also demonstrated that
French politicians were not the only ones to vent their spleen on the
markets when the going gets rough. The US president blamed 'international
money speculators' for the dollar's woes. 'Because they thrive on crises,
they help to create them,' he argued.
It was a similar story the next year, when Anthony Barber, the UK
chancellor, announced that sterling was pulling out as 'a temporary measure'
from the ERM's forerunner, the currency snake. Sterling then stayed out of
Europe's currency arrangements until the fateful decision to enter the ERM
in October 1990.
Ministers today will be hoping that August's suspension of the narrow-band
ERM does not turn out to be as permanent as the 'temporary' steps of
yesteryear.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Leading Article: All-Share changes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the FT-Actuaries All-Share index first saw the light of day in 1962, it
contained sectors such as shipbuilding, rubber manufacturing, and discount
houses.
Thirty years later, the British economy has changed greatly, thanks to the
growth of service industries, the decline of manufacturing, and the
privatisation of utilities. The indices that carry the FT name have changed
too, and from January 1994 they will change again, with the introduction of
such new industry sectors as gas distribution, medical ancillaries and
support services.
The work of reclassification is huge. It has been accomplished largely as a
result of a partnership, cemented last year, between the Financial Times,
the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, and the London Stock Exchange. This
agreement gives the FT-SE 100, the All-Share and the rest of the shared
family of indices a consistent set of rules, overseen by independent
committees of market participants.
One of these groups, the FT-SE Actuaries Industry Classification Committee,
has carried the burden of re-assessing the industry sectors for the UK
market.
They have achieved three significant improvements. First, each individual
industry sector has been redefined to meet the activities of today's
companies, rather than those of yesterday. Second, the stock exchange's much
more detailed classification has been incorporated into the new conceptual
framework, so it now forms the bottom tier of industrial 'sub-sectors'.
Third, the old 'economic groups', the broad industrial categories such as
capital goods, the consumer group, the industrial group and so on, have been
radically overhauled, to yield groupings which cluster together industries
that move in step through the economic cycle.
Not every one will be happy with the changes, at least at first. Some
companies will dislike their new homes; some investors will be unhappy at
the loss of familiar sectors. The committee is happy to listen to those
companies which believe they have been misclassified. And back histories of
the new sectors, already calculated, give the new classification an instant
pedigree. Most important, perhaps, the reclassification is based on a
consistent set of principles, now published explicitly. It reflects the
desire to make the governance of the indices transparent and independent.
The sponsors of the indices - the FT, the stock exchange and the actuaries -
are keen to acknowledge their debt to the people who did the work, the
members of the classification committee. The investment world will benefit
from their efforts for years to come.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Mr Gonzalez talks tough
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR FELIPE Gonzalez appears to have changed tack. After weeks of fruitless
negotiations with Spain's trade unions over proposed budget cuts, labour
market reforms and wage ceilings, the Spanish prime minister declared this
week that his minority government would try to impose the changes anyway.
But whether Mr Gonzalez can fulfil this threat, and make his reforms stick,
is quite another matter. Tough words and confrontational actions may cheer
the financial markets, but they will not necessarily deliver the fall in
wage inflation upon which sustained recovery depends.
Mr Gonzalez has reason to feel frustrated. The collapse of the hard exchange
rate mechanism, the focus of his economic policy, has exposed the seriously
depressed and distorted state of Spain's economy. But it has not yet
prompted Spain's labour leaders to agree to the kind of reforms in the
country's anachronistic and inflexible labour market upon which growth
depends.
Wage inflation is the immediate problem. Despite Spain's persisting
recession and an unemployment rate of 22 per cent, core price inflation is
stuck at 5.5 per cent while wage inflation remains above 7 per cent. Slow
growth and rising spending on public sector wages and benefits mean that the
budget deficit will grow to 6.2 per cent of gross domestic product product
this year, once again outstripping last year's over-optimistic target.
Meanwhile, these persistent wage pressures continue to persuade the Bank of
Spain that keeping short-term interest rates in double figures is necessary,
despite the devalued peseta's new-found stability. This is crushing domestic
demand and adding to the government's budgetary woes.
At the root of the problem lies the restrictive nature of Spanish labour
market regulations. There may be a happy medium between over-regulated
continental Europe and America's hire-and-fire culture, but Spain is very
much at the regulated extreme. Its notice and severance pay requirements are
restrictive even by European standards. The result, in addition to
persistent wage pressure, has been a rise in the percentage of Spanish
workers in unprotected temporary jobs, from 14.2 per cent in 1987 to 31.1
per cent in 1991, over twice as high as in any other OECD country.
At last, Spain has a government which appears willing to address these
deficiencies. Last week, finance minister Pedro Solbes announced a plausibly
tough budget, which projected a deficit of 5.7 per cent of GDP next year by
assuming that the government could impose a civil service pay freeze and
limiting next year's pension increases. Meanwhile, Mr Gonzalez says he will
unilaterally push through a liberalisation of the hire-and-fire rules and a
shift towards plant level bargaining.
But Mr Gonzalez is playing a risky game. While looser labour laws are a
necessary condition for renewed employment growth, the key to his budget and
employment hopes is economic recovery. This means lower interest rates soon
which, in turn, require a rapid moderation in wage inflation. But the
British evidence does not suggest that either deregulation or a shift to
plant-level bargaining will deliver lower wage inflation, certainly not when
the reforms are first introduced. Back in August, Mr Gonzalez was right to
seek to negotiate a wage pact to cap average private and public sector wage
inflation over the next three years. The wage pact remains the key to rapid
interest rate cuts. It is too early to give up the search for consensus.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Expanding company audits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEORGE LAPSLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The recommendation of the working party of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales ('Companies may have to review internal
controls', October 2) relating to the proposed audit of internal financial
controls adds fuel to the debate about the statutory obligations of
companies to report to shareholders.
This emphasis on reviewing internal financial controls may well be justified
and certainly accountants would welcome further statutory underpinning of
their fee income.
But what about other activities and operations in a company? Should there
not be a statutory requirement to report on marketing, quality, product
development, research and development, manufacturing? Are these not just as
important to the health of a company as financial controls and possibly of
even greater significance to shareholders and investors?
There must be many organisations with sound financial controls which face a
difficult future because they do not have the right people or the right
strategies.
Clearly these sorts of issues are of fundamental importance and need to be
dealt with in annual reports in a manner which is meaningful while not
giving undue commercial advantage to others. Perhaps non-executive directors
should be playing a part? They may be the people to take responsibility for
an independent 'health check', reinforced by some statutory realignment of
their responsibilities which also protects them with respect to other
directors on the board.
My self-interest is evident, provided of course such 'health checks' are
undertaken by suitably qualified management consultants who are members of
this institute. But such self-interest is no worse than that which prevails
when the bodies that fulfil a statutory obligation are seen also to
influence its scope

FT  08 OCT 93 / Second bite at the apple: Benazir Bhutto's election success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pakistan's general election, called to break prolonged political deadlock,
has failed to produce the desired result.
Ms Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister, has defeated her bitter rival
and successor in office, Mr Mohammed Nawaz Sharif. But, with just 86 seats
in the 217-member national assembly, her Pakistan People's Party lacks an
overall majority and must seek other parties' support.
Ms Bhutto's margin of success seems too narrow to assure Pakistan of the
stable government it needs if it is to solve its political, social and
economic difficulties. As one senior former minister said yesterday: 'A hung
parliament is a political and economic disaster.'
The main consolation is that the poll was completed with little of the
bloodshed which often accompanies Pakistani elections; thanks to army
supervision, it was also largely free of vote-rigging. The verdict therefore
seems to be a true reflection of the people's wishes. The pity is that the
result gives the winner a difficult hand to play.
Ms Bhutto's delicate position is the consequence of long-term army
involvement in politics. Born out of the bloody partition of India, Pakistan
has always lived in the threatening shadow of its huge neighbour. The army
has dominated public life and military dictators have ruled Pakistan for 24
out of its 46 years in existence. Of its civilian prime ministers only one
has completed a five-year term - Ms Bhutto's father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto,
the feudal landowner from the southern province of Sind.
Hopes were high that Ms Bhutto could follow his example when she first took
power in 1988 after the death of the dictator General Zia Ul Haq. But the
army and bureaucracy's refusal to co-operate, combined with her own
mishandling of relations with the military and the president, Mr Ghulam
Ishaq Khan, brought Ms Bhutto down in 1990. Mr Sharif, an industrialist
hand-picked for government by the army, ran into the same trouble this year
 -and was forced to resign by the generals.
Ms Bhutto's prospects of establishing power more firmly this time rely
primarily on creating better relations with the army and with the
bureaucracy headed by the president. She believes her chances are better
because the generals are no longer as hostile as in 1988. The new army chief
of staff, General Abdul Waheed, who took office in February, is considered
relatively unpolitical. Also, Mr Khan, the president who opposed her in
1988-90, was this year sacked by the army at the same time as Mr Sharif for
his part in causing political chaos. A new president will be elected in
polls in November. As Ms Bhutto said in a recent FT interview: 'The (power)
structure that was there has mercifully changed quite radically today.'
However, what has not changed is the mutual hostility between her and Mr
Sharif, whose Pakistan Moslem League (Nawaz) party (PML) will form the
opposition. Their hostility to each other poisons the atmosphere and
distorts decision-making. For example, both leaders promised voters
constitutional amendments to reinforce the prime ministership by curbing the
president's powers. But Mr Sharif is now unlikely to co-operate in a move
which would only strengthen Ms Bhutto.
Ms Bhutto's last government was also hampered by conflicts between the
federal authorities in Islamabad and Punjab, the richest and most populous
of the four provinces and the heart of Mr Sharif's power. When provincial
polls are held on Saturday, it seems likely that Punjab will stay in Mr
Sharif's hands.
Mr Sharif, Pakistan's first businessman-prime minister, has left behind a
mixed legacy. He promoted economic deregulation, foreign trade and
investment. But his policies were marred by over-spending on projects such
as a Dollars 1bn motorway; over-borrowing; and an upsurge in corruption.
Also, the end of US and Soviet involvement in the Afghan war left Pakistan
almost alone in coping with the effects of the conflict - including
continuing fighting in Afghanistan and the spread into Pakistan of arms and
drugs. Pakistan's international isolation increased due to worry over its
nuclear programme - a concern which prompted the US to cancel aid. Ms Bhutto
says her first priorities now are promoting economic growth and ending
Pakistan's isolation.
Her economic options are limited by the decisions taken by Mr Moeen Qureshi,
caretaker prime minister. Mr Qureshi has been forced to seek emergency loans
from the International Monetary Fund to ease a foreign exchange crisis
caused partly by Mr Sharif's profligacy and by last year's floods. These
have led to a slowdown in economic growth from an annual average of 6 per
cent to just 3 per cent in the year to June 1993. Mr Qureshi's IMF-approved
programme consists of devaluation combined with raising revenues by
introducing agriculture taxes, clamping down on corruption, and squeezing
tax dodgers, defaulters on loans from state banks and non-payers of utility
bills.
Ms Bhutto pledges to continue with Mr Qureshi's programme, including the
agriculture tax, though she has expressed reservations about his proposals
for its implementation. But her conservative, landowner-dominated party may
drag its feet on this and other measures. Many of Mr Qureshi's measures are
implemented via ordinances which will lapse unless confirmed by the national
assembly.
Public finances are burdened by military spending and debt repayments which
together absorb about three-quarters of the budget. Since neither can be
easily cut the chief route to stabilising public finances is through raising
revenue, as Mr Qureshi has recognised. The hurdle is the belief of many
politicians that the rewards of office include personal enrichment. This
disregard for the law has given rise to a black economy estimated to be half
the size of the official one.
It is difficult to see how Pakistan can generate enough funds for education,
health and other social programmes without bringing more of the black
economy into the tax net. Without better education, improved health and
population control will be largely unachievable. Ms Bhutto's PPP is the
self-proclaimed party of the poor; it remains to be seen whether they
benefit from her rule.
As for international relations, Ms Bhutto sees rebuilding ties with the US
as a top priority, including addressing Washington's complaints about
alleged state terrorism, the nuclear programme and Pakistan's support for
insurgents in the troubled Indian state of Kashmir. The difficulty lies is
squaring US demands with domestic pressures - such as a powerful pro-nuclear
lobby.
Ms Bhutto says that with the elections over, she will fight the 'battle for
the progress of Pakistan'. The danger is that she may be overwhelmed, as she
was before, by the battle for progress in Islamabad.

FT  08 OCT 93 / The Tory Jungle Book
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative party conference has not been a total shambles - so far.
There is still the little matter of the prime minister's speech this
afternoon, but we have been trained to have low expectations of that. We are
unlikely to be disappointed. If Mr John Major had his way the leader's
speech would be billed as routine, not a matter of political life or death.
As he is apt to remark, Lincoln's Gettysburgh address received poor early
notices.
Mr Major is painfully aware that he plays best in sitting-rooms; that he has
not developed the knack of communicating from a remote platform to a large
audience. Curiously, the same may be said of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the man got
up by the press as the pretender. In private or talking informally to a
small group Mr Clarke is excellent: persuasive, open, unafraid to take any
direct question. Give him a speech to read and his best friends will tell
you that he lacks the musical ear, the knowledge of when to pause and when
to emphasise, that mark the orator.
Unlike the prime minister, the chancellor usually knows what to say. 'Any
enemy of John Major is an enemy of mine,' he told the conference yesterday.
Afterwards, briefing the media, he reminded us of the prime minister's
remark, recorded here last week, that he would go into the jungle with Mr
Clarke and not be afraid to turn his back. Not to be outdone, the man who is
safe in the jungle said that he, Clarke, would be unafraid to turn his back
on Mr Major in the dark. The harsh truth is that when you have spent a week
among the beasts of this particular jungle, you wonder that they do not all
wear double-thick suits of armour.
The affecting pair-bonding of the prime minister and his chancellor might
offset some of the disunities that have marred the conference. The
disparaging remarks about Mr Major attributed to Lady Thatcher have done the
usual damage, but less than last time, which was less than the time before.
Before too long there will be nothing left but a handbag in an empty hall.
Conscious of their role as a TV studio audience, the assembled party workers
in Blackpool have exerted themselves to persuade us that the Tories are
united. The trick does not always work. Last year we witnessed a televised
drama of a party in disarray, particularly when Lord Tebbitt led his
anti-Maastricht rabble into the chamber and directly challenged the prime
minister. This year every entrance of the prime minister, every reference to
loyalty has been loudly applauded - only slightly less loudly, perhaps, than
one speaker's attack on the media.
Erecting a facade of unity is not the only purpose this year's conference is
supposed to serve. Saving Mr Major's skin apart, the ambition has been to
re-establish the Conservatives as the guarantors of law and order and the
least-worst managers of the economy.
On Wednesday Mr Michael Howard disregarded 14 years of Conservative failure
to control crime and sought to appear tough without succumbing to the calls
of one favoured speaker for flogging, hanging, castrating and permanently
incarcerating criminals. His proposals, some of them sensible, ignore the
social causes of crime, and do little to reassure us that fewer women will
be raped, fewer houses will be burgled, or fewer cars robbed. They merely
position the Tories in a political marketplace that has moved rightwards.
The price may be the wrongful conviction of a few unfortunates on the
grounds that they did not or could not answer questions on arrest, but that
appears to be regarded as a small price to pay.
Yesterday the chancellor sought to persuade the electorate that the hole the
government is in is of foreign origin. 'The recession has affected the whole
of the industrialised world,' he protested. His purpose was to prepare party
and public opinion for a budget and public spending package that is likely
to be less stringent than currently implied, while protecting the
Conservative government from blame for getting the public finances into such
a mess. He archly congratulated Lady Thatcher for her role in 1981, when tax
increases were imposed in the name of sound money. The Tory tax bombshells
due to rain down on us next year, including the highly unpopular value added
tax on domestic fuel, were three times credited to his predecessor.
In this way, blame for anything Mr Clarke may impose in November is
minimised. The chancellor has amply demonstrated his skill at political
discourse. We will be able to assess his skill at running the Treasury when
he presents his budget and spending proposals in 53 days . Until then, write
him down as the prime minister's best buddy.
Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary of the treasury, could not be so
designated. The mere mention of his name yesterday was greeted with
foot-stamping applause. He is the Tom Cruise of the cabinet: absurdly young,
and extremely dangerous. Although he did not address the main conference, he
continues to build his constituency on the right of the party, while
behaving perfectly properly as a loyal member of Mr Major's team. At a
fringe meeting last night he attacked 'political correctness' and spoke up
for the 'decent majority'. He appears to be a libertarian, although he does
not wish the state to be neutral - he calls it amoral - in the signals sent
out by its taxes, benefits and matrimonial laws. These should encourage
family values, discipline and individual responsibility.
Mr Portillo sees a market for right-wing ideology in the 1990s. Not so Mr
Douglas Hurd, who will doubtless be long retired when the young Cruise
reaches the pinnacle of his career. The foreign secretary said last night
that 'we should not give the impression that we believe in permanent
cultural revolution, in the style of Trotsky or Chairman Mao . . . We must
show that we are not driven by ideology to question every function of the
state . . .' Mr Hurd's words are closer than Mr Portillo's to the thoughts
of the pragmatic Mr Major or one-nation Mr Clarke.
The foreign secretary has the stature to resist the political correctness of
the Tory right. Other speakers, even the Christian Democratic Mr David Hunt,
have had to pepper their remarks with cheap anti-Europe shots. There have
always been at least two kinds of Conservative, but establishing which is
ascendant is better done out of office than in.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Rescue culture needs law changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STUART D HOLLANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am delighted that the vexed question of UK law in respect of
insolvencies is beginning to get the airing it deserves, in view of the many
unnecessary receiverships which have robbed shareholders and creditors and
weakened the UK's industrial base. Robert Rice's article 'Towards a rescue
culture' (October 5) is an enlightening contribution to the debate.
Whether or not the 1986 Insolvency Act is working depends on your definition
of 'working'. As the article points out, the intent is not being fulfilled.
This is particularly the case in rescues or recoveries, where the management
is trying to turn round the company, but continues to be excluded along with
the owners/shareholders by banks in pursuit of a quick run for their money.
This malpractice almost inevitably takes place at the time when the
foundations of a turnaround have been laid. Such was the case in the recent
demise of a quoted clothing group of which I was chairman (Dunkeld Group
plc). I know we are not alone.
The article does not mention that the law permits a bank under the terms of
its debenture to put its own short-term interests on the table and ignore
recent investment by shareholders and the security of creditors.
These interested parties will have been encouraged by the bank's initial
support for the refinancing process, the kernel of the 'rescue culture', and
possibly by its position as shareholder.
It must be in the interest of all those involved in the risk ventures
necessary for the country's industrial success for legislators to give
shareholders and creditors an opportunity to negotiate a less lethal attack
than receivership, if, in their combined judgment, it is likely to lead to
the successful continuation of the recovery.
The absence of that opportunity seems to be the essential difference between
the American and British environments. 'Mutual obligations' might provide a
suitable framework within which the necessary legislation could be
developed.
The article did not refer to the fact that the use of the same company as
both investigating accountants and receivers has, in many cases, increased
the likelihood of the receivership route and the inherent conflict of
interest the practice creates. This custom needs to be outlawed in the
interests of objectivity and a 'rescue culture'.
I hope that the lessons learned from the current spate of avoidable
receiverships will be used by the authorities to amend the regime. This
would help in the creation of the so-called 'rescue culture' and should be
designed to afford some protection, or at least sufficient time, for those
brave enough (or foolish enough under the current rules of the game) to take
on the responsibility of corporate rescue work.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER URWIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There have been two letters recently (October 2 and 4) expressing the
view that the Goode committee's proposals do not have any negative
implications for pension funds' exposure to equities. It is asserted that
derivative instruments can be used to 'avoid a substantial shift away from
equities' while giving sufficient protection against a fall in the market
leading to a failure to satisfy minimum solvency standards.
We agree that derivatives will play an important part in providing this
protection, but disagree that their use does not alter equity exposure.
Derivative instruments used in this context simply provide a less
transparent means to reduce equity exposure. This is clear when one
considers that investors on the other side of the put option contracts
involved would be selling equities.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Rejecting the benchmark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STUART FOWLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Barry Riley is topical and accurate ('The time has come to cut Japan
down to size', October 6) in reflecting the frustration felt by many
managers of international equity portfolios with the high and fluctuating
proportion of the total international market capitalisation that Japan
represents, particularly when investing outside the US. However, pension
fund trustees have heard this before and I believe they are shy of letting
managers blame the benchmark for their performance.
The reason trustees are frustrated with managers' frustration is that they
know two things about Japan which they find hard to reconcile. First, its
valuation basis, by any measure, has altered radically in recent years (from
boom to bust would probably sum up most images of its recent stock market
history). Second, with few exceptions, managers appear not to have altered
their exposure to Japan significantly during this period. This observation
is supported by the evidence of performance measurement universes on both
sides of the Atlantic.
The absence of dynamic responses to changing country valuations is a form of
'closet indexing'. Because the majority of returns in an international
equity portfolio are explained by country decisions (regressions of randomly
constructed portfolios since 1980 show over 80 per cent of portfolio
variance is explained by country exposure), trustees may wonder whether they
are paying an active fee for the wrong type of activity.
It is easy to exaggerate the effects of country concentration in an
international portfolio. For instance, for a US-based international investor
(for whom the Japanese decision is dominant) with as much as 20 per cent in
non-US markets, the effect of holding the index with nothing in Japan
compared with a full index weight would have been to reduce the volatility
(standard deviation of annual returns) of the entire portfolio since 1973 by
0.1 per cent.
Compared with the lost opportunities from genuinely active management of the
country exposure based on a sensible and consistent valuation discipline,
excuses about the benchmark should cut no ice with trustees. Their best
solution to the problem of assessing the short-term performance of managers
lies in trying to understand what managers have done with their
opportunities, a process in which the long-term benchmark should make only a
small contribution.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Arts: The Wilton Diptych remains enigmatic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In an age which has seen blockbuster exhibitions swell to ever more
monstrous proportions, the National Gallery in London has pioneered series
of modest shows which recognise how rewarding it can be to look hard and
think about a single work. For the first in a new series, Making and
Meaning, which again focuses on major works in its own collection, the
spotlight is directed towards the Wilton Diptych in the aftermath of its
recent cleaning and technical examination.
This small, portable altarpiece is one of the most refined and sumptuous
products of the late medieval world. It is also one of the most enigmatic.
Generations of scholars have debated who painted it, and why, and what it
meant to those who first saw it. The purpose of this exhibition, which is
supplemented by a small number of judicious loans of panels, manuscripts,
sculpture, metalwork and jewellery, is to offer visitors the possibility of
understanding a private and complex image. The temptation to tell them how
to interpret it is scrupulously resisted.
Although the Wilton Diptych has the inevitability of a dream, its two halves
make for a distinctly odd couple. On the barren earth of the left wing
kneels Richard II of England, identified as such by his personal emblems of
the white hart on his breast and the broomcods, or pods of the broom plant -
the planta genista from which the Plantagenets took their name - laced
around his neck. The three figures standing behind him - Edmund, king and
martyr, Edward the Confessor and John the Baptist - act as intercessors and
have been carefully chosen for their personal significance for the monarch.
The frieze of saints is remarkable for its evenly distributed verticality
while the profile portrait of the king has all the depth of a playing card.
The crowded panoply of the right wing could hardly be more different. Here
the Virgin stands cradling the Christ Child in a paradise garden, supported
by a company of angels who, wearing broomcods and white harts, seem to have
been liveried by the King of England rather than the Queen of Heaven. Arms
crossed, wings fluttering, seven of them form a backdrop to her, while four
more ring her round. This image is the epitome of a manner of painting that
was swept away by the Renaissance and the discovery of perspective, but here
too there is pictorial space.
The narrative link between the two is provided by the white banner
emblazoned by the red cross of Christ's Resurrection which is also the
banner of St George. Its pinnacle is a silvered orb and that too alludes to
England. Recent cleaning has revealed that it contains a minute
representation of a green island, a white tower with two turrets, and a boat
in full sail. It is hard not to read it as 'this sceptred isle . . . and
precious stone set in the silver sea' of John of Gaunt's speech in
Shakespeare's Richard II.
This is no standard image of a donor being presented to the Virgin by his
patrons. Rather, it appears a carefully orchestrated expression of Richard's
notion of the divine nature of his kingship and his hopes for salvation. As
such, the altarpiece is likely to have been made for the private devotions
of the king, a few years before his untimely death in 1399.
The Wilton Diptych is one of the high points of the so-called International
Style, that phase of late Gothic art when painters and sculptors all over
Europe seemed to be marching to the same drum. Such is the extent of
cross-fertilisation that no agreement has been reached about whether its
creator was English, French, Italian or Bohemian. The recent technical
examination has only confirmed that while the preparation of the ground of
the oak panels is typically Northern, the technique adopted for binding the
pigments and for the green undermodelling of the flesh tones is
characteristically Italian. The use of egg white allowed the painter to
exploit the full purity of the precious lapis lazuli which he ground to
produce the brilliant ultramarine.
Wherever he came from, the anonymous master of the Wilton Diptych was a
great painter. This is his (or her?) only surviving work. We have no idea
whether it belongs to his youth, maturity or old age. One thing is certain,
however: if it had not survived, no one would have felt the lack of it. The
picture stands as a poignant reminder of how much of our past has been lost.
That, and not just its quality, is part of its enchantment.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Arts: Marlowe's Dido, Queen of Carthage - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a school of thought which believes that if Christopher Marlowe had
not died young - at the age of 29 in 1593 - he would have surpassed even
Shakespeare as a dramatist. On quantity perhaps; on quality I doubt it.
It may be unfair to accuse Marlowe of lacking a sense of humour, since he
concentrated on writing tragedies. What he certainly lacked was
Shakespeare's sense of variety, but he wrote some of the most magnificent
blank verse in the English language.
There is another claim that should be treated with scepticism. Stage One
Theatre Company says that theirs is the first professional production of The
Tragedy of Dido, Queen of Carthage for 400 years. That sounds a bit like the
crime figures: not everything is recorded. There must have been some
productions, somewhere.
Yet one can see why there may not have been very many. Dido was probably
Marlowe's first play - no-one is quite sure of the date and there may have
been some collaboration with Thomas Nashe. As a drama, it is not the most
gripping. It relies heavily on Virgil's Aeneid and has some excessively long
speeches, though one of them is specifically commended by no less than the
Prince of Denmark in Shakespeare's Hamlet. The quality of the verse is on a
learning curve, but from a pretty low starting point. Take, for example, the
bathetic early lines of Aeneas: 'Achates, 'tis my mother that is fled; I
know her by the movings of her feet.'
One cannot say much for the ending either, when it is Aeneas who has fled
and everyone else to speak of is dead on stage. Shakespeare would have left
someone behind to tell the story.
Nevertheless, Dido has Marlowe's stamp on it, is an interesting part of his
development as a dramatist, and it is enterprising of the Stage One Company,
directed by Michael Walling, to have revived it.
My own main impression is how rapidly the verse matures as the play goes on.
There is a great deal of feeling in some of Dido's last lines, some of it
foreshadowing the uniqueness of Marlowe at his best. For instance: 'And all
the world calls me a second Helen, For being entangled by a stranger's
looks.'
On the other hand, one cannot speak for other people. My daughter said that
she preferred the first half because she had never seen anything like it
before. The second half merely reminded her of what a good play is Antony
and Cleopatra. Up to a point she was right, yet without Dido Shakespeare may
not have written Antony the way he did. There are some remarkable parallels
between Dido's and Cleopatra's femininity.
The experience is more educational than entrancing. I doubt if even the best
acting in the world could make much of the piece as a whole. As it is, Kevin
Costello plays Aeneas with a touch of the ham, which is probably the best
way of doing it. Julie Saunders' Dido gets better as tragedy approaches and
with the maturing of the verse.
There is the definition of a pretentious programme note by Inga-Stina
Ewbank, who is a professor of English at the University of Leeds. It ends:
'The professional stage has fought shy of this play for nearly 400 years: it
may not be coincidental that it now returns in the year when we have learned
to speak of 'former Yugoslavia''.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Arts: Niels Bjorn Larsen at 80 storms the stage as Coppelius
 -Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Niels Bjorn Larsen was born on October 5, 1913. His entry in ballet
dictionaries identifies him as a Danish dancer, ballet-master,
choreographer, artistic director of the Royal Danish Ballet for more than a
decade, and 'the company's most distinguished mime'. What must now be added
to this curriculum vitae is that on Tuesday night, to celebrate his 80th
birthday, he once again stormed the 'Old Stage' of the King's Theatre as
Doctor Coppelius. And he was marvellous as ever - as a devoted observer of
his art, I would venture 'more marvellous than ever' - in a role he has
danced for 48 years.
The tradition of mime performance is one of the glories of the Royal Danish
Ballet. The Bournonville repertory has ever depended upon a framework of
'natural' observation to set off the grand dance sequences. The life of a
location, its bustle and character, its crowds and the bright interplay of
personalities, fascinated Bournonville, and his ballets were often souvenirs
of places he visited - Paris, London (he made a piece about the Crystal
Palace exhibition), Bruges, Moscow, and, supremely Italy, which he adored.
(His Napoli is as true an aspect of Danish nineteenth century art's
fascination with the sun-lit south as the paintings of Marstrand.)
It is in showing this local colour to us that Danish dancers and mime
artists have, across the years, become so expert, so truthful in their
playing, and Danish ballet itself has gained so greatly in distinction.
(That the Danes also dance with such joyous grace is the other vital part of
Bournonville's bequest to his heirs).
Niels Bjorn Larsen has been one of the exemplars and beacons in this
tradition of dance-acting. We were fortunate in London, during Peter
Schaufuss' years with English National Ballet, that Larsen was a frequent
guest - his Madge in La Sylphide is, for me, the definitive reading of the
role, terrifying in malevolence and power, and with a nice edge of venomous
humour. We first saw him in London 40 years ago, when the Royal Danes made
their first big tour: then, as now, he gave his roles a weight, an intensity
of observation, so that character seemed wholly and marvellously alive.
For his 80th birthday performance - and it is certainly not a farewell: he
has much to do, and much still to show us - he returned to a role he has
made his own. The Danes' staging of Coppelia tells a credible story of
peasant love in a believable setting - this might well be Galicia, rather
than the usual Ruritania. It is also unlike other versions in text: the
choreography has developed over the years from a Copenhagen production at
the turn of the century. It is, in its present happy revival by Frank
Anderson and Anne Marie Vessel, jolly and coherent in its folk style - you
sense that these villagers have seen a plough, unlike the usual droves of
balletic toilers whose hands have been dirtied by nothing more than a
window-box.
The production is wise, and heart-warming. (The celebrated sequence when
Swanilda tests her beloved Frantz' fidelity by the rattle of seeds in an ear
of corn, is replete with feeling). Henriette Muus and Lloyd Riggings were
the lovers on Tuesday night - sprightly and sweetly sincere in feeling. But,
of course, we were there to see Niels Bjorn Larsen, and he was tremendous.
The characterisation treads, and with what finesse, a narrow path between
eccentric comedy (the old chap - Coppelius, that is] - is forgetful, and
given to antic bursts of activity) and wild dreams of magic. At every moment
Larsen speaks to us. His playing is a marvel of timing, each gesture phrased
and placed with subtlest understanding, each moment bright with a psychic
energy as lively as his still astonishing physical resource. He tells us the
truth, both comic and, at the last, tragic, about Coppelius. It is rare
theatrical art, and as with the motto over the proscenium of the King's
Theatre - 'Not for pleasure alone' - it has moral dignity, because of the
humanity that inspires the reading.
At the end of the evening there were cheers, flowers, presents, hats thrown
in the air, embraces. We were saluting a superb performer who has embodied
the ideals of his theatre throughout an illustrious career - and, most
happily, continues to do so.

The high-tech antennae used in Israel's most sophisticated smart bombs has
now been converted for civilian use, stuffed into the lid of a briefcase.
The antenna forms part of the Bipsat portable satellite communications
system, which can be used to send phone, fax or data messages via Inmarsat
satellites. The system incorporates a notebook PC, hard disc, printer and
communications software.
Although several other satellite transmitters and receivers are already
available, their antennae usually have to be carefully aligned with the
satellite - to within 2` - for messages to be sent and received. Rafael, of
Haifa, manufacturers of Bipsat, say the flat antenna gives a wider
tolerance, making the equipment easier to use. Rafael: Israel, 4 795435.

Composite materials are renowned for being stronger and lighter than steel,
but have traditionally been more expensive.
Cambridge Consultants has now found a way of mass-producing composite
structures with all the strength, but at a lower cost. The result could be
tough but lightweight car bumpers, train seats, manhole inspection covers
and even sports racquets.
Composites, which derive their strength from the lengths of glass or carbon
fibre embedded in the resin, are widely used in the defence and aerospace
industries. But they could only be mass-produced if the fibres were cut,
reducing their strength.
Cambridge Consultants has developed machinery which adapts conventional
spinning procedures to weave the fibres continuously in three dimensions.
Special resins have also been developed. Cambridge Consultants: UK, 0223

Over the past six months several personal computer manufacturers have
launched 'green PCs' that use less electricity, writes Louise Kehoe. None,
except IBM, has addressed the fundamental issue of encouraging PC users to
switch off their machines when not in use.
'Rapid Resume', a feature incorporated in IBM's new line of PS/1 computers,
overcomes the drawback of switching off. When the new PS/1 is turned off,
the system automatically remembers what the user was doing. When turned on
again, the machine returns to the exact spot, eliminating the need to
re-open Windows applications and find working documents. And if the user
forgets to turn off, Rapid Resume will do it when the system has not been
used for a pre-selected period. IBM: US, 914 945 3884; UK, 0705 321212.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Technology: The science of shopping - Electronic gadgetry
can now track customer flows in and out of stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For European retailers, the ability to attract customers and persuade them
to buy is often regarded as an art. In the US, on the other hand, retailing
is increasingly becoming a science.
What is the optimum ratio of sales staff to customers? How does pricing
affect sales? Does a particular advertisement bring more people into the
store?
These are topics which US retailers can now accurately measure, using the
latest monitoring equipment combined with sophisticated point-of-sale tills.
'Intuitively, we believed that all these things affected our business, but
we couldn't prove it,' says Phil Johnson, executive vice-president of human
resources at Macy's department store, and formerly with Saks Fifth Avenue.
At Saks, Johnson installed the ShopperTrak system from Datatec to count the
number of shoppers entering and leaving the store.
At its simplest level, the system was used to calculate peak traffic flows
and, combined with information from the point of sale (Pos) equipment, peak
'conversion' rates - how many customers were persuaded to buy.
Simple as it sounds, such data were difficult to obtain using traditional
manual counting methods - such as employees using 'clickers' to count
customers as they entered the store.
'It is one of the simplest things in retailing - knowing how many people
come into a store. But we've not had that information,' says Johnson.
'Eyeball' measuring, he believes, can be wrong by a factor of two or three.
'If you're running an ad, then it can produce very different traffic flows,
so data collected on a different day may no longer be accurate,' Johnson
explains. 'The lesson is that traffic is so hard to observe. But we talk
about it daily.'
ShopperTrak can give customer numbers every hour or for periods as short as
15 minutes. 'You can evaluate what you really get from a promotion,'
concludes Johnson.
The ability to garner such information lay behind the decision of Pier 1
Imports, the furnishing and household goods chain, to install ShopperTrak
when the US retail industry went into recession in spring 1990. 'Primarily,
we wanted to measure the effect of advertising,' says Jim Tener, senior
vice-president of operations.
The company soon realised it needed different information and that
ShopperTrak could help provide it. 'Preliminary results indicated alarming
evidence that, in addition to advertising, we needed to focus on more
fundamental issues dealing with store operations, namely improving our
emphasis on customer service and selling to the customer.'
The system helps the store managers decide on strategic issues such as price
reductions, how best to display items or whether demonstrating the use of
utensils increases sales.
The effectiveness of these is calculated by measuring a base line and then
assessing how that changes if a new factor is introduced. For Pier 1, this
included changing the ratio of staff to customers and altering the times
when staff cleaned or stacked shelves.
In one store in Toms River, New Jersey, the company experimented with
changing the staff-to-customer ratios from a high salesperson presence of
5:1 to a low of 9:1. It decided the optimum ratio was 7:1 - above that
conversion rates did not increase.
The company also wanted to evaluate how effective staff training was in
increasing the conversion rate, explains Tener. Although the concept of
sales training was devised by the managers themselves, ShopperTrak enabled
the company to measure the effects of the training.
Using such techniques at the Toms River test site, Pier 1 managed to
increase the conversion rate from 24.6 - just under one-quarter of shoppers
made a purchase - to 28.1 per cent, which equated to a 14.2 per cent
increase in turnover.
'The exciting thing to me is that we know exactly why it went up,' Tener
points out. 'We can measure cause and effect.' Pier 1 plans to do more
testing in its stores. Eighty of them already have the system installed and
by the end of February 1994, between 150 and 160 of Pier 1's 615 stores will
have ShopperTrak.
The financial payback is easy for Tener to calculate, as each of the stores,
with an average area of 9,000 square feet, has a single entrance. With the
systems costing Dollars 4,000 (Pounds 2,600) a time, Tener believes each
system will pay for itself in less than a year.
At Macy's, the calculations are not so simple. It would be too expensive for
the store to install equipment round every entrance to individual
departments, and so conversion rates can only be measured throughout the
store, not on a department-by-department basis.
At Selfridges in London, however, one tracking system has been installed
over an escalator, which could result in a floor-by-floor count. In one
discount store in the US, says Chris Carey, president of Datatec, systems
have been installed to enable the shop managers to count customers as they
enter each aisle.
Nevertheless, Johnson saw positive results at Saks even when treating each
store as a discrete unit. 'Sales had a positive change simply by telling
staff what the conversion rate was, how to improve it, and how it was
improving. We got a 2 to 3 per cent change in conversion rate for nothing.'
Tener also noticed changes in attitude at Pier 1. 'Our people developed a
competitive environment. One shift tried to outdo another.'
Johnson believes that in the future such systems could lead to changes in
the way staff and stores are assessed. 'Right now we measure everything on
sales,' he reports. But high-selling stores may have low conversion rates.
The data from ShopperTrak should enable managers to analyse which stores
need to produce higher conversion rates and which need to work on attracting
more customers into the store.
Carey believes the equipment can bring further advantages such as an
appraisal system of managers' performance. To do that, the accuracy of the
system is critical, says Johnson. 'You're trying to get the people in the
store to think in a completely different way, and you can only do that if
they have confidence in the data.'
The Datatec system uses vertical infra-red beams on a bar attached to the
ceiling. Unlike horizontal beams, they are out of the reach of children, who
often take pleasure in waving their arms in front of the beams to notch up
the numbers.
Because the infra-red beam bounces back once it is broken by the person
entering, the system can calculate the height of the object and eliminate
from its count anything or anyone under four feet tall - children, prams or
shopping trolleys.
ShopperTrak's software can calculate the number of 'buying units' entering
the store - a family, say - rather than just individuals. And it can combine
its data with that from IBM Pos systems to calculate conversion rates.
The latest software from Datatec has been designed for do-it-yourself stores
or supermarkets and enables floor managers to predict when they will need to
open another check-out lane.
The calculation is based on the number of customers entering and the average
time it takes them to complete their shopping. The system is already in use
in the US and is on trial at one UK supermarket.
In Europe, Carey sees the differing shopping habits as a challenge. In the
UK, for example, conversion rates are much lower than in the US - in the
high teens rather than the mid-20s, says Carey. But so is the ratio of staff
to customers.
While Pier 1 calculated that 7:1 was the optimum ratio in its stores, in the
UK there are 30 or even 40 customers on average for just one shop assistant.
'In the US, somewhere along the line customers have demanded service,' says
Carey. 'In the UK it's not even started.'

FT  08 OCT 93 / Property: Leaders and laggards - The notion that commercial
property lags the main business cycle is wrong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SHAW
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A mouth-watering cocktail of commercial property valuations
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
yields exceeding 9 per cent and capital values some 40 per cent below their
1989 peak - should have prompted institutional investors to snap up property
at bargain prices 12 months ago.
But the cocktail proved unappetising. It was to be another year before
institutional buyers would rediscover their taste for commercial property.
What went wrong? Most UK institutional investors believe that commercial
property values still lag the main business cycle. This time differential,
they add, can be beneficial to the industry: it gives insti-tutions plenty
of time to react after the economy has turned.
Institutions' willingness to watch the economy turn before making their own
investment decisions is intimately linked to their rationale for buying
property in the first place. Property provides a future stream of rental
income, which is at least partially inflation-linked, via upward-only rent
reviews.
Commercial property is therefore perceived by institutions as an attractive
home for the funds of those investors which have inflation-linked
liabilities such as pension funds.
Since inflation typically lags the business cycle by up to two years and is
believed to drive property values, the commercial property market has come
to be characterised as 'late cycle' - one that lags the main business cycle.
Nevertheless, there is a negative side to commercial property investment -
buildings are not a very liquid asset, unlike equities and bonds. This
dilemma poses a problem for any fund manager who needs to make significant
and rapid changes in a fund's property weightings in accordance with the
swings in a business cycle.
Despite this drawback, most fund managers remain comfortable with property
as an asset. Fund managers believe they have ample time after spotting the
turn in a business cycle in which to make strategic changes in their
property weightings.
But they are wrong. The conventional wisdom of 'late cycle' does not stand
up to scrutiny.
The evidence from a comparison of the behaviour of commercial property
values and real gross domestic product shows that over the period covering
the last three UK business cycles (1970-92) changes in commercial property
values and real GDP have invariably coincided.
The property investor should, on this evidence, be treating the markets as
an 'early cycle' play - assessing his position and making investment
decisions ahead of the general business cycle. Ignoring this 'early cycle'
factor would doom him to chasing prices up while a seller would be resigned
to pursuing falling values.
As chart one shows, in a comparison of the absolute level of commercial
property prices and real GDP, commercial property prices in the last cycle
peaked in the fourth quarter of 1989 - two quarters before the peak in GDP.
Similar time-lags have been identified in the UK economy, which bottomed out
in the second quarter of 1991. The difficulty for investors on both
occasions was that their recognition of a turn in the economy would have
lagged by two quarters - the extra time was needed by investors to
assimilate and respond to final official figures on the economy as a whole.
Given that on average it takes a further six months to conclude a property
transaction the investor would only have been in a position to amend his
investment portfolio in the middle of this year - some 18 months into the
economy's tentative recovery.
Such time-lags provoke uncertainty and impede investments. What investors
need, above all, is a reliable early warning signal that business activity
and commercial property prices are on the turn.
The preferred early warning indicator is interest rates, which provide a
reliable and sufficiently long-lead indicator of business activity,
primarily for three reasons:
First, changes in interest rates will affect the real economy by altering
individual consumption levels and the willingness of companies to invest.
With a 12-18 month lag, tenant demand for commercial property begins to
respond to changes in aggregate expenditure in the economy.
Second, a large number of property transactions are financed by bank
borrowings and are therefore sensitive to interest-rate changes. The volume
of property transactions may be even more sensitive to the willingness of
banks to make extra loans to the sector, given the extent of their bad
property loans following the boom and bust of the late 1980s. The
availability and cost of finance will have a greater impact over the short
term than changes in rent levels (which are made every three to five years).
Third, holding financial assets incurs an opportunity cost - the interest
forgone on cash deposits. When interest rates for deposits fall they enhance
the relative attractiveness of yields on all other financial assets,
including property. The same is true of long-term interest rates on, for
example, government bonds.
On this basis it should have been possible to spot a 'sell signal' well in
advance of the peak in property prices in mid-1989. This peak had been
preceded by UK short-term interest rates reaching their low point 18 months
earlier. An institutional investor acting at this low point in interest
rates would have had a year in which to find buyers - allowing for the six
months it commonly takes to conclude a property transaction.
When should investors have spotted the buy signal? A declining trend in UK
short-term interest rates only became apparent in the first quarter of 1991,
when rates were 14 per cent, accelerating in the third quarter of 1992 when
sterling left the exchange rate mechanism.
Given the normal time-lags, economic recovery could have been expected to
begin in the first quarter of 1992, which it did. In principle a property
market recovery should have been discernible by September 1992.
Yet by this summer there had not been a significant rise in property prices.
However, the market average indicated by the Hillier Parker Capital Index
masks a big rise in property prices in the significant retail segment of the
commercial property market in the six months to June. Some properties with
strong creditworthiness and long leases have already seen increases in value
in excess of 10 per cent.
In the present cycle, not only has the buying signal been given by an
earlier decline in short-term interest rates, but it has been reinforced by
the accompanying fall in long-term rates. The consequence is that for the
first time in a generation property yields stand at a premium over long gilt
yields.
This suggests that investors are, in effect, valuing commercial property on
the premise that future rental increases offer no protection against
inflation. But worse than that, it actually implies negative rental growth
over the lifetime of property assets.
This is unduly pessimistic. Inflation still exists, albeit at a historically
low level. It is therefore a factor which must be accounted for when valuing
property assets. A full valuation of commercial property should reflect the
importance of this hedge against inflation, which is provided by
upwards-only rent review clauses included in most commercial property
leases.
On this basis we expect property to resume trading on lower yields than
bonds. We shall remain buyers for some time to come.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
London Global Securities, the securities lending firm set up in 1990, has
tempted Hans Beckmann, 30, away from Deutsche Bank to head its new Hong-Kong
based subsidiary, London Global Securities (Asia).
Beckmann was previously head of operations at Deutsche Bank Asset Management
in Frankfurt. He will be supported in his new role by Katherine Pek, 31,
formerly an operations manager with Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong.
London Global Securities employs 54 people worldwide and has offices in
London and Greenwich, Connecticut. Its decision to set up in Hong-Kong -
just four years before the colony reverts to mainland China - was inspired
by the city's strategic status amid the region's emerging markets.
'For every one who thinks 1997 is a problem, there are three who think it's
an opportunity,' said Mike Hiard, managing director of the London subsidiary
and one of the firm's founders.

FT  08 OCT 93 / People: Watkins takes flight from Chrysalis
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nicholas Watkins has resigned as a director of Chrysalis, the music and
media group, to head a management buy-out of its multi-media and in-flight
television interests.
Watkins joined Chrysalis from Rank in 1989 to help it refocus its business.
He has succeeded to the point where he does not feel Chrysalis has a place
for him any longer. Its focus is now on the music business - which it
re-entered last year - and on television broadcasting activities.
Watkins believes both sides of the business require managers with a creative
background. 'I'm more of a corporate suit,' he says.
Chrysalis will keep 15 per cent of the company Watkins is setting up to
produce material for multi-media and in-flight television companies. He is
talking to another three or four potential investors.

FT  08 OCT 93 / People: Jacomb and Norrington retire from Barclays
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The first effect of the arrival of Martin Taylor as chief executive of
Barclays emerged yesterday when the bank disclosed that Sir Martin Jacomb,
below left, one of its two deputy chairmen, and Humphrey Norrington, below
right, one of its two vice chairmen, are retiring from its board.
The retirements are both linked to Taylor's arrival from January to take
over the chief executive role from Andrew Buxton, the bank's chairman. The
bank need no longer maintain such an intricate structure of responsibility
on its board to counterbalance Buxton's dual roles.
Jacomb, who is 63 and a member of several other boards, stayed on as deputy
chairman for a year at Buxton's request, despite passing its retirement age
of 62.
With Taylor's arrival Jacomb has taken the chance to leave Barclays, which
he joined in July 1985, from the year end.
A signal of intentions emerged this week when Jacomb was named as chairman
designate of Delta, an electrical engineering company. He already chairs the
British Council and Postel Investment Management. His most vital role at
Barclays was as the first chairman of its BZW investment banking arm.
Norrington's early retirement at the age of 57 follows his handing over
senior responsibility for the bank's risk management this year to Sir Peter
Middleton, its remaining deputy chairman. He has kept a role in risk
management, as well as overseeing personnel and property management.
The bank said that Norrington, who joined Barclays in 1960 and became a vice
chairman in March 1991 after being executive director in charge of overseas
operations, had decided to retire from December 3.
Norrington's executive responsibilities will pass to Taylor; his departure
will leave Alastair Robinson, head of its banking division, as sole vice
chairman. Taylor will take responsibility for the group credit policy unit,
which oversees the bank's lending.
The changes leave Sir Peter Middleton as chairman of the group credit policy
committee; Taylor will join this committee.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Management: Work without strain - Health Check / National
Back Pain Week starts in Britain on Monday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROL COOPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR some people, every week is back pain week. Although estimates vary, back
pain is responsible for more than 50m certified sick days a year in the UK,
and a sizeable loss of output by anyone's reckoning. Since some 80 per cent
of people in the west suffer back pain at some time, symptoms could be
considered part of the human condition, but they are not unavoidable.
Most of those afflicted have low back pain, because the greatest mechanical
stress is at the base, but pain can occur anywhere in the spine and may
radiate down a leg or arm. Symptoms usually resolve with a little rest along
with painkillers and perhaps local heat to ease muscle spasm.
The spine is a complex piece of machinery originally designed for creatures
that walked on all fours. Tumours and other diseases do occur, but the most
common cause of back pain is mechanical strain, which is where some problems
could be avoided.
Many accidents reported to the Health and Safety Executive arise from manual
handling of loads, but pain results from repetitive trauma as well as
one-off injuries.
The HSE publishes guidelines on the weight of loads that should be carried.
These are by no means absolute, for many factors - including workplace
routine and individual fitness - affect the risk of injury. Under the Manual
Handling Operations Regulations 1992, assessment of risk rests on the
employer.
Employees should also reduce the need for heavy or awkward handling in order
to lessen the dangers. There are several obvious ways to do this, from
making the load lighter to giving employees better training. Almost everyone
knows what a good lifting technique is, but few people - even those with
backache - put it into practice.
Backache also comes to those who sit and work. Research shows that much more
weight passes through the discs when sitting than when standing. Perhaps
this is because the spine's gentle S-shape is lost when seated. On car
journeys, it is worth stopping regularly to get out for a stretch, however
tight the schedules. If buying a car, it is a good idea to choose a model in
which the height as well as the angle of the seat can be adjusted.
In the office, the height of chair and/or desk may need adjustment. Short
breaks to stretch the back should be the order of the day.
Particular problems can arise with VDUs, of which there are close to 10m in
use in the UK. Mastering a PC should include attention to the physical
aspects of sitting at a terminal for any length of time.
Following EC directive 90/270, new legislation came into force in the UK on
1 January. It applies to those using VDUs for a significant part of the day,
and obliges employers to evaluate possible risks (both physical and mental)
to take steps to reduce risks, and to provide staff with information and
training.
Back problems are less likely if elbows are at right angles and the upper
arm vertical when using the keyboard. Shorter people may benefit from
footrests, and under the legislation anyone who asks must have one provided.
Chairs should tilt slightly forward, and the computer screen positioned
straight ahead in the line of vision, with the aid of monitor arms or
telephone directories. Unfortunately this may increase glare - and eye
symptoms - from the screen. It is also impossible to arrange with laptops.
Again, breaks are needed before tiredness sets in - at least once an hour
for a few minutes, or as long as it takes to remove one's eyes from the
screen and do some stretching, at the desk if it is impractical to get up.
The Organisation of Chartered Physiotherapists can give advice to businesses
on the ergonomics of office work (Tel: 0702 77462).
The HSE Information Centre is at Broad Lane, Sheffield S3 7HQ (Tel: 0742
892345; Fax: 0742 892333).
Chiropractors in the UK are offering free back-pain screenings and posture
checks next week (Call Freephone 0800 212618).

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
WATCH YOUR BACK
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -Keep your back straight and bend your knees when lifting. Hold the
  load close to your body, or, better still, use a trolley.
 -Adjust work surface heights so that you can work upright. If the
  surface has to be low, don't bend. Use a stool, chair, or kneel.
 -Don't slouch at work, at home, or in the car. Sit as upright as
  possible and place a small cushion at lower back height.
 -Try to keep your back's natural hollow when kneeling. Take some weight
  through the arms and stretch gently from time to time.
 -Sleep on a firm, comfortable mattress, on your back or side. Sleeping
  on your front can put stress on the lower back and neck.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Management: The best way to rear corporate babies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE lumbering behemoths let loose among a litter of their new-born, large
companies have a nasty habit of trampling their fledgling ventures to death.
The surviving progeny then take as long as eight to 10 years to stand
profitably on their own feet. Their parents would do far better to farm out
the task of child-rearing to experts who are better at it: the venture
capital community.
That just about sums up conventional wisdom on 'corporate venturing': the
spawning of internal ventures by established companies. After successive
waves of fashion since the 1960s, it fell out of favour in the mid-1980s, as
the well-publicised experiences of a few companies, including CBS and Shell,
seemed to show once again that 'intrapreneurship' was rarely worth the
effort and pain involved.
But this conventional wisdom is wrong on almost every count, according to a
controversial book from Harvard Business School Press by two
entrepreneurship professors. Called 'corporate venturing', it re-analyses
many studies on the subject.
Most large companies are certainly slow and clumsy. But the professors claim
that quite a number has demonstrated that a fair proportion of new ventures
can become profitable within two or three years if they are managed
properly, and that as many as half can do so within six years.
More surprising still, the book claims that a like-for-like comparison
between the record of corporate venturing and external venture capitalists
shows that the latter do no better than corporations: about one in 10
investments turns out to be a blockbuster, while two or three yield mediocre
returns, and the rest fail.
All this will startle anyone who remembers the spate of 1980s reports about
the abysmal experience of individual large companies with internal
diversification.
One should certainly be wary: the two academics, Zenas Block of New York
University and Ian MacMillan of Wharton, are unashamed evangelists for
corporate venturing. Moreover, assessment of ventures' success and failure,
even from large-scale statistical studies, can never be crystal-clear: it is
always coloured by certain assumptions.
Yet Block and MacMillan's conclusions are firm enough to rekindle the flames
of corporate interest in venturing, now that the need for whole-scale
revitalisation, rather than just restructuring, is being recognised by a
growing number of companies (see last Monday's article on corporate
creativity).
One researcher, above all, is to blame (or thank) for the poor reputation of
corporate venturing over most of the past decade: Ralph Biggadike.
His seminal study, of 68 ventures started by 35 large US companies, was
summarised in a widely-read 1979 article on 'the risky business of
diversification'. It concluded that individual new ventures needed, on
average, eight years to reach profitability, and that it took an average of
10 to 12 years for a company's return on investment in its entire venturing
activity to equal that of its mature businesses.
Block and MacMillan challenge Biggadike's reading of his own data, claiming
that these 'clearly show that nearly 50 per cent of ventures become
profitable within four years'.
This is far less clear than they claim, since the data are slightly
ambiguous. My re-reading of Biggadike's original article suggests he was
correct in citing a figure of 38 per cent. But this is still a respectable
success rate, even if he also showed that cashflow took twice as long to go
positive.
Block concedes that his book may overstate Biggadike's findings slightly,
but he points to a larger study a full decade later, which suggested that
more than 40 per cent of US ventures - a remarkable rate - had become
profitable after less than three years.
Leaving aside the question of whether all the early performers in that
survey would have remained profitable - in Biggadike's study, more than half
did not - Block is right when he complains that companies are too ready to
believe that a statistical study can be an accurate predictor of what will
happen if they take a particular course of action.
As he says, that ignores the unique character of every company and every
venture. Such studies can provide only general guidance. What matter are the
circumstances of each case, and how well management tailors its practical
actions to suit them.
It is here that the Block-MacMillan book is at its strongest. For instance,
it advises companies to avoid in most cases the popular - but dangerous -
step of of housing ventures in separate divisions from the mainstream
business.
Instead, says the book, they should frequently be placed within existing
divisions, but sheltered from normal planning and control systems; otherwise
they will be strangled. They should be given high-level sponsorship, but
must also manage political relationships and expectations.
In trying to make their culture more entrepreneurial and venture-friendly,
say the academics, companies should not follow the popular but ineffective
'cultural transplant' route: trying to imitate the innovative culture of
creative giants such as 3M. Instead, they should develop their own unique
brand of entrepreneurship by learning from their own past experience with
innovation projects - failures as well as successes. A new venture is no
less an experiment than one conducted in a scientific laboratory.
3M, Hewlett-Packard and a few other creative big companies have long shown
that such careful self-education is vital for a giant which wants to avoid
stifling its new ventures - and eventually consigning itself to oblivion.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Management: Meet the business schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The days when an MBA was the guaranteed passport to personal riches and an
exciting new job disappeared with the recession. The world's most popular
postgraduate business qualification is still widely admired, but,
increasingly, employers want to know where it was granted.
With more than 90 business schools offering courses in the UK alone - on top
of a highly visible dozen in continental Europe and a substantial
low-visiblity tail - individuals planning for the academic year starting
next October are overwhelmed by choice.
Given that the cost of a 12-month full-time course could be as much as
Pounds 25,000 - to which must be added lost earnings - their decision is not
likely to be a light one.
One way to survey the options is to look at one of the guides on the market.
These include the Economist Intelligence Unit's
Which MBA? (Pounds 21.90), Which Business Qualification? (Kogan Page, Pounds
16.95), and the Guide to Business Schools published by Pitman publishing
with the Association of MBAs (Pounds 16.99 including post and packing).
Another way is to attend AMBA's forthcoming Going To Business School
reception at the Institute of Directors in London on Monday October 18.
The event, which lasts from 4.30pm to 8.30pm, will be attended by 24 of the
top UK schools, eight continental European institutions, and eight North
American.
Approximately 800 would-be MBA students attended last year; the turnout this
time should be an indicator of whether the historic pattern of growth -
interrupted in 1992-93 - is likely to be resumed in 1994-95.
Entry is free but pre-registration is requested using the freephone number
of National Westminster Bank, the sponsor: 0800 282700.

Ladbroke obtained the injunction on September 25 after it had discovered

Ofwat, which sets the increases, has sometimes requested companies to

Under the proposed deals between Ofwat and Southern Water, North East Water,
Essex Water and Suffolk Water price rises will be more predictable. Similar

FT  08 OCT 93 / Gallup sees hope in housing market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST in buying houses and flats was last month at its highest level for
two years, according to a survey by Gallup, the market-research group, Peter
Marsh writes.
An index used by Gallup to illustrate people's readiness to inquire about
house purchases was 13.63 in September - after 12.08 in August. Gallup said
the rise in house-buying interest in recent months was 'consistent with a
modest price recovery' in housing.
However, it added that 'a significant minority' in its monthly poll of 2,000
people were being put off buying homes by fears about unemployment, lack of
savings and insufficient income.
People wishing to buy for the first time are more bullish about entering the
market than those already owning homes, the report says.

FT  08 OCT 93 / New towns commission to be split
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMISSION for the New Towns, which owns the remaining assets of the 21
former English new towns, is to be split into two agencies as part of a
wide-ranging restructuring.
The move, involving the loss of up to 240 jobs, is designed to help speed up
the sale of public-sector housing and land before the commission is wound up
in 1998.
Announcing the reorganisation yesterday, the commission said the first wave
of redundancies would be in December.
It follows a study by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, which
recommended cutbacks to match the commission's decreasing responsibilities
in areas where it has already sold most of its assets.
The commission will be split from June next year. CNT Land will handle sales
and planning for 18,000 acres of commission-owned land which the government
wants to see used for new development and infrastructure projects by the
turn of the century.
A separate agency, CNT 1998, will aim to sell off the remaining estates,
community parks and housing stock.
Both agencies will have their own boards and executive structures, although
their operations will be overseen by the existing main board.
Over the past 10 years assets worth more than Pounds 2bn have been sold off
in towns such as Milton Keynes and Harlow.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Shephard sets her sights on farmworkers' wages board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The National Farmers Union yesterday called on the government to keep the
Agricultural Wages Board in its present form. The NFU's ruling body was
responding to the government's consultation of the farming industry on the
board's future. The NFU argued that the board was essential to maintain
stability and harmony in the industry. It encouraged genuine career
progression and training as well as guaranteeing basic working conditions.
There was no evidence to suggest wage costs were unduly inflated by the
board's existence, it said.
Alison Maitland reports on the unlikely alliance of farming unions and
employers seeking to retain the country's last statutory pay body
MR NORMAN Davidson, a tractor driver, works 52 hours a week, starting at 5am
or 6.30am and knocking off at around 5pm. He is on duty for 12 consecutive
days before having two days off.
Working with his boss and two colleagues at Yewtree dairy farm in the heart
of Kent, he does everything from milking the 180-strong herd to clearing
slurry, mending fences and ploughing.
For this he takes home Pounds 190 a week. Yet Mr Davidson, who has worked on
farms for 20 years, counts himself lucky.
Thanks to the Agricultural Wages Board, whose future is in jeopardy because
of a government review, he lives rent-free in his tied cottage. He earns a
reasonable overtime rate, has at least three weeks' paid holiday a year and
is entitled to buy farm produce for his family at wholesale prices.
The board is the country's last remaining statutory body fixing minimum
wages for low-paid workers. It is in the sights of Mrs Gillian Shephard, the
agriculture minister, who steered legislation abolishing wages councils
through parliament when she was employment secretary. This time she faces
opposition from an unlikely alliance of employers and the Transport and
General Workers Union, whose agricultural branch speaks for the country's
240,000 farmworkers.
Tomorrow, the TGWU and the Labour party plan to take their campaign to Mrs
Shephard's Norfolk constituency with a rally demanding that the board be
retained. The board, whose powers stem from the 1948 Agricultural Wages Act,
sets minimum pay for a 39-hour week for five grades of farmworker, starting
at Pounds 138. It provides for sick pay, holidays, overtime rates and a
ceiling of Pounds 1.50 a week rent for tied cottages.
Mr Davidson fears the loss of these benefits. 'It would be every man for
himself,' he said. 'It's not so much the money, it's the security. There
would be a lot of disquiet because you would have no basis for knowing what
you're entitled to.'
The National Farmers Union said that 85 per cent to 90 per cent of its
members support the board and yesterday its council called for it to be
kept.
Mr Davidson's boss, farmer Mr David Prentice, says abolition would lead to
higher wages for some skilled workers, particularly on livestock farms where
they are needed round the clock. But isolated farmworkers with little clout
could well see cuts in real income, while farmers could face strife on their
doorstep.
'I don't want the aggravation of negotiations,' he said. 'I don't want to
see the safety net of the wages board going. If I had an argument with these
three people now, I'd be well and truly up the creek.'
Under pressure from both sides of the industry, the government has extended
the period of consultation until November. It says it is open-minded on the
issue.
Moreover, time is of the essence. The government has to denounce two
International Labour Organisation conventions on minimum wages and paid
holidays in agriculture if it wants to abolish the board, and it can do this
only once every 10 years. The year-long period for deratifying ILO
Convention 99 began this August, while that applying to Convention 101
begins next summer.
The minimum pay machinery has arguably helped to keep wages down because
farmers have been able to say they are doing well by their workforce simply
by paying slightly over the odds. Farmworkers acknowledge the board is not
perfect but say that without it they would face falling wages and rising
rents which could drive them off the land, hastening rural decay. Thirty
people left the industry every day last year.
The government may choose to avoid another high-profile battle, especially
when it is trying to win back the rural vote from the Liberal Democrats. Mrs
Shephard's preference could well be to keep the baord, given that she
represents a farming constituency.
The views of Conservative MPs in shire counties will be important but
ultimately it may be the clout of farmers that settles the issue.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Unions claim BT is targeting for redundancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS representing workers at British Telecommunications yesterday claimed
the company was introducing a grading system which could be used to target
individuals for redundancy.
The points system draws upon individual's annual performance assessment,
their attendance records and whether or not disciplinary action has been
taken against them. Age was to have been a factor but this was dropped by BT
after complaints from the National Communications Union and the Society of
Telecom Executives.
BT, which employs 170,000, down from a peak of 250,000 in 1984, has been
shedding jobs for the past five years.
It now wants to make an audit of its staff in different operations as part
of an exercise to define the shape and skill-mix of its future organisation.
Staff in units that need to be slimmed down will be selected, on the basis
of the points system, either to remain in their jobs or to transfer to a
're-deployment unit'.
It will be staff at the bottom of the scale who will be transferred to the
redeployment unit and trained for other vacancies. At present there are 527
managers in this unit with 348 vacancies logged with it.
The NCU, the largest union within BT, said it was concerned that the
redeployment unit could be seen as a 'dumping ground' with individuals
within it vulnerable to being targeted for redundancy. It objected to people
being de-selected from their jobs on the basis of what it called 'an
arbitrary points system'.
BT said that people in the redeployment unit might be offered jobs they did
not want to take but they had a choice,as there was a voluntary redundancy
package.
BT, which at present is locked in talks with the NCU on the points system,
said it was committed to the goal of achieving planned reductions in jobs by
voluntary means.
The company, which wants to shed 15,000 jobs this year and a similar number
next year, said it could not make a categorical denial that there would
never be any compulsory redundancies. But it said: 'We are doing everything
we can to stick with volunteers for redundancy.'
Traditionally, British companies have chosen workers for enforced redundancy
on the principle that the shortest-serving employees go first.
Employers have grown increasingly unhappy with this system, mainly because
it gives managers little control over who goes. Considerable numbers in the
recession, including National Westminster Bank and Aston Martin, the luxury
carmaker, have turned to alternative methods - in particular selection
criteria which may draw upon performance, skills, versatility and
attendance.
Companies are well placed if they have performance appraisal systems in
place. Indeed, companies are frequently advised that an indirect benefit of
appraisal systems is that they can provide evidence of fairness in
redundancy selection.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Charges dropped against West Midlands officers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE West Midlands police officers left the Old Bailey yesterday after
charges of perjury and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice in
connection with the prosecution of the Birmingham Six were dropped.
Mr Justice Garland ruled that a fair trial was no longer possible for the
three - Detective Constable Terence Woodwiss (left), retired Detective
Superintendent George Reade (centre) and Detective Sergeant Colin Morris.
The judge had heard lengthy legal arguments from their barristers that the
men could never receive a fair trial because of 'saturation' publicity since
the Birmingham Six were freed by the Appeal Court in March 1991.
The detectives had all denied the charges when they appeared in court on
Monday last week.
In a statement yesterday four of the Birmingham Six said: 'Today's decision
saddens and does not surprise us.'

FT  08 OCT 93 / Business backs fight on illiteracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Literacy Trust, a new charity financed by business to
co-ordinate efforts to combat illiteracy, was launched yesterday.
The launch follows the finding earlier this year by the Adult Literacy and
Basic Skills Unit that one in five adults had problems with reading and
writing.
Several large corporate backers, including WH Smith, the retailer, and
Pearson, which owns the Financial Times, are funding the trust, which will
target improvements to parents' literacy, and 'home-school' partnerships.
Its council includes Lord Walker of Worcester, former Tory cabinet minister;
Baroness Dean, former leader of Sogat, the printers' union; and Mr Simon
Jenkins, The Times' columnist.
The trust's founders have already consulted with more than 50 organisations
working in the field of illiteracy, and will promote good practice and
organise its own campaigns.
Ms Usha Prashar, the trust's deputy chairman, said the trust would attempt
to promote reading as a positive activity.
A survey which was carried out for the trust found that 24 per cent of
adults never read fiction books, while only 7.4 per cent described reading
as 'fun'.
Mr Neil McClelland, director of the trust, said: 'A lot of people start to
turn off reading for pleasure at the adolescent stage, because it isn't seen
as the thing to do. We will try to make a contribution towards changing
that.'
The survey also found that 77.4 per cent of adults felt that the ability to
read was a more important skill than the ability to use computers.
However, a survey of 400 businesses by Nielsen Consumer Research found that
86 per cent thought it was important for school-leavers to have experience
with personal computers.
The need for experience with industry-compatible computers - rather than the
Apple and Acorn systems mostly used in schools - was highlighted by 83 per
cent.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Power company to make 350 redundancies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND ADBURGHAM, Wales and West Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH Western Electricity, criticised in a report by Which? magazine
yesterday as having the most expensive tariffs in England, is to make 350
people redundant as part of a cost-cutting programme.
The losses, to be made 'at all levels' next year, represent 10 per cent of
the company's staff in its core electricity business and follow a similar
percentage cut over the past two years. The privatised utility has 1.2m
business and domestic customers in Avon, Somerset, Devon and Cornwall.
Mr Derek Lickorish, customer service and marketing manager, said yesterday
that Sweb was responding to the electricity supply review by Professor
Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator. He added that the cost-cutting
was 'part of an ongoing commitment to contribute to price stability. We want
to maintain Sweb's competitiveness'.
He added: 'We hope to achieve the job losses through natural wastage,
redeployment and voluntary redundancy.' Other measures will include internal
restructuring, retraining and a consolidation of office locations.
Other regional electricity companies have been shedding jobs to improve
efficiency. Several thousand jobs have been lost in the past year alone and,
with the companies under pressure from Prof Littlechild to contain costs,
many more redundancies are expected. Southern Electric has already announced
that 1,000 jobs will go over the next three years.
Which? said that Sweb was the equal worst of the regional electricity
companies at keeping appointments and worst at connecting new customers
quickly. But it said the company had won a government charter mark for
improvements in service.
Mr Lickorish defended Sweb's service record. He said: 'We do not believe we
have poor standards but that does not mean we are complacent.'
Mr John Seed, chief executive, said Sweb had responded effectively to the
changing demands on it.
In June, Sweb reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 101.1m, up 22 per cent on
the previous year. Yesterday its share price closed at 578p, up 7p.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Bus group warns of VAT threat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VALUE ADDED TAX on bus fares could put many operators out of business and
lead to 15,000 job losses in the industry, the Bus and Coach Council warned
yesterday.
The council, representing operators and manufacturers with a annual turnover
of Pounds 4bn, said such a move in next month's Budget would drive
passengers off bus services and force operators to raise fares by more than
30 per cent to maintain their profit margins.
The bus industry, like British Rail, fears that the Treasury is planning to
levy VAT on fares to help reduce the public-sector deficit.
Industry executives yesterday told Mr Roger Freeman, the transport minister,
that increased taxation would make services operated by many companies
unviable and leave no room for investment in new models.
Mr Bill Cottham, president of the council, said: 'VAT would wipe out a lot
of companies and would have a damaging knock-on effect on orders for
manufacturers.'
Speaking at the industry's trade fair in Birmingham, Mr Freeman said: 'It is
a matter for the Treasury rather than the Department of Transport.'
Although operators are likely to bear the brunt of any move to impose VAT on
fares, manufacturers said yesterday there would be a damaging impact on
orders just when they were beginning to show signs of recovery. Fare
increases would leave operators with no resources to buy new models.
Mr Sandy Glennie, managing director of Volvo Buses, the UK subsidiary of the
Swedish automotive group, said: 'We've just moved back into profit after two
years of losses. More taxation would be a setback and would undermine the
fragile increase in orders.'
His concern was echoed at Northern Counties, the Wigan-based manufacturer
which was rescued from receivership last year by a management buy-out. Mr
Lindsay Khan, finance director, said such companies had only won orders
because of failures among other manufacturers.
'The market is too vulnerable to withstand reduced spending by operators,'
he warned.
Mr Freeman acknowledged the council's fears but refused to comment on
whether such a policy change was being planned by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor.
The Treasury declined to comment on whether VAT would be extended to fares.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Dublin supports plea for public inquiry on Thorp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRISH government has thrown its weight behind those calling for a public
inquiry to be held before the Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield
is granted revised authorisations for radioactive discharges.
In its second submission to the UK authorities, the Irish government says
there is 'no sound economic case' to be made for going ahead with the
project.
Mr Brian Cowen, Irish minister for transport and energy, yesterday said he
was publishing the submission due 'to the concerns and fears held in this
island regarding Sellafield'. He added: 'I wish to highlight and reinforce
with our European Community colleagues the Irish government's concerns and
misgivings regarding the British nuclear industry and the Sellafield plant
in particular.'
The report says: 'There are no demonstrable overall economic or security
benefits arising out of Thorp's operation which would justify it or balance
out possible and likely risks to public health and environmental damage. A
narrow base of benefits to BNFL (British Nuclear Fuels) or the UK economy
alone is not a sufficient justification.'
The Irish government says that 'important points of substance specifically
related to the draft discharge authorisations' made in its first submission
'had not been adequately addressed' by UK authorities.
The submission says 'the bringing on-stream of Thorp represents an
additional and unnecessary risk to the health and safety of the population'.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Sand for the desert is no mirage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY USED to talk about hauling coals to Newcastle as the ultimate in
unlikely business. The modern equivalent might be chips to Silicon Valley -
or sand from the UK to the Middle East.
For the past year, Mr Ted Bonner has been doing just that, arranging for the
dispatch of container loads of sand to Oman and other countries in the
Middle East.
This unlikely export involves silica sand, widely used in filters for water
treatment in desalination plants, sewage works and - especially - swimming
pools.
Silica sand is not readily available in the Middle East. It has to be
imported, creating an opportunity for UK-produced silica sand that Mr Bonner
is determined to exploit.
A civil engineer, Mr Bonner went to work in Oman in 1980, and returned to
the UK last year. He had been working for a swimming pool company in Oman,
which became his first customer for the sand.
Working from his home in Caunsall near Kidderminster, Mr Bonner has set up
EG Exports - the name is based on his initials. He gets the sand from two
companies in Leighton Buzzard and Stoke-on-Trent, and arranges for its
export.
Mr Bonner admits that the business has its curious side. 'I was in Dubai
earlier this year, sitting in an office discussing the price of silica sand
when there was a sandstorm outside,' he said.
He is optimistic about growing business, which might soon have to take extra
staff. One Middle East customer prefers UK silica sand to its US counterpart
because it is better quality.
Not content with selling sand, Mr Bonner is also exporting the water filters
themselves, and even heaters and radiators for those cold desert nights.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONHOUSE, a London-based property company which owns Queens West, one of
Cardiff's best-known shopping centres, has gone into administrative
receivership.
Queens West, which was valued at Pounds 30m when it opened in Cardiff city
centre six years ago, has 70,000 sq ft of retail space on three floors and a
food theatre with seating for 430 people.
The centre's tenants include Laura Ashley, Currys, Burton and Dorothy
Perkins, but there are many vacant units. It is continuing to trade
normally.
Mr Mark Batten and Mr John Soden, of Price Waterhouse, have been appointed
joint administrative receivers. Mr Batten said yesterday that although
retailing in Cardiff had stood up well in the recession, Queens West had
suffered from not having quite as good a location as the rival St David's
Centre.
He said a number of options were being considered for the centre and, in the
meantime, it was business as usual. He added there would be a marketing
campaign to attract new shops.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Former Shell man jailed
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER engineer with Shell was jailed for 12 months at Southwark Crown
Court yesterday for accepting bribes to influence the award of a contract
for a floating accommodation vessel to be used in the North Sea.
Mr Francis Hemsworth, formerly a senior engineer with the oil company, had
pleaded guilty to two charges of corruptly accepting payments that totalled
more than Pounds 31,000.
The payments were made to him to influence the awarding of the contract for
the vessel to be used in Shell's Gannet oil field in the North Sea.
Mr John Napier, a former marketing manager, was also imprisoned for 12
months after pleading guilty to corruptly offering the bribes to Mr
Hemsworth.
Confiscation orders were also made against both men. Mr Hemsworth was
ordered to pay Pounds 31,000 and Mr Napier Pounds 25,467. Both men were also
ordered to pay part of the prosecution costs. Mr Hemsworth was ordered to
pay Pounds 6,500 and Mr Napier Pounds 13,500.
The convictions followed one of a series of investigations by the Serious
Fraud Office into corruption in the awarding of contracts in the North Sea
oil fields operated by both Shell and British Petroleum.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Teachers oppose truancy tables
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Association of Head Teachers yesterday urged Mr John Patten,
the education secretary, to change his plans for publishing truancy league
tables for schools next month.
Mr David Hart, the association's general secretary, described the proposed
tables as 'dangerously false' because they would be based on how many pupils
had missed at least one half-day of school, rather than on the total amount
of days missed through truancy.
He said the former figure would produce 'such extreme variations in the
published data as to make it meaningless'.
Mr Hart added that many truancies lasting for only a half-day were
parentally condoned, and that this could distort the figures for school
comparisons, leaving 'a very real prospect of government policy in this area
being exposed to ridicule'.
Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said the association's
complaints, made in a letter to Mr Patten, provided 'alarming evidence of
the consequences of government by gimmick'.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR more water companies have proposed deals with Ofwat, the water
regulator, that would reduce the scope for varying each year's price rises,
Bronwen Maddox writes.
Ofwat, which sets the annual price rises, has sometimes requested companies
to restrain increases, while companies have sometimes negotiated extra rises
to cover unexpected costs.
Under the proposed deals between Ofwat and Southern Water, North East Water,
Essex Water and Suffolk Water price rises will be more predictable. Similar
deals have been made with five other companies.
Next year Ofwat will review the industry's pricing structure and will set
price rises for 1995 to 2005.

FT  08 OCT 93 / DIY lobbying mailbags MPs: How the sub-postmasters got their
message across at Westminster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ART of political lobbying has developed strongly in recent years. For
one, there is much more of it: one Labour MP recently put annual growth in
the specialist lobbying sector at between 20 and 25 per cent. Moreover,
techniques are increasingly sophisticated, but one of the best ways to get
results - especially when the government has an inadequate majority - is
still through filling MPs' mailbags.
By this yardstick, the most successful campaign of the last parliamentary
session was masterminded, a little improbably, by the National Federation of
Sub-Postmasters.
The federation's aim was to derail plans to save money by 'pressurising'
people into having pensions and benefits paid direct into a bank or building
society accounts instead of collecting them at a post office. The
sub-postmasters feared this would hit the post office network hard.
Mr Colin Baker, the federation's general secretary, said the sub-postmasters
had 'a number of offers' from specialist lobbyists but 'declined them all'.
The extraordinary public response the campaign generated suggests this was
the right decision.
The federation was persuaded that a campaign was necessary when in early
March the government circulated to new pensioners three batches of trial
forms inviting them to decide how they wanted to be paid. One variant did
not mention post-office payment as an option; another referred to it only
cursorily. Mr Baker regarded this as 'withholding information'.
After letters to ministers failed to elicit a satisfactory explanation, the
federation took matters into its own hands by publicising the position on
local radio and drafting leaflets for all 23,000 post office branches.
A total of 6m went out, under the heading 'Beware] Your post office is under
threat', urging customers to write to their MPs. It was left to individual
sub-postmasters to decide whether to hand out the leaflets in branches or
deliver them with the morning post.
The approach was simple but the effect was the talk of Westminster for some
weeks. It was not unusual to hear MPs, huddled in corridors and bars as they
wearily awaited the next Maastricht vote, comparing the size of their post
office mailbags.
Mr Ian Paisley, the leader of the Democratic Unionist party said: 'After 22
years' membership of the House, I have some experience of large postbags.
But no constituency issue has ever brought a bigger one than this issue.'
Mr David Rendel, the Liberal Democrat victor in the Newbury by-election,
used his maiden speech in the Commons to say he was 'struck' by how often
the subject was raised on the doorstep.
He said: 'If the secretary of state has done anything for post offices
lately, it is perhaps that many extra stamps have been sold to pensioners
who have written to their members of parliament on this subject.'
Mr Baker suspects that the form of the letters was important as well as the
numbers in which they came. 'They were not organised petitions or
stereotyped letters,' he said. 'We did not put words in people's mouths.'
Even in the days of three-figure majorities, the government would have been
hard-pressed to ignore such a show of opinion, which was soon being
exploited gleefully by Labour.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, promised swiftly that forms to
be sent to those approaching pension age would 'mention the post office
option'.
The torrent of letters may even have influenced the government's decision to
delay privatising the Post Office by excluding the necessary legislation
from its outline programme for the next parliamentary session.
Perhaps more importantly for the Post Office's long-term future, the
government has begun to examine how new technology might be used to improve
the efficiency of paying benefit through post offices.
Mr Baker believes this could be the key to keeping everyone happy, providing
improved efficiency for the government and better service for customers,
while helping to ensure that the post office network is preserved.

FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Tebbit forecasts fresh
divisions over Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservative party has bridged its disunity over the Maastricht treaty
but could face further divisions in the European parliament elections in
June, Lord Tebbit said last night.
Lord Tebbit, one of the strongest Conservative opponents of the treaty, said
the party was 'completely agreed' about the free-market vision for the EC
set out by Mr John Major, the prime minister, in a recent article in The
Economist.
His comments, at a debate on the future of Conservatism with Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the chancellor, reflect a widely held rightwing view that the prime
minister has embraced many of the objectives of the party's Euro-sceptics.
Lord Tebbit said he would not campaign for Conservative candidates in the
European elections who endorsed the party's links with the 'federalist'
European People's party grouping in the European Parliament.
In a jibe aimed at alleged federalist sympathies among Conservative MEPs, he
said many were angry about the prime minister's Economist article because
'they think he has sold out to the British people'.
Lord Tebbit said that he believed a widespread boycott of 'federalist'
candidates by Euro-sceptic Tory party workers was unlikely. But he warned:
'I can only campaign for some (candidates) and I shall campaign for the guys
I like.'
He told the meeting, which was organised by The Sunday Telegraph, that
Conservative voters wanted 'to be able to vote for real Conservative
candidates,' committed to a manifesto based on Mr Major's article.
'The danger is that if the candidates don't say the things and stand for the
things which Conservative voters like, you can't go into people's houses and
grab them by the scruff of the neck and force them out,' he said.
Mr Clarke said he had no sympathy for European federalism, and suggested
that European Monetary Union was unlikely to occur until after the present
generation of political leaders had left parliament.
He said the Conservative party was not committed to the federalist
objectives of other members of the EPP, which was a coalition of like-minded
but not identical national parties.

FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Brittan says EMU project
still alive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Leon Brittan, the EC's Trade Commissioner, yesterday warned the
Conservative party against thinking that the recent crisis in the European
exchange rate mechanism had signalled an end of the European Monetary Union
project, James Blitz writes.
Addressing a fringe meeting to rally support for next year's European
elections, Sir Leon said that, far from abandoning the Emu project ,
Britain's European partners were preparing themselves to re-think the
project against a different time-scale.
'It is not realistic to think that the concept of Emu will go away or be
destroyed,' said Sir Leon. 'The lesson our European partners have learned is
that the concept of Emu will have to be achieved in a different way.'

FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Mortgage tax relief
system on Budget agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is reviewing the system of mortgage tax relief, but no
decisions have been taken and it wants to avoid steps that would deliver a
shock to the housing market.
The Treasury has put a further reduction of tax relief on mortgage interest
payments on its list of possible revenue-raising measures in the November 30
Budget. But it is understood that detailed discussions of the taxation side
of the Budget have yet to begin.
Asked about his plans for mortgage tax relief yesterday, Mr Kenneth Clarke,
the chancellor, said only that he was looking 'at all possible options in
taxation' and that his Budget was not yet finalised.
Close associates of Mr John Major, the prime minister, said yesterday that
he would be very reluctant to accept any move that would be perceived as a
break of the Tory general election manifesto promise to 'maintain' mortgage
interest relief.
They indicated that the government would therefore be unlikely to take such
a radical step as abolishing relief for new home buyers from April 1995 as
reported in yesterday's Guardian newspaper. However, it is also clear that
mortgage tax relief is no longer a sacred cow for the Conservative party.
Relief is due to be pared from April as part of staged tax increases
announced in the March Budget. From 1994-95 relief will be granted at the
lowest 20 per cent rate of income tax on interest paid up to the Pounds
30,000 ceiling for mortgages, compared with 25 per cent at present.
Treasury ministers are keen to see a further erosion in mortgage interest
relief which represents a substantial cost to the exchequer and is regarded
as a factor which distorts the British housing market.
Mortgage interest relief cost the government Pounds 5.2bn in 1992-93. But
this burden has fallen in line with lower interest rates so the cost in
1993-94 is estimated at Pounds 4.3bn. The Treasury estimates that it will
cost Pounds 3.6bn next year.
The low interest rates - with mortgage rates about half the level of the
early 1990s - should help ease political resistance to any move cutting
mortgage interest relief in the Budget. Homeowners are substantially better
off than a year ago, while tax relief on a Pounds 30,000 mortgage is now
worth only about Pounds 600 a year.
However, the housing market is still fragile and lagging the economic
recovery. In view of this ministers are approaching the issue cautiously.

FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Plans set to simplify NHS
management structure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS TO reshape the central management structure of the National Health
Service will be announced by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, next
month.
A simplification of the higher levels of NHS management could lead to
substantial job losses in regional health authorities and the service's
Leeds-based management executive.
Mrs Bottomley told the Conservative conference yesterday that her proposals
would reduce the number of health authorities. 'They will both simplify and
clarify structures, and provide more resources for patient care.'
Since the summer ministers have been considering the report of the functions
and manpower review, a committee set up to look at the service's
higher-level management needs following the market-based 1991 NHS reforms.
The committee's report presented a range of options. But ministers appear to
favour reducing the 14 English regional health authorities to about eight.
These would be amalgamated with regional outposts of the management
executive which have, since 1991, liaised with trust hospitals. A subsequent
stage of the restructuring exercise could lead to the abolition of regional
authorities as separate statutory bodies.
Slimming down the central management structure would offer Mrs Bottomley the
immediate advantage of being able to divert funds into clinical services at
a time of severe public spending constraints.
Supporters of the market-based philosophy behind the NHS reforms believe a
smaller central structure would increase the freedom of trust hospitals and
district purchasing authorities. But the abolition of regional authorities
would be challenged by campaigners for greater democratic accountability in
the NHS. Regional authorities' non-executive members, while not elected, are
chosen to reflect community interests.
Mrs Bottomley announced yesterday that a further 99 NHS trusts will become
operational next April, bringing to 389 the number of hospitals, community
and ambulance services run directly by their local managements. By April,
trusts will be responsible for more than 90 per cent of hospital and
community health service revenue. Mrs Bottomley will make decisions on a
further 44 trust applications later this year.
Mrs Bottomley said trust status - which removes hospitals from the control
of district health authorities - had benefited patients.
Waiting times had been reduced, and 116 patients were being treated compared
to 100 before the switch to trust status.
Dr Sandy Macara, chairman of the British Medical Association council, said
the health secretary had recognised in her conference speech that there had
been a substantial increase in NHS productivity, but this had not been
matched by the necessary increase in resources.

FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: 'Green' VAT move defended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel and power would help
towards a 'cleaner, greener world', Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, said
yesterday.
He told a fringe meeting in Blackpool: 'We as Conservatives are committed to
putting our money where our pollution is. If we pollute, we pay.'
He told the Tory Green Initiative meeting: 'We are harnessing the market to
create a greener, cleaner Britain and a cleaner, greener world.
'That's why we as a party must throw our full might behind the Budget
decision to extend VAT to domestic fuel.'
He added: 'The fact is that nearly all of us spend too much on heating our
homes.'
The heating bill for a three-bedroomed semi-detached house was more than
Pounds 500 a year, he said. But a modern energy-efficient house with full
insulation and modern boiler could be heated for Pounds 150.
He confirmed the government's commitment to using market instruments, such
as tradeable permits, to meet environmental goals.
He said the Department of the Environment was considering introducing such
permits, which control the amount of a pollutant that is allowed to be
discharged, for sulphur dioxide emissions.
'The principle here is that if the emissions from your factory are lower
than they might otherwise be, you have surplus pollution permits which you
can sell to some other factory who are exceeding their allowances,' he said.
'Your company makes money out of your environmental awareness, the other guy
pays - in cash - for his environmental profligacy.'
Among other similar initiatives, Mr Yeo said the government was also
investigating incentive charges to control water pollution and charges for
water abstraction.
On waste disposal, he said the introduction of a landfill levy would
'increase the cost of this method of waste disposal and thus increase the
financial attractions of more environmentally desirable alternatives'.
He added: 'Producer responsibility would give a further and substantial
boost to recycling by giving packaging producers and fillers (including
retailers) an incentive to reduce packaging waste and recycle it wherever
practicable.'

FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Lamont urges tough public
spending cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the former chancellor, yesterday demanded a cut in public
spending, and warned the government that tax increases would cost it the
next general election.
Mr Lamont, who was sacked in May by Mr John Major, the prime minister, said
the government must take 'unpalatable decisions' on spending in its first
two years in office.
'Two per cent of (spending) programmes across the board would give us over
Pounds 5bn,' he said. 'Does anyone in government really believe that
programmes cannot be cut across the board by 2 percentage points?
'We are the party of low taxation, of limited government and free
enterprise. That and that alone is the path that will lead our party to its
fifth election victory.'
Mr Lamont's comments, at a meeting organised by the Bow Group, amounted to a
determined bid for leadership of the rightwing backbenchers who are
concerned about the prospect of Budget tax increases.
He challenged Mr Major's description of Baroness Thatcher's government as
'the golden age that never was', saying Britain was 'strengthened
immeasurably' in the 1980s by 'the most successful government since the
war'.
He also called for an independent central bank and tough action on
inflation, reductions in capital gains tax and a further round of
privatisation, including Royal Mail.
Mr Lamont said the government deficit was likely to be less than the
projected Pounds 50bn, but warned that the structural deficit would not be
eradicated by economic recovery.
He said tax increases in the last Budget, in March, were necessary to
convince the financial markets that the government was serious about
controlling the public finances.
But the size of the increase, which raised 12.5 per cent more revenue than
Sir Geoffrey Howe's 1981 Budget, ruled out further tax rises.
'While it is possible to have such a large tax-raising Budget once a decade,
it is completely impossible to have two in the space of nine months,' he
said.
Mr Lamont said the government must confront those who were 'accustomed to
large increases in spending every year. The party, the government and the
country must understand that those days are over.'
He also attacked the refusal by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to reopen
negotiations on next year's Pounds 253bn public spending total, agreed when
Mr Lamont was chancellor.
'That will not do for a tax-cutting party. High taxes to finance high
spending are not the Conservative way,' he said.
He put forward a list of measures to cut spending, including taxing
invalidity benefits, equalising state pensions at 65, moving the pension age
to 67, and contracting out unemployment and invalidity benefits.
Mr Lamont said the government must 'look at' these policies if the party was
to take control of public spending. 'We Conservatives talk a lot about
reducing what the government does. But are we up to it?' he said.

FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Upbeat Clarke warns on
borrowing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE, the chancellor, yesterday delivered an upbeat assessment
of the recovery but warned that tough decisions must be taken in next
month's Budget to reduce government borrowing.
The recovery 'is really happening', he said.
Although he was 'concerned a bit' that the recovery was 'still not very
strong', the economy was 'going along quite well'. While there were
occasional 'blips', the recovery was stronger than the government could have
hoped at the time of the Budget in March, he said.
Since he succeeded Mr Norman Lamont as chancellor in May, Mr Clarke has
avoided trumpeting Britain's growth performance and has frequently warned of
the dangers posed by the recession among Britain's main trading partners in
continental Europe.
Yesterday, while acknowledging that unemployment and crime rates were too
high, he struck an optimistic note.
Britain was the first country in Europe to come out of recession and was set
to grow faster than any of its main European competitors this year and next.
'We can begin to lift our horizons to look beyond recovery and set ourselves
the realistic aim of making Britain the most dynamic and most successful
economy in Europe,' Mr Clarke told the conference.
The UK, he said, had 'good news to build on'. Interest rates were at their
lowest levels for 16 years. Inflation was 'down - and staying down'.
However, Mr Clarke said that Britain 'must lead the way' in reducing
government borrowing. He said that his first duty as chancellor was to
tackle debt by reining back public spending. But he did not rule out tax
increases in his November 30 Budget.
'As Margaret Thatcher discovered in her courageous Budget of 1981, when the
first priority is to balance the books, tight control over public spending
is not always enough.'
The chancellor said that everyone wanted lower income taxes - and a tax
system that protected the saver and encouraged the investor and
entrepreneur. However, he said it was necessary to get back to sound public
finances to achieve this.
Mr Clarke strongly defended the tax increases announced in the March Budget
by Mr Lamont. These were 'absolutely vital'.
Most of the increased revenue would come from people in work, with the
better off paying the most. Three quarters of the tax increases would come
from higher National Insurance contributions, cuts in income tax allowances
and a clampdown on tax avoidance. Mr Clarke was unrepentant about the plans
to raise nearly Pounds 3bn in a full year through levying value added tax on
domestic fuel from April.
Defending the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel, he pointed out that: two
thirds of the revenue would come from households with Pounds 12,000 a year
or more; gas, coal and electricity prices had come down so prices would be
unchanged in real terms from five years ago; extra help would be given to
the poorest members of society.

FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Minister steps up dole
fraud attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID HUNT yesterday made a thinly disguised call for people to shop dole
cheats as he pledged to continue to resist European Community plans for
mandatory workers' consultation in the decisions of multinational companies.
The employment secretary told a Blackpool press conference he was determined
that the government's fight against dole cheats - which has already netted
some 65,000 false claimants - should be intensified.
'Everyone who is a dole cheat is taking money away from the unemployed,' he
said. 'We cannot afford when resources are scarce . . . to allow that to
happen.'
Asked whether people should be encouraged to inform on fraudsters, Mr Hunt
said: 'I don't want to talk about informers but I think everyone in the
community wants to see law and order restored.
'There is a real determination among government and community in partnership
to weed out people who do not respect the rule of the law. People are
becoming more and more intolerant of people abusing the system.'
In a rabble-rousing speech under the watchful gaze of Baroness Thatcher, the
former prime minister, Mr Hunt promised to veto compulsory works councils at
next week's meeting of the EC's social affairs council in Luxembourg.
The EC served notice last month of its intention to sidestep the British
government's resistance and press ahead with the directive establishing the
councils as soon as the Maastricht treaty was ratified.
Britain would not be directly affected, as it has opted out of Maastricht's
social chapter. But about 100 UK multinationals would be drawn in through
their European subsidiaries.
Offering plenty of red meat for the party's ascendant right wing to chew on,
Mr Hunt, one of the most left-leaning cabinet ministers, called for all EC
directives to be weighed against a new charter for competitiveness.
'If they seem to damage the competitiveness of our businesses without good
reason, they should be booted right out,' he said.
in a strong appeal for unity, he had some stiff words for Tory MPs who voted
for Maastricht's social chapter earlier this year as part of their tactical
manoeuvring to try and scupper the treaty. That was, he said: 'one sight I
hope never to see again'.

COMPANIES IN Nottinghamshire have suffered a sharp decline in export orders
with the worsening recession in continental Europe, the county's chamber of
commerce said yesterday.
The number of companies reporting increased overseas sales in the last
quarter fell to the lowest level since September 1991, according to the
chamber's latest economic survey. Domestic orders, however, have improved
with 42 per cent of companies reporting rising UK demand, a 17 percentage
point increase on the same quarter last year.

FT  08 OCT 93 / 'Serious money' sought for home rentals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR George Young, the housing minister, said discussions were taking place
with pension funds and insurance companies about the action needed to secure
the investment of 'serious long-term money' in residential accommodation.
He contrasted the readiness of financial institutions to invest in
high-quality rented flats in Paris and New York with their unwillingness to
do so in Britain.
Sir George said he was working with City institutions and builders to find a
way to develop the policies which had proved successful in halting the
decline in the private rented sector.
He described it as a 'paradox' that after 14 consecutive years of
Conservative government, the rented market was still dominated by the public
sector.
Sir George noted that three quarters of those occupying rented accommodation
were either tenants of a local authority or a housing association.
He did not comment on a call by Mr Mark Tennant, a director of the largest
private rented property company in the UK, for the ending of tax relief on
mortgage interest for owner-occupiers.
Mr Tennant admitted that in advocating such a step he would be as popular as
'Attila the Hun', but insisted that there could not be 'a level playing
field' so long as tax relief on mortgage interest continued.
He also pressed for the streamlining of the legal processes for securing the
payment of rent arrears.
Sir George confirmed that the government intended to change the legislation
on providing housing for the homeless so that unmarried pregnant teenagers
were more likely to be accommodated in hostels rather than flats.
He emphasised the need to distinguish between providing 'an essential safety
net' and a device for jumping the housing queue.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Scots bank staff to vote on strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Royal Bank of Scotland is facing widespread disruption to its financial
activities as its 700-strong computer staff are balloted by banking union
Bifu to support a series of one-day strikes.
The ballot for action - in protest at the bank's decision to either dismiss
or downgrade 44 managers in its technology division - will begin on October
14 and the result is expected by the end of the month. The bank expressed
its disappointment at the union's decision to go ahead with a strike ballot.
'We want a negotiated settlement and not a strike', said Mr Sandy Boyle,
Bifu's Scottish officer yesterday.
He accused the bank of drawing up a 'hit list ' of middle and senior
managers and using performance assessment exercises to make 10 per cent of
its technology workforce redundant every year and replace them with contract
staff.
The bank rejected Mr Boyle's assertions, saying all but 20 had been found
new jobs. The union had been involved in 'confidential consultation in
advance of any decisions being announced'.
It had been told that 44 staff would have to be made redundant or
redeployed. Those moving to other jobs would retain their salary level.
The bank also denied it had a 'hit list' or intended to 'clear out' 10 per
cent of its technology workforce each year.
The union wants the bank to allow those dismissed to return to their jobs,
and a reduction in the use of contract staff by the bank. Mr Boyle warned
that staff were angry and it was only after three consultative meetings they
had pressed the union to hold a strike ballot.
Earlier this year the bank announced it was reducing its staff by 3,500 by
1997 with 1,000 jobs going this year.

FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Portillo attacks
rightwing tax stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, last night identified
the restoration of 'sound finance' as the prerequisite for a revival in the
government's fortunes, Philip Stephens writes.
Taking a further step towards establishing his credentials as the true
inheritor of Lady Thatcher's mantle, he launched a thinly veiled attack on
the Tory right campaigning against tax increases.
He told a fringe meeting hosted by the Conservative Political Centre that
Lady Thatcher had made lower public borrowing the first priority of her
governments: 'The restoration of sound public finance overrode all other
ambitions even when in 1981 we were forced to raise taxes against our deeper
instincts.'
He added: 'If a government believe that a policy is right for the country,
then it must pursue it, even if it leads to unpopularity.'
Mr Portillo combined his call for fiscal responsibility with an equally
strong call for the government to stick with policies designed to squeeze
public spending and to give individuals more control over their own lives.

SHE HAD come to see her friends and support the prime minister. That at
least is what her press secretary said.
Baroness Thatcher yesterday decided that actions speak louder than words as
she arrived to a slightly less than ecstatic welcome from the rank and file
inside the Empress Ballroom. Her presence on the platform, alongside many of
the senior ministers she has purportedly castigated in her memoirs, was
designed to underline her approval for Mr John Major.
But all most people wanted to talk about was what she really thought of her
successor. The extracts in the Daily Mirror newspaper, widely believed,
indicated just what a poor opinion she had of him. Mr Major appeared to
return the compliment when he broke with recent tradition by declining to
kiss her when he joined the platform for the debate on the economy.
If comparing their respective merits as prime minister was not enough,
supporters of each camp immediately began to contrast the standing ovations
given to past and present leaders. At just over two minutes, Lady Thatcher's
ovation was 20 seconds longer than the one given to Mr Major. But only half
the audience were on their feet for the whole two minutes. Sir Edward Heath
appeared scrupulously fair by standing for both but refusing to clap.
There was no shortage of cabinet ministers trying to put the explosive issue
of Lady Thatcher's memoirs behind them. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health
secretary, said the matter was 'history'; Mr Peter Lilley, social security
secretary said Lady Thatcher was 'livid with rage' at the Daily Mirror.
Other representatives of the parliamentary party were more outspoken in
their anger at what they perceived to be Lady Thatcher's hijacking of the
party conference. 'It's a disgraceful lack of self-discipline,' said one.
Her close friends appeared to hark back to a golden age which Mr Major now
says never was. Mr Edward Leigh, the rightwing former trade minister sacked
by the prime minister, said it was ludicrous to blame Lady Thatcher for
stealing Mr Major's thunder. 'There is a tremendous affection for
Thatcherite values. Until we get back to those policies we will continue to
drift.'
Sir Norman Fowler had hoped to appease Lady Thatcher's friends by declaring
that he wore the badge of both Thatcherism and Majorism with pride. But it
failed to convince one minister who said the government had only itself to
blame by trying to distance itself from the achievements of the 1980s.
Sir Tim Bell, who used to advise Lady Thatcher on her public relations,
appeared bemused by the fuss. He professed surprise that anyone could have
failed to see that the conference spotlight would fall on Lady Thatcher.
'What on earth did you expect?'
Not to be outdone by the party chairman, who organised a dinner party for
Lady Thatcher, Sir Tim hosted a lunch for her in the Imperial Hotel. As the
guests made their way to their table they were somewhat taken aback at the
sight of Sir Edward lunching in the middle with Mr Michael Heseltine at
another table on the right.
Mr Heseltine later made a triumphant return to the conference receiving the
third longest standing ovation of the day. Supporters held out letters
spelling 'Tarzan'.
He had timed his entrance perfectly. Lady Thatcher had long since left the
platform. Less than 24 hours after she arrived at Blackpool she strode out
of the hotel lobby. According to one of her luncheon companions she had yet
again demonstrated her support for the prime minister - this time by not
even mentioning him.

FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Heseltine returns to
cheers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RETURN of Mr Michael Heseltine to the political stage with a silent
appearance at the scene of some of his greatest oratorical triumphs was
greeted with an emotional welcome from conference representatives.
Making a comeback after his heart attack in June, Mr Heseltine came on the
platform to hear Mr Tim Sainsbury, his deputy at the department of trade and
industry, announce that the deregulation bill planned for the new
parliamentary session would include powers to deregulate in future without
necessarily having to go through the process of introducing a bill.
The extent of those new powers is still the subject of a behind-the-scenes
battle in Whitehall, where other departments are concerned that if these are
too wide-ranging then the government will face opposition from
constitutionalists in both houses of parliament.
The choice of deregulation as one of the government's main themes in the
coming months, has struck a chord with the party faithful, who have chosen
the issue as the subject for one of this morning's debates.
Mr Sainsbury received a sympathetic standing ovation at the end of his
speech, but the debate was overshadowed by the reception for Mr Heseltine.
Although unable to give the conference one of his customary barnstorming
performances, because of his illness, Mr Heseltine cheered the
representatives by miming some physical jerks to demonstrate his fitness,
and drew his own standing ovation to an end by gesturing to the audience to
sit down.
He is expected to be back in his department by the time the Commons resumes
in ten days, and is due to be interviewed on television this weekend.
While Mr Heseltine's conference appearances - he will be on the platform
again today for Mr John Major's speech - mark the beginning of his return to
political life, there are still questions about how long he will remain in
office.
But Mr Keith Hampson, one of Mr Heseltine's closest parliamentary
colleagues, yesterday dismissed the idea that the trade and industry
secretary might not continue in his job.
He admitted, however, that Mr Heseltine's absence had already had an impact
on the party, contributing to this week's marked rightward shift.
He said: 'There is a responsibility that the Tory party has always felt on
social policy which I do personally feel has been slightly missing in the
tone of this conference and that would have been very much part of Michael
Heseltine's performance.'

FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Mirror agrees to call a
halt to memoirs extracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Daily Mirror last night agreed not to publish further extracts from Lady
Thatcher's memoirs, The Downing Street Years.
The newspaper, which has been publishing extracts from the book each morning
this week, said it had agreed to call a 'truce' after being threatened with
an injunction restraining further publication for breach of copyright.
Sir David Napley, Lady Thatcher's solicitor, said the paper had also agreed
not to repeat any quotations from the book. The newspaper said: 'We've had
all the best bits. There isn't really much more to tell.'
Sir David said: 'Following on Lady Thatcher informing the Daily Mirror of
her intention to seek an injunction to restrain the further unlawful
publication of her book, the Daily Mirror has undertaken to her not to
publish any further material or to repeat any quotations from the book which
they have already published and not to pass any such information to a third
party.'
He said the Mirror's undertaking was 'realistic' particularly in light of
comments made by the Court of Appeal on Wednesday that it would be
unfortunate if the law was unable to prevent such publication of unlawfully
obtained material.
He stressed that the Mirror would still be free to use information from the
book and to comment on it. Lady Thatcher is considering whether to take any
further action for damages against the Mirror.
Her successful action follows three failed attempts by The Sunday Times,
which is due to begin serialising the book this Sunday, to halt publication
by seeking an injunction for breach of confidence.
Mr David Banks, the Mirror's editor, said he was happy to call it a truce.
'The Daily Mirror has set the agenda for the Tory conference and for all of
Britain. We are happy for the British public, having been presented with all
the facts, to make up their own minds.
'That's the role of the press in a democratic society,' he added.

FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Protection pledge for
state sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DOUGLAS HURD, the foreign secretary, last night fired a warning shot at
those of the Tory right seeking to further reduce the role of the state.
Taking a sideswipe at supporters of 'permanent revolution' he stressed the
government's commitment to respect as well to reform the public sector.
His comments were reinforced by a re-affirmation by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor, that the government's overall strategy should be based on an
'American approach to free-market economics and a European approach to
welfare'.
In a speech which followed a series of attacks from right-wing ministers and
Tory activists on the public sector, Mr Hurd said the party should not give
the impression that we 'believe in a permanent cultural revolution, in the
style of Trotsky of chairman Mao'.
His comments, carefully prepared after close consultation with colleagues,
were seen as a signal that the centrist majority in Mr John Major's cabinet,
is unwilling to surrender the public services agenda.
Mr Hurd told the Tory Reform Group: 'We do not want to break the mould of
every public service afresh in every Parliament. We must show that we are
not driven by ideology to question every function of the state, to make
impossible the life of our public servants, or to depreciate the worth and
quality of the different public services.'
He defended strongly the need to overhaul key public services like
education, the health service and prison system to ensure that they
functioned more like a sophisticated and responsive market.
But he coupled that with a warning that the policies of the Thatcher era did
not fit the priorities of the 1990s: 'We spent much of the 1980s cutting
back on the overblown responsibilities of the state. Our task now is to
strike the right balance in working out the role of the state in the 1990s.'
The government's commitment to deregulate and to introduce market
disciplines in the public sector should not be mistaken for a 'vendetta
against the state in the areas of national life where its role must remain
central'.
That sentiment was echoed by Mr Clarke who told reporters that the prospect
of public spending cuts should not be taken as an attack on the basic
principles of the welfare state.

FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Bottomley announces new
round of trust hospitals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, announced yesterday that a
further 99 hospitals and other medical establishments would be given
self-governing trust status in April.
She also promised to expand the number of family doctors authorised to
control their budgets, and forecast administrative savings through a
reduction in the number of health authorities.
Details of the administrative changes - expected to make the most impact on
regional health authorities - would be announced to parliament.
Mrs Bottomley said trust status - which removed hospitals from the control
of district health authorities - had benefited patients.
Waiting times had been reduced, and 116 patients were being treated compared
to 100 before the switch to trust status.
She said: 'In two years' time virtually every hospital, community and
ambulance service will have become a trust'.
Scoffing at abolition threats made by Mr David Blunkett, Labour's shadow
health secretary, she maintained that trusts were good for staff, good for
patients and were 'here for good'.
Mrs Bottomley undertook to apply the same determination in extending the
number of 'budget-holding' family doctors, whose skills 'make our money go
further for patients'.
She contended that Labour MPs loathed fundholding - 'they level down,' she
said. 'We level up.'
Emphasising the importance of avoiding waste in the NHS which spent Pounds
100m every day, she said the saving of one penny in the pound meant an extra
Pounds 1m every day for patients.

FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Delegates take worrying
interest in democracy - Disquiet about party accountability
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST THERE was the scandal over how the Conservative party received funds
form foreign millionaires like Mr Asil Nadir. Then the Labour party decided
to make its internal structures more democratic by adopting
one-member-one-vote.
Both events have led some Tory delegates to think that the time is ripe for
an open debate on democracy and accountability inside the Conservative
party.
In theory that debate should happen today, when the conference holds its
regular session on party policy and organisation. But it is unlikely the
floor will be given to any of the delegates who quietly criticise the party
organisation for its lack of democracy.
'The Labour party has recognised the importance of the individual member by
passing omov,' says Ms Sharon Spiers, head of a splinter group called the
Charter Movement. 'But the Tory party is yet to do this. Individual members
have no say in the election of the party chairman and no right to question
the accounts, which are in a deplorable state.'
The Charter Movement has enjoyed limited support at recent conferences.
Campaigning for greater internal democracy is the last vehicle by which
anyone climbs the ladder of a political party. Ms Spiers, a party member for
18 years, resigned herself long-ago to life as a campaigner, not a
candidate.
But she says the number of people quietly offering support is increasing.
Early this year, 50 constituency associations signed a petition calling for
a debate on party democracy at the Conservatives' central council meeting in
Harrogate - although there was no debate on the issue.
Charter's supporters feel there are several reasons why they are winning
support now.
In its 1993 accounts, the party recorded an accumulated deficit of Pounds
19m. Claims that the party received funds from Mr Nadir and other foreign
businessmen have tarnished the party's image. But fee-paying party members
cannot formally question the accounts or
'Party members have nothing like the power of company shareholders,' says Mr
John Stafford, a former member of the Conservative Board of Finance.
At a time of uncertainty for the leadership, there are also concerns that Mr
Norman Fowler, the party chairman, is not a directly elected official.
Instead, he is the appointee of the prime minister. 'What central office is
saying is 'You can't trust the members',' says Mr Graham Pycock, a
Conservative councillor in Lambeth.
Disquiet on these issues has led to the party leadership's openly attacking
the Charter Movement for the first time.
A fortnight ago, Sir Basil Feldman, the chairman of the Conservatives'
National Executive Committee, wrote to every constituency chairman and MP to
denounce the group. 'I do accept that (the Charter Movement) sincerely hold
their views, but I feel that they are utterly misguided at this time,' he
wrote.
Sir Basil will probably not need to engage with his critics on the
conference floor today. But if Mr John Major's leadership suffers any more
difficulties, the issue of party democracy may start to haunt him.

the individuals whose assets support the insurance market - is to recommend
its members vote in favour of the market's plans to admit corporate members
at an extraordinary general meeting later this month.
The decision of the Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents up to
9,000 Names, will boost confidence at the market where there are hopes that
as much as Pounds 1bn in corporate capital will back Lloyd's syndicates next
year.
However Lloyd's still faces potential opposition from a second group
representing Names involved in legal action. Mr Christopher Stockwell,
chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations Working Party said he would
reserve judgment until 18 October, two days before the EGM.
Mr Neil Shaw, the association chairman, said its committee had studied an
independent report which showed Names would not be disadvantaged by the
entry of new corporate investors. The association and the working party
commissioned the report. It is understood the advisers, who have not been
named, are a leading firm of actuarial consultants.
'In their overall opinion the proposals will be beneficial to Lloyd's and
all of its members and may even be necessary for the future prosperity of
the society,' said the association.
Mr Shaw said it was 'satisfied' with assurances given by Mr Peter Middleton,
Lloyd's chief executive, that Names will be able to maintain their market
involvement at 1993 levels. Although Names have been hard-hit by losses of
more than Pounds 6bn in the last five years, many are now anxious to
continue trading in view of insurance rate rises and improved prospects for
profits.
Lloyd's is aiming to make an out-of-court offer to Names taking legal action
to recover losses before the end of the year. The association said they had
been told by Mr Middleton that if a settlement is reached, arrangements will
be made for them to resume underwriting.
The association has also advised its members not to delegate responsibility
for voting at the EGM but the working party wants proxy votes to allow it to
press for better settlement terms.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Strike vote at Scottish bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Royal Bank of Scotland faces disruption to its financial activities as
its 700-strong computer staff are balloted by banking union Bifu to support
a series of one-day strikes.
The ballot - in protest at the decision to dismiss or downgrade 44 managers
in the technology division - will begin on October 14. The result is
expected by the end of the month. The bank said it was disappointed at the
union's decision to hold a ballot.
'We want a negotiated settlement and not a strike', said Mr Sandy Boyle,
Bifu's Scottish officer yesterday.
He accused the bank of drawing up a 'hit list' of middle and senior managers
and using performance assessment exercises to make 10 per cent of its
technology workforce redundant every year and replace them with contract
staff.
The bank rejected Mr Boyle's assertions, saying all but 20 had been found
new jobs. The union had been involved in 'confidential consultation in
advance of any decisions'.
It had been told that 44 staff would have to be made redundant or
redeployed. Those moving to other jobs would retain their salary level.
The union wants the bank to allow those dismissed to return to their jobs.
Earlier this year the bank announced it was reducing its staff by 3,500 by
1997 with 1,000 jobs going this year.

particularly subscription movie and sports channels - are turning into
billion-pound businesses in Europe, but there is little specific legislation
to protect them against increasingly sophisticated pirates.
The Motion Picture Export Association of America, the Hollywood trade
association, said that only the UK, Sweden and France had passed laws to ban
unauthorised decoders and smart cards which 'unlock' the scrambled signal.
Mr George Eriksson, deputy director of the association in Europe, said he
planned to lobby the European Commission to get a ban on unauthorised
decoders throughout the community.
BSkyB has only bought the pay-television rights for the UK. Making sure that
the signal is secure is part of BSkyB's contractual obligations under
agreements with the studios.
The UK government has dealt with the issue by inserting a section in the
Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. This created a criminal offence
with a fine of up to Pounds 5,000.
The new section says that 'a person who makes, imports, sells or lets for
hire any un-authorised decoder shall be guilty of an offence'. It is
apparently not an offence to use a pirate decoder.
The legislation adds that it would be a defence for the defendant to prove
'that he did not know, and had no reasonable grounds for knowing that the
decoder was an unauthorised decoder'.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Irish satellite bandits enjoy roaring trade: BSkyB downplays
decoders - EC urged to impose a ban / Smart card fights microchips
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE, RICHARD DONKIN and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BALLYEGAN is a hamlet in County Offaly in Ireland's agricultural heartland
so small that it does not even have a sub-post office.
Apart from the tractors on the lanes and cows grazing in the fields, the
only sign of economic activity is the local pub, 0'Meara's Black Bull -
except, that is, for a two-storey house called The Lodge.
The house is an important staging post for unauthorised decoders that
unscramble the satellite channels of British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite
television network in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a
significant stake. The decoders are not just supplying the Irish market but
are now being exported in large numbers to the UK.
Advertisements placed by the Ballyegan company in Ireland promise smart
cards to decode all the BSkyB channels which normally cost subscribers
Pounds 19.99 a month.
'Save hundreds of pounds in fees you have to pay each month,' says the
advertisement, which also adds: 'Agents wanted for all parts of Eire.'
Mr Jack Malloy who lives at The Lodge said he helped out with the business
of distributing the cards. His niece, he added, was married to Mr David
Lyons, who runs the UK arm of the business.
The company that placed the advertisement is registered in Dublin and called
Satellite Decoding Systems. It has a UK branch in a semi-detached house in
Dingle Avenue, Appleton, near Warrington in Cheshire. Advertisements have
also been placed in Cheshire offering to decode all the BSkyB channels.
The company charges Pounds 220 for a card to unscramble the BSkyB channels -
not, on the surface, a good deal. All 18 channels including three film
channels and Sky Sports can be legitimately obtained for Pounds 240 a year.
But the pirate card promises to work forever.
The company says its service is almost a parallel subscription service - if
BSkyB changes its codes or sends out new official cards, Satellite Decoding
Systems offers to provide a new card for Pounds 30.
Mr Lyons, a tall Irishman, answered the door at his Warrington home
yesterday and denied that he was doing anything illegal.
'The only thing we are doing in this country is advertising,' he said. 'If I
thought we were doing anything to damage Sky TV to the point where it was
unacceptable we would pack it in,' he added.
He said his solicitors had been instructed to fight a writ from BSkyB at the
beginning of the month issuing a restraining order against his company for
breaking UK copyright laws.
Mr Lyons said he had written to BSkyB about his system. He said: 'They know
about us. I don't suppose they are very enthralled about it all.'
Mr Gary Davey, deputy managing director of BSkyB, was dismissive yesterday
about the activities of the pirates.
'You find one that works? People have been trying to crack the system since
its first month,' said Mr Davey, who conceded that a number of serious
attempts had been made by pirates.
'At least once a month there is an attempt,' he added.
The company monitors the pirates closely, Mr Davey said, and sometimes lets
them spend a lot of money on a system before changing the codes or the
information sent over the satellite to decoder boxes in individual homes.
'Then they lose their shirts,' Mr Davey said.
'Our system has been cracked. But we control it over the air. It can't be
permanently cracked,' he added, claiming that the information sent over the
satellite could be changed 50 times a second.
It is not an argument that much impresses Mr Lyons who was yesterday
demonstrating one of his cards in Ireland. He declined to demonstrate his
system in the UK, he said for legal reasons.
He said of BSkyB: 'They tried to turn our cards off a month ago and
succeeded in putting out of action 10 per cent of their own cards. Their
switchboards were jammed. All the satellite operators across Europe have had
their codes cracked. Nobody has produced a foolproof system.'
Mr Lyons said the cards were being mailed over to the UK from Ireland then
remailed in the UK by an assistant who did not know the contents of the
packages. He claimed this device would escape the restrictions on importing
unauthorised decoders.
Cheshire Trading Standards department is taking an interest in the
activities of Satellite Decoding Systems and may take action although the
department has not had any complaints from customers of the company.
According to a woman answering telephone inquiries at the Warrington
address, the company is swamped with applications. 'We have sold 2,000 cards
in the past six weeks,' she said.
The Ballyegan-Warrington connection looks like a tiny part of the growing
trade in unauthorised decoders. Satellite magazines all over Europe carry
advertisements for the unauthorised cards.
The Ballyegan company says it acts as an agent for a supplier based in
Bochum in Germany.
Mega-Sat in Bochum advertises in a German trade magazine called Infosat and
offers not just cards to crack BSkyB but also the film service of FilmNet
which operates in the Low Countries. Industry specialists on piracy believe
Mega-Sat is an important source of the unauthorised cards.
BSkyB only buys the UK rights to the movies it shows and although the
channels are distributed on the Astra satellite all over Europe they should
not be legitimately available there. In the UK the potential problem for
BSkyB is loss of revenue.
In Ireland, satellite dealers make it clear that pirate decoders are
available in the marketplace and are already big business.
Mr Paul McKenna of Electroplus, a satellite specialist in Dublin, said
yesterday that BSkyB's VideoCrypt system was 'a relatively simple code and
can be broken easily'.
Mr McKenna said that a week ago BSkyB had changed its signal to render the
pirate cards useless. 'Within two or three days the pirate cards were
replaced with new ones,' he said.
He added that the pirates had significant financial backing and said that
specialists from San Francisco had been involved.
A UK television executive who asked not to be named said yesterday that he
had pirate cards which had been decoding BSkyB channels for the past six
months.
However, he added that BSkyB had successfully damaged the picture last week
and now the picture slipped in and out of its scrambled form every two to
three seconds and was virtually unwatchable. He has not tried to get a
replacement card.
When VideoCrypt was first introduced, BSkyB executives said it was a system
that could not be beaten, mainly because a new card could be sent out every
three months if the codes were cracked.
One senior BSkyB director said yesterday that they could send out a new card
every week if necessary.
In fact BSkyB viewers are being signed up on 12-month contracts and it seems
that one card is meant to last throughout that time.
That is perhaps an indication of the confidence of BSkyB that the pirates
can be held at bay - or a measure of the complacency of the satellite
venture.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Birth control implant launched
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONTRACEPTIVE implant designed to prevent pregnancy for up to five years
will be available in the UK from next week.
The introduction of Norplant was welcomed by the Family Planning Association
as an important 'extension of contraceptive choice for women'.
Norplant consists of six small rubber tubes, each about the size of a
matchstick, which are inserted under local anaesthetic beneath the skin of
the upper arm. They release levonorgestrel, a hormone used in contraceptive
pills, at a steady rate into the bloodstream for as long as five years. If
the women wants to have a baby, the capsules are removed.
Its greatest advantage is that women do not have to remember to take a pill
every day.
Norplant was developed by Leiras, a contraceptive manufacturer in Finland,
and the Population Council, a charity based in New York. They are licensing
it for sale by various international drug companies.
American Home Products, the US licensee, has sold Norplant to 750,000 women
since its launch two years ago. The UK licensee is French-owned Roussel,
which will charge the National Health Service Pounds 179 for Norplant -
significantly below the Dollars 350 (Pounds 232) US price.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Scrambling to unscramble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SPENCER, an engineer who is UK marketing director of GI, the US
electronics group, is a connoisseur of the work of the cable and satellite
television pirates.
Several years ago GI suffered a serious piracy problem in the US and 4m
decoder boxes in homes with cable television had to be replaced.
Mr Spencer said the most effective pirate equipment he had seen was based on
an Intel chip inserted into the decoder box itself. But he had also tested a
number of other cards that also worked well.
It is now easy and inexpensive, he believes, to get pirate microchips
manufactured from a floppy disk carrying the configuration of the system.
The VideoCrypt system introduced in 1989 has been hailed by BSkyB for its
'unmatched high security and unmatched flexibility'. It randomly cuts each
of the hundreds of tiny lines in the television picture and transposes them.
Information on the scrambling sequences and control is carried in spare
lines of the picture.
The security features lie in the 'smart card' rather than the decoder box.
The decoder establishes the legitimacy of the card, which has a built-in
microprocessor containing the codes needed to unscramble the picture. BSkyB
said: 'The smart card security algorithms may be changed frequently making
unauthorised attack extremely difficult and economically not viable.'
Nobody knows how pirates are breaking BSkyB security, but experts believe
some are cracking the code and manufacturing their own microchips.
Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, has said he hoped to make
VideoCrypt the world standard.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community airlines and telecommunications groups must be given time
to grow stronger before the European market can be opened to full outside
competition, according to the EC's competition commissioner.
In a speech due to be delivered in Washington last night, Mr Karel Van Miert
warned that although the EC was pledged to liberalisation in both sectors,
it would not improve competition to give US companies immediate access to
the European market.
Instead, he said, EC airlines and telecoms companies should be allowed to
'grow strong' within a liberalised internal EC market.
In the text of his speech - released in Brussels ahead of last night's
address at the European Institute Club - Mr Van Miert pointed out that US
airline companies 'grew strong on the back of the world's largest and still
protected market'. EC air transport and telecoms companies deserved an equal
chance to become competitive.
As the EC's transport commissioner until January this year, Mr Van Miert
helped persuade EC member states to accept a package of measures
liberalising the Community's air transport market. Under the terms of the
'open skies' programme, which came into force on January 1, airlines are
allowed to set fares at any level, and EC carriers can compete on routes
previously dominated by national airlines.
The text of last night's speech underlined his continued concern about
discrimination in the US air transport market. He said the US would have to
treat EC airlines in the same way as it treated its own before US carriers
would be granted access to Community markets.
Mr Van Miert said he also wanted to end the 'popular misconception (in the
US) that a large part of industry in Europe is either publicly owned or
publicly controlled' and that it benefits from unfair state support.

<TEXT>
THE EC has criticised Japan for dragging its feet on market access measures
and warned that, unless there was stronger commitment from Japan, the
Uruguay Round negotiations were in danger of not being concluded in time.
Mr Alexander Schaub, deputy director-general in charge of industry at the
EC, said that in a meeting with officials from the Japanese Ministry of
International Trade and Industry, the EC made it clear that Japan would need
to make a greater effort to help the Uruguay Round towards a successful
conclusion.
Japan has not shown determination to push forward discussions on market
access for textiles or on the multilateral steel agreement (MSA). Both are
part of a market access package agreed at the quadrilateral trade talks
between the US, Canada, Japan and the EC in Tokyo this summer, which it is
hoped will propel the wider Uruguay Round talks to a successful conclusion.
Meanwhile, the EC is also pursuing its own independent trade talks which
were agreed with Japan last January. The Trade Assessment Mechanism, as the
talks are known, is aimed at identifying sectors in which EC companies have
been successful internationally but have shown a 'striking underperformance'
in Japan. Once the sectors are identified the two sides will analyse the
reasons behind that underperformance.
EC and Japanese officials were, however, in closer agreement on the need for
an anti-harassment clause, in light of recent activity by the US steel
industry.
'If there is anything like harassment, it is the way in which the American
industry has launched dozens and dozens of complaints and created a climate
of permanent threat,' Mr Schaub said. 'This is the kind of proceeding we
would like to avoid. It is not about taking away legitimate instruments of
trade but about limiting the risks of abuse.'

FT  08 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Mondale presses Tokyo on rice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday increased pressure on Japan to reduce its trade surplus, in
the week before a fresh round of trade talks.
There was 'fundamental agreement on foreign policy and security issues'
between the US and Japan, 'yet it is urgent that we correct the economic
imbalance between us,' said Mr Walter Mondale, US ambassador to Japan.
Mr Mondale also urged Tokyo to remove its traditional ban on imported rice
and allow foreign rice sales subject to import duties. Japan should accept a
proposal in Gatt's Uruguay Round to replace all non-tariff barriers to
agricultural trade with tariffs: this would be 'good for Japanese farmers
and consumers', said Mr Mondale.
The first round of talks in Hawaii last month, to implement the framework
trade and economic accord struck last July, in which Japan has undertaken to
try to curb its record trade surplus, was only a preliminary. 'Serious
negotiations' would begin in Tokyo next week when both sides meet again,
said Mr Mondale, speaking at his first press confidence since taking the
Tokyo post in August.
This comes as Japanese politicians are beginning to show flexibility on rice
imports, which already happen in small amounts but are regarded as taboo. Mr
Morihiro Hosokawa, recently elected premier, still benefits from record
popularity ratings, and has hinted that Japan should consider lifting the
ban. The question has been given fresh relevance by a bad harvest, obliging
the government to allow 200,000 tonnes of emergency imports of industrial
grade rice, the first for nine years.
But for the time being, the Tokyo government is officially abiding by a
unanimous parliamentary resolution against foreign rice and feels under no
pressure to discuss rice in Gatt until the EC and Japan resolve their own
differences on farm trade.

SOUTH-EAST Asian governments have announced plans to relaunch the Asean Free
Trade Area (Afta) after a year of haggling during which they have made
little headway in reducing tariffs.
Ministers from the six members of Asean - the Association of South East
Asian Nations, comprising Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore and Thailand - are meeting in Singapore this week to discuss
regional and international trade matters.
Asean announced in Singapore that member states would start implementing
tariff cuts for intra-Asean trade from January 1 1994, to show the private
sector that the six countries were serious about moving towards Afta.
Officials said that a timetable would be issued in November.
The original plan agreed in 1992 was to begin reducing tariffs at the start
of this year to create a free trade area in 15 years, but the agreement did
not tie the signatories to a precise timetable. Most governments, under
pressure from uncompetitive national industries protected by high tariffs,
delayed the cuts and announced long lists of products they were excluding
from the scheme.
Asean said there had now been 'improvements to the commitments of member
countries', although Asean's own figures show little change for the better.
Malaysia, for example, appears to have sharply reduced the number of product
categories it is submitting to the Afta tariff cuts, partly because it has
dropped processed agricultural products for the time being and partly
because of bureaucratic changes to the way products are consolidated into
different tariff categories.
Previously, Malaysia has warned other Asean countries not to take advantage
of what it calls 'Malaysia's generosity'.

FT  08 OCT 93 / World Trade News: General in the war for free trade - Gatt
chief who leaves nothing to chance in his quest for a Uruguay Round deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITHIN a month of his arrival in July as head of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, Mr Peter Sutherland put the world trade body on a virtual
war footing. With what is now generally agreed to be the final deadline for
the Uruguay Round of trade liberalising talks just 10 weeks away, he is
leaving nothing to chance to secure a successful outcome.
Once a week and sometimes more often, a dozen close aides gather in Mr
Sutherland's office overlooking Lake Geneva to take stock of the final
stages of the negotiations and to plan strategy for the coming days and
weeks. Where are blockages emerging? Which countries need chivvying? Should
certain delegations be brought in for consultations with Gatt staff? Would a
telephone call from Mr Sutherland to the relevant minister be helpful?
'We are looking at anything that would drive the process forward,' says one
member of the strategy group. It includes Mr Richard O'Toole, Mr
Sutherland's chef de cabinet (who performed the same function in Brussels in
1985-89 when Mr Sutherland, an Irish lawyer, was EC competition
commissioner), the three deputy directors general and senior staff
responsible for specific areas of the Uruguay Round negotiations.
Mr Sutherland argues that if no deal is reached by the December 15 deadline,
when US negotiating authority expires, the seven-year-old round is doomed.
This, he believes, would be a disaster not only for world growth prospects
but for global economic security and political stability.
A collapse of the negotiations would not mean a continuation of the status
quo but a disintegration of the present system of trading rules and an
upsurge in trade conflicts and protectionism, with dangerous consequences
for economic and political reform in the developing world and eastern
Europe.
Mr Sutherland's central message to world leaders is thus that the Uruguay
Round is not an 'optional extra' but 'arguably the most important and urgent
issue on the world agenda today'.
'It's a softening-up period designed to get people desperate for a deal,'
says one insider. 'We're trying to create a climate for negotiation that
will ensure the flexibility needed to conclude the round successfully.'
So far this campaign has had two principal dimensions - an unprecedented
effort to spread the word through the news media and a gruelling personal
travel schedule for Mr Sutherland. By the end of October, he will have met
ministers and sometimes heads of government of virtually every important
trading nation.
He has already met ministers from most leading industrial countries and
Latin American countries, visited Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and Mr
Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, to discuss the critical issue
of farm trade reform. He has also been in regular contact with Sir Leon
Brittan, the EC's trade commissioner, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative.
This weekend he will be in Singapore for talks with ministers from the
Association of South-East Asian Nations, and later this month he will travel
to Tokyo to see Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister.
Mr Sutherland has used these opportunities to give dozens of speeches, news
conferences and press interviews and to use his considerable gifts of
persuasion to sway opinion formers behind the scenes.
During his recent trip to the US, for instance, he 'spoke to just about
everyone who makes or influences US decisions on trade', according to one
observer, including Mr Kantor, congressional leaders, business groups and
journalists.
Another tactic has been to publicise the far-reaching benefits of a Gatt
deal to counter the noisy but limited interest groups demanding trade
protection. A first well-timed and telling fact sheet issued just before the
Group of Seven summit in Tokyo in July stressed the role of trade in
creating new and better jobs in industrialised countries. A second, released
in August, drew attention to the high and often hidden costs of trade
protection for consumers and taxpayers.
In the next, even more difficult, stage of his overall strategy, Mr
Sutherland will be hoping to translate the political desire for a Uruguay
Round agreement into the concessions necessary to secure it.
He has already warned the US and EC that the onus is on them to make the
Round a success. But he is urging all governments to be more forthcoming in
the critical negotiations under way in Geneva on improving market access for
foreign goods and services, and has called for restraint in trying to open
up the draft accords on fair trade rules compiled in 1991 by Mr Arthur
Dunkel, his predecessor.
For the moment, the main priority is to get a wide-ranging package of tariff
cuts and other market-opening measures that will give the 116 participants
tangible benefits from the Round. This, it is hoped, will pave the way for
difficult concessions on the rules, including the 'multilateralisation' of
the troubled US/EC Blair House accord on farm subsidies.
Mr Sutherland concedes there is still a 'substantial risk' the talks could
founder. If so, it will not be due to lack of effort on his part. He and
fellow-lawyers Mr Kantor and Sir Leon have the ability to reach a deal, says
one seasoned Gatt-watcher. 'If these guys can't do it, nobody can'.

FT  08 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Fujitsu and Hyundai in D-Ram chip venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUJITSU, the Japanese computer and telecommunications company, and Hyundai
Electronics, part of the South Korean Hyundai Business Group, have agreed to
collaborate in the manufacture of semiconductor memory chips.
Fujitsu said they would work on 4-megabit and 16-megabit dynamic random
access memory (D-Ram) chips.
The move reflects the changing order in the memory market, where Japanese
semiconductor makers once held predominance. Last year, Samsung, another
Korean company, overtook Toshiba of Japan as the world's largest
manufacturer of D-Rams.
The move to next-generation D-Rams involves huge investments which Japanese
companies, under pressure both at home and abroad, cannot now afford to
make. As a result, Korean semiconductor makers have led in the race to
invest in 16-megabit D-Rams and those unable to do so have set up alliances
which often span national borders.
'It's a good move for Fujitsu because it can't really afford to spend so
much money on D-Rams,' commented Mr Phua Lee-Kerk, analyst at Barings
Securities. Mr Phua said that in the long run D-Ram makers could be reduced
to five: NEC and Toshiba from Japan, Samsung and Goldstar from Korean, and
Texas Instruments of the US.
Fujitsu and Hyundai also agreed to explore the potential for collaboration
in developing future generations of D-Rams.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE mounting US death toll in Somalia has redoubled demands in Washington
that the US assert control over operations involving its troops.
Members of Congress rammed home the message to President Bill Clinton in a
meeting at the White House yesterday morning that their limited tolerance
for a continued US presence in Somalia would be greatly reduced if they
could not be assured that US forces would remain under US command.
'My point was to ensure that this was an American plan and was going to be
controlled by Americans,' said Senator Bob Dole, Republican leader in the
Senate, after the meeting.
US forces have in practice almost always remained under the ultimate command
of a US officer. From General Dwight Eisenhower in the second world war, by
way of Gen Douglas MacArthur and Gen Matthew Ridgway in Korea, to Gen Norman
Schwarzkopf in the Gulf, the US has provided the commander-in-chief for
multinational operations.
It continues by trad-ition to appoint the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe
(Saceur) of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.
It becomes more difficult to insist on US command of a particular operation,
however, while seeking to minimise the size of the US commitment.
Already this summer, members of Congress with big military bases in their
districts returned from recess with questions about the command structure
under which US troops were operating in Somalia. Last Sunday's bloodshed has
reinforced US doubts about the wisdom of ceding control of their troops.
Specific complaints about muddled chains of command, language problems and
incompatible tactics have merged with long-held US suspicions, dating back
to U Thant's term as United Nations secretary general in the 1960s, about
whose side the UN is on.
US concerns have been further coloured by occasionally xenophobic views on
the reliability of troops from other nations taking part in the UN force.
Some US newspapers questioned the willingness of Malaysian and Pakistani
troops to come to the rescue of US soldiers trapped in Sunday's bloody
fighting in Mogadishu.
The command issue has already arisen in Bosnia, where the US has sought to
insist on Nato's leadership - and so, de facto, a US commander in chief -
while France has argued that the Saceur command structure is inappropriate
for peacekeeping operations and asserted UN supremacy.

THE US presidential party primaries of 1996 promise to be less of a marathon
as a result of action taken recently by several states bringing forward
election dates.
This week Governor Pete Wilson of California signed into law a bill setting
the last Tuesday in March, rather than the first in June, as primary day.
Last week Governor George Voinovich of Ohio did the same with a bill that
would have his state vote on the third Tuesday in March, the same as
Michigan and Illinois, rather than in mid-May. Wisconsin and Pennsylvania
may follow suit.
March now looms as a pivotal month, with in effect three regional primaries
 -the south at the start of the month, the Midwest around the middle and
California, the biggest state, in the west at the end.
Hitherto, states with late primaries have felt left out. California has not
held a truly decisive primary since 1972.

THE Clinton administration has urged the US Supreme Court not to hear an

system.
Mr Drew Days, solicitor general, argued in a brief filed yesterday there was
no longer any need for the court to review the case since California had
already changed its tax law to meet the objections raised by Barclays and
other foreign companies.
If the Supreme Court takes the administration's advice - which reverses the
position of the Reagan and Bush administrations - it would leave standing a
decision by the California supreme court in favour of the state and against
Barclays.
Although the UK bank's appeal specifically involves a Dollars 150,000 tax
bill from 1977, the accumulation of interest on this and similar cases
brought by other foreign companies means a total of Dollars 900m is at stake
for California. Cases involving US-based multinationals cover a further
Dollars 3.1bn in disputed tax assessments.
Mr Brad Sherman, a member of the California Franchise Tax Board, the state
body involved in the Barclays case, hailed the solicitor general's brief as
'a much-needed economic boost for California' and said it 'virtually assured
a victory for California over the multinational corporations'.
Barclays argues that California's system of unitary assessment is
unconstitutional, because it conflicts with the norms of international
taxation and so interferes with the federal government's sole right to
regulate foreign commerce.
Under the unitary taxation method California assesses taxes on a proportion
of a company's worldwide income, rather than on income earned in the state.
Barclays and the UK government will file briefs next week, and a Supreme
Court decision on whether to hear the case is expected at the beginning of
November.

BRAZIL'S review of its constitution was set to begin yesterday following the
overthrow of a controversial ruling by a Supreme Court judge which had
threatened to delay the process for several weeks.
The ruling, which had frustrated attempts to begin the review on Wednesday,
was overturned by a full meeting of the Supreme Court convened in emergency
session. The judge's ruling, which was highly technical, was determined to
be in error.
The constitutional review was due to be opened during a session of Congress
last night. Over the next few weeks the combined two houses of Congress are
expected to discuss procedural rules and the agenda to be reviewed. The
process is likely to last until at least the end of the year.
The review is seen as important in helping to solve Brazil's economic
problems, some of which stem from constitutional rules.

FT  08 OCT 93 / More troops for Somalia: US will not cut and run from its
mission, pledges Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton, declaring that 'we must finish the work we set out
to do', last night ordered the doubling of the US military presence in
Somalia but promised that all but a few hundred non-combatant personnel
would be home by March 31 next year.
In a sober televised address from the Oval Office, which sought to define US
policy, he insisted the US could not 'cut and run' and leave Somalia to the
starvation and anarchy which prevailed before the US intervention last
November.
'We need more strength to do our job,' Mr Clinton declared. To this end an
additional 1,700 infantry troops and 104 armoured vehicles were being
despatched immediately along with 3,600 Marines to be stationed offshore on
an aircraft carrier and in two amphibious groups.
Their mission, he said, would be to protect the 4,700 US troops already in
Somalia, to keep open roads and airfields so that humanitarian supplies
could still get through, to maintain pressure on those fighting US and UN
forces and to give the Somalis time to achieve their own political
solutions.
In pursuit of the last goal he was sending Mr Robert Oakley, US envoy under
President George Bush and at the beginning of the current administration,
back to Somalia with the brief to facilitate negotiations.
Mr Clinton did not mention by name General Mohammed Farah Aideed, the
faction leader, whose forces killed 13 Americans in a bloody confrontation
last weekend and another in Mogadishu yesterday. He said it was vital not to
personalise any conflict.
But he said that if the US pulled out forthwith, as some in Congress have
demanded, 'aggressive thugs and terrorists would conclude the best way to
change our policy was to kill our people'.
The president said he was stepping up efforts to persuade other nations,
including those in the region, to send in forces to replace Americans.
Private US contractors would be invited to take over the logistical work
undertaken by US troops.
Repeatedly Mr Clinton emphasised that a political solution could only be
reached by the Somalis themselves. He argued that until last June the US
mission was clearly achieving success and that, although perhaps 1m Somalis
still depended on relief supplies, there was plenty of evidence of life
returning to normal outside Mogadishu, the capital.
In the morning the president had held what was described by some as a
'spirited' session with leaders of both parties in congress.
In spite of much criticism then vented, Mr Clinton at least had the
satisfaction after his address of hearing Senator Bob Dole, the Republican
leader, commend both his actions and his explanations.
He also met a criticism from Mr Dole by stating that US troops in Somalia
would be operating under American, not UN, command and control.
Compounding problems for the administration is a post-mortem over why last
weekend's raid on the forces of Gen Aideed went so badly wrong.

FT  08 OCT 93 / States bring forward primary dates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US presidential party primaries of 1996 promise to be less of a marathon
as a result of action taken recently by several states bringing forward
election dates.
This week Governor Pete Wilson of California signed into law a bill setting
the last Tuesday in March, rather than the first in June, as primary day.
Last week Governor George Voinovich of Ohio did the same with a bill that
would have his state vote on the third Tuesday in March, the same as
Michigan and Illinois, rather than in mid-May. Wisconsin and Pennsylvania
may follow suit.
March now looms as a pivotal month, with in effect three regional primaries
 -the south at the start of the month, the Midwest around the middle and
California, the biggest state, in the west at the end.
Mr Voinovich pointed out that presidential candidates make promises in
primaries which may be redeemed if they get elected. 'Why should they spend
all their time in New Hampshire and Iowa (which hold the first primaries and
caucuses), when they're pea-pods in terms of electoral clout and
population?'
States with late primaries have indeed felt left out. California has not
held a truly decisive primary since 1972.
Experts are divided on the impact of shortening and front-loading the
primary season. It may help the well-organised and well-financed, especially
an incumbent. President George Bush, for example, would not have been as
embarrassed for so long by the sniping attacks of Mr Patrick Buchanan, his
right-wing challenger. But an unpopular front-runner or incumbent could get
knocked out very early.
Regional candidates from the south, like Messrs Carter and Clinton, will
probably have less time to establish themselves nationally. But western
hopefuls at least get an earlier crack at the biggest state of all, itself
prone to populist appeals.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Caracas bombings linked to share price manipulation
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CARACAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VENEZUELA'S police believe a small group of people placed at least one of a
series of bombs that exploded in the capital city in recent months in an
attempt to manipulate Caracas stock exchange prices, according to local
press reports yesterday.
If the theory proves to be true, it would represent one of the most
audacious cases of stock manipulation on record.
Mr Carlos Delgado Chapellin, minister of the interior, said people with
'links to Venezuela's financial sector' were suspected of planting a car
bomb that damaged a Caracas shopping centre on August 18.
The authorities also suspect that the group, reported to be made up of at
least five civilians, two navy officers and a member of the state security
police, were behind other bombings in a series which began in mid-July.
It was widely believed that the bombings were politically motivated and
aimed at destabilising the government. No one has admitted to them.
However, the police are now looking at the theory that the group planted at
least one bomb to depress share prices on the already nervous Caracas
exchange.
They then bought shares at low prices, and sold when they recovered. The
authorities are said to believe the bombings may also have been used to
manipulate the price of Venezuela's external debt bonds on international
markets.
However, the police have not rejected the possibility that one or more of
the bombings (especially a July 19 letter bomb blast at the High Court which
injured an employee) were indeed carried out for political purposes.
The bombings came at a time of social and political unrest in Venezuela. The
country weathered two attempted coups last year and has been in a state of
political turmoil for over two years.

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TONI MORRISON, the American novelist, yesterday became the first
African-American and only the eighth woman to win the Nobel prize for
literature.
The Swedish Academy of Sciences, which since 1901 has awarded the annual
prizes bequeathed by industrialist Alfred Nobel, said Ms Morrison's work,
mainly concerned with racism in the US, depicted the lives of 'blacks as the
people they are'.
Through novels 'characterised by visionary force and poetic import (she)
gives life to an essential aspect of American reality', the academy said. Ms
Morrison, professor of humanities at Princeton, was a surprise choice
because the prize had gone to writers in English in the previous two years.
The West Indian poet Derek Walcott won last year, preceded by Nadine
Gordimer, the South African novelist.
Ms Morrison, 62, is the 10th American to win the prestigious prize, worth
SKr6.7m (Pounds 553,000). In a statement issued by her US publishers, she
said: 'I am unendurably happy. I, of course, am profoundly honoured. The
most wonderful thing for me personally is to know that the prize has at last
been awarded to an African-American.'
A teacher of literature, Ms Morrison has written six novels and a number of
essays in which the themes of racism, slavery and segregation are often
conveyed in violent images. Her novel Beloved, published in 1987, won a
Pulitzer prize. The Nobel judges said Ms Morrison, born Chloe Anthony
Wofford in Lorain, Ohio, strove to free language from 'the fetters of race'.
Her work had its roots in the work of William Faulkner - a Nobel laureate in
1949 - and other writers from the American south. It was 'unusually finely
wrought and cohesive, yet at the same time rich in variation.' They
described her 1992 book Jazz as richly complex, which sensuously conveyed
characters and moods.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Fresh setbacks for Australian budget plans
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Australian government last night suffered a further setback when two of
the revenue-raising measures in its proposed budget were voted down by the
Senate.
The first measure to be defeated was a proposed increase in wholesale sales
tax on wine from 20 per cent to 31 per cent. This has been strongly
denounced by both the opposition coalition and by the minority parties (the
Democrats and the Green party) which hold the balance of power in the
Senate.
The loss of this increased tax revenue would affect the government's revenue
calculations for the current tax year, but by a relatively small amount of
some ADollars 70m (Pounds 30m).
The Senate subsequently approved one round of wholesale sales tax increases,
but then voted down a proposed second round, due to come into effect in July
1995. The second round of tax increases was rejected by the opposition and
the Greens, leaving the crucial vote with the Tasmanian independent senator,
Mr Brian Harradine. He finally voted against the increase.
Although the outcome of the Senate voting was largely as predicted, it is
still unclear where this leaves the government's finance proposals. Earlier
in the day Mr John Dawkins, the treasurer, had insisted that the government
would implement the income tax cuts proposed in its budget only when the
revenue-raising measures had been passed by the Senate. 'This is a package,
and it will remain a package as far as the government is concerned,' he
said.
Mr Dawkins' latest affirmation of the government's determination to link
revenue-raising and tax-cutting measures could mean the personal income tax
reductions, due to come into effect next month, will be delayed. Should this
happen, Mr Dawkins claimed, the opposition could be held responsible.
There was, however, one brighter piece of news for the government yesterday.
The nation's unemployment rate fell from 11.1 per cent in August to 10.9 per
cent last month, according to the latest seasonally adjusted data. The
Bureau of Statistics said 45,100 people found work during the month,
although most of the jobs created were for part-time work, and full-time
employment rose only slightly. The drop in the unemployment rate was largely
in line with analysts' forecasts.

THE BLACK maid employed by two of the white right-wingers accused of
murdering Mr Chris Hani, South African communist leader, gave evidence
yesterday linking the two to the alleged killer, Reuter reports from
Johannesburg.
Ms Elizabeth Motshwane told the Rand Supreme Court in Johannesburg that
Polish-born Mr Janusz Waluz, alleged to have killed Mr Hani with four shots
on April 10, visited the home of Mr Clive and Mrs Gaye Derby-Lewis four days
before the murder. 'I saw Waluz seated in the sitting room. . . he was
holding a fire-arm in his right hand, pointing downwards,' Ms Motshwane
said, adding that Mr Waluz had breakfast with her employers that day.
All three defendants have pleaded not guilty to the murder of Mr Hani, which
plunged South Africa into one of its worst political crises since President
F W de Klerk began dismantling apartheid in February 1990.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Sihanouk press ban prompts fears on rights: Reporting
restrictions in Cambodia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAIN SIMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE first sign of possible restrictions on constitutional rights in
post-election Cambodia, the new government has warned journalists working in
the country that they should refrain from criticising the newly enthroned
King Norodom Sihanouk.
At a press conference Mr Ek Sereywath, the deputy information minister,
pointed out that foreign journalists have often written critical comments
about Prince Sihanouk (as he was until two weeks ago) and said it would be
'against our custom to criticise' the king.
The country's new constitution, which was promulgated by King Sihanouk two
weeks ago, enshrines freedom of the press, together with freedom of
expression and freedom of association. However, diplomats and other foreign
residents say they are concerned that the bar on criticism of the king could
lead to other restrictions on these constitutional rights.
King Sihanouk's past record of close involvement in Cambodian politics
suggests that any full account of political developments in the country
would have to reflect his role. Under the new constitution, the king 'reigns
but does not govern'. However, the early signs are that the king is likely
to play a much more active part in day-to-day questions than that implies.
King Sihanouk has had a testy relationship with the media since the first
time he ruled Cambodia as king during the 1950s. Then, and later when he
abdicated to become the civilian head of state, he kept a black list of
journalists who were banned from the country and refused to give interviews
to any but his favourites.
In recent years, as head of a resistance coalition and then as head of state
under the United Nations mandate in Cambodia, he has often responded in
detail to what he perceived to be negative reports about him in the local
and foreign press.
He now says he has put those days behind him, though. In interviews last
weekend, he repeatedly told visitors that Cambodia would have an absolutely
free press with no restrictions and no censorship.
Mr Ek Sereywath insists the idea of restricting criticism of the king was
his own initiative, but it seems likely that the idea had at least the tacit
support of the king, whose actions have often belied his public statements.
During the 18 months that the United Nations Transitional Authority in
Cambodia (Untac) was in the country, the local media flourished and became
much more outspoken. With the backing of the UN's own radio station, Radio
Untac, Cambodian reporters began to expose corruption and to criticise the
main political players, including King Sihanouk.
Now that Untac's mandate has come to an end and most UN personnel have left
the country, the local media are again exposed to a possible renewal of the
bullying and threats of the past. Until the Untac-sponsored election in May,
Cambodia was a one-party state and there was no real independence in the
media. The one outspoken editor was thrown into jail and his newspaper
closed.
One optimistic note in the new environment is that Mr Khieu Kanharith, the
editor who was jailed for his independent views, is now the minister for
information. Many fear, however, that he may be replaced by a tougher
political rival.
The government says it is committed to openness and a free press but when
the constitution was being drafted, there was no public consultation and no
dialogue between the members of the drafting committee and the public.
Special interest groups and a coalition of Cambodian non-government
organisations protested strongly but their views were still not heard by the
committee. Now, they point out that the government's commitment to dialogue
carries limited weight given the way in which the constitution was written
and the unwillingness of members of parliament to listen to the views of the
people who elected them.
The government insists it does not intend to widen the ban on criticism of
the king to cover ministers or other members of the administration. However,
there is already concern that there could be a return to the official and
unofficial censorship of the past.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a two-year investigation by the Abu Dhabi government, 11 former
officers of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International are to appear in
court at a preliminary hearing in the emirate tomorrow to face charges that
include forgery, mismanagement and fraud.
Of the 11, six are British passport holders, four are Pakistani and one is
reported to be Canadian. They include former executives of Bank of Credit
and Commerce (Emirates), a local bank in which BCCI had a 40 per cent
shareholding and the management contract. BCCE has long since been renamed,
restructured, and put under new management.
Two key figures from BCCI who are among the 13 facing charges will be
conspicuously absent. Mr Agha Hassan Abedi, the founder and former president
of BCCI, is an invalid in Pakistan, with which the UAE has no extradition
treaty, while Mr Ziauddin Ali Akbar has started serving a six-year sentence
following his conviction in London on September 28.
The hearing, and full trial later, could be open to the public though this
will depend on a decision of the trial judge. At Saturday's hearing the
charges will be read out and counsel for the defence appointed from among
several local lawyers.
The case would then normally be adjourned for two weeks while defence
lawyers study the charges. But given its complexity, they could ask for more
time, especially if they should seek access to more documents.

<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA faces renewed economic conflict following the cabinet's
unexpected decision to proceed with a petrol price increase in the face of
widespread opposition.
The country's main trade unions and commuter taxi organisations have
responded by announcing a programme of mass action involving demonstrations,
pickets and marches aimed at the government and oil companies. The Consumer
Council, Automobile Association and the AHI, representing Afrikaner business
interests, have also expressed disappointment at the cabinet's decision.
The dispute disrupts recent multi-party unity on issues of economic policy
such as the debt rescheduling agreement and an offer to Gatt to simplify and
lower tariffs within the Uruguay round of trade talks. It will raise renewed
questions among foreign investors about future economic policy in the
country. There has been a considerable surge in investor interest in South
Africa following the call two weeks ago by Mr Nelson Mandela, African
National Congress president, for the ending of economic sanctions.
In an effort to defuse opposition the government agreed to refer the 4 per
cent petrol price increase to the National Economic Forum (NEF), a
tripartite body on which business, labour and government are represented. An
NEF task-force had recommended this week that the price rise should be
suspended for two months from mid-October to mid-December.
President F W de Klerk said the cabinet's decision was 'economically
justified' and rejected accusations he was merely trying to show that he was
not a lame-duck president.

BURMA's military rulers continue to commit grave human rights abuses against
the Burmese people, despite some recent improvements, a report by the human
rights group Amnesty International says today.
More than 1,700 political prisoners have been released by the State Law and
Order Restoration Council (Slorc) since April 1992. But many others are
believed still to be languishing in jail either without trial or after
unfair hearings, Amnesty says.
Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, the pro-democracy leader and Nobel peace prize winner,
is enduring her fifth year of house arrest in Rangoon.
Even those who have been released are not secure. The Slorc uses the
Military Intelligence Services to intimidate and harass real or imagined
government critics after they have been freed, the human rights group says.
Amnesty also highlights the plight of members of ethnic minorities. They are
routinely seized in their villages and fields by soldiers, accused of
supporting guerrilla insurgents and beaten or forced to work as porters.
'Despite some positive steps taken by the Slorc, including the abolition of
military tribunals, to respond to international criticism of its human
rights record, the human rights situation in Myanmar (Burma) is still grim
and needs urgent attention,' Amnesty says.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Meeting to seek halt to biodiversity loss
</HEADLINE>

GOVERNMENT officials and environmentalists from about 130 countries will
meet in Geneva next week to discuss how to implement an international treaty
protecting bio-logical diversity.
The biodiversity convention, signed at last year's United Nations Earth
Summit in Brazil, has been ratified by the required 30 nations and will come
into force on December 29.
The convention is designed to stem the unprecedented and accelerating loss
of the world's estimated 10m plant and animal species and thus its genetic
resources. The loss is largely due to destruction of tropical rainforests,
which contain roughly half the world's known species.
Ms Elizabeth Dickson, senior adviser on biodiversity to the United Nations
Environment Programme (Unep), said yesterday that on present trends the
world could lose a quarter of all plant species within the next 30 years.
Next week's meeting will be discussing immediate action to halt the erosion
of biodiversity and secure its sustainable use, as well as how the measures
should be financed.
Ms Dickson said the main emphasis would be on getting countries to draw up
national strategies for biodiversity protection and thereby trying to bring
about a change of philosophy. 'Instead of saying 'Let's have a park',
governments will look at how incentives built into the economic system
encourage people to destroy biodiversity,' she said.
The meeting is also expected to touch on the issue of how rich and poor
countries should share the benefits from use of genetic resources, which are
concentrated in the developing world. This includes technology transfer,
granting of access to genetic resources, and the role of intellectual
property protection.
Ms Elizabeth Dowdeswell, executive director of Unep, which sponsors the
newly-formed interim secretariat for the convention based in Geneva, said
yesterday it was imperative to take action now to stop the alarming loss of
biological diversity: 'The richer the diversity of life, the greater the
opportunity for medical discovery, economic growth and adaptation to
changing circumstances such as global warming. The variety of life is our
insurance policy. Our lives depend on it.'

About 1,000 Cambodian students took to the streets of Phnom Penh yesterday
in a peaceful protest against compulsory French language classes at their
technical institute, Reuter reports from Phnom Penh.
It was the first mass demonstration seen in the capital since government
police and army units bloodily suppressed an anti-corruption protest in
December 1991.
The students were angry that French-promised educational assistance to their
school was linked to their having to learn the language of their former
colonial masters.
Earlier this year King Norodom Sihanouk had pledged that his country, a
French colony until 1955, would become a member of the French-speaking
community of nations. Many younger Cambodians would prefer to learn English.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Beijing hits at Patten over HK speech

<TEXT>
CHINA yesterday expressed its 'regret' over a speech on Wednesday by Hong
Kong Governor Chris Patten in which he warned that decisions on arrangements
for pending elections would have to be taken in weeks not months.
Mr Wu Jianmin, Foreign Ministry spokesman, said there still remained a
'large gap' between China and Britain on the issue, but his remarks were
low-key. 'We hope that the British side will take a truly constructive
attitude towards the talks so as to narrow the gaps as early as possible,
and make the talks a success.'
Mr Patten, who wants to extend the franchise for local elections in 1994 and
for elections to the Legislative Council (Legco) in 1995, told Legco on
Wednesday that 'we now have only weeks rather than months' to conclude
arrangements.
China is bitterly opposed to Mr Patten's proposals, arguing that they
contradict understandings reached in negotiations during the 1980s on the
future of the colony, which reverts to Chinese rule in 1997. The 1994 and
1995 elections are the last that will be held before the handover.
Beijing and London have conducted 12 rounds of talks on the future of Hong
Kong in an effort to resolve differences over Mr Patten's proposals, but
have made little progress. Talks are due to resume in the Chinese capital
early next week.
'The Chinese side is of the view the current talks are aimed at a smooth
transition in Hong Kong's political system,' Mr Wu said. 'A bilateral
agreement on the 1994-95 election arrangements is the necessary condition
for a 'through train'.'
This latter reference is to arrangements that would help Hong Kong through
the difficult transitional period when London yields control to Beijing.
Legislators elected for four years in 1995 would continue to hold office
after the Chinese takeover, hence Beijing's extreme sensitivity over the
possibility that an extended franchise might yield more militant
representatives.
Referring to agreements between Beijing and the UK, including the Joint
Declaration on the colony's future, initialled in 1984, and the Basic Law of
1990, Mr Wu said that the 'essence' of the current dispute was not over
whether there should be democracy, but 'whether one should honour his word'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW ZEALAND seems headed for a close general election on November 6, with
latest opinion polls showing the opposition Labour party has steadily gained
support over the past month through attacks on the government's handling of
social welfare issues.
The Heylen One Network News poll says Labour and the ruling National party
are neck and neck at 37 per cent, with Labour gaining two percentage points
over the past month. The TV3 Gallup Poll showed the National party at 40 per
cent, a drop of seven points since early September, while Labour had gained
ground to 39 per cent. The minor Alliance and New Zealand First parties had
a combined 20 per cent in both polls.
Mr Murray McCully, government communications committee chairman, said the
polls showed that the National administration had no room for complacency.
Labour had gained momentum by 'firing all the policy shots' over the past
month'.
Mr Mike Moore, Labour leader, was the preferred prime minister in both
polls, with about 20 per cent support; the incumbent, Mr Jim Bolger, scored
8 per cent, behind Mr Winston Peters, leader of the New Zealand First Party,
on 17 per cent.
At the November 6 election, voters will also be called on to take part in a
referendum to vote on a change in the electoral system. At present New
Zealand elections are won on the British first-past-the-post system, which
means that the government is elected on the number of parliamentary seats it
wins. At a referendum, voters will be asked to choose whether they wish to
adopt the German mixed-member proportional system.
The latest polls showed that support for the change was falling slightly,
with 46 per cent in favour of the German system and 37 per cent against.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Ukraine nuclear pact threatened
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE and Russia are at odds over the terms of their agreement last month
for the transfer of strategic nuclear weapons on Ukrainian soil to Russia.
The viability of the accord reached at a summit meeting in Massandra in the
Crimea is now in doubt.
Russia has accused Ukraine of fraudulently changing the wording of the
agreement to exclude 46 modern SS-24 missiles from removal to Russian
territory. Two weeks ago Moscow quietly announced that it considered the
transfer agreement null and void.
Ukraine has responded by saying that Russia misled Ukraine during the
signing of documents by setting down a text that was not what Ukraine had
negotiated. Ukraine insists its changes were made in the presence of Mr
Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russian prime minister, before he signed.
The penned-in changes are not initialled in the margin as is customary
diplomatic practice. Ukraine sticks to its interpretation that all nuclear
weapons are not covered under the protocol. It says it is ready to
renegotiate but has set a list of conditions before any pact can be
implemented. These include compensation for the short-range tactical nuclear
weapons it voluntarily transferred to Russia in May 1992.
There is currently no timetable for reopening nuclear talks between the two
sides. Nor is there a timetable for the Ukrainian parliament to ratify the
1991 Start 1 nuclear arms reduction treaty signed between the US and the
Soviet Union.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Cocaine seizures soar in Europe

<TEXT>
COCAINE seized by European customs authorities was up 42 per cent in the
first half of this year, on the same period in 1992, customs officials said
yesterday.
European officials seized 9,800kg of cocaine in the first six months of
1993, against 6,914kg in the first half of 1992, the Brussels-based Customs
Co-operation Council said. The amount of cannabis seized in Europe during
the first half of the year also increased, from 80 to 91 tonnes
The amount of heroin seized decreased in western Europe, but rose in the
east European countries. Mr Georges Davrou, deputy director of the CCC's
technical division, said yesterday that it was too early to tell whether the
abolition of many of the EC's internal frontier controls on January 1 had
had any effect. Customs officials have always argued that more illicit drugs
are seized following tip-offs or large-scale cross-border operations than as
a result of random checks.
The nine members of the Schengen free-travel accord - all 12 EC countries
except Britain, Denmark and Ireland - have pledged to lift remaining
passport controls from December. Although it supports the deadline, France,
in particular, has expressed concern about the flow of drugs.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Ruhe call for partnership with Moscow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CALL for the Nato alliance to develop a 'new strategic partnership' with
Russia to meet Moscow's security interests came yesterday from Mr Volker
Ruhe, the German defence minister.
In a speech reflecting growing western concern at the pressure on Mr Boris
Yeltsin, the Russian president, from his own military establishment, Mr Ruhe
told senior officers of the armed forces: 'We will only achieve stability
with Russia, not against it.'
His statement amounts to a retreat from his earlier position, in which he
stressed the need for rapid enlargement of Nato membership to include Poland
and other central European countries - to the obvious anger of the Russian
military. Mr Ruhe repeated his call for a 'transfer of stability' by the
Nato alliance to the east, linked to extension of the European integration
process to include east European countries.
'Preventive crisis management means for us Germans above all extending the
zone of stability in the west as far as possible to the east,' he told an
officers' annual meeting in Mainz. 'Germany has no interest in remaining the
eastern frontier state of the western zone of prosperity. We are the ones
who feel the effects of instability in the east most immediately.'
This time, however, Mr Ruhe stressed the need to take account of Russia's
security interests. 'Russia will not and must not be excluded from the
European (integration) process,' he said.
'It is striving for a new strategic partnership with Nato and a
political-economic partnership with the European Community.
'We must take into account the extremely difficult situation of the forces
for reform in Russia.'
His stance reflects western analysis that Mr Yeltsin has been forced to bow
to Russian military pressure on several occasions recently, twice in letters
to Nato allies, in order to ensure military support in his confrontation
with the Russian parliament.
The Russian leader sent a personal letter to government leaders in the US,
Britain, France and Germany warning against an expansion of Nato to the
east, without taking account of Russian security concerns. He has also
sought to raise the ceilings on its forces in the Caucasus region and breach
the terms of the conventional forces disarmament treaty with the west.
Mr Ruhe has run into sharp criticism in Germany and Poland over earlier
calls for rapid Nato membership, and also for joint Polish-German exercises.
The more careful tone in his latest policy statement appears to indicate
that concern about the military influence in Moscow has now reached the
planning staff of the armed forces.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Bosnian Moslem split widens: How Serbs and Croats are
managing to drive a wedge between Moslem regional bosses and the Sarajevo
presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONVINCED that fighting between Moslems in north-western Bosnia will
finalise the republic's two-way partition, Serb and Croat leaders observe
the escalating violence with barely concealed delight.
They see the first intra-Moslem clashes as proof that the process of
fragmentation is unstoppable. There is slim chance, they believe, for
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic to build his own mostly Moslem state on
the ashes of multi-ethnic Bosnia.
Fighting erupted after Mr Fikret Abdic, the undisputed leader in the
north-west region, declared autonomy for this densely populated Moslem
heartland. The proclamation prompted Mr Izetbegovic to order Bosnian army
troops to stop the rebellion.
In an attempt to stop his would-be mini-state further disintegrating, Mr
Izetbegovic addressed the United Nations General Assembly in New York
yesterday where he protested that Bosnia was being subjected to 'political
vivisection'.
Mr Abdic's declaration of autonomy in the Bihac pocket was the outcome of 18
months of war. It was encouraged by Serb and Croat nationalists. Mr Abdic
also was keenly aware of tactical backing from the international community.
Mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, frustrated by the
intransigence of Mr Izetbegovic, have made no secret of their admiration for
Mr Abdic as a leader ready to make a deal on the republic's partition and
buy peace at any price.
The envoys re-invented Bosnia's collective presidency. At the Geneva talks
they used Mr Abdic to weaken Mr Izetbegovic. On points where Mr Izetbegovic
was particularly vulnerable, Mr Abdic proved ready to accept Serbian and,
especially, Croat demands.
Croatia over the past few months has boldly promoted Mr Abdic. Soon after
Croatian state media launched his propaganda assault on Mr Izetbegovic, Mr
Abdic announced his break with Sarajevo in the apparent first step towards
joining Croatia.
Even before the war, the region, because of its geographical proximity to
Zagreb, had closer economic ties with the Croatian capital than with
Sarajevo. In the shattered Bosnian capital, Mr Abdic counts for little.
However, he is a hero in his fiefdom, surrounded by Serb rebels in Bosnia
and neighbouring Croatia.
He is credited by his admirers for using his political cunning to ensure the
survival of his enclave, which has escaped the devastation wrought on the
rest of Moslem-held Bosnia. But his detractors say calculating Serbs and
Croats are waiting to gobble up the region, intact, later.
In the Bihac area, named after the biggest town, Mr Abdic is revered for
enriching this poor region by building up Agrokomerc, an agro-industrial
plant.
His popularity soared after a stint in jail in 1987 for issuing Dollars 300m
(Pounds 198.6m) in unbacked promissory notes. His opponents call him a
white-collar crook while fervent supporters claim he was framed. While
fighting between the Bosnian army and troops loyal to Mr Abdic continues, he
boasts, according to the Belgrade daily newspaper Politika, that
'Izetbegovic's state is defeated in western Bosnia and it will be defeated
in Tuzla and in other parts of Bosnia.'
Bosnian Serb leaders over the past month have leaked reports of talks with
Mr Selim Beslagic, mayor of Tuzla, the largest Bosnian stronghold in the
north. They gloat about 'signals' from Tuzla that the Moslem region is also
preparing to break away but to join Greater Serbia.
The international mediators appear to have taken an interest in Mr Beslagic,
stepping up their contacts with him over the summer. Bosnian Serb chieftain
Radovan Karadzic repeatedly claims he has messages from European capitals
expressing opposition to a Moslem state in Europe.
If Tuzla, too, under pressure of the war and the Serb stranglehold, declares
autonomy from Sarajevo, Bosnia will be divided between Serbia and Croatia,
with nothing left for the Moslems but assimilation or migration.

FT  08 OCT 93 / French parliament hails return of a Bourbon
</HEADLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BOURBON - King Juan Carlos of Spain - was back yesterday in the Palais
Bourbon, as the classical building which houses France's national assembly
on the banks of the Seine was once known.
The stir caused by the presence of the Spanish monarch, himself a descendant
of Louis XlV, in the French parliament was nothing to do with any royalist
revanchism or indeed what King Juan Carlos said; he delivered a 30-minute
eulogy on the good state of French-Spanish relations.
The controversy, rather, centred on the fact that Mr Philippe Seguin, the
maverick Gaullist president of the national assembly, had had the temerity
to invite, off his own bat, King Juan Carlos to be the first foreign leader
to address the French parliament since President Woodrow Wilson in 1919.
As far as the government and the Foreign Ministry in particular, are
concerned, the legislature is straying dangerously into the executive's
foreign policy patch. Yet Mr Seguin, who is campaigning to enhance the image
of what is one of Europe's weakest legislatures, called the king's visit 'a
great day' for parliament. Mr Seguin won praise from flattered MPs of all
sides for pulling off his 'Juan Carlos' coup, but many deputies are less
than pleased by his other moves to make their legislature more
business-like. In order to increase flagging attendance, Mr Seguin has for
instance forbidden individual deputies to cast electronic votes for absent
colleagues, as they had freely done so in the past.
President Francois Mitterrand himself shares some of Mr Seguin's aims,
having proposed last spring that the constitution should be changed to give
parliament more time and scope to organise its business.
But the Balladur government wanted to limit such a constitutional change. It
now finds, however, the other part of the legislature - the Senate which is
not even directly elected - is taking a leaf out of Mr Seguin's book. It has
invited Chancellor Helmut Kohl to address it next week .

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ROME, ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE prominent bankers have been arrested on charges of fraudulent
bankruptcy relating to the 1991 collapse of Federconsorzi, the powerful
Italian agricultural services group.
Federconsorzi was forced into liquidation in May 1991 with outstanding debts
of L4,200bn (Pounds 1.74bn). These are the first arrests connected with the
affair, which caused widespread friction with foreign creditors over full
repayment of debts contracted by the agricultural services group.
Those arrested yesterday were Mr Paolo Bambara, the Federconsorzi chief
executive, and Mr Rosario Corso, a senior member of the management of the
leading state-controlled bank, Credito Italiano. It was revealed yesterday
that a week ago police arrested Mr Paolo Lorenti, the financial director of
Federconsorzi.
The charges allege that these men abused their positions when Federconsorzi
was on the brink of collapse, ensuring that certain bank loans were
reimbursed in full prior to the formal liquidation process.
The arrests highlight the increasing involvement of the banking system in
investigations into corruption. Earlier this week police arrested Mr Franco
Matera, a senior manager at the Banca Nazionale dell'Agricultura, for
allegedly helping to facilitate a L2.5bn bribe for a contract for nine
helicopters supplied to the Italian security forces by Augusta, the
state-controlled helicopter manufacturer.
Meanwhile, Milan magistrates have issued an arrest warrant for Mr Enrico
Braggiotti, former chairman of Banca Commerciale Italiana, allegedly in
connection with Dollars 50m (Pounds 33m) paid to him by the late Mr Raul
Gardini while head of Ferruzzi-Montedison.
Greek supreme court prosecutors yesterday dropped their investigation into
allegations of wrongdoing in the sale of Heracles General Cement to Italy's
Calcestruzzi, court officials said, Reuter reports from Athens.
Calcestruzzi, which is controlled by the Feruzzi group, bought the major
share in Heracles, Europe's biggest cement exporter, in 1992 for Dollars
225m (Pounds 149m) in a joint venture with the state-run National Bank of
Greece. According to prosectors, No evidence had been found to justify
charges against employees of the state-run company, or any others involved
in the sale.
Feruzzi's financial executive, Mr Giuseppe Berlini, had alleged that Greek
politicians received bribes to expedite the sale of the cement company.

<TEXT>
GERMANY'S ambitious recycling programme for packaging waste faced a new
obstacle yesterday after a large dairy company filed a supreme court suit
seeking to undermine its key requirements, Reuter reports from Bonn.
A spokeswoman for Alois Muller, a Bavarian dairy company, said the
Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe had said it would hear the case. 'We have
been told verbally the case will be accepted, but we do not have an official
written confirmation yet,' said spokeswoman, Mrs Marita Rehbein, of Alois
Muller's legal department. However, a spokesman for the court said he
believed a decision on the case was still pending.
The case is the latest gesture of opposition to the programme run by a
private company, Duales System Deutschland (DSD), which has been criticised
by Germany's federal cartel agency and which narrowly escaped a financial
crisis this summer. Alois Muller's challenge also echoed mounting calls from
industry and environmental experts, including government members of
parliament, for incineration to be given a greater role in flattening the
mounting dumps.
Alois Muller, which uses mainly plastic containers for milk products it
distributes nationally, is challenging a strict 1990 recycling ordinance
that requires the private sector to recycle rather than burn or dump most
throw-away packaging. 'The main point for us is that incineration must be
allowed as an alternative to recycling,' Mrs Rehbein said.
She acknowledged it would probably take the court years to reach a decision
because of a backlog in cases.
Alois Muller's challenge would undermine a clause of the ordinance which
requires 80 per cent of disposable packaging made of plastic, cardboard,
paper or metal to be collected and 80 per cent of that to be recycled -
provisions that will take effect in 1994.
Under pressure from the new rules, the three sectors involved - packaging
makers, retail businesses and waste management companies - last year set up
a national network for collecting the waste from homes and recycling it.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Modest fall in German jobless rate

WEST German unemployment fell by only a modest 0.1 per cent last month in
spite of expectations that economic activity would pick up after the summer
break.
The number of people out of work in west Germany last month was 2.3m, down
26,800 on August. The unemployment rate fell from 7.5 per cent in August to
an unadjusted 7.4 per cent. This compares with a 5.8 per cent rate in
September last year. 'The reduction in the number of employed people has
continued unabated until now,' Mr Bernhard Jagoda, president of the federal
labour office, said.
However, the number of people put on short-time work again increased,
jumping by nearly 200,000 to 590,400 last month, and on an adjusted basis
the number out of work rose to 2.38m from 2.34m in August. Short-time
workers are defined as employees who stay on their companies payrolls but
work less than the normal 38 hours a week. Part of the salary is covered by
the federal labour office.
In eastern Germany, the unemployment rate fell slightly from 15.4 per cent
in August to 15.2 per cent last month. The number of people out of work in
the east is now 1.1m. The number on short-time work remained unchanged at
about 143,000, which is some 100,000 more than the same time last year.
The figures confirmed warnings by economists that the recession was lasting
longer than expected because of continuing low domestic demand. Leaders of
German business associations have been cautioning against government
statements forecasting recovery in the coming months.
Meanwhile, the number of people in job creation schemes continued its steady
decrease. The federal labour office, faced with a growing deficit now
standing at DM27bn (Pounds 10.9bn), stopped creating new state-subsidised
schemes earlier this year. Just over 39,000 people were in job creation
schemes in the west, nearly half the number recorded in the same month a
year ago. In eastern Germany, 1.4m people were in retraining programmes,
down from 1.8m last year.
The labour office said it had saved DM400m in the last six months after
introducing stricter controls over recipients of unemployment benefits.

NEGOTIATIONS to reschedule at least Dollars 26bn of Russia's debts to
western commercial banks opened in Frankfurt yesterday, as a top Russian
minister indicated that he would seek more generous terms.
The 'London Club' of some 600 commercial bank creditors, represented by a
committee chaired by Germany's Deutsche Bank, have offered a 15-year
rescheduling arrangement. It involves a five-year grace period, and then
repayment over a further 10 years.
As preliminary talks opened yesterday, led by Mr Andrei Vavilov, the first
deputy finance minister on the Russian side, a statement was released in
Moscow saying Russia could not afford the Dollars 6bn due to both commercial
bank and official creditors next year.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister in overall charge of
relations with international institutions, said the government was 'calling
on its official and commercial bank creditors to consider another
restructuring scheme more acceptable to Russia'.
Mr Shokhin, who is due in Frankfurt today to head the Russian team, said
Moscow could only afford to pay Dollars 2.5bn of debt servicing in 1994.
The Russian government was divided on the issue, with some ministers
favouring a debt write-off. But opinion has now swung behind Mr Boris
Fyodorov, finance minister, who believes Russia can and must manage to
service its rescheduled debts.
The Russian delegation is likely to meet a tough attitude from the western
bankers, who believe Russia has considerably more foreign exchange than the
Dollars 6bn reserves held by the central bank. Mr Georg Krupp, the Deutsche
Bank director responsible, suggested recently that Russian banks held up to
Dollars 10bn outside the country, and enterprises a further Dollars 20bn.
Moscow has already agreed a rescheduling arrangement with the Paris Club of
official government creditors, involving some Dollars 15bn of the Dollars
37bn they are owed.
The commercial banks are owed an estimated Dollars 37.5bn, including a
backlog of Dollars 1.5bn accumulated for 1993 alone. So far this year, the
debt has been subjected to repeated 90-day roll-over agreements, which the
new deal would replace.
Yet to negotiate an arrangement with Moscow is the group of unsecured trade
creditors, owed some Dollars 12bn.
When the recent backlog of payments is included, total Russian debt is now
estimated at around Dollars 80bn.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Swedish banks' bad loans investigated by prosecutor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Swedish state prosecution office is to scrutinise SKr37.8bn (Dollars
4.7bn) of bad banking loans for evidence of wrong-doing and poor business
practice.
A total of 156 cases have been passed over to the office by the country's
finance inspection board for further scrutiny following its own
investigations.
The amount is equivalent to 5 per cent of the total lending of all the banks
examined, up until December 31 1992, in the investigation into the bad
loans.
The move is part of the fall-out from Sweden's two-year banking crisis,
which has brought more than SKr100bn in credit losses and forced the
government to provide a safety net for the entire banking system.
The finance inspection board stressed that only some of the cases handed
over could be expected to lead to deeper scrutiny by the prosecutor's
office. It said it was impossible to calculate the exact amount at this
stage.
But the finance inspection board said there was evidence of some loans being
obtained by deception, and instances of loans being granted when it was
clear that the receiver could face repayment difficulties.
The investigation has covered all Swedish banks which have sought or
received state aid, including Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, the leading
commercial bank, Gota Bank, Nordbanken, Sparbanken Forsta, and
Foreningsbank.
In the first instance, the investigation has concentrated on credit
engagements dating from 1990, which have caused many of the banks' biggest
losses.
The size of the bad loans being investigated varies from SKr15m to more than
SKr1bn.
Sweden's banking crisis is mainly related to the collapse of the real estate
market.
It has resulted in two of the country's leading commercial banks, Gota Bank
and Nordbanken, coming under state ownership.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Greek Elections: Tough battle for the spoils of patronage -
Kerin Hope takes a local look at some of the campaign's issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF GREECE'S opposition Panhellenic Socialist Movement wins the general
election on Sunday, several hundred new jobs will be created in Lavrion, a
port south of Athens where some 70 per cent of the workforce have been made
redundant in the past three years.
If the ruling New Democracy party, lagging in the polls, manages to scrape
back in, the feud between a conservative government and socialist local
administration will continue, deterring new businesses from arriving.
The election campaign is being fiercely fought in Lavrion, a town that
exemplifies problems a new government must address: disinvestment,
increasing reliance on the black economy and intense political interference
that blocks administrative reform.
Issues that have dominated the campaign, such as the ballooning public debt,
Greece's ability to handle the EC presidency next year and, in recent days,
the outlook for talks with Macedonia, can arouse strong reactions.
However, in Lavrion argument is just as passionate over the town's efforts
to secure its share of the public investment budget. Competition is strong
for the spoils of Greece's patronage system, distributed for the most part
to the governing party's political allies.
'We've had a funding squeeze and public works projects moved very slowly.
Things will pick up a good deal here if Pasok comes back,' said Mr Panayotis
Bafilas, deputy mayor.
The conservatives claim they kept their 1990 election promises, improving
the road from Athens and building a workers' housing estate.
However, the town has lost almost 20 per cent of its residents since several
large companies, including two textile producers, a ceramics manufacturer
and a yacht-builder, shut down. A bigger blow to Lavrion would be the loss
of a Dollars 600m project to build a power station. If the conservatives win
the election, it will be built in central Greece instead.
'We get by, thanks to the black economy, with people working in the building
trade for illegal summer homes, or by commuting to jobs closer to Athens.
But there aren't many jobs for women so family incomes are down,' said Mr
Demosthenes Mourelatos, an electronics technician.
The effects of recession, blamed on the conservatives' stabilisation policy,
together with their commitment to privatising public utilities and shutting
loss-making industrial companies under state control, have undermined New
Democracy's chances of winning a second term.
Polls show Pasok holding a steady lead of between three and five percentage
points, which would translate into an overall majority of about 12 seats in
the 300-member parliament.
Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the conservative prime minister, has managed to
make a dent in Pasok's support by energetically touring the countryside.
This was done to point up the contrast with Mr Andreas Papandreou, the
socialist leader, whose health is too frail to allow him more than a few
carefully stage-managed campaign appearances.
Given that the prime minister is expected to take personal responsibility
for a multitude of minor decisions, even socialist voters doubt whether Mr
Papandreou can withstand the stress of the job.
However, Mr Mitsotakis's personal approval rating has continued to decline
throughout the campaign. New Democracy candidates have tried to distance
themselves from a leader perceived as serving the interests of his extended
family and close business associates.
Yet if the conservatives are defeated Mr Mitsotakis can safely blame Mr
Antonis Samaras, the former foreign minister, who brought down the
government last month by persuading a handful of rebel conservative deputies
to defect to his newly founded party, Political Spring.
Political Spring is expected to win about 4 per cent of the vote, taking
support almost exclusively from New Democracy.
Mr Samaras, whose hardline nationalist proclamations sit uneasily with his
calls for modernising Greek institutions, is expected to get most of his
votes in large urban centres. In the countryside angry New Democrats have
pelted him with eggs, calling him a 'traitor'.
Two small left-wing parties, Left Alliance, which has been losing voters to
Pasok, and the Greek Communist Party, supported by unreconstructed
Stalinists, are also forecast to win around 4 per cent.
Mr Mitsotakis, 75, says he will resign the party leadership and retire if he
loses power. That would leave Mr Papandreou, his political rival for more
than 30 years, free to prepare for his own retirement and bring the
long-awaited transfer of power to younger politicians within reach.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
MITSOTAKIS UNDER PRESSURE
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Constantine Mitsotakis
Leader of New Democracy
Party has held power since April 1990. Conservative and pro-business,
its majority was wiped out last month when two deputies broke away to
support the new Political Spring party (qv). Internal divisions
undermined Prime Minister Mitsotakis's efforts for economic reform,
with supporters of the patronage system coming out in opposition to
privatisation of public utilities. Mitsotakis, 75, says he will step
down from leadership if the ND loses.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Andreas Papandreou
Leader of Panhellenic Socialist Movement
Party was in government from 1981-89. It claims to have outgrown its
radical past and is promoting a new, pro-EC image. Papandreou, who
founded the party, still keeps a tight grip on policy-making and
organisation despite weak health. He pledges to keep economic reform on
track but has a record of making unpredictable policy switches.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Maria Damanaki
Leader of Left Alliance
Party participated in a short-lived coalition government with the ND in
1989. It split away in 1991 during an ideological dispute with the
still-Stalinist Communist Party (qv). Factional infighting brought a
further decline in support. Mrs Damanaki, a former communist, is
fighting an uphill battle to keep Alliance voters from turning to Pasok.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Aleka Papariga
Leader of Communist Party
Party looks defiantly backwards to the Greek civil war of the 1940s,
when the  communists were defeated by nationalists. Most of its support
comes from elderly civil war veterans and their families and militant
trade unionists. It takes a moderate line on Macedonia, partly because
many Greek communists fled there in the civil war aftermath.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Antonis Samaras
Leader of Political Spring
Party was founded in June by Samaras, a former political protege of
Mitsotakis. He was fired as foreign minister in 1992 for taking a
hardline nationalist position in Greece's dispute with Macedonia over
the latter's choice of name. He brought down the government in
September after calling on rebel ND deputies to stop supporting
Mitsotakis. He attracts support from younger, dissatisfied conservative
voters but is short on specific policies.

<TEXT>
ROMANIA yesterday became the 32nd member state of the Council of Europe, in
a brief ceremony in Vienna where a two-day summit of the organisation begins
today.
Mr Teodor Melescanu, the Romanian foreign minister, fulfilled the main
condition of membership by signing the European Convention on Human Rights
on behalf of his country. This document is, in the words of Mrs Catherine
Lalumiere, the Council's secretary-general, 'the ideological foundation of
our organisation'.
Romania's membership was approved by the Council's parliamentary assembly
and committee of ministers only last week. It had been controversial because
of doubts about the country's human rights record and particularly its
treatment of Hungarian and gipsy ethnic minorities.
Welcoming the new member to 'the European family', Mrs Lalumiere said
pointedly that she was 'thinking of all the Romanians, whatever their
origin', and that Romania was joining an organisation 'which had a duty to
remain vigilant'.
Representatives from other east European countries not yet admitted to the
Council, including Russia, will attend a pre-Summit 'exchange of view', with
the leaders of the member countries in Vienna this morning.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Confusion rules as Yeltsin takes scythe to soviets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin's plans to reform the system of soviets - the
law-making councils in every village, town, district and region of Russia -
yesterday touched off a mixture of anger, bewilderment, and resignation in
the regions.
The soviets system was developed by Lenin under the slogan 'All Power to the
Soviets'. They had no real power under communism but, in more recent times,
have clashed increasingly with parallel executive bodies known as
administrations.
The frightening sight of tanks pounding the Russian parliament has come as a
clear warning to the soviets, many of which had backed Mr Ruslan
Khasbulatov, parliamentary speaker, in his power struggle with Mr Yeltsin.
Taking the hint, some have begun to discuss their own dissolution.
'Everybody understands that we must end this theatre of the absurd,' said Mr
Vitaly Turkov, a spokesman for the Vladimir province council just east of
the capital.
Mr Vasily Cherepanov, deputy chief of the Perm council, said relations with
the regional administration had been soured by the power struggle in Moscow
and that his council would no doubt vote to dissolve itself. However, he did
not think any new council system would last long because Mr Yeltsin would
find in it a new 'enemy' to blame for worsening economic problems.
A spokesman for the Chelyabinsk council, which appointed its chief as head
of the administration in defiance of another governor appointed by Mr
Yeltsin, hit out at the president's 'violation of human rights'.
Although made from such a clear position of strength, Mr Yeltsin's
announcement on Wednesday of impending changes also posed more questions
than it answered.
Most officials of the soviets agree they need reforming, saying for a start
that regional soviets need to be cut back from 200 members to 10-15. They
also agree they should not be involved in the day-to-day running of the
regions. But nobody has yet spelt out what should replace them, nor is it
clear whether all but the regional and some city soviets, would be
abolished.
Mr Vyacheslav Tyabotin, spokesman for the Novosibirsk regional
administration, whose governor was sacked on Tuesday for opposing Mr
Yeltsin's dissolution of parliament, said he believed a single regional
soviet would be sufficient for Novosibirsk.
He cited as absurd the existence of a soviet in even the smallest village.
'Endless contradictions in some soviets have turned many of them into big
talking shops,' he said. But he and many others warned that haste in
electing new councils in December, as Mr Yeltsin suggested, would bungle the
reform of local government.
Deputy prime minister Sergei Shakhrai, who specialises in regional and
constitutional issues, has threatened to resign because, fearing a power
vacuum, he wants gradual reform of soviets after a new national parliament
is created.
The reform of the soviets also has a direct bearing on attempts to transform
Russia into a genuine federal state. Republics such as Bashkortostan, which
sees its soviet as the national parliament, insisted that any reform must be
decided together with federation members.
Mr Yeltsin's announcement also leaves in the air how the upper chamber of a
new Russian parliament would be formed. His initial plan was for it be to be
a Federation Council comprising leaders of each region's administration and
council. But Mr Nikolai Ryabov, head of the central electoral commission,
said yesterday a lower chamber could be elected in December, and formation
of an upper chamber decided later.

TRADING on Kiev's currency exchange was suspended yesterday after Ukraine's
interim currency, the karbovanets, plunged 10 per cent to 18,700 to the
dollar from 17,000 last week, Reuter reports.
'The currency exchange committee stopped the trading session to prevent the
collapse of the karbovanets,' said the market's spokesman. He said that
bankers lobbying for the repeal of regulations blamed for the currency's
decline were due to meet Mr Yefim Zvyagilsky, acting prime minister, later
in the day.
Under current rules, enterprises must sell half their hard currency earnings
at a fixed rate, which has stood at 5,970 since mid-August.

<TEXT>
THE GEORGIAN government has agreed to attend peace talks in Geneva which
will try to find a political settlement to the bloody civil war between
government forces and separatists from the western region of Abkhazia.
Mr Edouard Brunner, the Swiss diplomat who is mediating the peace talks on
behalf of the United Nations, said yesterday the Georgian side was ready to
come to Geneva 'in the next few days'. He hoped subsequently to get both
parties around the same table, along with Russia which, he said, had a
'legitimate interest' in the outcome.
Leaders of the self-proclaimed Abkhazian government yesterday concluded two
days of talks with Mr Brunner in Geneva. Mr Anri Djergeniya, its attorney
general, told a news conference that his delegation was ready to 'have a
dialogue' with the Georgian government. 'That's why we're here.'
Mr Djergeniya made clear that the Abkhazian leadership was not insisting at
the outset on full independence from Georgia. He said this would be for the
people to decide, once emotions had cooled and some stability had returned
to the war-ravaged region.
Mr Brunner said later that, despite their military success, the Abkhazians
were realistic enough to know that they might have to moderate their
political demands.
The Geneva peace talks were postponed twice last month because of the
renewed fighting in Abkhazia which left the rebels in control of the
disputed region.
These hostilities have now ended. However, the Georgian government is facing
another armed challenge from insurgent forces supporting the ousted
president, Mr Zviad Gamsakhurdia.
Aid agencies say an estimated 200,000 refugees fled Abkhazia during last
month's fighting, which shattered a Russian-brokered ceasefire agreed on
July 27. The Georgian government has appealed for helicopters to evacuate up
to 50,000 people trapped in the Caucasus mountains where many are already
said to have died from cold and hunger.
Mr Djergeniya said yesterday that all refugees, of whatever nationality,
were welcome to return home. He blamed reported acts of violence by
Abkhazian soldiers against ethnic Georgian civilians as the work of
'criminals'.
Mr Brunner said he had been assured by the Abkhazian delegation that such
acts would be sternly dealt with and that 2,000 criminal cases were already
pending.

FT  08 OCT 93 / BAe joint venture hit as Taiwan pulls out of talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE'S efforts to salvage its proposed joint venture to produce
regional aircraft in Taiwan appeared in further trouble yesterday when a
Taiwanese official said the government would take no further direct part in
the negotiations.
It emerged that basic differences over the deal separate the two sides.
Mr Wang Chieh-min, director-general of the Industrial Development Bureau,
part of Taiwan's industry ministry, told state radio that the government
would no longer involve itself directly in negotiations between Taiwanese
companies and foreign aerospace companies.
The government's function should be to improve the investment environment,
he said, with other tasks left to the companies involved.
The latest move, however, may reflect serious divisions in Taipei over the
value of such a deal.
The crucial difference between the two sides, according to negotiators, is
that BAe will not give a long-term commitment to the project.
Taiwan is insisting that BAe commit itself not just to selling the RJ series
of regional aircraft but to developing the next generation of aircraft,
which analysts suggest could cost Pounds 1bn.
BAe refuses to give such a commitment until the deal is signed and market
research shows there is a viable market.
Sources close to BAe say it broke off the latest talks last month because
'there was no real co-ordination on the Taiwanese side. They didn't come
with authority'. If the deal collapses it would undermine BAe's attempts to
improve its profits.
In the past three months, the Taiwanese government has played a formal role
in reconciling differences between BAe and its proposed partner, Taiwan
Aerospace Corporation. The government wants to enter the civil aerospace
industry as part of its industrial policy. However, the deal has stirred
political controversy in Taiwan on commercial grounds.
The deal involves Taiwan injecting Pounds 120m cash into BAe's lossmaking
regional aircraft business. BAe's regional jet range was designed in the
1970s and since then there has been increasing demand in Asia for aircraft
with a longer range and larger passenger-carrying capacity.
BAe has spent this week trying to restart the talks for the week starting
October 18. The next TAC board meeting, at which the future of the joint
venture will be discussed, takes place on October 19.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Pirate decoders pose threat to satellite broadcasters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY, TIM COONE and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SATELLITE Television broad-casters in the US and Britain and Hollywood
studios are joining forces to fight a potentially serious threat to their
booming business from pirates.
The Motion Picture Export Association of America, which represents the
Hollywood studios, and satellite broadcasters have produced a draft
directive they wish the European Commission to adopt to outlaw piracy
throughout the Community.
Manufacturing and distributing unauthorised decoders is a criminal offence
in the UK and France, but not in most EC countries.
Unauthorised decoders which unlock the scrambled pictures on subscription
channels are being openly advertised in magazines throughout Europe and are
now available in the UK.
The increasing threat from the satellite pirates comes only weeks after
British Sky Broadcasting launched its multi-channel subscription package in
the UK with a considerable fanfare orchestrated by Mr Rupert Murdoch,
chairman of News Corporation.
The Financial Times has tracked the pirates and their unauthorised 'smart
cards' that unlock the BSkyB movie and sports channels from Bochum in
Germany to the village of Bally-egan in Co Offaly in Ireland and on to
Warrington in Cheshire where the cards are being openly advertised for sale.
Mr David Lyons, who runs Satellite Decoder Systems, which operates in both
Ballyegan and Warrington, last night demonstrated one of his cards in the
Coachman's Inn pub outside Dublin airport.
The picture quality was indistinguishable over a 40-minute period from that
provided by the Sky card which is normally used in the bar's television
system.
Mr Frank Barlow, chairman of BSkyB, last night conceded that 'obviously
there are going to be attempts at piracy from time-to-time'.
'BSkyB will use all methods legal and technological to counter this
problem,' Mr Barlow added. BSkyB is a consortium in which Pearson, owners of
the Financial Times, has a stake.
Mr Lyons has said at times the cards come from Germany at others that
Ireland is the nerve centre. The satellite industry believes the cards are
being made in Bochum in Germany.
Mr John Spencer, UK marketing director of GI, the US electronics company who
has been monitoring the pirate decoders believes that the VideoCrypt being
used by BSkyB is being routinely broken by the pirates.
But in what is developing into a cat-and-mouse game with millions of pounds
at stake BSkyB is changing its signal when it thinks the threat from a
particular illicit card has become unacceptable.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Clarke backs Major's leadership: Chancellor warns of tough
Budget - Lamont launches attack on economic strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE offered unequivocal backing for Mr John Major's leadership
yesterday after keeping open the option of tax increases in his November
Budget.
As Mr Major prepared for the most important speech of his three-year
premiership at the end of the Conservatives' Blackpool conference today, Mr
Clarke dismissed speculation that he is poised on the threshold of 10
Downing Street.
The chancellor declared: 'Any enemy of John Major is an enemy of mine. Any
enemy of John Major is an enemy of the Conservative party.'
Mr Major managed yesterday to shrug off the appearance on the platform of
his predecessor, Lady Thatcher. He is now left with an opportunity to start
rebuilding his authority in his closing speech this afternoon.
Lady Thatcher has dominated headlines this week with criticism of her
successor apparently extracted from her forthcoming memoirs, but her
entrance to Blackpool's Empress Ballroom was eclipsed by the return of Mr
Michael Heseltine after his recent heart attack.
With Mr Clarke warning of a tough Budget and dissident Tory MPs threatening
to rebel against any further tax increases, few of the prime minister's
cabinet colleagues judged the threat to his leadership had disappeared.
The left-right struggle within the cabinet resurfaced again last night in
sharply contrasting speeches from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary,
and Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury.
Mr Hurd called on the Conservatives to avoid an ideological assault on the
public sector but Mr Portillo called for an ever diminishing role for the
state.
In a robust but less than inspirational performance, Mr Clarke hinted that
value added tax on domestic fuel could be imposed at the full 17.5 per cent
from next April. The present plan is for implementation in two stages - at 8
per cent in 1994 and 17.5 per cent in 1995.
He delivered a relatively upbeat assessment of prospects for sustaining
economic recovery, and said the priority was to curb public borrowing: 'The
Conservative party is the party of sound money or it is nothing.' He added
that it had been a mistake to phase in VAT on fuel rather than impose it
immediately.
But the chancellor's confident tone, bolstered by the failure of party
activists to launch a concerted assault on the tax, was challenged by a
renewed attack on his economic strategy by Mr Norman Lamont.
The former chancellor warned that tax increases beyond those he had
announced in March would lose the Conservatives the next election. He said
that Mr Clarke should instead raise another Pounds 5bn through a 2 per cent
cut in public spending.
His remarks drew a sharp response from Mr Clarke who said that Mr Lamont had
presided over a relatively lax spending round after the 1992 election.
The threat that the political row over VAT on fuel might explode again was
reinforced by a ministerial row over plans to compensate the low-paid for
higher heating charges.
Senior ministers said Mr Clarke had rejected a demand from Mr Peter Lilley,
social security secretary, that the compensation should extend to people not
reliant on income support.
Despite earlier hints that those with incomes and savings just above that
level might be compensated through housing and council tax benefit, Mr
Clarke said it was 'extremely difficult' to compensate that group.
He stressed that his first objective was to rein in the government's
borrowing through a planned freeze in real terms on public spending.

FT  08 OCT 93 / Kremlin plans radical reforms as election confidence grows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN ministers are preparing plans for new reforms beginning next year,
on the assumption that a radical, pro-market government will be formed after
parliamentary elections set for December.
Reformers believe that candidates identifying themselves with President
Boris Yeltsin will win in the polls after the smashing of the Russian
parliament and the assertion of strong presidential authority.
'Tanks shelling the White House is a much bigger argument than any other,'
said Mr Sergei Vassiliev, head of the economic reform centre. 'For ordinary
people it is not felt to be so bad that there is a strong man in the Kremlin
once more. I think we will get a parliament in December which is not bad
from the point of view of reform.'
Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy prime minister of finance, agreed that 'after
the tanks we found relations with the regional people suddenly got much
better'.
Mr Yeltsin yesterday continued to move against his political opponents,
banning the Constitutional Court until a new constitution is adopted and
issuing a further decree banning Moscow City Council. Security forces
arrested Mr Viktor Anpilov, head of the Labouring Russian group and a leader
of the attack on the Ostankino television centre on Sunday.
As troops and policemen killed in the battles were buried with full state
and religious ceremonies, Mr Yeltsin promised to banish the spectre of
'communist fascism' from the country, and said: 'Russia, its people and its
leaders must learn a solemn lesson from this tragedy and do everything in
their power so that it cannot happen again.'
The provisional death toll in two days of fighting stands at about 170 after
the discovery of a further 49 bodies in the White House, according to Mr
Viktor Yerin, the interior minister.
Some regional councils - as in Vladivostok - have responded to Mr Yeltsin's
call to dissolve themselves but others are likely to object strenuously.
The optimism in the reformers' camp is based partly on the perceived success
of Russia's Choice, the liberal-conservative electoral bloc formed under the
leadership of Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister.
Mr Vassiliev said that 'the Gaidar bloc has a good chance now to get around
40 per cent in the state Duma' (the lower house of the proposed new federal
assembly, the only one for which elections are to be held).
Mr Vassiliev and his colleagues are working on an economic plan for next
year, which would attempt to stabilise the currency as soon as a new
government took office with the aid of the International Monetary Fund.
The economic plan includes a new tax regime, being developed by Mr Fyodorov,
devolving taxation powers to the regions and republics, in the hope of
constructing a system that can satisfy their aspirations of autonomy.

FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Austin Reed in the black at Pounds 527,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPROVED turnover and margins in its UK shops helped Austin Reed, the
clothing manufacturer and retailer, achieve pre-tax profits of Pounds
527,000 for the 28 weeks ended August 14 1993, compared with losses of
Pounds 430,000.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 29.3m against Pounds 28.4m. Directors stated
that the manufacturing business 'fared less well as recession abroad took
hold, though it too experienced an improvement in UK sales'.
Earnings per share were 1.1p (1p losses) while the interim dividend is
lifted to 2p, up from 1.83p adjusted for June's scrip issue which
compensated the ordinary shareholders for the enfranchisement of the
non-voting shareholders.

FT  07 OCT 93 / German manufacturing orders fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MANUFACTURING orders in western Germany fell by 2 per cent in August against
July and by 7.1 per cent against August last year, the economics Ministry
reported yesterday. Orders for July and August together, however, were 0.5
per cent higher than in May-June, indicating 'a continuation of the upward
tendency observable since spring', according to the ministry.
The level of industrial orders will be watched closely in eastern Germany,
where any sustained economic growth will depend on receiving orders from
companies in the west. Real exports from the five eastern states are
expected to rise by 5 per cent this year compared with last, but it will
hardly dent the trade deficit which totals DM200bn (Dollars 123bn).
The latest figures coincide with a report by the Berlin-based DIW Institute
for Economic Forecasting which sees no signs of a fall in unemployment in
either western or eastern Germany. Despite adjustments for seasonal factors,
the DIW expects unemployment in the west to have risen by a further 20,000
last month, bringing the total number of officially unemployed to 2.16m, or
7.2 per cent of the labour force.
In the east, the DIW says there is not yet 'light at the end on the tunnel'
in terms of stemming structural unemployment. However, the number of job
vacancies stood at 64,000, a rise of 7,500 over the same period last year,
and 40,000 remain unfilled.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN is moving firmly into a recovery phase and its economy can be
expected to grow by around 2 per cent next year, Mr Bengt Dennis, the
central bank governor, said in a speech yesterday. Growth from 1995 onwards
ought to be even higher, he stated.
He said domestic demand, which has fallen sharply over the last three years,
could be expected to stabilise in 1994. 'Combined with rapidly growing
exports, this ought to produce a noticeable change in the development of the
economy,' he added.
Mr Dennis noted that short-term interest rates were at their lowest levels
for 14 years and long-term interest rates back to 1974 levels.
He ruled out any drastic cuts in the bank's key marginal rate, which has
fallen from 12.5 per cent to 8 per cent since last year. He drew attention
to the weakening of the krona and rise in long-term interest rates during
recent weeks, which he said could be blamed on uncertainty over Sweden's
future economic policy.

FT  07 OCT 93 / World News in Brief: Michael Jordan quits at the top
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
US basketball player Michael Jordan announced his retirement, saying he had
reached the pinnacle of his career. Jordan, 30, whose annual earnings and
endorsements from companies such as the Nike sports shoe group were put at
Dollars 50m, was top scorer seven times in his nine seasons in the National
Basketball Association with the Chicago Bulls team. His departure deprives
the NBA of its most charismatic attraction.

FT  07 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 Index reaches new peaks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW PEAKS on the FT-SE 100 Share Index yesterday signalled another
successful trading session in London as global fund managers continued to
buy equities across the range of European bourses. Early gains in London
were halved when profit-takers appeared both in equities and stock index
futures, but a strong opening on Wall Street helped the Footsie to close at
3,100.8, a gain of 15.6 on the day, and just 0.2 above the previous closing
high. The market capitalisation of the Footsie-listed stocks moved above
Pounds 500bn for the first time.
News that domestic car sales gained more than 11 per cent last month
provided a curtain-raiser for today's speech by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the
chancellor of the exchequer, to the annual conference of Britain's
Conservative party.
Firmness in Far Eastern stock markets overnight provided fresh support for
the opening of the London market, and an early gain of 5.1 on the Footsie
was quickly extended when the December contract on the Index came in once
again at a strong premium.
Stock market traders spent the rest of the session watching the play between
the Footsie and the futures contract. By mid-morning, the FT-SE Index was
31.1 ahead at 3,116.3, a new intra-day trading peak.
At this stage, the Footsie was 77 points, or about 2.5 per cent, up since
last Friday. Hardly surprisingly, the pace proved too hot to maintain and
the premium on the futures contract diminished and profits were taken in the
underlying blue chip stocks. Trading volume was not excessive and the
Footsie dropped back below the 3,100 market as Wall Street made an initially
uncertain start to the new session.
But equities resumed the upward path after Wall Street turned strongly
higher, showing a gain of 16 points on the Dow Industrial Average during UK
trading hours.
Stock markets have recovered confidence following the conclusion of the
political crisis in Russia, with London again finding the US buyers who had
backed off last month when they switched to the French and German markets.
In the UK market, hopes that base rates may be cut soon have quickened
during the Conservative party conference now unfolding in Blackpool, the
north of England seaside resort. Equity market optimism was sustained
yesterday by firmness in the government bond market.
Confidence continued to spread across the full range of the stock market,
lifting the FT-SE Mid 250 Index by 13.9 points to 3,471.6 - this Index
peaked at 3,513.3 at the end of August. Business in non-Footsie listed
stocks, at around 53 per cent, returned to average daily levels.
Trading volume increased towards the close but the day's Seaq total of
696.4m shares remained short of Tuesday's 774.3m, which was worth Pounds
1.33bn in retail business.
Oil shares rebounded yesterday and there was support for the
pharmaceuticals. But the strongest features were the interest
rate-orientated sectors, including properties, merchant banks and
construction issues.
The stock market hopes for a buoyant speech from the chancellor of the
exchequer, and hopes he will set the scene for a November budget which will
be stimulative for the domestic economy and favourable to prospects for the
equity market.

FT  07 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE carrot of an early interest rate cut persisted in coaxing derivatives
investors to the market and pushed the FT-SE future higher, Christine
Buckley writes.
While some doubts continued whether rate cut hopes would become reality, it
was difficult for traders to swim against an optimistic tide and buying of
the December contract on the FT-SE 100 was almost frenzied early in the
session, according to one trader.
Continuing the pattern of recent days, US buyers figured large as purchasers
along with local traders.
December opened at 3,128 and quickly climbed to its day's high of 3,148. But
as the cash market reached an all-time high a sense of perspective began to
curb derivative excitement and the contract began to fall back. Just before
lunch it dipped down to 3,122.
Volume notched ahead of recent levels and broke the 10,000 mark to close at
10,706 contracts traded. At the official end of trading December stood at
3,131 - a premium of just over 30 points to cash and just over 9 points in
front of its fair value premium to cash.
A quieter day was seen in traded options after the previous day's high
volume. The number of lots traded fell back over 14,000 to 32,420. Of the
stock options Hanson was the most heavily traded at 2,877 lots with Amstrad
in second place at 1,992 lots.

FT  07 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: BAe hit again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, SAQIB QURESHI and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Further fears that the proposed Pounds 250m regional jets joint venture
between British Aerospace (BAe) and Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC) was
close to collapse sent shares in one of the UK's biggest manufacturing
companies tumbling for the second day in row.
The shares were down 15 to 396p in early trading after TAC's acting
president said his directors would vote on the issue on October 19.
However, the news only served to increase uncertainty pver the deal with
traders paying little heed to a statement from BAe saying the Taiwanese
government still backed the venture.
Bargain hunters in the afternoon helped the stock recover some of the lost
ground and the shares finished 12 off at 399p, the second time the shares
have closed below 400p since July. Explaining the market's jitters, Mr Chris
Avery at Paribas said: 'The market had not fully discounted the possibility
of closure of the regional jets division and the cash outflow that would go
with it if the deal does not go ahead.'
Sentiment in BAe was further weakened by a sell recommendation from Robert
Fleming, due to land on investor's desks today.
The oil sector rebounded yesterday as cheap buyers followed closely on the
heels of the previous day's slide in share prices. In a generally firm
sector the main players staged the best performance.
Oil prices softened after trying to stage a modest rally and analysts saw
the recovery in share prices as little more than a knee jerk reaction to the
previous day's session in which they took a largely unwarranted bruising.
Some optimism over the announcement by Shell and BP of their joint venture
to develop oil and gas exploration in the Gulf of Mexico helped buoy those
stocks. Another boost to the larger oil stocks was the recommendation by
brokers Strauss Turnbull. Shell went ahead 3 to 682p in moderate volume
while BP moved up 5 1/2 to 326 1/2 p, again in reasonable volume.
A further driving force in oils was the relentless interest of US buyers,
according to a couple of analysts.
Burmah gained 6 to 788p, Lasmo added 2 to close at 140 1/2 p, Enterprise
also improved by 2 to reach 470p. Cairn Energy added 3 to 67p with its
quoted price touching 69p at one point, according to an oil analyst.
Interim figures from Bank of Scotland at the top end of expectations cheered
the market, helping the shares firm 3 1/2 to 184p in strong trade of 7.7m,
as analysts upgraded expectations of full-year profits.
Half-time profits jumped 58.4 per cent to Pounds 117.6m against a range of
forecasts of Pounds 93m to Pounds 120m. The range for the full year is now
Pounds 260m-Pounds 280m against a previous Pounds 210m-Pounds 230m.
Hopes of a reduction in interest rates continued to boost Abbey National
where the shares put on another 6 to to 437p.
Strong two-way business in Hanson brought the day's biggest turnover at 32m,
the shares closing 3 ahead 267p.
Among insurance stocks, Royal Insurance eased 3 to 325p after Smith New
Court placed 6.5m shares. The broker was reported to have placed the stock
at 325p.
A clutch of positive recommendations boosted British Airways and the shares
firmed 2 to 370 1/2 p. The stock is favoured by NatWest Securities, SG
Warburg and Smith New Court. Smith also recommended BAA, the UK airports
operator, and the shares put on 10 to 880p.
Among engineering stocks, a positive note on TI Group from NatWest
Securities helped the shares gain 8 to 371p, and it was a recommendation
from the same house that saw FKI advance 7 to 168p. Cookson Group put on 6
to 204p following a buy recommendation from Nomura.
Concerns about future prospects hurt FR Group and the shares lost 6 to 252p.
A bullish note from Credit Lyonnais for Fenner saw the shares put on 8 to
110p.
Construction group Hewden-Stuart gained 16 to 158p after the announcement of
interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.1m ahead of expectations. Analysts had
predicted profits of around Pounds 8m. Mr David Taylor of UBS said: 'The
good performance was a consequence of fewer bad debts and better
management.'
News of a slowdown in the German construction industry helped ease RMC down
8 to 825p and Redland 10 to 555p. UK housing start statistics, showing 4 per
cent fall in the three months to August, assisted the slide.
The move by Coats Viyella to redeem early preference stock dated November
2004 gave the share price a boost as the market responded well to the
implications for a rise in earnings per share and a fall in gearing. The
shares gained 8 1/2 to 268 1/2 p.
Courtaulds Textiles bounced after its recent dull run, the shares added 16
to reach 540p. Thin trading contributed to the price rise but one analyst
also believed that investors were beginning to realise that the stock had
started to look oversold.

News that Ladbroke, the gaming and leisure group, was being forced back to
court today to argue for the continuation of its injunction against the Mail
on Sunday, the UK newspaper, hung over the shares yesterday.
They closed a penny off at 180p, against the strong trend of the market, in
above average turnover of 2.8m. The newspaper is hoping to get the ban
lifted or to have its restrictions eased.
Ladbroke obtained the injunction 10 days ago to prevent the Mail from
repeating allegations about the company's relations with its bankers.
However, the episode heightened concern among investors and commentators
regarding Ladbroke's sensitivity over the issue, and prompted a spate of
negative press comment.

<TEXT>
NEWS OF the share restructuring at Whitbread, which will enable it to raise
cash by means of equity rights, prompted speculation over the drinks group's
strategy, and in particular over whether it is about to hit the acquisition
trail. Speculation was heightened by the list of investments held by the
Whitbread Investment Company (WIC), swallowed up by Whitbread as part of the
restructuring move.
The deal takes Whitbread's holding in Boddington and Marston to 21 per cent
each, six per cent above the ceiling demanded by the government's Beer
Orders. Favourite among drinks analysts to receive attention from Whitbread
is Marston, which has strong beer brands and a profitable managed estate.
Regional brewers aside, WIC's investments in FT-SE stocks total around
Pounds 50m, and analysts expect many of these to be off-loaded in the coming
months. The drinks sector in particular, where WIC is heavily invested, is
likely to see increased trading activity.
There was speculation that Greene King might be a candidate to buy WIC's
14.9 per cent stake in Morland, the company which it failed to land last
year and in which it still holds a 29.3 per cent stake. Among retail outlets
being hinted at as potential targets was Pizza Express.
However, yesterday's share price movements suggested that the market was
more concerned about stock overhangs than bid premiums. Boddington's had a
weak session, although rallied to close steady at 260p. Marston slid 7 to
266p, Vaux a penny to 247p and Morland 8 to 525p. Elsewhere, Greene King
steadied at 557p, as did Pizza Express at 107p. Whitbread 'A' shares stayed
at 534p and the 'B' shares fell 188 to 1200p.
Mr Kevin Feeny at Henderson Crosthwaite said: 'I believe the deal is a good
one because it is non-dilutive and gives Whitbread access to ready cash in
the form of investments.' He added that the accompanying upbeat statement
augured well for current trading.

FT  07 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow hesitant as jobs report
is awaited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
PROGRAM buying and strong financial stocks helped US share prices post
modest gains across the board yesterday, but afternoon selling brought
prices back down from their new highs, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 11.73 at 3,598.99,
short of its high for the day of 3,605.98. The more broadly based Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 finished 0.46 lower at 460.74, while the Amex composite ended up
1.68 at 463.36, and the Nasdaq composite 2.50 higher at 764.77, close to a
new record.
Trading volume on the NYSE was 276m shares, and rises outnumbered declines
by 1,105 to 858.
Prices opened only slightly firmer, as traders and investors waited for a
lead from the bond market. Although bond prices rose marginally in early
trading, they failed to provide much impetus to equity prices. Participants
in both markets seemed reluctant to trade actively ahead of tomorrow's
important September employment report.
Additionally, equity investors remained nervous about the approaching third
quarter reporting season. Some are worried that the moderate rate of
economic growth recorded over the summer will have hindered corporate
profitability, and that third quarter earnings will come in below
expectations.
Stocks, however, picked up ground later in the morning, aided by sporadic
computerised buy programs and firmer financial stocks, before easing back
from their peaks in the afternoon. Among financials, banks were mostly
higher in the wake of an announcement from Chemical Banking that it would
report record net income for the third quarter. Chemical rose Dollars  1/4
to Dollars 45 3/8 , Citicorp added Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 38 7/8 , Chase
Manhattan put on Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 37 1/2 , NationsBank firmed Dollars
 1/8 to Dollars 53 and BankAmerica rose Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 44 1/4 .
Semiconductor stocks, hit hard on Tuesday by poor earnings from Advanced
Micro Devices, rebounded in early trading, but suffered in a late sell-off.
Texas Instruments ended down Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 69 7/8 , Motorola
finished unchanged at Dollars 98 1/2 and Intel, traded on the Nasdaq market,
fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 69 1/4 . Advanced Micro itself remained under
heavy selling pressure, falling another Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 21 in volume
of 4m shares.
Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 46 1/2 after the
company said that it expects to report third quarter net income of between
Dollars 130m and Dollars 135m, up from Dollars 91m a year ago.
Nike fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 45 1/8 on the news that Michael Jordan,
the basketball star and the most famous promoter of Nike goods, is to
retire.
Canada
TORONTO prices posted strong gains in moderate trading, led by surging gold
issues. The TSE-300 composite index rose 41.37 points, or 1.03 per cent to
close at 4,055.48, according to preliminary data. Advancing issues
outnumbered declines 444 to 281.
The gold group jumped 4.1 per cent as the price of gold in New York rose.
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said it expects fiscal 1994 loan losses
to decline slightly from the forecast fiscal 1993 level of CDollars 920m. It
rose  3/8 to 30 5/8.

FT  07 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Peru and Sri Lanka join the IFC stable
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Peru and Sri Lanka take their places in the IFC's emerging markets
investable indices for the first time this week, raising the number of
markets covered to 20. The IFC also announced that it intends to issue data
on Zimbabwe and China in the new year.
Peru's equity market has been one of Latin America's strong performers this
year, although some profit-taking in September pulled prices lower. However,
the local IBVL index reacted impressively at the start of this week,
reaching an historic record high, on improved political prospects.
Baring Securities notes that news that the guerrilla group, Shining Path,
was willing to negotiate a peace accord with the government of President
Alberto Fujimori has lifted sentiment this week.
Baring's Latin American research team also report that September inflation
data, revealing the lowest monthly rate in 17 years, suggests that the
government's target of a ceiling of 40 per cent for the year now seems
feasible.
Trading in Peru is expected to remain choppy ahead of the referendum on a
new constitution later this month.
Sri Lanka has shown a healthy 30 per cent gain in dollar terms since the
start of the year, indicating, says the IFC, a preference for blue chip
stocks. In practice, the index contains only five tradeable stocks.

FT  07 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Rising bond prices cited as
DAX tests 2,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCORDING to the Eurotrack 100, bourses saw their best share prices at the
beginning of the day, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT's DAX index tested the 2,000 mark, peaking at 1,997.71 before
ending at a new all-time closing high of 1,987.05, up 14.32.
Turnover eased from DM10.8bn to DM10.6bn. Brokers thought that a break above
2,000 was only a matter of time, and the Ibis indicated DAX rose to 1,994.81
in the afternoon. The talk yesterday was all of the relationship between
equities and rising bond prices.
Corporate earnings prospects were a less attractive proposition. According
to Mr Horst-Kaspar Greven at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, the DAX is on
prospective earnings of DM75 to DM80 a share for 1993, so it would need eps
growth of a quarter to a third in 1994 to put it on a prospective p/e of 20;
even that would be at the high end of European valuations.
Big winners on the day included one leader of the recent rally in Allianz,
the insurer, up DM32 at DM2,740 on a 1993 progress report; losers took in
Daimler, DM6.30 lower at DM753.70 following its US debut, and Kaufhof, down
DM10 at DM550 as it sank in that the retailer's plans for a New York
quotation did not involve a change in its accounting practices.
ZURICH marched to a second consecutive record close, supported by hopes for
lower interest rates and a firm bond market. The SMI index added 13.5 to
2,534.8
Insurers were led higher by Zurich Insurance, SFr16 ahead at SFr1,291.
Kleinwort Benson, which rates it as a buy, said that in spite of one of the
worst underwriting years on record, Zurich's core Swiss insurance market
continued to provide a profitable, stable platform for earnings growth.
Bearers in SMH, the watchmaker, added SFr47 or 5.0 per cent to SFr991 in
active trade as the company sought to clarify earlier comments on the
profits outlook. SMH had fallen by 11.5 per cent over the previous three
sessions.
PARIS drifted throughout the session and the CAC-40 index closed 5.69 ahead
at 2,164.46, after a day's high of 2,179 and a low of 2,156.
Paribas Capital Markets, in its latest focus on French equities, remained
positive on the medium term outlook, forecasting that the CAC-40 index could
reach the 2,350 level by the year end, helped by falling interest rates.
On a sector-by-sector analysis Paribas recommended a long-term switch into
consumer stocks, noting that food retailing, particularly hypermarkets, can
be expected to perform well, given an expected improvement in consumer
spending. The brokers commented that food retailers could see earnings
growth of between 15 and 20 per cent in 1993, and that Carrefour and
Promodes had the potential to achieve high growth. Shares in Carrefour
closed yesterday up FFr87 at FFr3,586.
SocGen advanced FFr7 to FFr662 ahead of reporting a 9 per cent rise in first
half profit after the close.
MILAN saw late profit-taking pull prices back from their best levels with
the fortunes of Fiat group companies again the day's main theme. The Comit
index rose 3.94 to 600.41.
Fiat gave up an early advance to finish L11 easier at L6,172 although Ifil,
the Agnelli holding company, was L113 ahead at L6,045.
MADRID's climbers included Argentaria, up Pta100 at Pta5,770, Tabacalera,
Pta90n better at Pta3,780, and Telefonica, up Pta40 at Pta1,625 as the
general index closed 2.47 higher at 291.51.
Mr Stephen Hughes at Kleinwort Benson said that Argentaria (up Pta350 this
week) was recovering from weakness following a new equity issue; Tabacalera
reacting to a new chairman, who talked of job cuts this week; and Telefonica
to a KB buy note which went down well in the US market.
AMSTERDAM was broadly higher although Hoogovens, the steel group, fell back
Fl 1.80 to Fl 43.00 in spite of denying rumours that it might file for court
protection against creditors or issue new share capital.
The CBS Tendency index gained finished up 1.00 at 127.9.
STOCKHOLM followed Tuesday's tax cut proposals with a morning rally, but the
afternoon saw an upward correction in money market interest rates and the
Affarsvarlden General index closed only 1.3 higher at 1,327.0.
A fall in Ericsson B shares, down SKr7 to SKr437, from Tuesday's all-time
high weighed on the market, as did a decline in Volvo B, off SKr9 to SKr431.
OSLO, in contrast, was spurred to a 2 per cent gain by lower domestic
interest rates and forecasts of a narrower budget deficit for 1994, the all
share index closing 11.62 higher at 575.55.
COPENHAGEN closed 1.1 per cent higher with the KFX index up 1.09 at 98.86.
Investor interest in Superfos, the agricultural chemical, grain and
road-building group, was stimulated by continuing rumours that the company
could be the subject of a hostile takeover. The shares rose DKr17 to DKr384.
ISTANBUL retreated by 1 per cent as a consolidation phase, which began on
Monday, was seen continuing. The composite index lost 163.9 to 15,698.9 in
turnover of TL1,200bn. However, most market commentators believe that
equities remain positive and forecast further gains in the short-term.

FT  07 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Australia driven to
six-year high by offshore-buying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BARGAIN hunting by overseas investors supported share prices, and the Nikkei
average was led higher by a rise in large-capital stocks, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei rose 178.32 to 20,500.25. Arbitrageurs bought shares as futures
firmed and margin traders, who sold stock in April, bought back stocks to
clear their positions.
The index saw a low of 20,312.93 in early trading, but gained ground as
foreign buying came in, and rose to an afternoon high of 20,529.55. Volume
totalled 332m shares against 229m, helped by rumours of good economic
figures coming next week.
Advances led declines by 700 to 320 with 167 unchanged. The Topix index of
all first section stocks advanced 18.85, or 1.2 per cent to 1,653.78. In
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 4.34 to 1,284.99.
Traders said that investors switched from small capital, high growth stocks
to large capital issues on the main market. 'The pessimism has been
overdone. Not a lot of people want to sell at these levels,' said Mr Alan
Livsey, a strategist at Kleinwort Benson.
Large-capital issues such as steels and shipbuilders gained ground. Nippon
Steel, the most active issue of the day, rose Y19 to Y339, Kawasaki Steel
advanced Y17 to Y339 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gained Y23 to Y668.
Investors were also encouraged by reports of liquefied natural gas tanker
orders from Qatar.
Arbitrage buying linked to the Topix index supported financials. Industrial
Bank of Japan rose Y20 to Y3,240 and Sumitomo Bank by Y30 to Y2,260.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone firmed Y21,000 to Y889,000.
Utilities issues were higher on the higher yen, lower fuel costs and hopes
of higher profits. Tokyo Electric Power rose Y150 to Y3,520 and Tokyo Gas
Y20 to Y535. The latter expects its pre-tax profit for the first six months
to September to have tripled.
Video game makers and amusement equipment makers continued to decline
following Nintendo's downward earnings revision earlier in the week. Sega
Enterprises fell Y200 to Y10,500 and Namco lost Y40 to Y3,380.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 181.18 to 22,455.81 in volume of 16.2m
shares. Nintendo fell Y130 to Y8,530.
Roundup
SEVERAL Pacific Rim markets continued on their winning ways. Karachi is
closed until Sunday as general and provincial elections take place.
AUSTRALIA broke through chart resistance to close at a second consecutive
six-year high. The All Ordinaries index rose 20.3 or 1.0 per cent to 2,018.8
driven by offshore investors, especially from Asia.
The index is now less than 300 points below its all-time high of 2,306.2,
set on September 21, 1987.
HONG KONG continued its run, a further influx of foreign investment taking
the Hang Seng index up 172.09 or 2.19 per cent to 8,041.47, its fourth
consecutive peak.
A round of profit-taking pared half of a 130-point early gain by late
morning but renewed buying emerged after Mr Chris Patten, the governor,
began his annual policy speech during the afternoon.
Heavy demand from US and European funds gave the index its late surge,
carrying it above the 8,000 level. A number of strategists have increased
their weightings for the Hong Kong market in recent days.
BANGKOK surged 3.8 per cent to a three year high on continued strong demand
from foreign and local institutions which has seen the market climb 9.6 per
cent in the last five trading days. The SET index added 38.79 to 1,058.24 on
the back of Tuesday's 2 per cent gain, in high volume of Bt18.35bn.
NEW ZEALAND was encouraged by sharply lower government deficit predictions
announced late on Tuesday, and a broadly based wave of buying took the
NZSE-40 capital index 26.92 higher to 1,982.53.
TAIWAN saw late selling in some speculative shares cut earlier gains which
were sparked by hopes of a further credit easing in reaction to September's
low inflation rate.
j The weighted index closed 1.36 ahead at 3,814.62, off an intra-day high of
3,832. Turnover remained thin at TDollars 10.9bn against Tuesday's TDollars
10bn.
SINGAPORE closed higher in record volume of 661.95m shares, underpinned by
continuing buoyant interest in Malaysian speculative shares. The Straits
Times Industrial index rose 5.61 to 2,039.12.
KUALA LUMPUR saw heavy profit-taking drag share prices down from their day's
highs, and the composite index closed 7.79 higher at 865.77.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Pound lifts against D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING stood out in a virtually lifeless foreign exchange market with a
respectable performance against a range of currencies including the D-Mark
and dollar yesterday writes Peter John.
Investor buying from South East Asia and Europe pushed the pound up by one
and a half pfennigs against the German currency which suffered from the
impact of very disappointing industrial order statistics, and a cent against
the dollar.
It followed the dollar higher in early trade and closed at DM2.4775, up from
DM2.4625 previously and at Dollars 1.5260, up from Dollars 1.5170.
The rise coincided with a general lift in UK financial markets: the FT-SE
100 index scraped to an all-time closing high and long-dated government
bonds were up by around three-quarters of a percentage point.
However, most dealers and economists, were at a loss to provide any concrete
reason for the burst of enthusiasm and tended to focus on the Tory Party
conference. There was no good news to latch on to but the party was at least
making a pretence at cohesion.
Also, the background of low growth with low inflation and the consequent
expectation of a cut in base rates remains. However, an interest rate cut
has been so fully discounted that the market is focusing on the fundamental
economic advantages of the UK over the rest of Europe.
Elsewhere, most markets were on hold ahead of key employment data from the
US on Friday. Economists are looking for a rise of between 150,000 and
200,000 in the non-farm payroll figure for September. That figure is seen as
a crucial pointer to a US recovery that has appeared to be running out of
steam recently. If it is lower than predicted there could easily be a slide
in the dollar which held its own yesterday.
The currency was supported by US investment funds who decided that it had
hit the bottom of its range but it came under pressure from cross-currency
options expiries. It closed relatively flat against the Japanese Yen at
105.60 and the D-Mark at DM1.6230.
The volatility on currency options - one of the principal elements
determining their price - has fallen dramatically in some cases and was
blamed for the low level of activity in the underlying market.
The Portuguese escudo was quoted at Es102.958 against the D-Mark as the Bank
of Portugal intervened to support the currency. Dealers said the central
bank intervention was aimed at bringing the rate back past the psychological
level of Es103.
The Belgian franc weakened to BFr21.67 to the D-Mark against BFr21.60 on
light selling by external investors.
The Canadian dollar was marginally firmer at CDollars 1.3370 against its US
counterpart ahead of elections on October 25. Kidder Peabody argues that the
currency is undervalued and should approach CDollars 1.20 over the next 12
months.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Money Markets: German repo tight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY was the focus of European money market operations yesterday. The
Bundesbank kept its interbank lending on a tight leash and reinforced the
widespread belief that it will not cut key interest rates at today's council
meeting, writes Peter John.
The main elements of the German repo that exercise the minds of economists
are whether the 14-day rate is fixed or variable, what level it is set at
and how much is allocated. All three factors disappointed rate cut
apologists yesterday.
The central bank allocated DM66.3bn at a fixed rate of 6.7 per cent over two
weeks and DM14.8bn and at a variable rate no lower than 6.71 per cent over
35 days. The 6.7 per cent level has remained the same for the past five
weekly repos and and economists estimated that the Bundesbank drained around
DM1.7bn from the system while the banks were looking for an injection of
some DM5bn to relieve the tight monetary conditions of recent days. The
unwillingness to meet bank demands ensured that call money remained between
6.8 per cent and 6.95 per cent.
In spite of conciliatory comments on interest rates from Mr Hans Tietmeyer,
the new head of the Bundesbank, most analysts remained convinced that an
imminent reduction in the discount rate, which sets the floor for German
lending, was unlikely.
In the UK, short sterling barely moved with the contract for December
closing unchanged at 94.34 on turnover of just over 10,000 lots, a volume
described by one dealer as 'pitiful'. However, the spread between the
December and March contract has widened to 20 basis points underlining the
enduring faith in lower interest rates.
Bank of England operations proceeded effortlessly in spite of a much larger
than average liquidity shortage. The forecast shortage of Pounds 1.85bn was
principally absorbed when the central bank bought Pounds 1.7bn of bills from
the market at a rate of 5 29/32 per cent bills repayable in equal amounts on
October 25, 26 and 27.
The Bank also announced a one-week special roll-over rate at 5 5/8 per cent
and set a roll-over rate of 5 7/8 per cent for the duration which is being
extended to November 3 from October 6. The facility was introduced last
September to reduce pressure in the money market after sterling's exit from
the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.

<TEXT>
WORLD COAL trade is expected to fall this year in both volume and value
terms and a return to the high growth rates of the past looks improbable,
according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.
In its annual report on the coal situation, the ECE predicts a 0.5 per cent
decline in world imports to about 409m tonnes this year, compared with a
rise of 1 per cent rise last year and 6 per cent annual growth in the late
1980s.
Further growth in international coal trade will depend on demand for steam
coal, the ECE suggests. The coking coal market is in long-term decline
because of changing steel-making technologies.
World coal production increased slightly last year, though total consumption
fell. The ECE expects global coal demand to remain fairly flat over the next
five to ten years at about 4.5bn tonnes but then to pick up as oil and gas
become scarcer. Output fell sharply in 1992 in central and eastern Europe,
notably in Ukraine. The decline is forecast to continue until industrial
output in the region stabilises. However, Russia hopes to boost output by 10
per cent a year for the rest of this decade.
Coal still provides 44 per cent of the world's electricity, the ECE points
out. Though the steady tightening of environmental regulations and control
of carbon dioxide emissions could induce some countries to switch to
alternative fuels, large amounts of coal will still be required for power
generation for the next two decades and beyond to meet rising electricity
demand.

OIL PRICES got a boost yesterday after talks in New York between the United
Nations and Iraq on the sale of up to Dollars 1.6bn worth of oil failed.
Brent Blend for November delivery was 13 cents higher in London at Dollars
17.24 a barrel.
Mr Vahan Zanoyan, a director at the Petroleum Finance Company in Washington,
said the Iraqi decision to call off the talks 'removed a bearish cloud' from
the markets and was likely to 'eliminate caution from the bulls'.
The prospect of Iraq's early re-entry into international oil markets has
been a factor behind recent low oil prices. It has also unsettled the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which last week said it would
call an emergency meeting if Iraq's talks with the UN were successful.
The Iraqi decision was conveyed during a meeting between Mr Mohamed
al-Sahaf, the foreign minister, and Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary
general.
Officials said the Iraqis were evidently not interested in the one-off sale
of Dollars 1.6bn worth of oil, the amount set in a Security Council
resolution two years ago and the subject of exhaustive negotiations. Their
aim now was the total lifting of sanctions in return for their compliance
with all the conditions set by the council in its ceasefire resolution.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tenancy deregulation proposal
angers UK farmers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S FARMERS' union yesterday angrily rejected long-awaited government
proposals to free the market in agricultural land by removing tight
restrictions that have discouraged landowners from letting.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, said that new legislation would
leave landlords and tenants free to make their own agreements without
government interference.
The measures were welcomed by the Country Landowners' Association but they
brought a dusty response from the National Farmers' Union.
The union said they would jeopardise the viability of future farm lettings
because they did not specify any formula for rent reviews.
'They totally ignore the desperate need to protect tenants from upwards only
rent demands,' said Mr David Naish, NFU president. 'Farmers will view these
proposals as an abdication of the government's responsibilities to their
industry.'
Under existing legislation, which is widely held to be in need of reform,
farm tenancies are for life and the government dictates how they should be
assigned and allows tenants to decide what crops they grow. Deregulation
would affect only future tenancies.
Mrs Shephard said the government wanted to redefine agricultural tenancies
to include a range of farm-based enterprises in an attempt to encourage
diversification and benefit the rural economy.
Only three safeguards would be attached to letting arrangements:
That tenants should be fully compensated for improvements they make to the
value of their holdings;
That either side should have access to simplified arbitration to settle
compensation disputes rather than having to resort to the courts;
And that landlords must give a minimum of a year's notice of the end of a
tenancy.
Mrs Shephard said formidable barriers faced anyone wanting to buy their way
into farming, with the cost of starting a basic dairy farm of 40 cows
amounting to Pounds 300,000 at current land prices.
'Yet the obvious alternative of renting land is not readily available,' she
said. 'As long as the government decides the detailed conditions on which
tenants may lease land it is inevitable that landowners will remain
reluctant to make it available.'
Mrs Shephard, who is acting on a Conservative party manifesto commitment
from the 1992 general election, was unable to promise legislation in next
year's busy parliamentary timetable. If the proposals are held over,
legislation would not come into force until 1995.
The Country Landowners' Association said: 'What is crucial now is that
parliamentary time is found as soon as possible.'

COMMODITY PRICES could stage a slight recovery next year from recent
depressed levels, but the upturn would be led by increasing demand and
supply constraints rather than fears about inflation, said Mr Ravi
Bulchandani, senior international economist at Goldman Sachs, the US
investment bank.
'There won't be a huge increase in prices, but at last there are more
positive signs in the markets,' said Mr Bulchandani speaking at Goldman's
commodity conference in London yesterday.
Goldman's production cost benchmark, which reflects the break-even cash cost
(operating cost, excluding amortisation of capital outlays) of producing
commodities, shows now that, overall, sales prices are 8 per cent below the
cost of production. This means that most commodity production is not
profitable at current prices.
The producers' loss is greatest in base metals such as aluminium and nickel,
and agriculturals such as cotton and sugar. Prices for aluminium are 19.9
per cent and for nickel 23.7 per cent below the average costs of producing
them. For cotton and sugar the gap is 29 per cent and 20.1 per cent
respectively.
Mr Bulchandani pointed out that prices as low as those experienced in recent
years would usually have caused large capacity cuts. That had not happened
in many commodities, particularly base metals where governments were often
involved in running plant.
But at the same time, low prices made it virtually impossible to get bank
finance for increasing capacity. For example, Goldman's production cost
benchmark puts the cost of producing aluminium at Dollars 1,400 a tonne
while current prices are around the Dollars 1,100-a-tonne level and it would
be difficult to get banks to invest at prices much below Dollars 1,600 a
tonne.
Increasing demand for many basic commodities especially from non-OECD
countries could underpin prices in coming months. At the same time, the
relative cheapness of the US dollar makes dollar-denominated commodities
more attractive in terms of other currencies: this could, in turn, result in
greater demand.
The situation in Russia will also have a big effect on commodity prices over
the next year. A return to economic stability over the long-term would be
beneficial for prices as consumption would increase along with production of
commodities such as oil.
However, Mr Bulchandani pointed out that the current chaotic situation in
Russia would depress prices as individual producers would be exporting all
they could to earn hard currency.
Mr Bulchandani stressed that he did not expect any explosive rally for many
of these commodities, but the current trends might prevent prices from
falling further in the short term and lead to some recovery in the longer
term.
Goldman's price forecasts for most commodities see prices remaining flat for
the next three months and showing some pick-up in six months to a year.

The Australian wool market has continued to move steadily dearer, and the
AWC market indicator, at 442 cents a kg. on October 6, is getting close to
the high point of the season, 459, when sales were resumed in July.
Clearances at auction are also good, over 90%. As always, strength in
primary markets is causing more buying interest in wool using markets,
though over-supply and recent erratic weakness in the Australian dollar make
price rises difficult to establish.

COCOA futures prices yesterday extended the retreat that began after
overhead resistance was encountered on Tuesday morning. The March futures
price at the London Commodity Exchange closed Pounds 21 down at Pounds 950 a
tonne and some traders were expecting a corrective move to develop,
following the recent sustained rise. 'We had been expecting a washout and it
came today,' said one trader. 'The market needs to correct itself but
opinions vary over how low it can go. Some people put the move back to
Pounds 830 to Pounds 840 a tonne. . . some say it could go further.' NICKEL
and TIN markets, the London Metal Exchanges weakest contracts of late,
maintained earlier advances in the afternoon, with both metals ending firmer
and around their highs after late kerb covering. Dealers said short-term
factors were responsible as both remained depressed by long-term
fundamentals, and the current upticks were generally seen as snap rallies in
a bear market. The COPPER market consolidated, with routine business seen
either side of the Dollars 1,700-a-tonne level for the three months
position, which ended Dollars 10 up at Dollars 1,699.50.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coal plan undermines German
villagers' hopes - The people of Horno may have the ground cut from under
them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BERND SIEGERT had little idea what he was taking on when he was elected
mayor of Horno in 1990. The village, located in the eastern German state of
Brandenburg, close to the Polish border, had hoped for a better life after
German unification. Its 380 inhabitants, mostly farmers, had worked in the
large collective farms under the former communists. When they were broken up
after 1990, these plain-speaking people bought shares that enabled them to
farm their own land.
But the people of Horno had hoped for something even more fundamental from
unification: the right to remain in their village. In the 1970s, the
communist authorities had decided that Horno, which is over 600 years old,
should be flattened to make way for the mining of brown coal. Understandly,
following the collapse of industry in eastern Germany after 1990, Mr Siegert
and his constituents expected more than a reprieve. They assumed there would
be no need to dig for coal under their village.
They were sadly mistaken. The management of Lausitzer Braunkohle, or Laubag,
the company that mines the giant brown coal fields straddling the eastern
states of Brandenburg and Saxony, appears determined to press ahead with
moving the villagers from Horno by the turn of the century.
'We have no intention of moving,' declares Mr Siegert, a tall, stocky,
42-year-old farmer. 'Of course we want the miners to have jobs, but there is
no need to dig for brown coal under Horno. We don't need more energy,' he
insists. 'Even if we did, why can't we have gas? It's cleaner and cheaper.
We will not move. Whatever happens, we will stay here. This is our home.'
In many ways, Horno's predicament exemplifies not only the difficulties of
implementing an energy policy for eastern Germany but also the government's
commitment to brown coal as a source of power and employment in the region.
In 1990, in a move aimed at saving the industry - and jobs - the government
drew up a energy policy for eastern Germany under which 100m tonnes of brown
coal would be mined annually and supplied to Veag, the region's main utility
company. Before 1990, lignite accounted for 62 per cent of eastern Germany's
primary energy consumption. Since then, electricity demand has fallen by 40
per cent.
The authorities now face uncertainty over whether there will be demand in
eastern Germany for this amount of lignite, particularly since there are few
signs of an emerging new manufacturing/industrial sector. If not, what will
happen to its plans to upgrade or build power generating blocks with an
annual capacity of 7,200MW, to be supplied by Laubag's brown coal? A further
complicating factor is the possibility that more cities, including Potsdam,
the capital of Brandenburg, might well opt for gas instead of brown coal.
None of these problems has escaped the attention of Laubag.
Laubag is owned by the Treuhand, the agency charged with privatising and
restructuring eastern German industry. The Treuhand is negotiating Laubag's
sale with a west German consortium led by Rheinbraun, a subsidiary of RWE,
the largest of the west German utilities. In the meantime, the agency is
preparing Laubag for privatisation. This entails identifying the most
profitable and efficient way of mining, which includes transporting brown
coal from the five pits that will remain open to feed the power generating
blocks that will be modernised or built by Veag. Veag, which also comes
within the Treuhand's ambit, is to be privatised as well.
Before 1990, Laubag was producing about 200m tonnes of coal a year and
employing over 54,000 people. Today, it produces about 89m tonnes and
employs 25,000 people. Mr Kurt Hage, a member of Laubag's board, expects
that figure to fall further to 14,000.
To reduce costs in Laubag and make it more attractive for privatisation
Laubag's management has decided to close several mines south of Horno,
although they have sufficient brown coal reserves of a quality as good, if
not better, as those under Horno, and there is a railway line linking them
to the power plants. Essentially, the Treuhand wants to centralise the
production and burning of brown coal as much as possible.
'It is about costs,' explains Mr Hage. He believes that by mining under
Horno and the surrounding region, which right next to the Janchwalde power
plant, transport costs will be reduced. Janchwalde, which has a capacity of
3,000MW, requires an annual supply of 24m tonnes of coal. Mr Hage calculates
that mining around Horno, rather than moving brown coal from mines 25km
away, will save Laubag between DM4 (Pounds 1.6) and DM7 a tonne in
transportation costs. That would makes it even more attractive for
prospective buyers.
But in order to mine under and around Horno, Laubag requires mining rights
for 40 years. The time scale is crucial because the Treuhand is insisting
that the Rheinbraun consortium should agree to sell an annual 57m tonnes of
lignite to Veag for 40 years.
'We have to have these long term coal contracts because it will secure the
economic viability of Laubag, and we have to lock the consortium into a
price structure for this coal,' explains Mr Helmut Ballon, head of the
Treuhand's mining department.
But it is not as simple as that.
Even if the consortium agrees to these contracts, the governments of
Brandenburg and Saxony have to be persuaded to grant long-term mining rights
to Laubag. So far they have granted 30 and 20 years respectively. 'The
mining rights pose social and political problems for these governments,'
says Mr Klaus Schucht, a board member of the Treuhand. 'Long term mining
rights means that people will have to be moved out of their villages,' he
adds.
To make up any possible shortfall between coal delivery contracts and mining
rights, the Treuhand is proposing that it pay compensation to the buyers of
Laubag, who in turn would have to compensate Veag for any failure to
deliver. A similar formula is being worked out for Mitteldeutsche
Braunkohle, or Mibrag, brown coal fields in Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony. They
are being bought by an Anglo-American consortium, led by Britain's PowerGen,
NRG of Minneapolis, and Morrison Knudson of Idaho, and they will supply coal
over 40 years to the 1,600MW power blocks Veag is building at Lippendorf
But over the next 40 years, the energy landscape in eastern Germany is
likely to change. The success of the government's commitment to brown coal
depends on the development of the region's manufacturing and industrial
base. But in addition gas, especially for domestic heating, is likely to
emerge as a powerful competitor to brown coal. This explains why the
Treuhand is desperate to privatise Laubag and Veag quickly, so as to speed
up investments in modernising Veag before gas becomes a player in the
market.
The Treuhand has the support of the miners at Laubag and Mibrag, who would
resist any attempts to cut production of brown coal. But for the people of
Horno, and Mr Siegert in particular, gas, or other alternative supplies of
energy would be a Godsend.
Rheinbraun and the Anglo-American consortium are holding their breath.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee price slide continues
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COFFEE PRICES dropped by up to Dollars 27 a tonne on the London Commodity
Exchange yesterday after a wave of selling in New York, where brokers
remained sceptical that the producers' new retention scheme would work.
The scheme aims to restrict producers' exports by 20 per cent until the
15-day average of the International Coffee Organisation's composite
indicator price rises above 75 cents a lb. Tuesday's ICO average was 70.62
cents, but that was set to fall with London's January robusta futures
position slipping to the equivalent of 52 cents a lb yesterday and New
York's March arabica position, which fell one and a half cents on Tuesday,
down another 0.35 to 74.15 cents in late trading.
In the run-up to the scheme being launched last Friday, London's December
delivery price, which closed yesterday at Dollars 1,140 a tonne, reached a
high of Dollars 1,325 a tonne.
'I can see the scheme working temporarily, but if prices go up, the lure of
higher prices could attract some increased selling from producers,' said Ms
Judy Ganes, analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York.
If prices fell too far, she added, producers would wonder why they were
spending so much on the scheme and might 'throw in the towel'.

THE GERMAN government bond market climbed to new highs again, spurred on by
heavy futures buying by traders, hedge funds and short-term accounts.
The market took cheer from a newspaper interview with Mr Hans Tietmeyer in
which the Bundesbank president said he could not rule out further cuts in
short-term interest rates, as money supply growth was slowing and inflation
was likely to ease.
With the Russian crisis abating, dealers said the market is focusing on
economic data, in particular the money supply and inflation figures which
are due out in the third week of October.
The Bundesbank yesterday raised the lowest accepted rate for its
variable-rate 35-day repo by one basis point to 6.71 per cent, but the
announcement failed to ruffle the bund market.
'It was a tight repo, but it's basically a sign the Bundesbank is pressing
the pause button,' said Ms Alison Cottrell, economist at Midland Global
Markets.
'The long end has had its run, but the short end of the European markets
haven't discounted the likelihood of rate cuts in Germany and France yet,'
she added.
The bund futures contract opened at 99.45 and reached a high of 99.79,
before slipping back to 99.62 by late afternoon.
FRENCH government bonds came off their highs, but closed up on the day. The
futures contract settled 14 basis points higher at 124.16, against a high of
124.28. One dealer pointed out: 'Both 10-year German and French government
bonds are yielding around 6 per cent and there is strong resistance at those
levels.'
UK government bonds took their cue from Germany, gaining about a quarter of
a point. 'The gilt market continues to look firm, taking the view that
interest rates are pointing downwards,' said Mr John Kendall, economist at
Baring Sterling Bonds.
The Liffe gilt futures contract traded in a range of 113.24 to 114.05, and
ended at 114.00, a gain of 0.09 on the day. Dealers noted some unofficial
supply of gilts by the Bank of England as the market reached the higher
levels.
RUMOURS of unexpected new supply dealt a blow to the Japanese government
bond market, pushing cash and futures prices sharply lower in the afternoon
trading session.
Dealers said rumours swept the market that the Ministry of Finance had
contacted a Japanese banks about the question of additional financing
through the bond market.
The December futures contract, which had traded in a range of 113.38 to
113.51 in the morning session, fell to a low of 113.02 after lunch on the
rumours, before closing at 113.07 in Tokyo.
According to Toyo Trust International, 'a scenario of tax cuts of about
Y7,000bn to be met with about Y5,000bn in deficit financing, with spending
cuts and a small rise in consumption tax looks likely. The market . . .
should be preparing to receive an extra Y300-Y400bn in bond issuance per
month'.
US Treasury prices were little changed in light trading yesterday as market
participants continued to trade cautiously before tomorrow's important jobs
data.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was unchanged at 103
11/32 , yielding 6.003 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was up  1/32 at 100 1/16 , to yield 3.825 per cent.
Prices edged higher at the opening, but failed to hold on to their gains,
and for the second consecutive day trading activity on the bond market was
restrained by an unwillingness among dealers and investors to commit funds
ahead of the September employment report, which is due to be published by
the Labor department tomorrow.
Analysts are expecting an increase in non-farm payrolls of about 150,000,
but concern that the data could include a surprising number, as happened
last month when the August figures were released showing an unexpected
decline in payrolls, kept many players on the sidelines.

FT  07 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Bright outlook for commercial
property loans securitisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN unwillingness among banks to lend directly to commercial property
developers following the property crash of the late 1980s has opened up a
potentially huge market in securitising commercial property loans.
Securitisation is a funding process which allows banks to take loans off
their balance sheet, thereby removing the risk of default and freeing up
capital.
This is achieved by the banks placing these assets in a special-purpose
vehicle which then raises money by selling debt securities to investors. The
interest payments on the these so-called 'mortgage-backed' or 'asset-backed'
securities are funded by repayments on the loans.
The securitisation of residential mortgages and consumer loans is already
widespread in the US and is starting to take off in the UK. Last week
National Westminster Bank launched its first issue of mortgage-backed notes
which raised Pounds 300m.
However, the securitisation of commercial property loans is still at an
early stage, says Mr Bob Wilson, global product manager at Nomura Securities
International, the US arm of the Japanese securities house.
In the US, the volume in securities backed by commercial property loans is
currently around Dollars 12bn. Most of these securities were issued by the
Resolution Trust Corp, the US federal agency charged with clearing up the
debts caused by the collapse of US savings and loan institutions in the late
1980s.
The RTC is expected to bow out of the market in the next year since it has
almost completed the job it set out to do.
Mr Wilson anticipates that Dollars 300bn worth of commercial property loans
will need to be refinanced over the next three years. 'There will be no new
money coming from the S&amp;Ls and only a little from the banks so the secondary
market will need to provide most the capital,' he said.
Nomura aims to be one of the leading players in the securitisation of
commercial property loans. It is committing Dollars 3bn of its own capital
to enable it to act as a principal in such transactions. It plans to use its
global network to distribute the securities.
The main attraction of securities backed by commercial property loans is
that they offer a much higher yield than corporate bonds with a similar
rating. Pension funds, banks and insurance companies looking to match
long-term liabilities are the main buyers of these assets.

FT  07 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Finland gains favourable pricing for
Pounds 500m offering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FINLAND achieved its best pricing for five years yesterday when it raised
Pounds 500m through an offering of seven-year Eurobonds. The all-in cost of
the funds, which were kept in sterling, was thought to be 16 basis points
over the London interbank offered rate (Libor).
Syndicate managers said that the radical improvement in the spread which
Finland paid over UK government bonds provided more proof that international
investors no longer harboured doubts about the sovereign borrower.
Finland's bonds were priced to yield 37 basis points over the 9 per cent UK
government bond due 2000, well below the spread of 60 basis points that
Finland had to pay in March for a deal of the same size but with a 10-year
maturity.
That offering was launched only days after Standard &amp; Poor's cut Finland's
credit rating by two notches to AA minus and at a time when Finland was
borrowing heavily in the international bond market.
Finland has been a less frequent borrower since the first quarter of this
year, opting instead to increase its issuance in its domestic bond market.
An improvement in Finland's current account position has also kept its net
borrowing requirement down.
Investors were also keen to buy the offering which they believed would be
Finland's last big issue this year. A senior finance ministry official said
yesterday that Finland was close to reaching its foreign borrowing target of
around Dollars 8bn.
The bonds rose to 99.70 in the late afternoon, up from its re-offer price of
99.65, and the spread tightened accordingly. Around 25 per cent of the bonds
were placed in Asia and the rest in Europe.
Depfa, Germany's largest mortgage bank, is expected to launch a Eurosterling
issue of around Pounds 500m in the near future, via Salomon Brothers and
UBS. Turkey is also likely to tap the Eurosterling sector with a 10-year
offering, via SG Warburg.
The World Bank gave details of its first D-Mark global bond offering, which
will be lead managed by Deutsche Bank and Salomon Brothers.
Mrs Jessica Einhorn, the World Bank's treasurer, said at a presentation in
Frankfurt that the fixed-rate issue was likely to raise about DM3bn and have
a maturity of five to 10 years. The World Bank expects to achieve a spread
within 10 basis points above the yield on underlying German government
bonds.
The D-Mark sector was active yesterday as the European Investment Bank
raised DM500m through an issue of five-year Eurobonds. The bonds were priced
at nine basis points over the yield on the Bobl series 107 of medium-term
German government bonds. The issue was seen to be tightly priced and the
bonds traded at 100.20 in the late afternoon, just outside fees.
Bank Austria, Austria's largest bank, got a better reception for its DM250m
offering of 10-year Eurobonds which were priced at a spread of 22 basis
points over underlying German government bonds. The bonds rose to 99.50 bid
from a re-offer price of 99.375.
The pricing of GECC's FFr1.5bn five-year offering was viewed as aggressive
which caused the bonds to fall to 98.75 bid from a re-offer price of 98.898
and the spread widened by two basis points to 22 basis points.

FT  07 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Hagemeyer raises Dollars 120m
in private US placement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAGEMEYER, the Dutch-based international trading house, has raised Dollars
120m through a private placement in the US market.
The funding, which is thought to be the first private placement by a Dutch
company in the US, will be used to help pay for the acquisition of Newey &amp;
Eyre, the Birmingham-based electrical distributor.
Several foreign companies, mainly from the UK, have flocked to the US
private placement market in recent months attracted by the ready
availability of long-term funding at relatively favourable rates.
US interest rates are at their lowest levels for 18 years.
Hagemeyer is issuing Dollars 120m of notes with maturities ranging from five
to 12 years, with an average life of eight years. Few UK banks are willing
to lend money to corporate borrowers at such long maturities.
The notes were priced to pay between 86 basis points and 95 basis points
over the corresponding US Treasury bonds, which gives an average borrowing
cost of 5.985 per cent.

FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: SEC tightens rule for brokers to
disclose order flow payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Securities and Exchange Commission voted yesterday in favour of new
rules that would require stock brokers to disclose to their customers the
payments they receive for diverting stock orders to market-making firms.
The practice of brokers steering business to marketmakers in return for
money or payment in kind, known as 'payment for order flow', has been the
subject of controversy for several years.
The big established US exchanges such as the New York and American stock
exchanges have vigorously attacked payment for order flow.
When brokers are paid by marketmakers to divert business their way, it is
usually at the expense of the big exchanges, whose members lose the
opportunity to execute the buy and sell orders for brokers and their
customers.
Marketmakers are willing to pay for this business because they can make
money every time they handle a stock order.
From now on, brokers will have to reveal on the confirmation slips they send
out to customers if they have been paid cash, or received a rebate, or a
reduced fee, to divert the order to a marketmaker.
Although payment for order flow remains legal, the SEC has left the door
open for a ban on the practice if enough brokers' customers complain about
the payments.
In two separate decisions, the SEC voted to reduce to three days from five
days the time investors and brokers have to settle their stock trades, and
to grant large, well-capitalised German companies exemption from certain SEC
trading rules.
The vote on shortening settlement time was expected.
The decision to grant big German companies exemption from the rules which
limit participation in securities distribution by companies selling debt or
equity in the US markets is designed to make it easier for foreign companies
to sell their securities in the US.
Daimler-Benz, the big industrial group which on Tuesday became the first
German company with a full listing on US equity markets, is an obvious
beneficiary of the exemption.
The SEC said the exemption was limited to German companies because the
agency addressed the issue because it was asked to by lawyers representing a
German company.
However, the agency said it would consider extending the exemption to other
foreign, and some US, companies.

<TEXT>
METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER, the Hollywood film studio owned by the French bank
Credit Lyonnais, yesterday announced the resignation of Mr Charles Meeker,
president.
Mr Meeker's departure is the latest in a string of executive changes as the
French bank tries to resuscitate the studio before selling it. In July, the
bank ousted Mr Alan Ladd Jr, who had run MGM for more than two years, and
brought in Mr Frank Mancuso, former chairman of Paramount Pictures, to take
his place.
Credit Lyonnais took control of MGM and United Artists, its companion
studio, in 1992 after foreclosing on loans it made to Mr Giancarlo Parretti,
an Italian entrepreneur who bought the company in 1990 for Dollars 1.3bn.
The bank is trying to make MGM more attractive to buyers before 1997, when
it must sell the studio.
In August, Mr John Calley, a Warner Brothers executive in the 1970s, was
named head of United Artists Pictures, a studio which had been inactive for
years.

takeover

CREDIT SUISSE said only 62 domestic branches would be closed following its
SFr1.6bn (USDollars 1.1bn) takeover of Swiss Volksbank in March,
significantly fewer than the 100 to 150 closures forecast at the time of the
takeover.
The benefits of the merger were proceeding more rapidly than expected, and
the bank expected a SFr65m operating profit gain from it this year, Mr Josef
Ackermann, chief executive.
'We are confident that we will achieve the planned SFr250m annual
improvement in operating results by the end of 1995. In the medium term, we
should do even better,' he said.
Mr Ackermann added that the bank's operating results in the third quarter
continued to be 'very good', but warned that provisions for bad loans would
remain high because of the recession in Switzerland.
The new branch plan means that the two banks together have the largest
network in Switzerland, with 332 outlets.
The group has chosen to cut 35 Credit Suisse branches, but only 27 Volksbank
branches, reflecting Volksbank's stronger presence in Swiss retail banking.
Volksbank would continue to be represented throughout the country, while
Credit Suisse would concentrate on the larger centres and tourist resorts
where its international reputation would be a competitive benefit.
The original forecast of 2,000 job losses arising from the merger still
held, but the bank hoped to avoid compulsory redundancies, Mr Victor Erne,
personnel director, said.
The more modest cuts appear to reflect the bank's sensitivity to public
resentment of its high profitability at a time of deep recession in
Switzerland.

FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: Corning issues earnings warning
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORNING, the US glass and high technology group, warned last night that its
third-quarter results were falling short of expectations and earnings before
special charges could be 10 per cent lower than last year's 53 cents a
share.
The company intended to expand upon its previously announced restructuring
charges to cover the cost of reducing assets and overhead expenses. The
charge would total some Dollars 130m.
The announcement came after the close of trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, where Corning shares ended the day unchanged at Dollars 33 5/8 .
Mr James Houghton, the chairman, also said: 'Earnings before unusual items
for the full year are currently not expected to reach last year's level of
Dollars 1.66 a share.
'The principal shortfall,' he added, 'has been in the consumer products
business and other cyclically sensitive businesses,especially in Europe.'
In addition, the group's MedPath health-care related business had seen a
slowdown in its rate of growth in recent months.
However, the group was enjoying a continuing strong performance in the
optical fibre business and improved operating earnings in information
display, science products and pharmaceutical services. Earnings from equity
interests were also expected to improve over last year.
He added that the group was aggressively responding by getting its cost
structure better aligned with current business conditions.
Corning expects to release its results on October 19.

ITT, the conglomerate which owns the Sheraton hotel chain, said yesterday
that it planned to build a Dollars 1bn, 5,000-room resort complex in the
Nevada gambling city of Las Vegas on land being bought from Mr Kerk
Kerkorian, the billionaire investor.
The resort, to be build in phases over a decade, would be on a 35-acre site
next to the Desert Inn.
Sheraton bought the site for around Dollars 160m from Mr Kerk-orian last
June.
ITT has been making a push into the booming US gambling industry. At the
time of the Desert Inn deal, Mr Rand Araskog, the group's chairman, said
that the group wanted to build a 'tremendous showplace' in Las Vegas to
rival the city's biggest and most profitable resorts.
Mr Araskog said that the company was undaunted by the fact that several
competitors are gearing up to open new theme resorts in the desert city.
The 5,000 rooms envisaged for the ITT resort would match the number at a
Dollars 1bn hotel-casino being built in Las Vegas by MGM Grand, which has
claimed that this will be the world's largest hotel.

FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: Goodyear sees third-term gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOODYEAR Tire &amp; Rubber, the last of the big US-owned tyre companies,
yesterday predicted a strong improvement in third-quarter net income to
between Dollars 130m and Dollars 135m, or 88 cents to 92 cents a share.
In the same period of 1992, Goodyear earned Dollars 91m, or 64 cents, after
the company's stock split. This year's third-quarter earnings will include a
Dollars 5m after-tax gain from the sale of Reneer Films.
Sales for the quarter are expected to be flat, excluding revenues from
divested assets. Last year, Goodyear had third-quarter sales of about
Dollars 3bn.
The Ohio-based company attributed the gain in earnings to better
productivity and the success of its premium lines of tyres. It has launched
a number of tyres since 1991, when Mr Stanley Gault took the helm.
Although sales were hurt by economic weakness in many countries, Goodyear's
moves to improve efficiency have contributed to better operating margins.
'We are especially pleased that the operating margins generated by our
business units for the period should reach our long-term objective of 10 per
cent,' Mr Gault said.
On Wall Street, shares in Goodyear gained Dollars 1 1/4 to a new 52-week
high of Dollars 46 5/8 at mid-session.

MR George Soros, the international financier, has made an investment in
Viatel, a small but fast-growing private telecommunications services company
which plans to come to market in London and New York next year.
Viatel, founded two years ago by Mr Martin Varsavsky, a New York-based
entrepreneur, sells software-based telecommunications services, mainly to
small and medium-sized businesses in Latin America and western Europe.
The company's revenue has grown to Dollars 7m last year from about Dollars
360,000 in 1991. It had sales for the first quarter of this year of Dollars
4.3m and projects sales of Dollars 25m for 1993.
The size of Mr Soros's stake in Viatel is undisclosed. About 80 per cent of
the company is owned by Mr Varsavsky. Mr Soros and one other private
investor, associated with the merchant bank Goldman Sachs, hold the
remaining 20 per cent between them.
Viatel is one of a growing number of small telecommunications service
companies exploiting the liberalising international telecommunications
regime to provide value-added services on the back of existing national
telecommunications networks.
The US and the UK are the company's main hubbing and software-development
centres. Its expansion plans centre on western Europe, which is expected to
account for 30 per cent of sales this year.
The investment is a further indication of Mr Soros's interest in the
telecommunications industry. He is a private investor in privatised Latin
American telecommunications companies and is believed to be keen to broaden
his telecommunication activities.

FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: Third-quarter results hit AMD
share price
</HEADLINE>

SHARES in US semiconductor manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices continued to
fall yesterday following the company's announcement the previous day of
third-quarter results that failed to live up to analysts' expectations.
At mid-session, AMD's share price had slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 21 1/4
. Other semiconductor companies, such as Intel Motorola, 8 and Texas
Instruments, which had followed AMD lower on Tuesday, were slightly higher
in early trading yesterday.
AMD's third-quarter net income rose 25 per cent to Dollars 61.3m before
preferred stock dividends, or 61 cents a share after dividend payments. In
the same period last year net income was Dollars 49.1m, or 51 cents on the
same basis. Revenues rose 17 per cent for the quarter, to Dollars 418.4m
from Dollars 356.7m.
Analysts had forecast third-quarter income of about 66 cents a share,
following second-quarter net earnings of 65 cents a share. AMD's share price
drop reflected 'downbeat' comments by company executives, analysts said.
However, Mr W. J. Sanders III, AMD chairman and chief executive, said the
company had had 'another outstanding quarter', noting that operating income
rose more than 50 per cent compared with the same period last year. 'We are
on track to achieve a third consecutive year of record sales and earnings,'
said Mr Sanders.
Revenues were boosted by sales of AMD's latest 'clone' of the Intel
microprocessors used in personal computers. Sales of 486 microprocessors
more than offset declining sales of the 386 microprocessor and seasonally
slow sales of most other product lines, AMD said. AMD is involved in legal
battles with Intel over intellectual property rights that have shadowed its
success in the microprocessor market.

FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: Mercurial times for HK telecoms
 -Simon Holberton assesses the aims of a poacher turned gamekeeper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Howell-Davies describes himself as a 'catalyst'. In management-speak
he would be called a 'change agent'. He is both of these but he is also a
poacher turned gamekeeper.
Mr Howell-Davies, the former deputy chief executive of Mercury
Communications, the telecoms company owned by Cable &amp; Wireless that is
challenging British Telecom's UK monopoly, is now in Hong Kong charged with
protecting Hongkong Telecom's monopoly from competition.
By mid-1995 a second, and possibly a third, telecoms company will have been
licensed to compete with Hongkong Telecom - which is controlled by Cable &amp;
Wireless - in the Hong Kong domestic market.
Mr Howell-Davies, deputy chief executive of Hongkong Telecom since February,
does not dispute the poacher turned gamekeeper tag: 'I've been through - and
have scars to prove it - starting up, growing a business, and competing with
a large and well-established business. I should therefore have some idea
what the second network may try and do or want to do.'
This week he has been explaining to senior management his plan to meet the
challenge posed by the onset of this competition. Mr Howell-Davies plans to
do in two years what took established telecoms companies elsewhere five or
10 years: that is, radically altering how Hongkong Telecom deals with its
customers.
The company's structure, which was split along functional and product lines,
is being changed so that all aspects of the business which 'touch' customers
will be centralised in an enlarged sales and marketing division. That
reformed division will itself be segmented into three business units
reflecting different customer needs.
When Mr Howell-Davies came to Hong Kong, he found an organisation used to
the ways of a monopoly.
'Hongkong Telecom has operated in an exclusive franchise environment. It has
been relatively inward looking and it was not very nimble. It has been a
technology-driven company, like many of the large PTTs, and has been very
successful at that.
'But it was recognised that the company needed to go through a change, like
any monopoly needs to, if it's going to be able to operate in a competitive
environment. It does need to become much more market-driven and much more
customer-focused and have the ability to bring on new services much quicker
than it has been done in the past. You need a catalyst in order to make
changes.'
The problem with Hongkong Telecom's previous structure, Mr Howell-Davies
says, was that no one was accountable for what he calls the 'end-to-end'
provision of a service. No one, that is, until the problem got shunted to
his office. 'That was manifestly wrong in an organisation of this size and
complexity,' he says.
To deal with this, the reorganisation seeks to 'recast the process of
responsibility'. This, he hopes, will mean that problems are looked at from
the customer's perspective and not from a particular product or functional
point of view.
When the reorganisation is complete, Mr Howell-Davies believes the company
will be able to provide a one-stop service. 'Sitting behind the account
manager will be the people who are developing products for the customer and
the people who will support the selling, installation and maintenance of the
service.'
The sales and marketing division - now 1,200 strong - will grow by 2,000.
The enlarged workforce will service three 'marketing business units' (MBUs):
MBU1 will deal with the 1,000 largest customers; MBU2 with the 200,000 to
250,000 small and medium-sized company sector; and MBU3 with residential
customers.
'Not all customers want the same service from Hongkong Telecom,' he says.
'Mrs Wong in the New Territories wants one type of telephony service from us
and the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank want a very different portfolio of
services. So we need to position, to structure ourselves to meet both their
differing and legitimate requirements.'
It is clear that Mr Howell-Davies expects competition from new entrants to
be in niche areas, not an attempt to provide a ubiquitous service.
The segment of Hongkong Telecom's business most under threat will be the big
business customers, those who Mercury set its sights on in the UK when it
started up.
Competitors are circling. Although its monopoly in international telephony
is secure until 2006, American Telephone and Telegraph has tied up with
Hutchison Whampoa to provide value-added international services, such as
E-mail; British Telecom is setting up a 'node' for its Syncordia network;
and it faces competition from Singapore Telecom for the hubbing of
multi-national companies' international communications.
It faces competition in mobile communications, paging and value-added
services. Since the summer, mobile operators have been able to interconnect
with Hongkong Telecom's international service, sharing a percentage of the
revenue accruing to outgoing calls and receiving a flat rate for incoming
calls.
The change in corporate structure which Mr Howell-Davies told staff about
this week is seen as the most important management reorganisation the
company will conduct in advance of competition.

FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: Wallace Smith Canadian units put
into receivership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE liquidator of Wallace Smith Trust group, the UK-based banking and
finance group formerly controlled by Mr Wallace Duncan Smith, has put two
Canadian companies with links to the group into receivership.
The move against the Canadian units is part of a multi-pronged effort by
creditors to recover as much as they can of the estimated Pounds 100m
(Dollars 149.3m) deficiency in assets which was discovered in the group when
it collapsed in early 1991.
Mr Smith, who is a Canadian citizen, has been charged with fraud by the
Serious Fraud Office in the UK.
His trial is expected to start at the Old Bailey in London on November 15.
He is on bail of Pounds 250,000.
The appointment of the receiver in Canada, like much of the winding-up
process in the UK, has been marked by a flurry of legal claims.
The liquidator, KPMG Peat Marwick, is claiming substantial damages from
Royal Bank of Scotland and National Westminster Bank, as well as from
Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the Wallace Smith group's auditor. The main creditors
include Credit Lyonnais, Tokio Reinsurance of Japan, DG Bank and Banca
Commerciale Italiana.
In separate actions, the Toronto-based companies in receivership, Wallace
Smith Group and Wallace Smith &amp; Co, have filed two suits against KPMG for a
total of Pounds 3.3m.
One of the claims alleges that the liquidator has unfairly interrupted the
business of the Canadian companies.
These companies continued to operate for several months as brokers in North
American money market instruments after the collapse of Wallace Smith Trust
in the UK. Another Toronto-based company, Wallace Smith Securities, was
placed in receivership last October.
The Canadian companies put into receivership are in a relatively sound
financial position, with net assets estimated at CDollars 4m (USDollars
3.1m).
However, Mr Philip Wallace, a partner at KPMG, said yesterday that 'our
concern is to avoid wasteful spending of money on proceedings which we don't
think would help anybody'.
Mr Wallace said that the purpose of appointing the receiver, who is an
independent accountant, was to ensure that 'all the litigation gets sorted
out in as cost-effective a way as possible'.
The creditors of the two Canadian companies are mostly other companies in
the Wallace Smith group, as well as employees and professional advisers.
The group set up by Mr Smith and his family is an intricate web of companies
which included three UK-based trusts.
Below each of the trusts were several layers of operating and non-operating
companies.
The precise relationship between the UK and Canadian branches is among the
points of dispute between KPMG and the management of the Canadian companies.
Mr Nick Press, an American consultant who has acted as chief executive of
the Canadian group, said that the trading links between the two were minimal
and dividend flows non-existent.

OERLIKON Buhrle, the Swiss armaments, engineering and retailing
conglomerate, said its acquisition of most of Leybold from the German
chemicals group Degussa would strengthen its substantial position in vacuum
technology related sectors.
Terms of the purchase were not disclosed.
Oerlikon's Balzers subsidiary, based in Liechtenstein, is a leading supplier
of vacuum chambers and thin film coatings for various products from cutting
tools to compact discs and the latest flat panel liquid crystal display
screens.
Leybold has been Balzers' main competitor in most of these fields. Together,
they should account for about 16 per cent of world markets, with much higher
shares in particular specialities. Oerlikon said it would maintain the
Leybold brand name because of its strength in the market.
The Leybold businesses being acquired have annual sales of about DM800m
(Dollars 471m) but have been in loss. Balzers had sales of SFr468m (Dollars
312m) last year and recovered from a 1991 loss to make a SFr50m operating
profit.

six months

<TEXT>
FLUGHAFEN WIEN, the partially privatised operator of Vienna's international
airport, said its net income in the first half rose 5 per cent to Sch251m on
revenues of Sch1.46bn (Dollars 121m), up 6.4 per cent.
The airport said that slow growth in aircraft maximum take-off weights
restrained revenue growth in the first half. Passenger volume rose only 5.2
per cent and freight tonnage gained only 4.2 per cent.
Meanwhile, operating costs jumped 20.5 per cent, mainly because of an
overhaul of a runway. Operating profit thus tumbled 40 per cent to
Sch187.4m.
Thanks to a successful net financial result, pre-tax profits rose 29.9 per
cent to Sch263.5m.
The directors cautioned that prospects could be affected by whatever
alliance decision Austrian Airlines made. The airline, which accounts for
44.3 per cent of passenger flows at the airport, is considering co-operation
plans offered by Lufthansa of Germany and by the Alcazar project with three
other European airlines.

COCA-COLA Amatil, the stock market listed Australian snacks and beverage
group in which Atlanta-based Coca-Cola holds a majority stake, plans to
acquire control of an Indonesian bottling company, P. T. Djaya Beverage
Bottling. It is paying about USDollars 46m.
DBBC is the Coca-Cola franchise bottler for Jakarta and adjacent parts of
the Jakarta metropolitan area, one of the most heavily populated and
prosperous centres in the region, and has about 30 per cent of Coca-Cola
system sales in Indonesia.
CCA already owns 49 per cent interests in two other Indonesian joint venture
bottling companies - Pan Java and Tirtalina - with about half the system
sales.
CCA will acquire DBBC in exchange for shares. The majority shareholder in
DBBC is Indonesian Bottlers (IBL), which will receive 5.88m shares in CCA.
The two minority shareholders are Coca-Cola Holdings (Asia), which has a 29
per cent interest and Mikuni Coca-Cola Bottling Company with about 20 per
cent.
At current stock market prices for CCA and ruling exchange rates, they are
expected to receive about 1.6m shares and 1.1m shares respectively.
The deal is subject to various regulatory approvals. Assuming it is
completed as planned, the interest held by Coca-Cola in the US in Coca-Cola
Amatil will be slightly diluted, but will remain above the 50 per cent
level.
CCA shares rose slightly yesterday, to ADollars 8.60.
Amcor, the paper and packaging group, expects that the ADollars 415m
(USDollars 276m) acquisition of Associated Pulp and Paper Mills, the pulp
and paper arm of North Broken Hill Peko, will improve both its overall
profits and its earnings per share.
Amcor said the purchase should be completed at the end of this month.

POSTIPANKKI, the Finnish state-owned bank, yesterday announced a sharp
reduction in losses for the first eight months, confirming evidence that the
Finnish banking sector is past the worst of its difficulties.
The bank's operating loss amounted to FM66m (Dollars 11.6m), compared with
FM599m in the corresponding 1992 period.
It was helped by falling interest rates, which cut the carrying costs of
non-performing loans and lifted the profits of money market activities.

chief

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media mogul, has carried out a management
reshuffle in his family-controlled Fininvest group.
He has brought in Mr Franco Tato, from the Mondadori publishing subsidiary,
to take on the new job of group managing director.
Mr Tato, aged 61, has a reputation as a tough manager with broad experience
having worked for long spells at Olivetti as well as in Germany's Triumph
Adler.
This is the first time Mr Berlusconi has sought to bring in a manager with
wide overall responsibilities in an organisation which has reflected Mr
Berlusconi's personality.
The move has been prompted by plans to raise about L550bn (Dollars 348m)
through the flotation of a minority stake in Mr Berlusconi's publishing
interests. These are being regrouped in Silvio Berlusconi Editore
(Sbe)-Mondadori via a reverse takeover of Mondadori.
The Sbe flotation will take place within a matter of weeks, Fininvest said.
Mr Berlusconi's bankers have been pressing for firmer executive control as
the group's debt rises and interest charges eat into profits.
The group's published borrowings at the end of last year stood at L3,333bn
while profits totalled L21bn.
Rising debts come at a time of flat television advertising revenues while
the structure of Italy's commercial television networks, dominated by
Fininvest, is under discussion.
First-half results for 1993 show a turnover up 14 per cent to L6,268bn with
an end-year figure likely to be in the range of L12,000bn. But this, in
part, reflects acquisitions and consolidations to the balance sheet.
The cost of debt service at about L550bn is hampering any increase in
profits.
Candy, the white goods producer, is to take over the domestic refrigerator
and freezer division of Iberna, a small specialist producer based near
Milan.
The deal is expected to add half a percentage point to Candy's 6 per cent
share of the European white goods market. Although Iberna only produces
about 250,000 domestic freezers/refrigerators, it has an important
specialist market niche.
Candy, controlled by the Fumagalli family, will be able to use its
distribution network and exploit its brand name.
Iberna, controlled by the Valesei family, is understood to have had a 1992
turnover of L200bn. It will retain its industrial refrigerator division.

FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: Swedes split over 'foreign
invasion' - Surge in inward investment has sparked debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RESURGENT argument in Sweden this week over the merger of Volvo's car
and truck operations with Renault of France has highlighted a wider debate
about a growing trend of foreign influence in Swedish industry.
Volvo's plan to hand over its automotive business to Renault, in exchange
for a 35 per cent share of the merged company, has excited most comment
because of Volvo's position as the traditional champion of Sweden's
impressive industrial base. But anxiety over the fate of Volvo has been
fuelled by a perception that it presages a flow of control of industry out
of a country weakened by three years of recession.
The bid by Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), which like Volvo has suffered
heavy losses recently, to combine forces under the Alcazar project with
three other European airlines is a prominent example. Although only
one-third Swedish owned, SAS is headquartered in Stockholm and, until last
week, was led by a Swede, Mr Jan Carlzon. He has already stepped down at SAS
and if Alcazar goes ahead, Stockholm will become no more than a branch
feeder to the new alliance's main hubs elsewhere.
Less obvious, but no less significant, has been a dramatic surge in foreign
investment in Swedish companies in the last year through the Stockholm stock
exchange. The relaxation of restrictions on foreign buyers of Swedish shares
 -the last of which were scrapped at the beginning of this year - and the
sharp devaluation of the Swedish krona have combined to produce
unprecedented levels of overseas investment.
In the first eight months of this year, foreigners accounted for 28 per cent
of the SKr186bn (Dollars 23bn) turnover on the stock exchange, pushing up
the foreign share of the market's total capitalisation to some 24 per cent.
In 1991, the level was just 10 per cent.
The impact on many of Sweden's blue-chip companies has been striking.
Foreigners hold 44 per cent of the capital in Ericsson, the
telecommunications company, compared with 27 per cent at the end of last
year.
In Astra, the pharmaceuticals giant, the level is now 38 per cent; in SKF,
the ball-bearing maker, it is 34 per cent; and in Electrolux, the white
goods manufacturer, 26 per cent. In Scandinaviska Enskilda Banken, foreign
holdings have jumped from 3 per cent to 15 per cent this year.
Inevitably, perhaps, this trend has produced an emotional response among
many Swedes, which culminated in a revealing outburst last week at a private
gathering by Mr Leif Ostling, president of the truck maker Scania. He called
the Volvo-Renault deal a tragedy, condemned Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the Volvo
chief, as 'Sweden's biggest destroyer of industry' and said Swedes were
'spineless' for not speaking out.
But while many acknowledge a similar gut reaction, the considered analysis
of the government, trade unions, business organisations and shareholders is
very different.
The centre-right government of Prime Minister Carl Bildt, the Social
Democratic opposition and the labour unions continue to support the
Volvo-Renault merger. Nor did it escape notice at Volvo that Saab, the
carmaking sister company of Scania, has only survived because of a 50 per
cent share taken by General Motors of the US, which now runs the company
under a British chief executive.
Aktiespararna, the small shareholders' association which opposes the
Volvo-Renault deal, is doing so because of its doubts about the valuation of
Volvo assets in the merger and worries about the privatisation of Renault,
not the principle of Volvo becoming a junior partner to the French company.
'In principle we are for an international society - an open society with no
borders where you can move your capital as you want,' says Mr Lars-Erik
Forsgardh, president of Aktiespararna.
Mr Bjorn Karlin, head of an organisation that promotes shareholding, points
out that Sweden has until recently had relatively low levels of foreign
investment for a country with such a large number of international
companies.
With local capital investment at a low ebb because of the recession, and
with a need for Sweden, which is applying to join the European Community, to
integrate more closely into the European economy, Mr Karlin says foreign
ownership is widely supported.
'You will not find any real opposition in political and business circles.
Our companies have an urgent need for risk capital and the money is not
available in this country,' he says.
Moreover, Swedish companies have themselves been eager acquirers of foreign
companies in recent years - notably in the forestry sector.
Previous mergers, like the combination of Asea with Switzerland's Brown
Boveri and the merger of Avesta with the stainless steel division of British
Steel to form Avesta Sheffield, have led to strengthened groups in which
Swedish interests have remained prominent.
Of course, as in the case of Volvo, there are worries that jobs will leak
abroad when Swedish companies come under foreign influence or control.
But Mr Per-Olof Edin, chief economist at LO, the blue-collar trade union
federation, takes a sober view of this, explaining that the LO accepts that
companies must act in their own interests, not those of the country.
'Yes we are all sad about Volvo. But if you are rational you have to accept
the necessity of the merger. We in Sweden have been too dependent on Volvo
and Saab. In the long run employment will fall in these sectors. It has a
better chance to be managed smoothly this way. Our members are better off in
this new situation.'

FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: Volvo defends merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLVO yesterday insisted that its merger agreement with Renault was the best
deal available for its shareholders, Hugh Carnegy writes. Rejecting a call
from Aktiespararna, the Swedish small shareholders' association, for the
deal to be blocked at a shareholders' meeting on November 9, Volvo said that
the merger agreed last month had won widespread support.
'The board of Volvo, the board of Renault, the French government, the
government of Sweden, all the trade unions in Sweden and all the leading
politicians have said that this is a good deal and that it is important that
it takes place,' a spokesman said.
Aktiespararna, which represents about 10 per cent of Volvo's shareholders,
faces an uphill battle to block the merger. With Renault holding more than 8
per cent of the Volvo parent and at least a further 15 per cent held by
investment companies and institutions seen as being close to the company, it
admits that many of the larger shareholders see no alternative to the
merger. However, the association has taken heart from its successful
campaign in 1977 to win support for its objections to a proposal to sell a
40 per cent share in Volvo to Norway in exchange for oil concessions.
Volvo said the commitment of the French government to privatise Renault
after the merger was not in doubt. The company admitted, however, that a
detailed prospectus for shareholders, which Volvo will publish later this
month, would not set a value 'on each and every part of the company'.
However, a spokesman said the 35 per cent of the merged company to be held
by Volvo would yield 'much better' returns than the truck and car operations
would on their current basis.
Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo chairman, last night played down the risk of
opposition from small shareholders to the proposed merger, Kevin Done adds.
'I have not seen much shareholder opposition so far,' he said. 'I have had
very little negative comment. I trust that the majority of shareholders will
see the case as the board does.'
The deal was also the best protection against the erosion of Sweden's
industrial base, Mr Gyllenhammar said.

FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: France closes sale of BNP shares
to institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government last night closed the sale of shares to institutional
investors in Banque Nationale de Paris, the first company to be sold in its
privatisation drive, because the tranche was already more than 12 times
subscribed.
The economy ministry said that the 'strength and speed' of the institutions'
response to the issue had forced it to bring that part of BNP's
privatisation to an early close.
The original deadline for institutional subscriptions was October 12, the
same as for the public offer.
The ministry has no plans to close the public part of the BNP sale, which
values the bank, headed by Mr Michel Pebereau, at FFr43bn (Dollars 7.6bn) by
selling its shares at FFr240 each.
The ministry declined to comment on the level of subscriptions received so
far from individual investors.
However, banking sources suggest that public demand for shares in BNP has
also been high.
French and foreign institutions subscribed for around FFr100bn of BNP shares
in the first two days of the offer, against the FFr8.3bn of equity that had
been allocated to them.
Under the original offer terms the government reserved 12.12m shares, or 17
per cent of the total issue, for French institutions and 22.5m shares, or 31
per cent, for foreign institutions.
However, the number of shares available to institutions could be reduced by
up to 9.5m if demand from individual investors is so strong that the
government decides to trigger its clawback facility.
The success of the BNP share sale is critical to the prospects for the rest
of the centre-right French government's privatisation programme.
This could include the sale of up to 21 companies, including the
Rhone-Poulenc chemicals company and Elf-Aquitaine oil group.
Analysts have interpreted the keen pricing of BNP's shares as a tactical
ploy to ensure that the issue was a success.
The eventual share price of FFr240 was significantly lower than the stock
market's initial estimates of between FFr250 and FFr275.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOCIETE Generale, one of France's largest banks, yesterday lightened the
gloom over the French banking sector by announcing a 9.2 per cent increase
in net profits to FFr2.16bn (Dollars 380.6m) in the first half of 1993, from
FFr1.98bn in the same period of last year.
Mr Marc Vienot, chairman, said the group should also produce 'good results'
for the full financial year. 'It's hard to imagine that 1993's result will
be less than that of 1992,' he added. Societe Generale produced net profits
of FFr3.55bn on net banking income of FFr36.45bn in 1992.
The French banking industry has been under pressure because of the sluggish
state of the credit market and the impact of recession.
Several leading banks have recently announced disappointing first-half
results. Paribas, the investment banking group, last week reported static
interim profits, while Credit Lyonnais, the state-controlled bank, last
month reported a dramatic FFr1.05bn loss.
Societe Generale managed to overcome the pressures on industry due to strong
performances from its international interests and trading activities. Mr
Vienot said the bank had benefited from the development of its interest-rate
and foreign-exchange instruments.
Net banking income increased by 9.5 per cent to FFr20.22bn in the first six
months of 1993 from FFr18.46bn at the same stage in 1992. However, costs
rose 4.5 per cent to FFr13.53bn from FFr12.95bn due to increased investment.
Gross operating profits rose 21.3 per cent to FFr6.69bn from FFr5.52bn.
The bank made a loss of FFr106m on financial transactions, against a FFr789m
gain in the first half of last year when it received FFr525m from the sale
of shares in Perrier mineral water.
However, the group raised interim provisions by 3.2 per cent to FFr3.53bn
from FFr3.42bn, due mainly to writedowns on its exposure to LDC debt and to
sour commercial loans in France.

FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: Credit Mutuel chairman
optimistic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT Mutuel, the French bank, hopes to 'maintain or possibly increase' net
profits for 1993 compared with last year, in spite of the competitive state
of the banking market.
Mr Etienne Pflimlin, chairman, likened the current condition of the sector
to that of the 'first oil shock in autumn 1973'. However, he said his group
had managed to increase market share and hoped at least to maintain net
profits at the same level as 1992's FFr1.5bn (Dollars 264.3m).
Credit Mutuel, which is the fifth largest retail banking network in France,
has been affected by the sluggish demand for credit, according to the
chairman. The French credit market has been depressed by the impact of high
real interest rates, in spite of recent rate reductions.
Mr Pflimlin identified the farming sector as an area of potential market
share gains. He said his group should win share at the expense of Credit
Agricole, the co-operative farmers' bank, which he described as a
'dinosaur'.
Credit Mutuel also plans to extend its branch network. It intends this year
to set up new offices in Lyon, Bordeaux, Toulouse and Nancy.

FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: Victoire sees sharp fall for
year

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VICTOIRE, the French insurance company which is the subject of a quarrel
between the Suez holding company and Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP)
insurance group, yesterday warned of a sharp fall in full-year profits due
to the problems of Baltica, the Danish insurer.
The future of Victoire, which yesterday also reported a 41 per cent fall in
net profits to FFr275m (Dollars 48.5m) in the first half of this year from
FFr470m in the same period of 1992, was flung into doubt when Suez, its
majority shareholder, last week announced it had resumed negotiations with
UAP over its minority holding.
UAP, the largest French insurer, has for some time been anxious to exchange
its Victoire shares for control of Colonia, the latter's German subsidiary.
The resumption of talks between Suez and UAP has come at a sensitive time
for Victoire, which has for the second successive year been badly affected
by the difficulties of the loss-making Baltica, in which it holds a 23 per
cent stake.

FT  07 OCT 93 / International Company News: Hong Kong sale helps Time Prods
to Pounds 5.33m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DISPOSAL of its remaining property interests in Hong Kong for Pounds
1.48m helped Time Products, the watch and jewellery distribution group, lift
pre-tax profits for the six months to July 31 by 52 per cent, from Pounds
3.5m to Pounds 5.33m.
Operating profits were ahead from Pounds 2.2m to Pounds 3.34m, including a
Pounds 486,000 contribution from acquisitions. This mainly reflected the
purchase in March for Pounds 11.9m of the business of Judith Leiber, an
American designer of luxury handbags.
Mr Marcus Margulies, chairman, said that 80 per cent of profits came from
the luxury end of the group's markets, with 20 per cent from volume markets.
A couple of years ago the proportions would have been reversed.
While the group owns Sekonda, which accounts for about 12 per cent of UK
watch sales, it also sells watches worth hundreds of thousands of pounds
apiece. It holds agencies for exclusive brands such as Blancpain and
Vacheron Constantin, and last April acquired for Pounds 2m the agency to
distribute in North America watches by Audemars Piguet, the Swiss watchmaker
that specialises in highly technical and luxurious pieces.
Mr Margulies' strategy is to concentrate on luxury brand names. The group
has now opened a luxury watch shop at Judith Leiber's premises in New York.
'The concept of the company is changing very dramatically,' he said
yesterday. 'The US offers us a very exciting opportunity, and the start has
been better than we would have hoped.'
Group turnover rose from Pounds 26.2m to Pounds 29.9m. The latest figure
included Pounds 4.63m from acquisitions and Pounds 197,000 from discontinued
operations. Turnover last time included Pounds 5.95m from discontinued
operations.
Mr Margulies said turnover in the luxury watch division was moving
increasingly into the first half of the year, partly because of demand after
the Basle Fair in April. The volume business showed some improvement, but
trading conditions remained difficult.
Net interest receivable fell from Pounds 1.09m to Pounds 513,000, reflecting
a reduction in net cash because of acquisitions and lower rates.
Earnings per share were 6.67p (4.57p), and the interim dividend is 3p
(2.75p).

FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Parkdean Leisure will raise Pounds 7.6m via
flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARKDEAN LEISURE, the holiday park operator, yesterday finalised its
flotation, pricing its shares at 120p and arranging an institutional placing
which will raise Pounds 7.63m net for the company. The price values the
whole company at Pounds 12m.
Mr Graham Wilson, chief executive, said the flotation would leave the group
virtually ungeared at its financial year end in November. It would then be
able to expand, partly through buying two or three new parks a year.
He said the average cost of a park was between Pounds 500,000 and Pounds 1m
and Parkdean would also spend on new facilities such as indoor swimming
pools. Gearing could rise to about 35 per cent by the end of the 1994
financial year.
Mr Wilson said the group might return to shareholders for more equity when
the success of the acquisition programme had been demonstrated.
Past acquisitions had shown Parkdean could raise profits substantially
through adding to facilities, improving marketing and applying economies of
scale, he said.
The group, which currently owns seven parks, forecast operating profits for
the year to end-November of not less than Pounds 1.4m, up from Pounds 1.3m
in 1992.
On a pro-forma basis, as if the flotation proceeds had been available
throughout the year, earnings per share would be 8.7p, giving a p/e of 13.8
at the placing price.
Parkdean said if it had been quoted for the whole year it would have paid a
total dividend of 4.35p, covered twice by earnings. That gives a notional
yield on the placing price of 4.53 per cent. It said it planned to pay a
final dividend of 1.3p next April.
The company is issuing 6.85m new shares and some shareholders, including
certain directors, are also selling a total of 645,833 shares. There will be
a total of 9.99m shares in issue after completion.
After the issue, Mr Wilson, who led the management buy-out of the company in
1989, will hold 3.85 per cent of the equity, with directors and management
holding a total of 8 per cent.
The venture capital groups which backed the MBO and put up further equity
finance in 1991, are selling some shares but retaining stakes in the group.
About 30 institutions agreed to buy shares in the placing.
Proceeds will be used to repay Pounds 2.33m of preference shares, which Mr
Wilson said were costing the group 16 per cent gross in dividends, with the
other Pounds 5.3m repaying debt.
At the end of 1992 the group had debt of Pounds 6m and finance leases and
deferred consideration of Pounds 828,000.
The placing was arranged by Charterhouse Tilney. Dealings in the shares
begin on October 14.

FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: David Brown advances 22% - Profits of
Pounds 4.7m after lower interest costs in first result since float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVID BROWN Group, the Yorkshire-based specialist engineering company,
announced a 22 per cent rise in pre-tax profits in its first results since
coming to the market in April.
Profits increased from Pounds 3.8m to Pounds 4.7m in the six months to July
30, although sales were flat at Pounds 37.7m, as were operating profits at
Pounds 4.9m.
The increase in the pre-tax line was caused by a sharp reduction in interest
payable to Pounds 277,000 (Pounds 1.05m) as the flotation proceeds
transformed net debt of Pounds 7m into net cash of Pounds 10.1m at the half
year.
David Brown said its results were much as foreshadowed in its listing
particulars. An expected gap in orders for Challenger tank gearboxes reduced
sales by the vehicle transmissions division.
This was offset by growth in the other divisions - pumps, which supplies the
oil and gas market; special products, which makes custom-built gearboxes;
and Radicon, which makes smaller gear units.
Mr Chris Cook, joint chief executive, said that transmission sales were 20
per cent down following the gap in orders between Challenger 1 and
Challenger 2.
However, Vickers had recently won an order from Oman which meant David Brown
would supply 23 new gearboxes.
Overall the group's order book stood at a record Pounds 59.5m.
Mr Derek Kingsbury, chairman, said the group's longer-term prospects had
been enhanced by a contract to supply Agco Corporation of the US with
tractor axles, worth a minimum of Dollars 50m (Pounds 33m) over three years.
The group will invest Pounds 7m in a new facility near Huddersfield and
working capital for the Agco contract and deliveries to the US will start in
January.
Radicon's sales grew by 13 per cent to to Pounds 10.5m, reflecting the
impact of new products and devaluation, rather than widespread recovery in
the UK.
Sales of pumps grew by 16 per cent to Pounds 9.1m, but demand for
higher-margin spares and services remained depressed, and operating profits
were down by 12 per cent.
Sales of special products were up 5 per cent at Pounds 7.6m, reflecting weak
demand from UK engineering contractors, although margins were improved by a
fall in costs.
Mr Chris Brown, joint chief executive, said the group workforce of 1,400 had
fallen by about 70 during the half year, but was likely to increase as the
Agco work picked up.
Pro-forma earnings per share amounted to 6.5p (6.1p) for the period.
The maiden interim dividend is 2.1p.

FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Kelt Energy stake for Kerry Packer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KELT ENERGY, the oil exploration and production company, is raising Pounds
5m through a share subscription and open offer under which Mr Kerry Packer's
CP International Securities, could take a maximum 14.8 per cent stake in the
company.
CPI, a subsidiary of the Australian entrepreneur's Consolidated Press
International Holdings, is subscribing for up to 12.5m shares at 40p each.
The deal is part of CPI's expansion into the energy and petrochemical
industries.
Ordinary and preference shareholders can subscribe on a 1-for-11.174 basis.
Two companies held by Mr Hubert Perrodo, chairman of Kelt, will not take up
their entitlements, totalling 12.2 per cent of the enlarged capital, in
favour of CPI.
Mr Perrodo's stake in Kelt, which was restructured two years ago when a
group of banks took over some of its exploration and production assets in
return for writing off its debt, will fall to a little more than 55 per
cent.
Mr Jean-Michel Runacher, chief executive, said the subscription was the
first step towards the further dilution of Mr Perrodo's stake. Additional
steps to broaden the shareholder base can be expected.
Since its restructuring Kelt has specialised in taking over marginal assets
from large oil companies and cutting costs in order to make them profitable.
Yesterday Mr Perrodo said the strategy had enabled Kelt to double its
production over the past six months to 11,050 barrels of oil equivalent a
day.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRENT WALKER, the heavily indebted leisure and property group, yesterday
sold the Hackney Wick Greyhound Stadium for Pounds 5m to a consortium led by
Henderson Venture Managers.
Henderson has raised another Pounds 9m to invest in refurbishing the
stadium, which will be run by a management team headed by Mr Robert Parker,
a racing writer and trainer.
Mr Parker said he intends to turn the stadium, which is currently in a
run-down condition, into the most advanced in the UK.
He plans to build a new stand and upgrade other facilities in a 40-week
building programme. The track will remain open throughout.
Mr Parker said: 'There is huge potential to develop the sport further.'
The stadium will be owned by Fleetwood Racing, with Sir James Harvie-Watt as
non-executive chairman.
Sir James is a former managing director of Wembley Stadium and was vice
chairman of the Sports Council.
Senior debt for the project is being provided by Bank of Scotland. Samuel
Montagu is providing mezzanine debt.

FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Whitegate Leisure returns to profit with
Pounds 663,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHITEGATE Leisure, the entertainment and ten pin bowling group, announced
pre and post-tax profits of Pounds 663,000 for the 12 months to August 31.
In the previous period - covering the eight months to end-August 1992 - the
group incurred losses of Pounds 8.72m, adjusted for FRS 3. The figures were
struck after interest charges of Pounds 3.02m and Pounds 2.74m respectively.
Adjusted earnings per share emerged at 6.5p (5.3p losses).
The accounts were prepared on a going concern basis; a renewed agreement
with the group's bankers lasting until end-September 1995 was reached on
Tuesday whereby Whitegate will issue 3.19m shares at par to the banks,
subject to shareholders' approval.
The return to profit enabled the group to repay some Pounds 2m of bank debt
since April 1. Borrowings currently stand at about Pounds 30m, expected to
come down to below Pounds 25m by the end of next year.
Turnover in the largest business - dancing - amounted to Pounds 13.7m
(Pounds 6.41m) for operating profits of Pounds 4.37m (Pounds 970,000).
Bowling contributed turnover of Pounds 6.34m (Pounds 4m) and oper-ating
profits of Pounds 2.32m (Pounds 1.46m).
The group has finally divorced itself from the ill-fated move into France
and is still seeking buyers for the remnants of its healthcare subsidiary.
Options include seeking a separate quotation for the business which achieved
profits of Pounds 231,000 (Pounds 137,000) before exceptional items.
The group's intention was now to concentrate wholly on the UK mass market
leisure business. To reflect its 'distinct regional identity' it proposes to
change its name to Northern Leisure. Whitegate also intends to move from the
USM to a full listing.
The shares rose 4 1/2p to 43 1/2p.

Another year of progress was recorded by Paramount, the USM-quoted pub
operator, with pre-tax profits up 12 per cent from Pounds 403,000 to Pounds
450,000 in the 12 months to May 31.
With operating profits down from Pounds 1.59m to Pounds 1.42m, pre-tax
results benefited from reduced interest of Pounds 1.15m (Pounds 1.26m) and
increased associate's contribution of Pounds 180,000 (Pounds 73,000).
Turnover was lower at Pounds 4.81m (Pounds 7.64m).
Paramount currently owns and manages 220 licensed properties within a 100
miles radius of Chester.
Earnings per share were unchanged at 0.56p basic and 0.43p fully diluted.
The dividend is up from 0.1p to 0.15p.

REA Holdings, the plantation company, achieved an 83 per cent jump in
pre-tax profits from Pounds 193,000 to Pounds 354,000 in the half year ended

FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Forte aims for agreed settlement to Savoy
imbroglio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTE, the hotel and restaurants group, has decided it will try to avoid a
hostile bid for Savoy Hotel when a five-year truce between the two companies
ends in November next year.
Although Forte would still like to gain control of Savoy, it is believed to
favour an agreed settlement.
It is thought to fear that an announced bid would drive up the Savoy share
price and make an acquisition more expensive.
Forte fought a bitter battle to take over its rival during the 1980s which
gave it a majority of Savoy shares but a minority of voting shares.
The two groups reached a stand-still agreement, under which Forte said it
would give 12 months' notice if it wanted to increase its shareholding after
November 1994.
This means that if Forte wants to gain control of Savoy as soon as the
five-year period ends it will have to give notice next month.
This is now unlikely to happen.
Instead, Forte is expected to try to persuade Savoy that a merger of the two
companies' luxury hotels is preferable to a reopening of hostilities.
Mr Forte has said he would like to create a new luxury hotel group over
which Forte would have majority control.
The group would encompass the Savoy establishments, which include the Savoy,
the Connaught and Claridge's.
Forte would place its Exclusive Portfolio of hotels in the group.
These include the Grosvenor House and Hyde Park Hotels in London, the
Westbury and Plaza Athenee in New York, the Ritz in Madrid and the George V
in Paris.

FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Lack of exceptional cuts Grampian Hldgs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERIM pre-tax profits at Grampian Holdings, the Glasgow-based
mini-conglomerate, fell from Pounds 10.8m to Pounds 2.05m.
The comparable figure was distorted by an exceptional gain of Pounds 8.34m,
against a charge this time of Pounds 1.22m.
The company is holding the interim dividend at 1.7p, out of earnings down at
2.14p (14.7p).
The group, with interests in animal pharmaceuticals, transport, retailing
and sports goods, reported operating profits of Pounds 5.16m (Pounds 5m) on
turnover down at Pounds 60.2m (Pounds 66.7m) in the six months to July 2.
The pre-tax figure was helped by lower interest charges of Pounds 1.89m
(Pounds 2.56m) although net borrowings were static at Pounds 36m.
'Trading in the third quarter has shown an improvement over the same period
in 1992,' said Mr Bill Hughes, chairman and chief executive, but
'marketplace uncertainties' persisted.
Sales improved in all divisions but the company excluded from the group
figures Pounds 8.18m of Pounds 8.7m (Pounds 8.3m) sales in its retail
business, of which it now owns just 25 per cent following a merger with the
privately-held Edinburgh Woollen Mills in March. Operating losses in retail
fell to Pounds 475,000 (Pounds 1.2m) for the same reason.
Pharmaceutical sales rose to Pounds 24.8m (Pounds 22.5m) with overseas sales
up 21 per cent but the larger UK volumes were up just 6.4 per cent.
Operating profits were Pounds 3.29m (Pounds 3.06m).
Transport operating profits were Pounds 1.32m (Pounds 940,000) on turnover
of Pounds 17.9m (Pounds 15.9m). Sporting goods fell into losses of Pounds
273,000 (profits Pounds 160,000) on turnover of Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 14.8m).
The exceptional charges related to profits on sales of subsidiaries less
reorganisation costs.
COMMENT
Grampian, a hope-postponed stock for some while, has solved some of its
problems. The pharmaceuticals division has cut annual costs by more than
Pounds 1m and has just obtained licences for two vaccines it has developed.
The retail merger and sportswear licencing deals are good glosses on poor
quality businesses, with royalties from the latter worth about Pounds
700,000 a year. Grampian can also enjoy something of a cyclical kick through
its transport interests. Profits of about Pounds 9m this year before tax and
exceptionals would put the stock on a multiple of 17.3 but, assuming the
solutions achieved pay off, this drops to a good-value 11.1 in 1995.

FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Hewden Stuart advances to Pounds 9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEWDEN STUART, the UK's biggest independent plant hire company, yesterday
celebrated the 25th anniversary of its coming to the market by announcing a
35 per cent increase in pre-tax profits and a 1-for-5 scrip issue.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 6.7m to Pounds 9.1m in the six months to
July 31, even though turnover rose only slightly, from Pounds 88.9m to
Pounds 91.7m.
Sir Matthew Goodwin, chairman, said the downward trend in profits
experienced for the last three years was reversed in the early summer, but
this was more a reflection of good husbandry than any real strengthening in
the workload of the Glasgow-based group's customers.
The chairman said the improvement in the hire division's profits reflected
benefits from the heavy capital expenditure programme which had been carried
through the recession, often at a cost which adversely profits at the time.
He added: 'Overall, however, the division reported no lessening in the
severity of the competition and little sign of recovery in rates, and did
well to achieve a small increase in turnover and profits.'
Merchandising also saw a moderate increase in activity and profits, and Sir
Matthew said one of the noticeable factors was that machines taken in
part-exchange tended to be older than usual, with a shortage of modern
second-hand equipment. 'This supports the view that the condition and age of
plant fleets generally has deteriorated and brings nearer the time when
customers will seek quality and service, albeit at higher prices,' he said.
The group said its tower crane division, which last year incurred a loss,
had improved and was expected to make a contribution to profits at the
year-end.
In July 31, Hewden paid Pounds 11m for the non-operated plant hire assets of
BET Group, acquiring 24,000 items of plant and 29 freehold properties. The
group said the acquisition increased and complemented its activities in this
field, and was expected to contribute to profits in the second half of this
year.
Capital expenditure, including the BET deal, amounted to Pounds 28m and was
financed entirely out of cashflow and cash resources. The group still had
net cash at the half-year close, and in August raised more cash by placing
6m shares with institutions at 119p.
Earnings per share rose to 3.6p (2.39p). Sir Matthew said that in a
recessionary period where wages and costs needed to be carefully controlled,
it would be inappropriate to do other than moderately increase the dividend,
which rose to 0.9p (0.875p).
COMMENT
Sir Matthew was pleased with these results and upbeat about the group's
prospects in the second half, as well he might be. The speed with which
small increases in demand have been translated into substantial increases in
profits is a tribute to how the group has kept on investing, and bodes well
for the impact of a stronger recovery. Analysts were pleasantly surprised to
learn that there will be some profits this year from the BET deal, which
looks like a tax-efficient coup. Forecast profits of Pounds 18m put the
shares, up 16p to 158p, on a premium prospective multiple of 20, but there
are many supposed recovery stocks with a poorer record and outlook.

FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Manchester United up to Pounds 8.2m -
Pre-tax outcome hit by increased spending on player transfers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE year in which it finally fulfilled 26 years of fans' expectations by
becoming League champions, Manchester United lifted profits before transfer
fees from Pounds 7.68m to Pounds 8.19m.
At the pre-tax level for the 12 months to July 31, profits declined to
Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 5.06m), adversely affected by net expenditure on the
transfer of players which rose from Pounds 2.63m to Pounds 3.99m - with
money spent on players totalling Pounds 6.02m. This included the purchase of
Roy Keane for Pounds 3.75m, and Eric Cantona and Dion Dublin for Pounds 1m
apiece.
The shares closed down 15p at 542p.
The aggregate value of the first team squad, as reported by Touche Ross, was
Pounds 30m (Pounds 24m).
Interest receivable declined to Pounds 796,000 (Pounds 1.42m) as cash and
gilt-edged stock fell to Pounds 7.76m (Pounds 14.8m) after capital
investment of Pounds 12m, with the rebuilding of the Stretford End at the
Old Trafford ground coming in under budget at Pounds 10.3m. Cash generated
was Pounds 4.1m.
The operating surplus of Pounds 7.39m (Pounds 6.27m) was achieved on
turnover up at Pounds 25.2m (Pounds 20.1m). This grew in spite of a 4 per
cent reduction in gate receipts to Pounds 10.7m (Pounds 11.1m) mainly due to
the rebuilding.
Turnover from television rose to Pounds 3.85m (Pounds 1.84m), thanks, the
company said, to improved arrangements under the senior league and winning
the championship. Sponsorship, advertising, first-time royalties from Umbro
and increased sales of replica kits contributed more at Pounds 3.62m (Pounds
2.76m), and in spite of the reduced capacity, conference and catering
activities turnover rose to Pounds 1.81m (Pounds 1.7m).
The strongest growth in turnover came from the merchandising division where
there was a 93 per cent rise to Pounds 5.23m (Pounds 2.71m). A joint venture
retail store has recently been opened in Belfast and Mr Robin Launders,
group finance director, said the launch of a credit card was likely soon and
that there would be an announcement about financial services offers on
Friday.
Below the line, Pounds 1m was appropriated from the transfer fee reserve -
'essentially a dividend protection reserve', according to Mr Launders - to
give earnings per share after appropriation of 32.5p (27.6p), or 24.3p
(29.7p) before.
The final dividend is lifted to 13.5p (12p) for a total of 19.5p (18p).
The fortunes of the club will be significantly boosted should it defeat
Galatasary of Turkey in the European Champions Cup and progress to the
lucrative mini-league stage.

FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: CentreGold valued at Pounds 50m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CENTREGOLD, a leading UK-based publisher and distributor of video game and
computer entertainment software, will be valued at about Pounds 50m when it
comes to market through a placing and intermediaries offer later this month.
The Birmingham-based group, which was founded 10 years ago by Mr Geoff
Brown, a former teacher, issued its pathfinder prospectus yesterday and also
revealed sharply higher profits fuelled by booming sales of home
entertainment software for Sega and Nintendo video games machines and
personal computers.
Pre-tax profits increased by 60 per cent to Pounds 2.72m (Pounds 1.7m) in
the year to July 31 on turnover ahead 23 per cent to Pounds 68m (Pounds
55.1m).
Precise details of the issue, which is being brought to market by Smith New
Court, have yet to be fixed but it will be priced on October 19. The issue
is expected to raise about Pounds 20m, including Pounds 10m for the company
itself, and is likely to be priced at up to 125p a share.
Three quarters of the shares will be placed firm with the balance subject to
clawback under the intermediaries offer. That offer will close on October 22
and dealings are expected to begin on October 28.
Following the flotation the existing management, including Mr Brown who is
CentreGold's chief executive, will retain just under 50 per cent of the
enlarged share capital. Mr Brown is expected to emerge with a 35 per cent
stake valued at about Pounds 17.5m.
The Pounds 10m in proceeds from the new shares will mainly be used to
provide additional working capital to support ongoing development.
In particular, Mr Brown said, it would enable the group to take advantage of
its new distribution arrangements with Sega, a new publishing relationship
with Nintendo and the continued expansion of its US operations.
The market for home entertainment hardware and software has grown rapidly in
recent years.
The UK market, dominated by Sega and Nintendo, was worth approximately
Pounds 900m last year, against Pounds 190m in 1992.
CentreGold operates through two main subsidiaries - CentreSoft, which
distributes computer and video game entertainment software to 1,300
retailers in the UK, including the Boots and John Menzies chains, and US
Gold, which publishes PC software and video games for Sega and now Nintendo
games machines on both sides of the Atlantic.

FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Matt Clark seeks Pounds 30m for buy -
Grants of St James's seen as perfect fit with significant cost benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MATTHEW CLARK yesterday offered shareholders the sweetener of a 7.5 per cent
dividend increase to 18p as the drinks group launched its second rights
issue in four months to fund an acquisition.
Shareholders, who provided Pounds 13m in June to buy a drinks wholesaler,
were yesterday asked to contribute Pounds 30m through a 3-for-5 rights issue
at 375p to fund the purchase of Grants of St James's, the wines and spirits
supplier, from the Hiram Walker offshoot of Allied-Lyons.
The shares, which were suspended last week following speculation over the
acquisition, closed at 498p.
Mr Peter Aikens, chief executive, said Grants and Clark were 'a mirror image
. . . they are a perfect fit'. Both groups had a branded wine business and a
drinks wholesale division.
Allied-Lyons said that following a strategic review earlier this year light
wine and wholesaling was not considered to be a priority.
Mr Aikens said there were significant cost benefits to be achieved by
merging the two businesses. He expected annualised cost savings of about
Pounds 8.5m to begin to feed through in the new year.
The acquisition would also strengthen Clark's ability to take advantage of
the opportunities provided by a rapidly changing drinks sector, Mr Aikens
said.
It has been estimated that between 700 and 800 pubs would eventually be free
to choose their suppliers following last week's announcement that Grand
Metropolitan was selling its Chef &amp; Brewer estate to Scottish &amp; Newcastle.
Over the last three years, Clark has been restructured away from its
original role as agency for a few branded drinks to a producer, wholesaler
and supplier. It owns Stone's Original Ginger Wine and last year purchased
Strathmore bottled water.
Grants is a leading company in the wine-in-a-box sector, claiming 40 per
cent of the UK market with brands such as Stowell's of Chelsea.
Mr Aikens said he expected the acquisition to enhance earnings this year.
Rationalisation costs of about Pounds 10m will be provided for in the
balance sheet. Analysts, who had been expecting pre-tax profits of about
Pounds 8m for the year to April 30, are revising forecasts to about Pounds
10m.
Clark will make an initial cash payment of Pounds 28m for the business and
assets of Grants. There will be a further payment of about Pounds 4.5m on
completion.
The acquisition follows the purchase in July of Freetraders, a drinks
wholesaler. Mr Aikens said Freetraders had shown solid growth since its
acquisition with a 37 per cent increase in profits before interest and tax
to at least Pounds 3.2m.

FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Amber Day pulls out of imports and
distribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Amber Day Holdings fell by 14p to 56p after the controversial
retailer said it was withdrawing from the import and distribution business
and would concentrate on What Everyone Wants, its Glasgow-based discount
retail chain.
Mr Peter Carr, who took over as chairman in August after a boardroom split,
also warned that the group's results for the year to July 31 - which will be
reported in November - would be depressed by charges totalling not more than
Pounds 8.5m.
The bulk of this will relate to the disposal of the group's import and
distribution business, which has offices in London and Sri Lanka.
However, a substantial chunk will also go on compensation to former
directors.
A payment of Pounds 1.13m was made to Mr Philip Green, who stepped down as
chairman and chief executive last September after the group reported a drop
in last year's profits from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 7.5m.
This year's results should also reveal how much compensation was paid to Mr
Stacey Ellis, who stepped down as chairman in August, only seven months
after he joined the group in an attempt to rebuild its credibility.
The third element in the charges will be a further exceptional provision for
the group's former men's wear division, which was sold during the previous
financial year.
This mainly covers write-downs on property and is in addition to the Pounds
5.99m exceptional charge which the group took when it sold the division last
year.
Mr Carr said: 'The board believes that it is important to take these
measures now, recognising the need to clear the impositions of the past, in
order to devote skills and resources to the core business of the group, What
Everyone Wants.'
Trading at What Everyone Wants in 1992-1993 continued satisfactorily, with
the underlying trend of sales and profits ahead of the previous year,
despite difficult trading conditions. However, the group warned that
operating profit of the chain would show a small decline as a consequence,
principally, of a non-recurring change in accounting method for stock
mark-downs.
'The board is confident of the opportunity that exists in the British
discount retail sector, as well as the growth potential of What Everyone
Wants within it and a strategy for expansion is in the final stages of
preparation.'
Amber Day said it intended to recommend a final dividend which, taken with
the interim of 1.1p, would 'form a base from which to grow the dividend in
future years.'

FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Invergordon bid would be 'inadequate'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVERGORDON Distillers, the scotch whisky distiller, said that if a bid were
made for the company at 300p it would be 'inadequate' and would 'fail to
reflect the strategic value' of Invergordon. The statement was made after
the market closed with the shares up 6p at 294p.
The announcement followed a joint statement from Whyte &amp; Mackay, the UK
drinks subsidiary of American Brands, and Fleming Investment Management on
Tuesday, which said they were in talks that might lead to FIM selling its
13.6 per cent stake in Invergordon to WM.
If WM bought the stake it would be obliged to bid for the whole of
Invergordon as it already holds 41 per cent of its shares, the legacy of an
unsuccessful bid two years ago which was pitched at 275p. FIM had supported
Invergordon then.
Under the Takeover Code, WM would have to offer shareholders at least the
same price that it paid to FIM.
WM and FIM have not publicly stated the possible price at which FIM might
sell. A price of 300p has been mentioned in the press, with FIM reported to
have rejected that amount.
Invergordon said yesterday that WM was 'denying the (Invergordon) board the
opportunity to represent the interests of all shareholders' by not putting
the proposals directly to it. It is to write to shareholders shortly and
advise them what action to take.
Invergordon is advised by Robert Fleming, the merchant bank, while FIM, the
investment management arm of Robert Fleming, is being advised on this issue
by SG Warburg.

POCKLINGTON Blocks, the York-based manufacturer of concrete floors and
staircases, has been bought for the second time by the man who rescued it
from receivership in 1982, writes Ian Hamilton Fazey.
The company, part of Bardon Group since 1988, has been sold to Mr Eric
Emmerson for Pounds 2.4m.
The sale is a small divestment of a non-core business by Bardon, the
building group which last month reported interim losses of Pounds 59.5m,
including a Pounds 60m provision for a US investment it plans to sell.
3i's Leeds office has provided Pounds 500,000 of equity, with Midland Bank
covering loans and Pounds 600,000 of working capital.

FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: SE probe as Drew issues warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DREW Scientific, the maker of medical diagnostic kits, yesterday issued a
profits warning less than six months after coming to the market, and days
after a sharp fall in the share price.
The announcement that there would be a pre-tax loss of Pounds 850,000 in the
six months to September 30 was timed to coincide with the close of the stock
market.
Drew said that for the last three months it has been unable to ship the only
product it produces, a kit that helps doctors monitor the management of
diabetes.
Mr Trevor Barker, chairman, has asked the Stock Exchange to investigate
recent trading in the share price. 'I want to know why there was a leak,' Mr
Barker said.
He said that while Drew had known since July about the problem with valves
it buys for its kits in the US, it could not quantify the extent of the
problem and had not made an announcement.
Advisers at Credit Lyonnais Laing, said the directors should have been aware
that there was a danger of a false market in their shares once shipment of
the only product was suspended.
Mr Barker said the company had wanted to wait until it could announce that
shipment had been resumed.
Drew was floated in May at 105p and the shares jumped to 150p valuing the
company at about Pounds 40m. Directors took about Pounds 3m in cash from the
sale of shares, with Mr Drew, still one of the largest shareholders, taking
Pounds 1.3m.
Since then the share price fell to 105p before last Friday when it dropped
another 20p. It closed yesterday unchanged at 80p before the announcement
Mr Barker said that since the float the company had met problems. 'None of
this was known when we issued the prospectus,' he said.
Mr Andrew Kenney, research and development director, said the 'working
hypothesis' was that 'the mistake we may have made is not saying anything
publicly since the flotation.'
At the time of launch, Drew did not make a profits forecast. But based on
assumptions about the number of kits that would be shipped, brokers were
steered towards a pre-tax profit figure for the year of about Pounds 2m.
Drew also said yesterday that the US Food and Drug Adminstration had
approved a new G15 diagnostic kit which should enjoy larger sales.
The profits warning will be particularly embarrassing for Close Brothers,
which brought the company to the market in a placing, and its advisers.

FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Gold Greenlees shares fall 50p after
profits warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Gold Greenlees Trott fell by 50p to 225p yesterday after the
advertising and marketing services group warned that City profit forecasts
for the year ending next April were 'optimistic'.
The group, which had a Pounds 14.7m rights issue in February at 235p a share
to fund acquisitions, said it expected that interim results would 'justify
the maintenance of the interim dividend' and, for the full year, pre-tax
profits should exceed last year's Pounds 4.3m.
Analysts had been forecasting pre-tax profits for the year of between Pounds
6m and Pounds 6.5m; yesterday they dropped to about Pounds 4.5m after the
warning was issued.
Recovery in both advertising and sales promotion activities in the UK has
been slower than anticipated, GGT said. This had resulted in the deferral
and reduction of spending by a number of clients.
'Although the board remains encouraged by the number of new business pitches
by both the North American and UK agencies, these are unlikely to have the
impact on this year's profitability that was originally anticipated,' the
group added.
GGT said earnings per share would be reduced, but a temporary reduction in
the dividend cover would be justified because of its 'strong balance sheet,
positive cash position and good long-term prospects'. These factors would be
taken into account 'in considering the appropriate level of full-year
dividend,' it said.
At the time of the February cash call, Mr Michael Greenlees, chairman, said
he saw 'considerable room for growth' in existing business.
In June, a joint venture was formed with GGK, the privately-owned European
agency network, with both sides putting Pounds 3m cash into the new company.
In the year to April 30, GGT reported pre-tax profits 6 per cent higher at
Pounds 4.32m. Turnover rose 18 per cent to Pounds 275.4m and the final
dividend was 5p on capital increased by the rights issue, making an
unchanged 8.3p for the year.

FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Abbott Mead Vickers down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBOTT MEAD VICKERS, the advertising group, yesterday reported a slight drop
in pre-tax profits for the first half of 1993 from Pounds 1.54m to Pounds
1.5m.
This drop was in spite of a strong increase in new business in recent months
and an increase in turnover to Pounds 94.4m (Pounds 77.7m).
Mr David Abbott, chairman, said there were signs that 'widespread cutbacks
in client spending seem to be a thing of the past'. This, together with
continuing success in winning new business 'gives us considerable optimism
as we look forward into 1994', he said.
This optimism was reflected in an interim dividend increased 7 per cent to
3.2p, although earnings per share dropped to 5.71p (6p). Operating profits
increased slightly to Pounds 1.29m (Pounds 1.23m).
The group reported that average cash balances had improved to over Pounds
7.5m, against Pounds 6.2m. However, lower interest rates had reduced
interest income to Pounds 211,000 (Pounds 308,000), said AMV.
Profits growth had partly been held back by investment in software to
transmit full colour pictures, although the longer-term opportunities of the
technology were 'substantial', according to the group.
AMV acquired the BBDO London advertising agency in 1991 and 'tangible
rewards' from the relationship continued. AMV-BBDO moved from tenth to fifth
position in the 1993 Register-MEAL ranking of advertising agencies, with a
year-on-year billing increase of 38 per cent. AMV bought Clarke Hooper from
the receiver in 1992.
First-half new business totalled over Pounds 48m on an annualised basis. New
accounts included: Gossard, Ever Ready, British Telecom code change, Radio
Times, Du Pont, Dunlop Slazenger, British Gas, SmithKline Beecham and Lever
Brothers. The group was additionally pitching for business worth over Pounds
54m on an annualised basis, it said.

leased from Whitbread since May 1992. Sales through the group's tenanted
pubs improved 5 per cent.
Earnings per Pounds 1 share emerged at 54.4p (45.6p). A final dividend of

ABTRUST Fund Managers is attempting to raise Pounds 50m to invest in
emerging markets in the Far East, Asia, Europe and Latin America in a new
investment trust.
Abtrust has received undertakings to subscribe for Pounds 27.5m from
institutions and financial intermediaries.
The initial net asset value will be between 95.5 and 96 per cent of the
gross proceeds of the offer because of start-up costs.
The new trust has a simple capital structure and offers a minimum investment
of 2,000 ordinary shares at 100p each. For every five shares subscribed one
warrant with a life of 15 years will be issued.
The warrant gives its owner the right to subscribe for one ordinary share at
100p in any one of the years from 1995 to 2008.
The offer opened yesterday and closes on October 27.
Dealings are expected to begin on November 4.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Bank of Scotland surges despite weak demand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER loan margins and increased fees helped Bank of Scotland raise interim
pre-tax profits 58 per cent to Pounds 117.6m, against Pounds 74.2m, despite
being hampered by weak loan demand.
Economic recovery enabled provisions for bad debts to be lowered 25 per cent
compared with the second half of last year to Pounds 174.4m in the six
months to August 31. But this was still 26 per cent up on the first half of
last year.
Assets such as loans rose only 1 per cent on the second half of last year to
Pounds 29.4bn, well within the bank's self-imposed limit of 5 per cent asset
growth for the year.
Mr Bruce Pattullo, governor and chief executive, had been surprised by the
'extremely weak' loan demand. As a result, assets might well expand this
year by less than the 5 per cent limit it had set in order to maintain its
capital adequacy ratio. He said improvements in management and the reshaping
of the bank over the past three years had started 'to come through to the
bottom line'.
Bad debt provisions should continue to fall in the second half. This would
be helped by some release of provisions as it sold assets such as distressed
companies which it had helped to continue trading.
Operating profits before bad debt provisions rose 39 per cent to Pounds
288.2m. Net interest income rose 22 per cent to Pounds 376.1m (Pounds
307.3m) and non-interest income rose 24 per cent rise to Pounds 186.5m
(Pounds 150m).
The rise in net interest income was achieved by increasing the average
margin on loans from 2.37 per cent to 2.57 per cent. This was reflected in a
widening of the spread between interest charged on assets and paid on
liabilities.
Mr Pattullo said that margins on syndicated loans to large corporate
customers were starting to narrow as competition re-emerged, but this had
been more than offset by the rise in margins on loans to small business
customers.
More than half the rise in fee and income commission in the clearing bank
came through branches and included increases in personal and corporate
customer charges. Mr Pattullo expected further improvements in the second
half.
The Bank of Wales subsidiary, which suffered a Pounds 15.3m loss last year
because of problems with a finance subsidiary, returned to a half-year
profit of Pounds 400,000.
The bank reduced its ratio of costs to income to 49.6 per cent, in spite of
a 10 per cent rise in expenses to Pounds 274.4m. It raised its interim
dividend 5.6 per cent to 1.87p, against 1.77p. It maintained its tier 1
ratio of core capital to assets at 5.8 per cent after retaining Pounds 40.4m
profit. The shares closed 3.5p up at 184p.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Freeing its hand to shop around
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whitbread's restructuring frees it from its past as a family brewer and
gives it flexibility to pursue its strategic development in retailing and
leisure.
The move had been widely expected since Sir Michael Angus took over as
chairman last year from Mr Samuel Whitbread, whose ancestor founded the
business at the Goat Brewhouse in London in 1742.
The family, with 10.8 per cent of the voting rights, had long ago ceded
control. But the dual share structure and the cross-holdings in Whitbread
Investment Company continued to put a brake on expansion.
The share structure had been devised in 1948 as a safeguard against takeover
threats, but was out of tune with contemporary thinking on shareholders'
rights, restricting Whitbread's ability to raise funds in the market.
The Whitbread Investment Company had also outlived its usefulness. It was
set up in 1956 when a number of regional brewers turned to Whitbread for
help in resisting takeover bids, notably from an acquisitive Bass. Whitbread
bought minority stakes, usually in deals which included an agreement to
stock its beers. Several of the regional brewers concerned - including
Flowers, Fremlins and Castle Eden - became part of the Whitbread group in
the 1960s.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into the brewing industry in
1989 changed the competitive climate. Because of its association with WIC,
Whitbread was forced to reduce its stakes in regional brewers and
pub-owners, or free more of its own pubs from tied beer supplies.
For Whitbread's shareholders, its near 50 per cent stake in WIC began to
appear anomalous.
It became increasingly obvious that the complex and confusing structures
were a drag on the group's development. Mr John Spicer, analyst at Warburg
Securities, says this helps to explain 'Whitbread's slippage in size behind
other leading companies in the drinks sector over the past 10 years. Some
opportunities for sizeable acquisitions may have been missed.'
Losing to Scottish &amp; Newcastle in the bidding for GrandMet's Chef &amp; Brewer
chain of pubs last month was a blow - though Mr Peter Jarvis, chief
executive, said 'the price GrandMet was looking for and our valuation were
never in the same ball park'.
With the completion of the reforms, Whitbread will not only gain readier
access to funds through equity issues, but also instant access to WIC's
investment portfolio.
That includes - apart from nearly Pounds 200m of shares in Whitbread which
will be cancelled - Pounds 250m of shares in more than a score of companies.
Much of this portfolio could be sold to raise cash, though stakes are likely
to be kept in regional brewers and pub operators to underpin Whitbread's
trading links.
Though speculation continues about Whitbread's eventual exit from brewing,
Mr Jarvis said that he was 'comfortable' with its present performance.
His prime objective, however, is likely to be the continuing reinforcement
of Whitbread's position as one of the UK's leading retailers. The group's
eyes are now clearly on Forte's Harvester chain. 'We are very interested,'
Mr Jarvis said.
As the country's second largest operator in the eating-out market, Whitbread
aims to continue the growth achieved in its Beefeater chain with the
acquisition of Berni, and the development of Pizza Hut. It also plans to
expand its Travel Inn budget hotels and the Thresher chain of off-licences.

FT  07 OCT 93 / BAe shares fall on doubts about Taiwan venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and DENNIS ENGBARTH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, TAIPEI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace shares fell for the second day running yesterday amid
growing fears that a proposed venture to build aircraft in Taiwan would not
go ahead. The shares closed at 399p, down 12p.
BAe said the Taiwanese government still backed the deal. But BAe's joint
venture partner, Taiwan Aerospace Corporation (TAC), confirmed that the
deal's future would be discussed at a board meeting on October 19. 'There
will be a report and a discussion, but it is hard to say whether there will
be a clear decision,' said TAC.
In addition, Taiwanese opposition politicians have stepped up their pressure
on the government to cancel the deal. They accuse it of putting industrial
strategy ahead of commercial good sense.
Collapse of the joint venture, called Avro, would undermine BAe's plans to
improve profits: the RJ regional jets, currently made in Woodford, Cheshire,
lose money for the company. BAe had hoped to return them to profitability by
moving some production to Taiwan.
It could also leave the company about Pounds 300m worse off, according to
City estimates.
In the short term, BAe would lose the Pounds 120m that Taiwan would pay for
the assets BAe is putting into Avro. It would then have to make most of the
4,000 people working on the RJ in the UK redundant, costing another Pounds
60m or more.
Over the medium term, there could be additional costs associated with leases
on RJ aircraft and their predecessors, the 146 range, of about another
Pounds 100m. These costs would not directly hit BAe's profits because they
fall under a Pounds 1bn provision included in the 1992 accounts. But there
might not be enough in the provisions to cope with both the failure of Avro
and a restructuring or closure of BAe's loss-making turboprop aircraft unit.
BAe cannot easily look to any other potential partners to build the RJ
series in an increasingly overcrowded market for short-haul jets. 'It's
Taiwan or it's nothing at all,' said Mr Pete Deighton, aerospace analyst
with Smith New Court.
Taiwan, by contrast, may have a choice of partner. The country is keen to
enter the civil aviation market, and French company Dassault may transfer
the expertise to build the wings for its Falcon executive jets to Taiwan.
Avro's defenders such as Mr Deighton, argue that the recent opposition in
Taiwan to the deal is part of an attempt to wring further concessions from
BAe.
These could involve transferring more manufacturing to Taiwan or a guarantee
to design a new aircraft, the RJ-X.
They also point out that although the failure of Avro would hurt, the damage
would not be as severe as it might have been earlier this year.
'BAe's balance sheet would be considerably more able to cope with the
failure of Avro than a year ago. It was practically a forced seller of the
RJ business then,' said Mr Paul Ruddle, aerospace analyst with NatWest
Markets. 'The cash cost of losing the deal has already been covered by the
(Pounds 250m) sale (to US company Raytheon in June) of the corporate jets
business.'

FT  07 OCT 93 / Alliance reveals DM9bn holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIANZ, Europe's largest insurance company, yesterday disclosed the biggest
of its extensive holdings in German and foreign companies, showing a
combined market value of DM8.9bn (Pounds 3.6bn) at the end of June.
The Munich-based group, which has long had a reputation for secrecy,
followed Daimler-Benz's decision to publish its accounts according to US
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as part of its listing on the New
York Stock Exchange. Earlier this year German banks also moved to more open
accounting.
The holdings, disclosed at the shareholders' meeting in Munich, include: a
14.4 per cent stake in BASF, one the big-three German chemical companies; a
14.8 per cent stake in Linde, one of Germany's biggest insurance companies;
a 12.8 per cent stake in RWE, the Dusseldorf-based utilities conglomerate;
and a 12.1 per cent stake in Veba, the energy-based conglomerate.
Allianz also disclosed a 16.9 per cent stake in the BHF Bank, one of
Germany's most influential, and a 12 per cent stake in the Dusseldorf-based
IKB Deutsche Industriebank.
Disclosures were limited to stakes of 10 per cent or above. Allianz has
already revealed a 22 per cent stake in Dresdner Bank, Germany's second
biggest bank, and 20 per cent of the Bayerische Hypo-Bank, another large
bank. It also owns 25 per cent of Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurance
company.
It is known that Allianz is the largest shareholder in Deutsche Bank,
Germany's biggest bank, but as this holding did not appear on the list the
holding is below 10 per cent, but worth several billion D-Marks.
Allianz's disclosures shed light on an investment portfolio which was worth
DM184bn at the end of last year at book value alone.
The announcement pre-empted next year's changes in German securities markets
law which will bring the disclosure requirement down from a threshold of 20
to 25 per cent to 5 per cent or less.
Mr Henning Schulte-Noelle, chief executive, said premium income for the
group in 1993 would rise 14 per cent to more than DM62bn. For the first six
months premium income rose 21.5 per cent to DM33.3bn.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Whitbread gives equal rights: Philip Rawstorne on the UK
brewer's changes to its share structure and investment activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHITBREAD, the UK brewing, retailing and leisure group, yesterday announced
proposals for reforming its 45-year-old share structure to give equal voting
rights to all shareholders.
It also intends to acquire the 51 per cent outstanding stake in the
Whitbread Investment Company, an associate set up in 1956 to protect a
number of regional brewers from takeover.
The share offer values WIC at about Pounds 482.6m, or 765p a share, with a
cash alternative worth 742p. WIC's shares rose from 690p to 743p yesterday.
Sir Michael Angus, Whitbread chairman, said the moves would bring the share
structure into line with other leading public companies and provide greater
flexibility for the group. 'These two transactions will reinforce the
transformation which has taken place at Whitbread in recent years.'
Institutions have long pressed for changes in the outdated dual-share
structure, which has given holders of B shares 20 times the votes of A
holders. It was devised as a safeguard against takeover when Whitbread was a
family-controlled brewer. But today the family holds only 10.8 per cent of
the voting rights.
A single class of shares will now be created by a capitalisation issue
giving 1.27 new A shares for every B share to compensate for the elimination
of the superior voting rights.
The move will give Whitbread easier access to market funds as well as
providing shareholders with greater liquidity and marketability of their
shares.
Sir Michael said: 'It is our intention to make further investment in the
development of our businesses and to make further acquisitions.'
Whitbread will review its options on WIC's investment portfolio, worth more
than Pounds 250m after the deal. It seems likely to sell stakes in leading
UK brewers and retailers, such as Guinness (Pounds 10m) GrandMet (Pounds
7.8m), Bass (Pounds 6.6m) and Allied-Lyons (Pounds 4.5m), as well as smaller
holdings in companies such as Rank, Forte and Cadbury Schweppes.
Compliance with government orders will require stake reductions in Marston,
Boddington and Brakspear.
Whitbread B shares fell from 1388p to 1200p yesterday, while the A shares
closed unchanged at 534p. Both closing prices were in line with the formula
for valuing WIC, whose 30 per cent stake in Whitbread is being unwound.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Yeltsin confirms election date and eases press censorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin called on Russians last night to put the 'nightmare
of these black days' behind them, eased his press censorship and confirmed
that parliamentary and possibly regional council elections would be held in
December.
Mr Yeltsin, seemingly close to tears after his first address since the
suppression of the armed uprising in Moscow this week, strove to heal the
wounds of the violence. 'Let us not say that someone has won and someone has
lost,' he said. 'Such words are out of place, blasphemous. We have all been
scorched by the death-like breath of fratricide.'
But he warned that the fledgling democracy had in future to be more decisive
in its use of force to prevent further attempts to destabilise his regime.
Apparently criticising his own staff, he said 'not everyone had the
self-control to withstand the huge tension at the critical moment'.
General Vladimir Pankratov, head of the Moscow police, admitted the police
'did not always act brilliantly' during the mob attacks on Sunday, but
excused them by saying 'they were not prepared or trained for military
action'.
Echoing Mr Yeltsin's point that democracy needed better defences, he
announced a shopping list for his men, including armoured cars, heavier
weapons, and training in sharpshooting and riot control.
In an article banned by censors in the liberal newspaper Sivodnya, Mr Sergei
Parkhomenko, stationed in the Kremlin last Sunday, alleged Mr Yeltsin and
his aides in the Kremlin had been in a state of panic when demonstrators
broke through police lines to the White House. Although censorship of
mainstream newspapers was lifted, opposition publications, including Pravda,
remained banned.
Mr Yeltsin's call for regional council elections had been trailed by his
aides, but he stopped short of ordering such elections.
The round of resignations continued with that of Mr Valery Zorkin, head of
the Constitutional Court and a long-time target of Mr Yeltsin's camp.
In a further break with the past, the guard of honour was removed from the
tomb of Vladimir Lenin, one of the founders of the Soviet Union.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Building society rebuked over sales of bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE North of England Building Society may have to pay some Pounds 500,000
compensation to clients after receiving the first public reprimand issued by
the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog.
The SIB censured the society yesterday for failing to ensure that its
independent financial advisers sold suitable products to clients. It is the
first such reprimand by the SIB against any of the 77 firms it regulates
directly.
The building society said that, as a result, it may have to pay compensation
to up to half the 2,000 customers it has advised since 1987, at a cost of
roughly Pounds 500,000.
The SIB's charges against North of England, the UK's 20th largest building
society, deal mainly with its sale of so-called single-premium bonds and its
advice to people to transfer from their existing pension arrangements.
Single-premium bond investors pay a lump sum for a fixed term and earn
higher returns. But cashing in single-premium bonds before their maturity
date leads to a penalty.
Mr David Hodgson, the society's secretary and solicitor, said that although
there were inspection visits in earlier years, they had lasted no longer
than a day. But last September, inspectors announced they intended to
conduct a much more intensive review of records.
That review, which focused on 600 client files, turned up enough instances
of mis-selling to prompt inquiries into the files of the society's entire
2,000 clients.
'We could be looking at remedial action on 1,000 cases,' Mr Hodgson said.
North of England ceased giving independent advice from last Friday and is
now acting as a 'tied agent' selling the products of General Accident
exclusively.
The SIB does not have authority to set fines for firms which break its
rules, unlike the self-regulatory organisations (SROs) which oversee the
bulk of the financial services industry. Firms not wishing to join an SRO
have been able to seek direct supervision by the SIB.
The SIB said that while it has privately disciplined firms before, this is
the first case where it believed public action was warranted. Firms in the
retail financial services industry have complained that direct regulation by
SIB, chosen mostly by banks and building societies, is a 'soft option'
because it is less rigorous than action by SROs.
Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, has said he wishes to withdraw from direct
regulation completely and has urged creation of a new self-regulatory body,
the Personal Investment Authority, which will include many firms now
supervised by SIB.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Clinton may send 2,000 more troops to Somalia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is considering sending up to 2,000 more US troops to
Somalia and may set a date for the withdrawal of all US forces from the
country.
The possible developments, including sending as many as another 50 armoured
vehicles, were revealed by administration officials last night. They suggest
Mr Clinton has decided to escalate attacks on the forces of General Mohammed
Farah Aideed, the Somali faction leader, prior to a withdrawal.
No details were immediately forthcoming, but earlier, in brief but carefully
worded remarks, the president had insisted it was essential the US conclude
its military mission in Somalia but that it do so 'honourably' and without
leaving behind 'a reversion to the absolute chaos and terrible misery that
existed before'.
In the US view, Gen Aideed is culpable on two main counts - for the killing
of 12 US servicemen last weekend and the desecration of their bodies,
graphically captured on TV pictures, and for the threat he poses to the US
and UN humanitarian and peacekeeping missions.
Mr Clinton said he would confer today with leaders of both parties in
Congress. An address to the nation at a later date was also planned, he
said. The president has been forced to set aside for the moment his domestic
policy agenda in the face of political and public pressure for clear-cut
action in Somalia.
Earlier, a possible confrontation with Congress was averted when the Senate
agreed to postpone by at least a week a vote that could have led to a
cut-off in funds for the operation.
Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, made it clear the delay was
designed to give the president more time to formulate policy and to allow
congressional emotions, inflamed by the grisly TV pictures of dead US
servicemen in Mogadishu, to cool down. In fact, the congressional debate,
while frequently critical of the administration, has also cut across party
lines. Yesterday a letter signed by 65 Republican congressmen demanded an
early withdrawal, but Senator Robert Dole, the Republican minority leader,
argued that 'this is not a time for panic'.
Democrats were similarly divided. Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, while
criticising the administration's fixation with getting rid of Gen Aideed,
argued that the wrong global signals would be sent by a premature US
retreat.
Michael Littlejohns adds from New York: Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary-general, will travel to Mogadishu next week to review military
operations. In advance of his trip, Mr Kofi Annan, head of UN peacekeeping
operations worldwide, is to visit the country to demonstrate 'solidarity
with the troops on the ground' and confer with force commanders.

FT  07 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Invergordon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Potential conflicts of interest abound in the debate over Invergordon's
future. Fleming Investment Management holds the deciding stake, and is
negotiating with Whyte &amp; Mackay to sell Invergordon's birthright. Yet it has
to call in S G Warburg as an adviser because its sister company is
Invergordon's adviser. Meanwhile the apparently downbeat view of Warburg
Securities' analysts is hardly helpful to Warburg's corporate finance
efforts on behalf of the vendor.
All that should not detract from the seriousness of the situation. If FIM
agrees a price with Whyte, it will trigger a full bid, but the issue will
effectively have been decided since, thanks to its existing stake, Whyte
will have more than 50 per cent of the votes. In that case neither other
shareholders nor the company's management will have had a full opportunity
to express their views. FIM will have effectively negotiated on everyone
else's behalf and two shareholders will have decided for everyone. It would
be more satisfactory if Whyte, having noted FIM's interest, decided either
that it did not want to bid at present, or put a formal offer into the
market open to all shareholders.
The difficulty, unsurprisingly, is over price. Whyte seems determined not to
overpay while the market is talking the price higher than the previous
failed bid. Yet any bid should be determined by what Whyte is prepared to
pay set against the management's view of business prospects. Currently
shareholders are being denied both pieces of information.

FT  07 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Bank of Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bank of Scotland continues to reap the rewards of prudence. A 39 per cent
increase in interim operating profits before provisions represents a fine
performance, especially as there was little benefit from windfall foreign
exchange gains or overseas income. However, much of the growth came from
wider spreads on its Pounds 5bn mortgage book. That advantage will last only
as long as interest rates stay down.
Of more permanent value is Bank of Scotland's continuing reduction in its
cost to income ratio, which now stands at 49.6 per cent - way below that of
all London-based clearing banks. But it will become progressively tougher to
trim the ratio further to generate income growth. Moreover, with problem
loans representing a relatively low proportion of total lending, Bank of
Scotland will benefit less from declining bad debts than more reckless
rivals.
But as banks start to accumulate surplus capital in the upswing, attention
will increasingly focus on how they intend to use it. Bank of Scotland is of
the old school in believing good money can be made from lending. It promises
to use its capital strength for further expansion into England without
building up a costly branch network. Its progress may be unspectacular, but
the strategy is a good deal less risky than Abbey National's modish foray
into derivatives.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is an aura of unreality in the flirtation of the DAX index with the
2,000 level. German corporate earnings are expected to rebound sharply next
year as restructuring charges fall away and the effect of cost-cutting takes
hold. But after rising by nearly 50 per cent so far this year, the market is
trading on a 1994 multiple of nearly 20. That leaves little room for
anything to go wrong in a year when rising unemployment will ensure consumer
confidence remains weak and election uncertainties will overshadow an
already weak fiscal position.
A more plausible reason for the strength of the equity and bond markets is
the simple weight of liquidity. Money supply growth of around 7 per cent is
far higher than needed to finance the output which is actually being
achieved. Some of the surplus is finding its way into financial assets. The
received wisdom in Frankfurt is that there is room for further gains,
particularly in equities, as money market rates fall. At some point, though,
such confidence must give way to renewed concern about inflation.
At present the Bundesbank can still point to low bond yields as evidence
that inflationary expectations remain muted. If, however, the froth in the
equity market spilled over into property prices, worries about an asset
price bubble, which have recently surfaced in the US, would look much more
applicable to Germany. Monetary easing would then stop dead in its tracks.
That would be bad news indeed for the many industrial companies whose
liquidity has been eroded by weak revenues and the cost of redundancy
payments.

FT  07 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Whitbread's full measure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It was only a matter of time before Whitbread's poison pill got in the way
of its ambition. Enfranchising restricted voting shares and buying out the
majority in the investment company leaves Whitbread as vulnerable to
takeover as its peers. If institutional investors are more willing to hold
the shares, though, it will enjoy easier access to the equity market. The
offer for the investment company will add at most Pounds 250m debt to the
balance sheet - and probably much less - so there is no immediate need for a
rights issue. But there can be no doubting Whitbread's intention to use its
new-found freedom should it spy a large acquisition through the glass in the
bottom of its tankard.
Buying the investment company opens a number of options, since Whitbread is
acquiring stakes in companies ranging from Anheuser-Busch to Vaux. The large
holdings in Boddington, Brakspear and Marston must anyway be reduced to
comply with the beer orders. While the investment company was happy as a
passive shareholder, it is less clear that Whitbread should maintain even
its permitted 15 per cent stake in each. That points to either divestment
over time or a full bid.
The response of the regional brewers' shares suggests the market is more
worried about an overhang of stock than excited by the prospect of a bid.
That may prove premature. Whitbread might value either Boddington's estate
or Marston's strong regional brand. Neither would represent a giant leap
forward in retailing or leisure. But having missed out on Chef &amp; Brewer and
set its face against overseas expansion, Whitbread may have to be content
for now with progress in small steps.

FT  07 OCT 93 / SIB faults North of England over selling of bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog,
has publicly reprimanded the North of England Building Society for failing
to ensure that its independent financial advisers sold suitable products to
clients.
The rebuke, delivered yesterday, was the first such reprimand by the SIB
against one of the 77 firms it regulates directly.
The North of England said that, as a result, it may have to pay compensation
to up to half the 2,000 customers it has advised since 1987, at a cost of
roughly Pounds 500,000.
The SIB's charges against North of England, the UK's 20th largest building
society, deal mainly with its sale of so-called single-premium bonds and its
advice to people to transfer from their existing pension arrangements.
Single-premium bond investors pay a lump sum for a fixed term and earn
higher returns. But cashing in single-premium bonds before their maturity
date leads to a penalty.
Mr David Hodgson, the society's secretary and solicitor, said that although
there were inspection visits in earlier years, they had lasted no longer
than one day. But last September, inspectors announced they intended to
conduct a much more intensive review of records.
That review, which focused on 600 client files, turned up enough instances
of mis-selling to cause the review to be broadened to the society's entire
2,000 clients.
'We could be looking at remedial action on 1,000 cases,' he said.
North of England ceased giving independent advice last Friday and is now
acting as a 'tied agent' selling the products of General Accident
exclusively.
The SIB does not have the authority to set fines for firms which break its
rules, unlike the self-regulatory organisations (SROs) which oversee the
bulk of the financial services industry. Firms which do not wish to join any
existing SRO have had the option of seeking direct supervision by the SIB.
The SIB said that while it has privately disciplined firms before, this is
the first case where it believed public action was warranted. Firms in the
retail financial services industry have complained that direct regulation by
SIB, chosen mostly by banks and building societies, is a 'soft option'
because it is less rigorous than action by SROs.
Mr Andrew Large, SIB's chairman, has said he wishes to withdraw from direct
regulation completely and has urged the creation of a new self-regulatory
body, the Personal Investment Authority, which will include many firms now
supervised by SIB.

Severely strapped for cash, Conservative party officials are having to
become pretty resourceful in their quest to turn an extra penny. But the
prize so far must go to the loyal workers in treasury minister Stephen
Dorrell's seat of Loughborough.
They are spending the week at the annual conference seeking out prominent
Euro-sceptics to autograph Teresa Gorman's new book, The Bastards, billed as
the inside story of the Euro-sceptics' revolt against Maastricht 'and how
the government stamped it out'. The plan is to auction the embellished tome
to raise money for Dorrell's local constituency.
Signatures assembled to date include those of corporate affairs minister
Neil Hamilton, Lord Tebbit, the former party chairman, who further
identifies himself as 'one who knows who his father is', and John Carlisle,
the MP for Luton North, who appends the legend 'barmy'. Thatcherite chief
treasury secretary Michael Portillo is understood to have declined to lend
his name to the endeavour.
The views of ardently pro-European Dorrell on this display of local
initiative are not known.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Observer: Mucha do
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Why has Norddeutsche Landesbank chosen the works of Alphonse Mucha, the Art
Nouveau poster artist, for its first big art promotion in the UK? Easy. The
artist's grandson, John Mucha, is head of corporate affairs in the London
office of the Hanover-based bank. Who better to secure Geraldine Mucha, his
mother, for years residing in Prague, for the dinner marking the opening of
the Barbican show?
Though he made his name in Paris in the 1890s with posters for Sarah
Bernhardt, Alphonse Mucha turns out to have been a fervent Czech nationalist
who lived long enough to mark the 10th anniversary of Czechoslovak
independence in 1928 with an enormous wall-painting called 'the Apotheosis
of the Slavs'. His son Jiri became an RAF pilot during the second world war
two, and returned to Prague in 1945 with his English bride.
Now widowed, Geraldine Mucha rashly urged her London audience to visit her
Prague apartment which still houses the poster artist's extensive
collection. 'Do ring up first,' she urged. 'Otherwise I might be out
shopping.'

In selecting a little-known council member as the Bundesbank's 'foreign
minister', Hans Tietmeyer, who took control of the German central bank at
the beginning of this month, has signalled that he has no intention of
relinquishing control of the institution's international relations.
Ever since Tietmeyer came to the Bundesbank in 1990, the two departments,
currency issues and foreign, have been his bailiwick, a role which involves
representing the bank in such crucial forums as the EC monetary committee
and at IMF meetings. In this capacity, Tietmeyer, with his highly-tuned
international antennae, was very much his own man, as Karl Otto Pohl,
president when Tietmeyer joined, rapidly discovered.
So it comes as no surprise that a relative newcomer to the board, Bavarian
Helmut Schieber, takes on the mantle in the new regime. A career Bundesbank
man of 29 years service, Schieber has worked his way up at the regional
central bank of Baden-Wurttemberg, becoming its vice president in 1985. He
has only been a member of the central bank directorate since June.
Buba watchers attempting to interpret the smoke signals emerging from
Frankfurt following the handover will therefore have to contain themselves
in patience a little longer.

Boy scout meetings may not be the most obvious source of stock market tips,
but shares in Chemical Bank roared ahead yesterday after a gathering the
previous evening of the Greater New York Councils of the Boy Scouts of
America.
Having just been sworn in as president of the movement, which aims to give
boys a disciplined start in life, John McGillicuddy, the bank's chairman and
chief executive, must temporarily have forgotten the famous scouting motto.
So industrious Reuters journalist Alison Rea, who had sat through an
hour-long ceremony at New York's Waldorf Astoria hotel, was duly rewarded
when she walked up to McGillicuddy afterwards. At least two weeks in advance
of the official results, the boss let slip that Chemical would be expecting
record profits in the third quarter.
Abashed Chemical spokesman John Myers had to agree that McGillicuddy had
been quoted correctly, but understandably declined to elaborate.

Hong Kong's political class being long of lawyers and terribly short of
characters, Chim Pui Chung, the local legislature's representative for the
financial and insurance industry, easily steals the limelight in the latter
category.
When Chim, a noted stock market punter and big-time gambler, was elected to
the legislature in 1991, he bought himself a gold Rolls- Royce - just to
show that he was not entering politics to get rich but already was.
Yesterday Chim took out half a page in the business press to give an
'advance appraisal' of Governor Chris Patten's state-of-the-colony speech
due later in the day, expounding on favourite themes such as the need for
the UK and China to resolve their differences over the colony's future.
More original was a suggestion to unblock the political impasse surrounding
Hong Kong's HKDollars 165bn airport project. Funding for the project could
be raised by leasing outlying islands for casinos, says Chim, who is
presumably tiring of the long ride to Las Vegas.

</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MR John Hume, leader of the SDLP
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the non-violent part of the nationalist movement in Northern Ireland -
visits Dublin today to give the Irish government a full account of the
bilateral talks he has been holding since April with Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn
Fein (which represents the violent part), as well as a reaction from
Washington where he has been sounding out his friends in the US Congress.
The announcement 10 days ago that these talks had reached some kind of
conclusion worth reporting to the Irish government has reawakened public
interest in that most elusive of political goals, a peaceful settlement of
the Northern Irish conflict. The precise content of the report remains
private, but its purpose is clear: to devise a political process which would
lead to the abandonment by the IRA of their armed struggle, and thereby to
bring both strands of nationalism to the negotiating table.
Almost simultaneously, it became known the British and Irish governments
were jointly drafting a constitutional settlement, to present this to the
parties in the province before the end of the year, in which the Irish
government would indicate a willingness to modify its constitutional claim
to jurisdiction over Northern Ireland to an 'aspiration'.
To what extent the two events are linked is unclear, but the sudden
publicity given to the second may well have resulted from anxiety in London
to minimise the potential fall-out from the first. The British government
has enough difficulty fending off the intense suspicion felt by Ulster
Unionists about its contacts with Dublin. It knows that that suspicion is
liable to become quite unmanageable if it appears at the same time to be
negotiating, even indirectly, with the IRA.
Intense sensitivities
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, hurriedly
confirmed there would be 'no change whatever' in the province's
constitutional status without the consent of its people. But he has neither
condemned Mr Hume's talks with Sinn Fein, nor ruled out considering their
outcome.
If these events signify that a peaceful settlement may indeed be moving,
however tentatively, within reach, they also highlight the intense
sensitivities on all sides to any perceived deviation from established
political traditions in dealing with the Northern Ireland issue.
The Irish government, under pressure from Britain to alter articles two and
three of the republic's constitution (those which lay claim to sovereignty
over the whole island), can only do this by referendum, but fears a rebuff
from the electorate if a change on such a delicate issue is not part of 'an
overall and balanced settlement'. The premature disclosure of the latest
Anglo-Irish talks could increase this risk, by making it sound as though
Dublin is covertly plotting a deal in which the republic would be expected
to give something for nothing.
Ringing endorsements
Dublin's anger and embarrassment at the disclosure is to be expected and
perhaps explains the ringing endorsements of Mr Hume by no less than four
Irish cabinet ministers including the Taoiseach, Mr Albert Reynolds,
himself. Mr Reynolds has asked the Unionists 'to suspend judgment' on the
Hume-Adams talks until it becomes clear what the substance of their joint
proposals is.
The Unionists are unlikely to hold their breath for long however, especially
if the IRA continues with its bomb outrages, as it has done over the past
week. Until there is, at least, an effective ceasefire, the idea of Mr
Reynolds and Mr Hume considering peace proposals from Sinn Fein will simply
reinforce the Unionist belief that all nationalists are the same under the
skin, whatever their public statements about violence.
The Irish government, too, has it in its power to improve the atmosphere. It
could do so by admitting publicly what many Irish politicians will say in
private, namely that far from aspiring, let alone claiming, to govern the
north, they regard any such prospect with trepidation. A statement to that
effect would both give a clearer lead to public opinion in the republic -
most of which would probably be more relieved than angered - and offer
much-needed reassurance to the anxious majority in the north.

</HEADLINE>

Tomorrow Sir Terence Conran, the designer, opens the Butler's Wharf
Chop-house, his sixth London restaurant. It is his fourth on the site, near
Tower Bridge, owned by the failed Butler's Wharf property company - making
Ernst &amp; Young, the receiver, Sir Terence's landlord.
This juxtaposition of busy restaurants, unpaid bills and receivers is all
too common. There is hardly a food wholesaler or wine merchant in the UK who
has not had this year's profits severely dented by overdue payments from, or
the liquidation of, one or more restaurant customers. In the past 12 months
there have been 235 receiverships in the country's hotel and catering
industry. According to Val Brown, 49 years in the wine trade and chairman of
Heyman Brothers, the wine merchants, the last two years have been 'the
bloodiest on record'.
Yet many restaurants today are full and have almost forgotten that, nine
months ago, gloom and doom were the only items on the menu. Last week's
Fifth Restaurant Show in London, which attracted a record 6,000 chefs and
190 exhibitors, even had a panel discussion confidently entitled 'Planning
for the next recession'.
Such a rapid transformation from empty restaurants to busy has surprised
many chefs. When Martin Lam opened Ransome's Dock in Battersea, south
London, a year ago, his sights were low: 'My hope was merely to survive, to
break even during 1993. But when the 12 shareholders who financed my
restaurant under a Business Expansion Scheme met last week for our first
anniversary dinner, it was to celebrate a small profit.'
This type of establishment - family-run, seating 40-50 customers, and open
six and a half days a week - has been the most successful in adapting to
today's economy. Restaurants are now expected to provide good value lunches,
even for corporate clients, and more sophisticated dinners - potentially
more profitable, but not too expensive - for those living nearby. Restaurant
overheads today are too high to allow for any empty tables.
So many restaurants have been able to adapt so quickly - although many
outside city centres are still struggling - because of the restaurant
industry's structure. Although the headlines and column inches are
invariably grabbed by London's Kensington Place, the Ivy and Planet
Hollywood (which has created 350 jobs and will achieve a turnover in excess
of Pounds 15m in its first year, serving more than 3,000 customers a day),
most restaurants are small businesses. They are not the 'mom and pop'
affairs of yesteryear, but professional businesses run by husbands and wives
or, more successfully perhaps, by two or three partners who share the burden
of a business open 18 hours a day, seven days a week, and then go their
respective ways home.
Since January, several different developments have allowed restaurateurs to
feel optimistic, and enabled many restaurants to open.
The first was the spate of newspaper-led restaurant promotions, initiated by
the FT's Lunch for a Fiver, which filled restaurants during the normally
quiet first quarter of the year. This taught restaurant owners a lesson in
arithmetic - lower prices mixed with higher volume can be a recipe for
success.
Having survived the first quarter, restaurateurs had an unexpected bonus - a
wet spring and summer. When the sun shines, restaurant bookings slump, but
this year barbecues and picnics did not seem to be inviting alternatives.
According to Judy Markwick, of Markwick's restaurant in Bristol: 'Every
month has been better than the previous one since January, and the summer
was wonderful. We have learnt the importance of price, too. Our two-course
menu is down from Pounds 14.50 to Pounds 10.50 this year but overall
turnover is up 30-40 per cent.'
The continuing fall in the property market has also helped, by restricting
rises in every restaurant's major fixed cost, the rent. It has also prompted
landlords to offer rent-free periods of six to nine months, allowing several
restaurants, such as the Big Night Out in north London, to open on sites
considered previously uneconomic. One potential restaurant site in the City,
10,000 sq ft on the ground floor of a new development near Liverpool Street,
was recently offered with the first year rent free.
This development, together with the government's legislation splitting the
brewing industry from its tied houses, has given the opportunity to many
chefs, formerly employed in restaurants or hotels, to open their own
restaurants in what were once public houses. The quality of the food now
being served at the Eagle, the Gloucester and the French Dining Room in
London, for example, may set a trend for good, unpretentious food at
reasonable prices.
The fact that Christmas bookings are already running at a much higher level
than last year adds to the sense of optimism. But before December, the best
trading month of the year, there is an obstacle to be negotiated: the
November Budget. Rises in valued-added tax and indirect taxes would
immediately lead to higher restaurant bills.
Many UK restaurateurs have survived the recession by cutting costs and
reducing prices - bringing them more in line with those elsewhere in Europe
and the US. A sprinkling of economic pragmatism should also enable them to
cope with whatever the Budget brings.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Truly, widely and deeply: Japan's recession is exposing
widespread structural problems in the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japan is beginning to realise that its economic problems might run deeper
than it had earlier imagined.
This is not like other recessions. Until now, Japan's postwar economic
slowdowns were caused mainly by external shocks, such as the 1973 oil crisis
or the rise in the value of the yen sparked by the 1985 Plaza accord to curb
the appreciation of the dollar.
It was as if, in previous slowdowns, the economy had broken an arm, argues a
senior executive at a leading Japanese securities house. The pain was
intense, but the body remained healthy enough to ensure a quick recovery.
This time, though, the economy has a circulatory disorder, caused both by
external shocks and internal weakness, he says. A cure will therefore be
harder to find and convalescence will take longer than in the past.
A look at some of the latest indicators supports this diagnosis:
Gross national product shrank by an annualised 2 per cent in the second
quarter of this year. GNP in the current quarter is probably in decline too,
which means Japan has slipped from an economic downturn into full recession.
Most private-sector economists believe growth for the full year will be less
than 1 per cent, the fourth year running in which the pace of growth has
slackened.
The previous occasion GNP faltered, in 1986, the economy recovered smartly
in the following year. This time, recovery will come at the earliest in the
second half of the tax year to March, according to official forecasts. Some
private-sector economists believe recovery could be as far as a year away.
Last week, the government reported a 2 per cent annualised fall in
industrial output for August, down for the 23rd consecutive month, the
longest decline on record. Inventories of unsold stocks continued to rise,
by 0.7 per cent, the fourth monthly increase in a row.
The jobs market shows no sign of pulling out of a two-year slide,
illustrated by a fall in the number of jobs on offer to 70 per 100
applicants in August, from 72 in July, according to the Labour Ministry.
Consumer confidence remains weak, with a 4.2 per cent decline in department
store sales in August, the 15th month of decline, says the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry.
Companies will cut capital investment for the fourth year running in 1994,
according to the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, raising worries that
industry's capacity to respond to an upturn in demand will be diminished.
The external pressures at work on the economy are well-known. The yen's more
than 20 per cent rise against the dollar this year has saddled corporate
Japan with heavy foreign exchange losses, Y1,000bn this year for the car
industry alone, estimates Mr Yuichi Nakamura, president of Mitsubishi, the
electronics goods and car group.
On top of this, industry faces a downturn in demand at home and in most of
its main export markets, even in fast-developing China. The weakness of the
domestic economy means demand for imports is sluggish, with the result that
the trade surplus continues to rise, so pushing the yen higher.
As if that were not enough, evidence is mounting that the recession has
uncovered structural problems in the economy that had been hidden by the
steep rise in asset values that came to such an abrupt halt three years ago.
The new coalition government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa has recognised this and
done almost everything it can to stimulate growth. That includes
deregulation measures, a Y6,150bn package of infrastructure spending and
business loans. The Bank of Japan has helped with a three-quarter percentage
point cut in official interest rates to a new low of 1.75 per cent.
The only thing Mr Hosokawa has not yet been able to do is to respond to
corporate pressure for a cut in income tax, seen as a vital stimulus to
depressed consumer spending.
On the question of income tax cuts, the fragile coalition is deadlocked. The
Social Democratic party, the largest coalition member, has refused to accept
a rise in sales tax to fund any cut in income tax, which is seen as
essential by most of its government partners and the powerful Ministry of
Finance.
A compromise could emerge by the end of the year in the shape of an
immediate income tax cut, to be funded by a rise in sales taxes in two
years.
Corporate Japan's recognition of its structural weaknesses is evident in the
speed with which it has acted to cut capacity, by contrast with previous
short dowturns, when many companies preserved capacity and continued to
invest in hope of better times.
The reduced capacity has brought a wave of job cuts, unprecedented in
postwar times. This has provoked widespread fears that corporate Japan's
tradition of jobs for life will break down. 'The time of employment
insecurity has come,' warns a recent headline in the Asahi Shimbun, a daily
newspaper.
Cost-cutting by companies entered a new phase last month when NTT, the
telecommunications group and a pillar of the industrial establishment,
announced that it wanted to shed 10,000 staff, through voluntary retirement,
by next year.
As expected, NTT's move further undermined the 'jobs for life' ethos and
encouraged others to follow; Toshiba is to cut 5,000 jobs, Honda 3,000, and
Kawasaki Steel 3,200.
Most of these job losses will take place over three to five years.
So far, Japanese companies have managed to avoid making widespread
redundancies, relying instead on natural wastage. This has helped keep the
unemployment rate steady at 2.5 per cent in August, but this figure excludes
the variously estimated 800,000-1.2m employees who are surplus to companies'
needs but are still kept on the payroll. How much longer their hard pressed
employers, many facing a fourth year of profits decline, will be able to
afford to retain so many surplus staff is uncertain.
The job market's weakness is a symptom of wider change in the industrial
economy, as reflected by the continued shift of manufacturing capacity out
of Japan to cheaper locations in south-east Asia.
Japanese companies' decision to relocate manufacturing to low-cost sites
overseas is a response to the rise in the value of the yen and the long-term
general pressure on costs as their markets mature. This trend, strongest in
the consumer electronics and car industries, clearly cannot be reversed once
the domestic economic recovers.
These developments have fuelled a debate on which new industry, if any, will
provide the fresh engine of growth to compensate for the maturity of the
consumer electronics and car sectors. Japan's postwar success in planning
shifts in industrial dominance from textiles to shipping, then to cars and
electronics, is being put to a fresh test. Planners at Miti and at a special
government panel are working overtime on this question. There are no clear
answers yet.
Another structural weakness revealed by Japan's recession is the sclerotic
state of the banking system. Banks are still scarred by the collapse in
asset prices that came with the start of the downturn. This left banks with
heavy bad debts, in some cases worryingly concentrated with a handful of top
customers. A sharp decline in new lending which began three years ago shows
no signs of easing.
Officially, bad debts account for 3 per cent of the leading banks' loans,
though the proportion rises to nearly 10 per cent if the more stringent US
definition of what constitutes a bad loan is applied, says Ms Alicia Ogawa,
investment analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia, the securities house.
The economic consequence of all these structural problems - the surplus
workforce, the industrial economy's maturity and the banking system's
weakness - is to diminish Japan's future growth potential.
When consumer and corporate confidence does recover, probably some time in
the second half of next year, Japan will settle down to an average annual
growth rate of 2.5 per cent-3 per cent, compared with 3.5 per cent-4 per
cent in the 1980s, forecasts Mr Peter Tasker, chief strategist at securities
house Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo.
Most economists agree with him. So do Japanese companies, as reflected by
their cuts in capital investment and capacity. Whether they have cut too
much is questionable. But one thing is certain. Japan will emerge from
recession to face unprecedented challenges to the economic priorities that
have assured its success for the past 30 years.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Ageism in the workplace
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AGE DISCRIMINATION is rife throughout the European Community. That is the
conclusion of a spate of reports published this year as part of the European
Year of Older People, the most recent by the pressure group Eurolink Age.
Top of its list of villainy is the practice of targeting employees over 50
for redundancy and retirement programmes. Also criticised are job
advertisements specifying that candidates must be below a certain age -
sometimes as young as 35.
The current interest in age discrimination is welcome. Ageism not only
unfairly curtails individual opportunity. It will also become increasingly
economically wasteful, as Europe's population ages. Older people capable of
contributing to society may instead become a burden.
The Eurolink report blames older people's restricted employment
opportunities largely on discriminatory attitudes. Too many employers
believe that old people are not up to the job. There is also a widespread
belief that older people's jobs are more expendable than young people's.
Although some people lose their ability and enthusiasm to work in their 50s,
it is unfair to lump all older people into that category. Moreover, the idea
that old people's jobs are more expendable than young people's rests on the
assumption that economies have a fixed amount of work which must be
rationed. This is fallacious, because in the long run more workers create
more wealth which in turn creates more jobs. If people are fit, productive
and want to work, age should be no bar. Instead of standard retirement ages,
people should be free to agree with their employers when to retire according
to their personal circumstances.
Declining industries
But discriminatory attitudes are not the only, or even the main, factor
restricting older people's working opportunities. Take the sharp decline in
employment rates among males aged 55-64 in most European Community countries
during the 1980s. In the UK the rate fell by 12.2 percentage points, in
Spain by 14.8 points and in France by 21.6 points.
Part of the explanation is that older people are being targeted for
redundancy, but there are other reasons. Older workers are
disproportionately concentrated in declining industries such as steel,
mining and textiles. Meanwhile, many higher-paid workers are only too glad
to retire early. Provided they do so willingly, this trend should be
welcomed rather than resisted.
Even where older people are forced out of work against their will, it is
often simplistic to point at discriminatory attitudes. Is it credible that
companies are sacking masses of productive workers out of prejudice? A more
plausible explanation is that institutional arrangements give them an
artificial incentive to do so.
Cheaper youngsters
One such arrangement is the seniority system, under which older employees
are commonly paid more than younger workers. As a result, it is often
financially rational for companies to retire older staff and replace them
with cheaper youngsters. This incentive is compounded by the structure of
many company pension schemes, which require employers to fund greater
entitlements for older workers. The fact that such pay-offs can often be
financed tax-free makes them all the more attractive to employers.
Pension schemes can undermine opportunities for older people in other ways
too. If pensions are based on final salaries, employees have a strong
disincentive to move to part-time work as they get older even if they would
prefer phased retirement to a sudden exit from the workforce. Phased
retirement is also deterred by rules in some countries that prevent people
drawing pensions while working.
An assault on age discrimination should certainly aim to change attitudes.
But it is doubtful that altering attitudes on its own would substantially
expand older people's job opportunities unless companies also had a
financial interest in employing them. The best way of achieving that is
through institutional changes such as making pension and retirement
arrangements more flexible. This is where governments, companies and unions
should focus their efforts.

   THE WARBURGS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The 20th-century odyssey of a remarkable Jewish family
By Ron Chernow
Random House, Dollars 30, 820 pages
The Warburgs were a wonderfully talented and creative lot. Paul, a partner
in the US investment house of Kuhn Loeb, provided an original blueprint for
the US Federal Reserve. Aby's work on iconography left a lasting mark on art
history and, courtesy of the Nazis, on London, which acquired the Warburg
Institute. Siegmund, founder of SG Warburg, did more than any other
individual to revive the fortunes of the City of London in the postwar
period.
Members of the family were also around - and were heavily scarred,
financially and psychologically - when many of the great historical
upheavals of the 20th century took place. The Hamburg-based bank, MM
Warburg, whose Jewish partners were fierce German nationalists, lost most of
its capital in the first world war and its name in the second; Max Warburg
served on the German reparations delegation at Versailles and was
subsequently excoriated in Nazi propaganda for a settlement that he did not
support.
Jimmy of the New York Warburgs advised, then fell out with, FDR at the time
of the New Deal. It was he who invented the phrase 'soak the rich' and on
whose Connecticut farm George Gershwin wrote much of Porgy and Bess while
conducting a passionate affair with Jimmy's wife. Max and Siegmund played a
courageous role in extracting Jews from Germany, with support from the rest
of the family in Scandinavia and the US. Felix, who spent years as a senior
partner at Kuhn Loeb without pretending to know much about banking, was the
pre-eminent American Jewish philanthropist of his day.
All in all, a marvellous subject for a multiple biography. Yet this
door-stopping volume by Ron Chernow makes an off-putting start to the job.
He is not helped, admittedly, by a blurb writer who accuses him of laying
bare 'the whole stormy, heart wrenching history of Jews and Germans in the
20th century' - a singularly tasteless way to talk about the Holocaust. But
the real problem is that the book is infuriatingly reticent on how the
Warburgs came by their wealth and eminence in banking.
The bare outlines of the story are that the family started as money changers
and pawnbrokers in the Westphalian town of Warburg in the 16th century. From
this they graduated into trade finance in the Hanseatic port of Hamburg.
In the late 19th century they invaded Wall Street by marrying into the
Schiff and Loeb families, thereby securing a far better US bridgehead than
the Rothschilds managed to achieve. Over a long period the family
established a network of international connections that survived the
depredations of two world wars.
Yet there is no more than sketchy detail of how Moritz, then Max, turned MM
Warburg into one of the most powerful private banks in Germany. We are not
told how the bank made the transition from trade finance to the domestic
investment banking that left it vulnerable to the aftermath of the 1929
crash. Nor again, of how, apart from force of personality, the partners of
Kuhn Loeb made the fortunes they so ostentatiously displayed. In contrast,
we are presented with very precise details of how many diamonds and rubies
Warburg daughters are given on marriage, a great deal about the furnishings
of their houses and exact numbers for the surrounding acreages.
Happily, the book is saved in the end by the unbeatable quality of the
story. The plight of the German Jews, the most heavily assimilated in
Europe, is revealingly portrayed through the fortunes of the Warburgs, whose
sense of loyalty to their country made it difficult to leave. The banks'
Jewish partners were hounded from company boards and forced to sell MM
Warburg to non-Jewish members of the staff for a song, leading to a
contentious change of name to Brinckmann, Wirtz.
Max, meantime, placed too much trust in the slippery Dr Hjalmar Schacht,
head of the Reichsbank, in his attempts to make deals for the lives and
property of members of the Jewish community. There were moral and tactical
dilemmas everywhere, not least over how to confront Nazi propaganda without
providing ammunition to the anti-Semites who attributed Germany's woes to an
international conspiracy wrought by Jewish bankers. Although Chernow raises
questions about some of the actions of Max towards fellow Jews, it is a tale
that commands sympathy and respect.
The book also comes to life when it reaches Siegmund Warburg. Here Chernow
tackles the business issues in more detail and the great dramas of
Siegmund's life - the contested takeover of British Aluminium, the attempt
to shake up Kuhn Loeb and the power struggle to put the Warburg name back
into Brinckmann, Wirtz - are rendered to good effect.
It is a warts-and-all portrait, including details of a covert romance with
the ballerina Alexandra Danilova and speculation that Siegmund and Theodora
Dreifuss, a Swiss graphologist and psychologist, were lovers.
Whatever the truth of these particular matters, Chernow's suggestion that
Siegmund sent all letters of congratulation on his knighthood to Dreifuss
seems wholly plausible. He was, in today's vernacular, a control freak, and
would have delighted in putting Dreifuss's analysis to future use.
The paradox of Siegmund is that, for all his inventiveness, he failed time
and again to get the big strategic moves right. The initial postwar assault
on Brinckmann, Wirtz was bungled through family feuding. By alienating
American members of his family, he forfeited the chance to control Kuhn
Loeb. Links with AG Becker in the US and Paribas in France went nowhere. But
in his inimitable way, he was undeniably a great banker. That much shines
through an otherwise unflattering portrait.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Public service pay figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN SHELDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The table that accompanied your report of the New Earnings Survey
figures ('Pay rises faster in public sector', October 1) provided a
misleading picture of pay increases for civil service executive officers
and, if repeated in the other examples, may explain the apparently
contradictory evidence of public sector pay movements.
Executive officers are shown to have received a pay increase of 5.2 per cent
'in spite of the fact that many key public-sector groups had been affected
by the government's 1.5 per cent pay limit when the pay data were compiled'.
The reason for this apparent discrepancy is that the pay data are compiled
in April each year, and in both years in question, the settlements were
delayed. Therefore the comparison reflects the pay settlement in 1992. It is
also distorted by compensation payments, required by law, made when the
system of service-related annual increments was abolished.
Information gathered by the Office of Manpower Economics as part of our pay
agreement showed that far from pay rising faster in the public sector, civil
servants suffered compared with the private sector in 1991 and 1992.
The office's data would have shown it in 1993, only the government prevented
publication in order to save itself further embarrassment.
On top of that, the chancellor now wants to make public servants the
scapegoats for the failings of the government's economic policy, with
extensive privatisation and a further year's wage freeze. It is an explosive
cocktail.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Measures of pension solvency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROY B. COLBRAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It seems premature for David Parsons (Letters, October 6) and others to
say the Goode committee's proposals on solvency are unworkable. Equally,
those who suggest that any problems can be solved by all the pension funds
in the country purchasing derivatives, in what would become a one-way
market, may not really have thought through the issues.
Goode has suggested a solvency test based on leaving service transfer
values. The actuarial profession would be required to tighten up its
guidelines on calculation of those values. Surely any such guidelines must
allow for a market level adjustment if the bottom falls out of the equity
market. There simply has to be a mechanism to prevent the position where
virtually all UK final-salary schemes suddenly could be technically
insolvent.
Of more concern is the proposal that solvency for pensioners should be
measured by the price of buying annuities. A surprisingly large number of
pension funds have already guaranteed increases at the lesser of 5 per cent
or the rise in prices. There is no investment available to match that
liability and mature funds with a high proportion of pensioners may well
face problems if that solvency standard is adopted.

<TEXT>
Sir, For a couple of years I have been receiving the clipped columns of your
dance reviewer, Clement Crisp. They are first read in Hosle, Norway, then
they fly to Torrington, a small Connecticut city which is the home of the
Nutmeg Ballet, a training ground for students of classical ballet. From here
the columns make their way to my colleagues: to designers, an author, a
sculptor, musicians and others.
These dance reviews breathe with the liveliness of sharp-eyed observation
and show a formidable background of knowledge and experience, a superb
communicative zest and a combination of wit and truth. Bravo to Clement
Crisp and to the publication that presents him.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Direct sales of goods and services to
Israel not subject to boycott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ANDREW STONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your recent article ('A wait for hidden fruit', September 20)
predicting the slow demise of the Arab economic boycott of Israel is timely
and can only be helpful to British exporters. They continue to be concerned
about adverse reaction from customers in Arab states who still might be
applying aspects of the boycott to their trade in Israel.
Nevertheless, your blank phrase 'companies are supposed to certify to Arab
countries that they have no dealings with Israel' may continue to reinforce
the perception of an all-encompassing boy-cott.
Our understanding, supported by the recent Department of Trade and Industry
guidelines, is that direct sales of goods and services to Israel are not
subject to any compliances.
This is apparent in the remarkable British trade record with Israel. With
its small land mass and 5m population, Israel is in the top 30 of UK
customers worldwide. Exports from the UK to Israel could reach Pounds 700m
if this year's trend of a 50 per cent increase in the first seven months
continues. This is for visible exports only and excludes the considerable
business in financial services and tourism despite the pervasive
psychological pressure of the boycott.
The DTI and our trade advisory group can offer confidential advice to
companies with residual concerns.
For many hundreds of successful British exporters, the Israel market is
already an important and successful one. The Dollars 60bn gross domestic
product contrasts starkly with Jordan's GDP of Dollars 4bn.
Hopefully, the West Bank and Gaza will now have the opportunity to develop
economically, too, giving benefits to its inhabitants and hopefully bringing
peace and tranquillity to the region. As an important trading partner,
Britain, through its world-famous exporting companies, can help this
process.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Big ideas that may bridge the gap: John Willman on
suggestions to smooth the UK private sector's involvement in public projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Private investment in large public sector projects such as new roads and
railways is seen by UK ministers as the big idea for the 1990s, as
significant as privatisation was for the 1980s.
Later this morning, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will tell the
Conservative party conference of his determination to sweep away obstacles
to involving private finance in public projects. In addition to reducing the
burden on the exchequer, he will say, private sector involvement introduces
fresh thinking and a more commercial approach into public sector investment.
Yet a report published today by the Chartered Institute of Transport says
that efforts to attract private investment into transport projects are
doomed to fail unless the government adopts a new approach.
The authors, who include builders, financiers and transport consultants, say
private sector companies see little hope of a reasonable return on financing
transport projects under Treasury rules for such projects.
'The government's approach simply won't work,' according to Professor Tony
Ridley, chairman of the group that produced the report. 'My fear is the
Treasury has simply invented a new mechanism for proving all sorts of
infrastructure projects can't be financed.'
The government's plans for involving private capital go beyond transport
projects. Ministers responsible for the health service, education, urban
development and the prison service are all searching for innovative ways to
use the private sector to provide for needs traditionally met by the public
sector.
But the biggest impact could be made in transport. While much of the
transport department's Pounds 3bn annual capital budget goes into road and
rail schemes, there is a large backlog of desirable projects the taxpayer
cannot finance. These include most of the Pounds 20bn roads programme
published in 1989, the modernisation of British Rail lines such as the west
coast line between London and Glasgow, and urban light rail projects.
According to the institute's report, only a handful of private finance
projects have got off the ground. Most have been bridges such as the
Dartford bridge across the Thames which can be completely financed in the
private sector using tolls for repayments.
However, the number of such projects is limited - mainly to estuarial
crossings where users will pay tolls to save themselves a lengthy detour. If
private finance is to be more widely used for infrastructure, the report
says, it must be drawn into projects which cannot be wholly financed in the
private sector.
That means joint ventures or co-investment, in which the government
contributes either some or most of the finance with the rest being raised
privately. The return for the private sector partner will come from payments
made for using the new road or railway. These may be raised through tolls,
track charges, fares or perhaps even shadow tolling - a payment from the
transport department for each vehicle that uses a new road.
Treasury rules make such joint ventures hard to establish, according to Prof
Ridley, because of an unwillingness to recognise that the private sector has
a choice about where it invests. Potential investors in transport projects
want the risk and uncertainty to be no greater than on alternative
investments such as power stations or new industrial plant.
Yet transport projects have characteristics that increase risk and
uncertainty. Roads and railways are fixed assets, and particularly
vulnerable to errors in forecasting demand. Demand cannot be tested with
small experiments, only by completing the project. And since use builds up
over the years, the new road or line is not immediately used at full
capacity.
'Roads are the type of infrastructure to which the private sector can bring
least added value,' says Mr Roger Sainsbury, a director of John Mowlem, the
construction company, who has worked on several transport projects. 'The
success or failure of a road is largely outside the control of the operator,
and depends more on factors such as economic performance.'
These characteristics mean that the payback period for the initial
investment is both uncertain and lengthy. Project cash flows are likely to
show low debt coverage ratios and little hope of dividends in the early
years.
To these inherent uncertainties in transport projects must be added the
risks created by the political pressures around new roads and railway lines
and the delays created by the planning process. Yet the Treasury appears to
want the private sector to assume all these risks and uncertainties, says
Prof Ridley.
'Total risk transfer scares everyone away,' he says. 'The government will
frighten off the private sector if it is too ideological about private
finance.'
The public sector's contribution to joint ventures might be lower if the
government takes responsibility for some of the elements of risk which it
can most easily control, according to Mr Richard Haycocks, a partner in the
corporate finance department of Ernst &amp; Young, the accountants. He says that
the government needs to act as the promoter of infrastructure schemes,
rather than putting the whole process out to tender and accepting the lowest
bid.
'Unlike the private sector, the government has skills in road and rail
planning,' he says. 'It also has the power to reduce risks without
significant detriment to the public interest - for example by guaranteeing
that no competing project will be built for a specified period.'
The government should also be prepared to consider some element of
indemnity, he says. For example it could underwrite a new toll road by
guaranteeing a minimum level of toll income if use falls considerably below
estimates during the first few years.
In return, the cost of private sector participation could fall
significantly, according to Mr Sainsbury.
'It would be better for the taxpayer if the government carried the ball part
of the way and eliminated some of the risks before handing it over to the
private sector,' he says. 'Ministers must recognise that there is an optimum
point at which risk can be transferred.'
A further element of uncertainty is introduced by the government's
reluctance to commit itself to transport projects, says Prof Ridley.
'Companies that devote resources to putting together their bids find that
the project does not go ahead because none of the bids is high enough to
bridge the gap between what the government is prepared to contribute and the
total cost,' he says.
This creates a no-prize competition which makes companies unwilling to bid.
'Contractors are prepared to lose competitions, but not if everybody loses.
It would be far better to decide to go ahead with a project and then find
the private sector partner best able to make a contribution.'
Mr Haycocks agrees. He says that the government needs to identify two or
three projects that it will fund as necessary and take them forward to the
point where private sector finance can be raised.
Meanwhile, the chancellor should bear in mind the advice of Mowlem's Mr
Sainsbury. If the government is serious about the private finance
initiative, it must address the private sector's principal concerns: is
there a project worth bidding for and is there a chance of winning it.
'Ministers can write the rules and mark out the pitch,' he says. 'But if the
private sector doesn't want to play, the game won't happen.'
