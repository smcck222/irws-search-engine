FT  07 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: A fifth possibility for the ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JULIAN TAPP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your editorial 'Way ahead for the ERM' (September 27), you suggested
that there were only four intellectually defensible possibilities for the
ERM. There is a fifth possibility that deserves a mention: to define the
currency bands in real as opposed to nominal terms, making the adjustment on
a monthly basis according to an appropriately defined current inflation
differential.
Such a system would produce a convergence in real, as opposed to nominal,
interest rates and would encourage counter-cyclical monetary policy rather
than the tendency of the current system to act pro-cyclically. Exchange rate
adjustments would be small, frequent, relatively predictable and immune from
political interference. High inflation countries would not be able to use
the system as an anti-inflationary anchor and would be forced to address
structural factors that gave rise to their problem. Large misalignments
would be avoided and the threat of discontinuity that speculative pressures
render self-fulfilling would be avoided.
Attention would be focused on expected rates of inflation (and
differentials) and would bolster commitment to inflation targets. Monetary
union would come about as the result of a convergence in inflation rates
rather than the misguided attempt to force a reversal of this process.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Arts: A bizarre inauguration for St John's new organ -
Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even in its days as a working church St John's, Smith Square was not graced
with an organ appropriate to its scale and position, an impressive landmark
on the 18th-century skyline of London just behind Parliament Square. One
writer remarked that its modest instrument was 'very foul and much in need
of repair'.
Two centuries later, the omission has been made good. Following its
restoration after war damage, St John's functioned well enough as a concert
hall without an organ until the past few years, when it has been building on
its reputation as a venue for choral music. An organ no longer looked a
desirable extra; it had become a necessity. An appeal was launched and
reached its target thanks to a large donation from the Sainsbury Family.
The Sainsbury organ, as it is to be known, was inaugurated with a gala
concert on Tuesday. In several ways it was a bizarre affair, if an enjoyable
one. There was no standard organ solo on the programme, but we did get
Ruggero Raimondi, who turned up to sing an Italian song with piano lasting
all of two minutes.
Meanwhile, the audience was seated with its back to the new instrument,
supposedly the star of the evening.
Those who turned round will have been impressed with what they saw. The
familiar 18th-century organ case has been retained, extended where necessary
in the same style, and restored, its pipes gleaming silver, the overall
picture a splendid enhancement to an elegantly Baroque hall. The German
builder Johannes Klais of Bonn was put in charge of producing the new
instrument and has come up with a firm, varied, authoritative organ sound.
Varied is the key word these days. A new organ has to do duty for the whole
repertoire, whether it be Bach or Messiaen, the grand French romantics or
Baroque preludes and fugues. Simon Preston, the organist for the gala
evening, chose to show off its prowess in unusual music - a triumphal march
by Francaix to start, a riotous set of variations on 'God Save the Queen' by
Charles Ives, some Tournemire and a dazzling showpiece by Joseph Bonnet.
Even after all those, the organ seemed to have new sounds to spare. It can
unleash plenty of volume as well - too much for Poulenc's Organ Concerto,
when it dwarfed the orchestra, at least from where I was sitting. Another
problem there, too: it is notoriously difficult to keep an organist and a
choir or orchestra together when they are at opposite ends of the hall. The
only answer will be to have the audience facing the other way.
These initial impressions will no doubt be enlarged, modified, possibly
contradicted, as the solo recitals get underway, led by Preston, Gillian
Weir and Daniel Chorzempa. A big additional attraction will be the novelty
of the video screen, which allows the audience to watch the organist at work
in close-up, though the players themselves may not like it. No cheating will
be possible in those tricky pedal solos at St John's.
Organ recitals this month will be on October 14 and 28 (evenings), 15 and 29
(lunchtimes)

FT  07 OCT 93 / Arts: The Piano Lesson - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The second half of August Wilson's The Piano Lesson is so good that one
immediately forgives a rather laborious first act. The last 15 minutes are
so dramatically clever that even the most seasoned play-goer is unlikely to
foresee the ending. Twice I guessed wrong.
When the gun is barely concealed in the lady's dress, I thought there would
be a shooting, probably fatal. When the shooting was diverted by a drunken
entrance stage right and the drunk proceeded to play the piano that is at
the centre of the play, one wondered, knowing that the three hours were
almost up, what on earth could happen next.
As it turns out, divine intervention. Yet as the preacher exorcises the
house and the piano, it is a reasonable assumption that the instrument which
has been so rooted to the floor that not even grown men can move it, will
become suddenly lighter. That does not happen either. Wilson's Piano Lesson
ends happily, even sentimentally.
Sentimentality, however, is no longer the dominant note, as it was in his
play Fences, which was shown in London three years ago. Wilson is a black
American playwright who writes mainly about blacks and has won most of the
American theatre prizes. The evidence of The Piano Lesson suggests that he
is up with the best, alongside Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller and David
Mamet.
It is Pittsburgh 1936, then not a bad place for blacks to live compared with
the American south. At least there are jobs and prospects. One of the
residents of the house works on the railways, enjoys wearing his uniform and
travelling across the states. The widowed Berniece takes a pride in owning
the house, working and bringing up her daughter who might go in for
teaching.
The problem is a mixture of the piano and the arrival of relations from the
south, notably the Boy Willie. Willie is the brother of Berniece. He wants
to sell the piano - a hugely ornate affair, though an upright  - in order to
buy land back home. Berniece resists: the piano is the most prized
possession that the family, such as it is, has ever had. In the past it had
been exchanged for 1 1/2 niggers: one grown-up, one child.
Wilson takes too long to set out the background. Yet, once it is
established, there are some masterly scenes. Berniece, played by Cecilia
Noble, is a very attractive and intelligent woman. She is not madly keen on
coming out of her widowhood to marry the preacher Avery (Danny John-Jules),
but comes tantalisingly close in the middle of the night, when much of the
action takes place, to falling for one of her brother's friends.
This friend is called Lymon, played by Cyril Nri. He is not very bright and
takes a childish delight in being sold a white silk three-piece suit with
silk handkerchief and white and brown two-tone shoes to match. He buys a
perfume that he is told is worn by the Queen of France, then gives it to
Berniece.
In the marvellous second act, there are other felicities, not least in the
twists and turns of the plot. There is also feeling. The play is directed by
Paulette Randall and designed by Poppy Mitchell. If you cut the first act by
20 minutes, it would be the highest professionalism all round.
Tricycle Theatre, London NW6, until October 31. (071) 328 1000

I have greatly enjoyed Plain Tales from Northern Ireland(BBC 2, 8.00), the
series about rural life in Northern Ireland by writer and producer Carlo
Gebler. Each film has been admirably understated, unhackneyed, and
illuminating. Tonight is the last film, about a border village where it is
the start of the duck-shooting season at the local gun-club. Catholics and
Protestants take an innocent pleasure in a day's shooting.
Last year there was a ghastly incident when a grizzly bear ate a camper so
it is good to see them getting a better press on Living Dangerously:
Grizzly] The Bear Facts (BBC 1, 8.30). The camera films them catching salmon
underwater.
I hold the minority view that dogs are not honorary humans and ought to live
in kennels. The Dog's Tale (BBC 2, 9.30) is better tonight. Surprisingly,
the Dalai Lama appears, talking about reincarnation and his dog, and in the
parish of San Rocco in Italy, they honour the dog who befriended the plague
saint. However, hagiologists know that French Catholics did once venerate a
dog-saint, St Guinefort.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Arts: Simply horribly funny - Cinema
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAINING STONES (15) Ken Loach
THE YOUNG AMERICANS (18) Danny Cannon
HARD BOILED (18) John Woo
Ken Loach's Raining Stones is a comedy about misery: something the English
do better than anyone else. Perhaps it is the weather. Perhaps it is
Britain's post-imperial national mood: all that lost pride swilling around
like poison. Or perhaps it is just the British ability to keep getting
turned down for the Olympics.
In scene one, somewhere near Manchester, the hero Bob (Bruce Jones) is
limbering up for his own unique athletic event, sheep-stealing. Bob is an
unemployed fortysomething failing to make ends meet. His friend Tommy is the
dumpy, bespectacled ideas-man (Ricky Tomlinson of the famous Riff Raff bath
scene) who helps him urge the piece of live mutton into Bob's van. Then,
having transformed it into choice cuts off-screen, the two men hawk it
around the local pub. Only problem: while they are doing so Bob's uninsured
van is stolen from the pub car park.
Thus begins the breezy catalogue of disasters. In a Ken Loach film the
following truths are self-evident. Few men have any money; few men have a
job; and if a Loach hero followed Norman Tebbit's advice to get 'on his
bike' he would promptly have his bike stolen. Raining Stones is scripted by
former Loach collaborator and Play For Today veteran Jim Allen, who must
have been asked to report to the set with three jokes per page. The hero's
misfortunes are horribly funny, except in one scene when they are simply,
searingly horrible. (A moneylender barges into his home to terrorise his
wife: 'Take the rings off]' he says, addressing her knife-threatened
fingers).
Mostly, Loach and Allen let comedy do the business both cautionary and
caustic. Since Bob is a born loser whose empty head fills up with the first
predatory propagandisings to come along, he is a semi-devout Catholic. He
wants to buy his daughter a communion dress (cost Pounds 115) and this
insignium of pride and purity must be acquired by any means, however
shamefaced or impure. From rustling sheep our hero advances to stealing
turves at the Conservative Bowling Club, cleaning out the drains at the
church and coaxing his wife into reluctant seamstress work. (She handles a
sewing-machine much as a dog handles a bicycle.)
Bruce Jones, his face like a wounded croissant, makes Bob's mixture of
dimness, obstinacy and sweet nature irresistible. His communion lessons to
daughter are a masterclass in daffy scholarship: ''E takes a piece of bread
and 'olds it up to 'is mates' is his summary of Our Lord's activities at the
Last Supper. And when the daughter later shows who is the real moral boss by
lending Dad a much-needed tenner, he promptly bursts into tears after she
has left the room.
The movie gets tough when it is time to. Bob is involved in a violent death,
and for a few bizarre but persuasive minutes the film is possessed by the
dark spirit of urban verismo. But this is world where lunatic optimism
always returns to beat back reality. The priest pats our Bob's shaking hand
and mouths some doubtful scriptural bromides; and Bob moves off, not much
sadder and certainly no wiser, to his daughter's Communion.
Bad Loach movies (Fatherland, Hidden Agenda) deal out denouements, showdowns
and Messages. Good Loach movies - The Gamekeeper, Riff Raff, Raining Stones
 -rejoice in life's confusions and contusions and offer ironic sympathy as
the only band-aid. These films are about the mixed blessings of
self-knowledge: especially in a hard-up world where energetic befuddlement
and instinctive camaraderie often provide the best protective layer between
outside world and inside awareness.
'I didn't expect everyone to be so polite,' says New York police detective
Harvey Keitel on landing in Scotland Yard. Why not? Has he not seen
Brannigan, The Mackintosh Man and a dozen other
yankee-in-Queen-Elizabeth's-court crime movies? The Young Americans brings
its Stateside law-enforcer to London to assist the natives in their
international drug traffic problems, and to be bemused in his turn by
people's tendency to say 'How was your flight?' instead of 'Siddown' or
'Whaddyawannaknow?'
Not that this politeness lasts long. Soon Keitel is being strobed by East
End discos, threatened by cockney crime barons and gnawed by anxiety when he
sends in a young apprentice supergrass (Craig Kelly) to grab incriminating
evidence on the suspected Mr Big (Viggo Mortensen).
The British writer-director is Danny Cannon, a National Film School
graduate. He smothers the film in high-concept gloom as if still doing his
second-year school exercise, 'How to make a film noir without cutting off
all the lighting sources.' There are dark streets strafed by backlighting;
dark basement homes illuminated by a single grungy window; dark, flicker-lit
dance clubs where a hundred extras trip the light epileptic.
What there is not, amid the acres of moody style, is a compelling story.
Narrative momentum is constantly sabotaged by Cannon's wish to pile in as
many subplots as possible to please the American market he seems to be
aiming for. Here an interracial love affair (Kelly's with his black
girlfriend), there a crumbling marriage (Keitel's with his end-of-phone
wife), somewhere else the wit and wisdom of a veteran 'godfather' (Terence
Rigby). No wonder the two best-known UK actors hugging the top of the cast
list - Iain Glen, John Wood - have time for about four lines each of
true-Brit dialogue before vanishing into the gloom and confusion along with
everything else.
The Hong Kong action film Hard Boiled has no fears about losing its
characters. Its set aim is to dispose of them all as fast and spectacularly
as possible. The checklist of weapons includes: knives, handguns, submachine
guns, rocket-launchers, electric cables, crashing ceilings, burning
hospitals and intercontinental ballistic dialogue. (Exclamatory Chinese
interspersed with suddens spasms of B-movie American).
If all this does not take care of the arms-running gangsters who have
attracted the adverse attention of our hero Inspector Yuen, nicknamed
'Tequila' (Chow Yun-Fat), there is always Yuen's undercover ally Tony (Tony
Leung). He has startling powers of survival. Shoot him, beat him up, stab
him, electrify him and he still comes back smiling and firing.
The man responsible for this insanity is writer-director John Woo. You have
to admire his effrontery as one hard-to-top shoot-out is topped by another,
and as the violence itself is finally topped by an outbreak of high-kitsch
sentimentality in the newborn babies' ward. As mayhem bursts around them,
the tots are scrupulously rescued by 'Tequila' and his girlfriend (Teresa
Mo). Our hero even takes the trouble to stuff the babies' ears with cotton
wool and to avert their eyes ('Hey] X-rated action]') whenever his gun-hand
comes into play. Hard Boiled is 100 minutes of movie violence redeemed by
its total remoteness from real life: unless we are to take the date in which
Woo's story is set - 1997 - as an earnest prediction of life in Hong Kong
after that fateful changeover.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Technology: Copy-proof strip takes swipe at fraudsters - A
specially coded magnetic channel on plastic cards should increase security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL KENWARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For his party trick, Simon Willcock will copy your credit cards. With a
device twice the size of a mechanical card reader, he transfers the data on
the magnetic strip from one card to another.
His box of tricks is made of perspex so that you can see it contains nothing
more exotic than some tape-recorder heads and simple electronic circuits.
With more sophisticated equipment, Willcock can show you just what data sits
in the magnetic strip on your card. Mostly, it is a seemingly meaningless
sequence of numbers and letters in three parallel 'recording channels'.
Willcock does not counterfeit cards for a living; he wipes clean any copies
he makes with a powerful magnet. He does it to demonstrate the vulnerability
of conventional credit cards.
The party trick is part of a demonstration put on by the Central Research
Laboratory of Thorn EMI, where Willcock heads the magnetics division. CRL
has a vested interest in raising doubts about the security of credit cards:
it has developed a technology that it claims makes it impossible to
duplicate cards.
The Watermark Magnetics technology - so-called because it leaves a permanent
'fingerprint' and is as hard to copy as the watermark in paper - is a
growing business for Thorn Secure Science International (TSSI). As credit
card fraud grows, more and more banks are turning to the company for its
copy-proof magnetic strip.
Since adopting Watermark in the mid-1980s, banks in Sweden have seen the
disappearance of 'phantom withdrawals' where money goes missing from an
account, despite customers' claims that they did not use their cards. TSSI
has just announced the first UK trial with standard Visa payment cards; this
will involve 30,000 cardholders in the Northampton area. The Korean Phone
Card Company has used Watermark since the Seoul Olympics in 1988.
CRL's technology also uses a magnetic strip, but one with a fourth recording
channel. This channel is different magnetically from the conventional
recorded strips that make up the other three channels. It contains 'hard'
data that cannot be erased or copied. 'Whatever you do, you can't get rid of
it,' says Willcock.
Watermark's fourth track carries data that is unique to each card. Just as a
paper watermark is 'written' into the fibres of the paper, so CRL's magnetic
mark is embedded in the strip's 'magnetic domains'. Unlike the domains of a
recording tape, which point along the tape, the domains in CRL's stripe, its
magnetic particles, are at 45 degrees to the tape.
The magnetic domains in one length of tape can point in one of two
directions, with some particles pointing one way, while particles in other
stretches of the tape are at 90 degrees to them. A specially designed tape
reader can detect where the strip goes from one direction to the other. By
arranging these short stretches in a predetermined way, the tape-maker is
effectively creating a special pattern that shows up as a unique sequence of
numbers and letters. From its production plant in Swindon, TSSI delivers to
its customers tapes with an agreed security sequence. The card-maker then
puts the strip on to a plastic card.
By checking for the watermark, an automated cash machine can confirm that
the card is present. With a conventional credit card there is always some
doubt about this. The user's personal identification number (Pin) is
supposed to verify this, but with cards so easy to copy, customers can argue
that a transaction had nothing to do with their card.
While credit cards are an important market for CRL's technology, it has also
found a role in security systems. The Ministry of Defence already employs it
in its Central Headquarters Office Technology System. Before gaining access
to the MOD's electronic mail, users have to insert their 'Watermarked'
cards. And those cards have to stay in place throughout the session.
A further use is in pre-paid cards, for phone calls and transport systems,
for example. Here the risk of duplication is considerable, as it is in cards
used for gaming machines. Australian casinos have adopted Watermark cards
for this application.
If Watermark technology is so secure, why has it not caught on? After all,
it adds just a few pence to the cost of a card. The true costs of adopting a
new technology are those of changing business systems, in installing new
reading machines and registering the issue and numbers of magnetically
protected cards. Financial institutions issue more than a billion cards each
year for financial transactions alone.
On the other side of the balance sheet, fraud is a growing problem for
banks. They are looking for ways of reducing their losses. Alternatives to
Watermark's 'hard strip' include 'smart cards' with electronic chips that
hold large amounts of data. While smart cards can also reduce fraud, Thorn
EMI maintains that they are no more secure than its magnetic stripe, and are
considerably dearer.
The company forecasts a growing demand for its system. It has issued
magnetic strips for more than 500m cards, and now makes about 70m a year.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Technology: Watson is on the case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The growing number of students at Britain's universities are finding it more
difficult to keep in touch with each other. The student unions at the
universities of Brighton and Sussex are the first to try to combat the
problem with pocket pagers.
From January, students at the two universities, both sited in Brighton, will
be able to rent pagers to receive messages about student union meetings,
entertainment and information from local companies.
There will be messages broadcast to all students - which band is playing on
Saturday night, say - and messages to members of particular clubs or
societies. The pagers will also be used to carry individual messages.
Brighton was chosen as the first site for the service because the two
colleges were trying to work together, says Rosalind Macfarlane, marketing
manager of Higher Education Communication (HEC), the service provider. Other
universities will get Watson - derived from the expression 'What's On' - in
the 1994-95 academic year.
The Brighton students will be able rent the alphanumeric pagers, which can
carry messages of up to 96 characters, for Pounds 10 a term.
Jeremy Oates, director of HEC, says his aim is to make money out of the
service, and to do that Watson will need one large sponsor - possibly a bank
 -and advertising from several local companies.
Oates also reckons that the cost of the pagers will have to be written off.
'I believe we'll see the pagers go out, but I don't believe we'll see them
come back.'

FT  07 OCT 93 / Technology: Geared for economy - Fiat is bucking the trend
with its Punto, a mass-market car with six speeds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Motorists wanting to develop their left leg muscles should try out Fiat's
Punto small car, to be launched in Italy, France and Germany - three of
Europe's biggest car markets - in early November.
While most automobile makers, including Fiat itself, have been developing
increasingly sophisticated automatic transmission technologies, especially
for smaller models used for stop-start urban driving, Italy's leading car
marque has come up with an interesting alternative.
The new Punto range, which is widely seen as being as crucial to Fiat's
success as its predecessor, the Uno, was in the 1980s, includes models with
a standard five-speed gearbox as well an innovative continuously variable
transmission, due next spring. But the company has also unveiled a novel
six-speed gearchange on one the most basic and least powerful of its Puntos.
Six-speed boxes are nothing new. 'Supercars' such as the Corvette Stingray
and BMW's fast and luxurious 8-Series sports coupes already offer them to
performance-minded drivers. More recently, six-speed transmissions have
appeared on more modestly priced, but still potent, sports cars such as the
most powerful version of Vauxhall/Opel's Calibra. In a matter of months,
Fiat itself will be offering a six-speed transmission on a new,
high-performance four-wheel drive version of its sporty Alfa Romeo 164
saloon.
However, the relatively low sales volumes of the six-speed supercars mean
the gearboxes have all been bought in from specialist manufacturers, usually
Germany's Getrag, rather than being produced in-house by the car makers
themselves.
The Punto marks the first time that a mass-market car will offer a
manufacturer-built six-speed box. It will also be the first time a six-speed
transmission has been used in a car with such a small engine. The Punto
version involved has a 1100cc motor, developing just 55 hp (40 kw). In a car
likely to be chosen predominantly for city driving, where frequent gear
changes are essential, what was the point?
Nicola Malara, head of gearbox development at Fiat's car subsidiary,
explains. 'We designed the six-speed box largely for young drivers, who may
have only just passed their driving test, but want to have the sense of fun
associated with a bigger car. The six-speed Punto isn't a turbo or a car
which goes terribly fast, it's more the feeling of a sports car.'
The six-speed transmission is a marriage of marketing and technology. A
number of countries, such as Italy, limit the engine capacity of cars which
can be driven by newly-qualified drivers. Even where there are no such
restrictions, many prospective Punto buyers would not be able to afford
higher-performance cars.
The six-speed transmission is intended to let drivers get the most out of
the modestly powered engine by making them work harder themselves. 'Its
qualities are particularly evident in mixed-condition driving or going up
hills, where the driver has a suitable gear ratio for every situation,'
according to Fiat.
Frequent use of the clutch may not put off many prospective buyers just
making the transition from two to four wheels, reckons Malara. 'For those
used to driving 50cc or 125cc motor scooters, six gears are nothing new;
manufacturers have used them for some time to maximise performance.' And in
Italy, where motor racing is almost a religion, the idea of frequent, snappy
gear changes may appeal to sports-minded public. Malara thinks the model
will also catch on in Germany and Spain, where drivers also value
'performance motoring'.
But Malara denies the six-speed box is just a gimmick to draw first-time
drivers to the Punto. 'The six-speed box, if used properly, will lower fuel
consumption compared with the five-speed version.' And although its appeal
may seem limited at present, Fiat may offer the new transmission on other
small models, such as a successor to the Lancia Y10, he hints.
Either way, the company should benefit. As the six-speed box was a spin-off
from the new five-speed Punto gearbox, development costs were modest. The
six-speed transmission is only slightly heavier and required only modest
additional engineering, says Malara.
On the other hand, if the six-speed transmission catches on, the company
will have stolen a march on its competitors, who may feel obliged to develop
six-speed boxes of their own. 'We'll be ahead, and theirs won't be a novelty
any more,' says Malara.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Accountancy: Portion of Cadbury may taste more bitter than
sweet - Andrew Jack wonders whether proposals for internal controls are
focused in the right direction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of copies of an unlikely bestseller are circulating in British
boardrooms this month in a sale driven by fear. The text is one which could
test executives' powers of imagination with words as much as accounting
standards have, in the past, challenged their creative use of numbers.
After a tortuous period of gestation through more than 17 drafts, the
working group on internal control has produced a weighty document designed
to provide directors with advice on developing and commenting on effective
financial controls.
Internal Controls and Financial Reporting runs to 70 pages of tightly-packed
text, ranging over six chapters and six appendices. It was chaperoned by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, with six chartered
accountants drawn from business and the profession as members.
Few can have expected all this work to have been spawned by a few almost
throw-away lines in the report of the Cadbury committee on the financial
aspects of corporate governance, issued last December. Cadbury recommended
that 'the directors should report on the effectiveness of the company's
system of internal controls', and called on the accountancy profession to
develop the 'necessary guidance' to allow this to take place.
Businesses would be foolish to ignore the document, however tempting that
might be. If and when it is ever approved, it will become an essential part
of the recommendations in the Cadbury code. Listed companies will be
required to provide a statement on internal controls. Failure to comply
could result in action by the Stock Exchange.
On the whole, the guidelines manage to do an effective job of sketching out
the background to the subject and highlighting issues to consider. The
document defines internal controls as systems established to provide
reasonable assurance of effective and efficient operations, reliable
financial information and reporting, and compliance with laws and
regulations.
It says controls are needed in order to comply with the law, act as a
mangement response to growing corporate size and complexity, and provide a
means for boards to identify and evaluate risks for the prudent operations
of the company on behalf of shareholders.
It argues that internal control structures have four separate 'elements'.
The first is the control environment, fostered by the board for all
individuals in a company to take the subject seriously. The second is the
identification of risks, control priorities and objectives. Third is control
activities: the policies and procedures to ensure that the objectives are
achieved. Fourth is monitoring and corrective action.
All these points seems very logical, desirable and even patently obvious -
on paper. They reflect an increasing focus on internal controls, not least
that highlighted in a paper earlier this year by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of Scotland, which sees a far greater role for internal auditors
in place of external auditors in the future.
The most vocal, and effective, critic of the internal controls proposals has
been the Hundred Group of leading finance directors. Following dire warnings
of 'corporate overload' generated by a raft of new proposed guidelines
issued in the last few months, the group recently gained agreement for
greater consultation, co-ordination and delay.
Partly as a result, the document, which was originally due in June, has only
just been released, and is now out for consultation until the end of next
February. That means if it ever finally appears, it is unlikely to be in
place for reporting by companies with year-ends before the end of 1994.
In a speech last week, Mr Nigel Stapleton of Reed Elsevier, chairman of the
Hundred Group's technical committee, urged standards-setters to 'make haste,
carefully', arguing there were too many peripheral issues under discussion,
with guidelines often inadequately drafted.
The danger is that companies - many already with good internal control
systems - will be saddled with substantial additional costs to report on
internal controls, while those without will still be able to slip through
the net and avoid fairly reporting on the state of their systems.
It is tempting to dismiss these criticisms as self-interested attempts by
boards to save costs and evade efforts to make them more accountable. That
would be far easier to do if those taking the alternative, working party
line were entirely dispassionate. But they are not.
The accountancy firms have been cashing in on Cadbury in a big way. It came
as no surprise that publication of the document last week was immediately
welcomed by KPMG Peat Marwick and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, for instance. KPMG,
Arthur Andersen and Touche Ross have all recently produced booklets on the
topic.
While calling for greater attention to internal controls, the firms have
been aggressively marketing their advice to steer companies through the
confusion caused by the fall-out from the corporate governance movement.
In the longer term, some of the firms are estimating that ensuring companies
are complying with the Cadbury code - notably on internal controls and
whether it is a 'going concern' - will add between 10 per cent and 25 per
cent to the annual audit fee.
As the working party document says, most companies will need to review their
internal control systems as part of the process of generating their
statement of compliance with the code. For smaller companies, one accountant
estimates that will typically cost several thousand pounds in consulting
fees to write systems. What is unclear is how far this will be a paper
exercise to satisfy the auditors rather than something which genuinely adds
value.
In a chapter on the statement that directors will be required to make, the
working party urges that the wording should be free-ranging rather than
adhering to a formulaic 'boiler plate', something which is sadly the norm in
auditors' reports. It wants directors to list 'reportable weaknesses' which
have been discovered, and describe remedial action being taken.
If it worked, such text would provide wonderful information for readers of
accounts, not least journalists. But it would also mark a remarkable change
in the normally bullish texts available up till now, and leave boards
feeling exposed and more vulnerable to legal action than a standardised form
of words.
Guidance is now being developed by the Auditing Practices Board on how
auditors would verify the statement. But it is unclear how detailed this is
likely to be and what would happen if there was disagreement between
auditors and directors over the state of internal controls.
Boards would clearly do everything possible to prevent a qualification in
their accounts driven by disagreement on the topic. Yet the recommendations
seem to leave little room for them to conceal the sins of the past, since
they are being required to own up to weaknesses and say how they are making
amends. That contrasts with accounting standards which allow for disputes to
be resolved and policies changed following discussion with the auditors but
without any public statement.
This would suggest that boards will impose greater pressures on their
auditors not to qualify their statements - on pain of loss of audit fee or
job. And, unlike with the Financial Reporting Review Panel for accounting
standards, auditors would not have the power of an external regulator party
to the discussions with which to threaten compliance.
As a result, the statement on internal controls runs the risk of being
costly but worthless.

FT  07 OCT 93 / People: Hesketh's political weight entices Babcock's board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lord Hesketh, right, who resigned last month as government chief whip in the
House of Lords, has joined the board of Babcock International as a
non-executive director.
The appointment is a further move by Babcock to strengthen its non-executive
line-up.
In January, Alan Wheatley, who was then chairman of 3i, the venture capital
group, joined the board of the engineering contractor, facilities management
and materials handling group.
While Wheatley was attractive to Babcock for his City contacts, Lord Hesketh
will bring additional talents to the Babcock team, said Lord King, chairman.
'Lord Hesketh has extensive national and international experience,
politically and commercially, including a period as minister of state in the
Department of Trade and Industry where he was highly regarded by those in
industry who worked with him,' said Lord King.
Engineering ventures are not unknown to Hesketh, who has in the past
interested himself in ventures such as Formula One motor racing and an
attempt to set up a motorcycle manufacturer.
The appointment of Hesketh, 42, comes in the same week as Mr John Parker
takes over as deputy chairman and chief executive at Babcock, and Mr Nick
Salmon joins as group managing director. A further non-executive appointment
is likely.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Shoppers make up for
lost time - Judy Dempsey on the enthusiasm for direct selling in eastern
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until 1990, eastern Europe was terra incognito for Jonas af Jochnick. As
chairman of Oriflame, the Brussels-based cosmetics firm, af Jochnick
concentrated on direct selling throughout western Europe, Mexico and Chile.
But once the communist regimes collapsed in eastern Europe, he jumped at the
opportunity to start selling in a region which had been starved of consumer
goods.
His first venture was in Poland. Instead of exporting his wares to the
country, af Jochnick took a gamble. He bought Karmeila, a Polish cosmetics
factory, and has never looked back. In just three years, Oriflame has
blossomed in Poland. It now has more than 50,000 sales assistants who spend
their time criss-crossing the country, encouraging Poles to buy a wide range
of cosmetics without leaving their homes.
'It has been a remarkable development,' said af Jochnick last week at the
World Federation of Direct Selling Associations in Berlin. Last year,
Oriflame's turnover in Poland and other countries in eastern Europe rose to
Pounds 6.4m compared with the previous year's turnover of Pounds 2.7m. Its
total turnover was Pounds 83.6m.
Oriflame is not the only company penetrating eastern markets in this way.
According to Paul Southworth, president of Avon Cosmetics (UK), direct
selling in the region has been successful for many reasons.
'This is a brand new market. Look, we are not talking about knocking on
people's doors and doing the hard sell, which is often the image associated
with direct selling,' he said. 'It has become much more sophisticated. We
market the products and services to consumers away from the business
premises, primarily in their homes, so that people have time to talk and
choose.'
Moreover, the likes of Oriflame and Avon reckon consumers do not have the
inclination to travel to big cities such as Warsaw, Krakow and Gdansk, where
the country's fashionable department stores and boutiques are concentrated.
'We are there on the spot,' says Southworth.
WFDSA members agree that the eastern Europe consumer can be put off by the
barrage of television and newspaper advertising at a time when most
countries are facing high unemployment.
Af Jochnick has tried to overcome this problem in three ways. He makes sure
the consumer can afford his products - through careful market research. In
addition, his staff, mostly women, are hired locally, which means that
customers are not intimidated by the thought of a foreigner stealing his or
her job.
More importantly, the brochures are all in the local language. 'The consumer
can see that we are catering to their needs, and that we are giving
employment,' explains Southworth. The company already has 20,000 people
selling in eastern Germany, and is now targeting Poland, Hungary, the Czech
republic and Slovakia. It is even venturing into Latvia, Russia and Ukraine.
Avon has about 50,000 on the ground throughout eastern Europe, and a
turnover there of about Dollars 75m (compared with worldwide sales last year
of Dollars 4bn).
Direct selling in eastern Europe has had to overcome a number of obstacles:
bureaucracy, a poor infrastructure and conservative values, particularly
among men.
'It was difficult at first to capture the male market,' says Southworth.
'Some think cosmetics are just for women. But the younger generation of men
is much more open to buying these products. In any case, it's easier when we
send a husband-and-wife team out selling. Indeed, then men see how much
money women are earning through direct selling, and they want to do it as
well.'
Af Jochnick suppresses a sigh when he recalls the hassle with Polish
customs. 'They really know how to hold up things. The delays in bringing
some products into the country and registering them can be very
frustrating,' he explains. Sending money in and out of the country through
the banking system provokes another sigh, as does the problem of phone
lines. Oriflame has about 40 people working full-time in the Budapest
office, but it only has two phone lines. 'That's what I call overload,' said
af Jochnick.

FT  07 OCT 93 / People: New finance director for Simon Engineering
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The new team at Simon Engineering is making another move to try to reverse
the fortunes of the struggling process engineering to hydraulic platforms
group, bringing in a new finance director.
Tim Redburn, who most recently was working with David James at LEP, takes
over as finance director with immediate effect. He replaces Alan Jarvis, who
had held the post four years. Jarvis remains a director.
The appointment of Redburn, 40, is the latest in a round of changes at Simon
which began with the death earlier this year of the former chairman, Roy
Roberts.
In July Michael Davies became chairman. A month later he recruited Maurice
Dixson as chief executive, replacing Brian Kemp - who had been blamed by
some shareholders for the company's unsuccessful diversification into
environmental businesses.
Redburn faces a tough task at Simon. Last month, the group announced a
first-half pre-tax loss of Pounds 52.6m, passed its interim dividend and
said that it had breached one of its banking covenants.
Dixson said then that his main priority would be to reduce net debt from
Pounds 143m to less than Pounds 100m. Achieving this would involve focusing
on the internal control of money and reducing the cost base.
'I have brought Tim Redburn into Simon to work closely with me to restore
the group to financial health,' said Dixson yesterday.
Dixson believes Redburn is the man for the job because of his considerable
experience working with companies undergoing change and restructuring.
Before his stint at LEP, Redburn was finance director of Davies &amp; Newman,
finance director at Electron House and finance director and general manager
of Hoverspeed.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Traditional roast
yields to stir-fry - Ten years of Oxo ads have reflected the social changes
affecting British family life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Katie, the gravy supermum, hung up her apron for the last time and was
replaced by the Oxo family on British television, there were letters of
complaint from viewers.
The family featured in the new set of advertisements was too realistic for
some to stomach. Children arguing at the Sunday lunch table prompted
Disgusted of Walton-on-Thames to write: 'Such a din, the children didn't
deserve the lunch presented to them.' A Bristol viewer complained: 'It's bad
enough on the few occasions my children squabble but to have it on an advert
. . .'
This week, and 36 commercials later, the family is 10 years old and still
striving to maintain a contemporary flavour. Indeed, the development of J
Walter Thompson's campaign for Oxo's manufacturer, Unilever subsidiary
Brooke Bond Foods, tracks many of the social changes affecting families in
general over the past decade.
In 1984, a year into the Oxo family soap opera, Mum began her bid for
freedom by leaving Dad to cook a weekend lunch while she goes off on a
shopping jaunt. 'Saturday off from now on,' she declares on her return, as
he appears not to have made a dog's dinner of it.
Three years later, Mum, like most women, has a job; like most mums, the job
she has is part-time and she still carries the main domestic
responsibilities. Even though she is working late, her family will not be
deprived of nourishing food - an Oxo-enriched casserole is left bubbling in
the oven. By 1990 Mum is venturing even further afield to a Friday night
keep-fit class.
Health consciousness is also creeping in among the now-adolescent children:
in an attempt to shake off the total identification with red meat, vegetable
Oxo was launched in 1989. The TV soap has a vegetarian friend of son Nick
coming over for lunch and daughter Alison finding his veggie pal madly
attractive.
Which brings the campaign to Oxo and sex. In 1990 Nick invites his
girlfriend back for a meal while Mum and Dad are out. Their eyes meet
seductively over the gravy boat but viewers are spared further developments
as the parents return.
Two years later Nick has stayed the night at his girlfriend's flat - they
appear to spend their time preparing a risotto together. Later the same year
he is cohabiting with her.
The most recent development in this everyday story of contemporary family
life is the appearance of a wok. How many viewers would even have known what
one was 10 years ago? The increase in foreign travel and the developing
British palate have led Oxo to its latest brainwave - the International
Cube.
Nick and girlfriend, their unwedded domestic routine now firmly established,
invite his parents over for a meal and treat them to an Oxo-seasoned Chinese
meal.
The British public seems to have taken all this in its stride. The next
obvious development - babies out of wedlock - might be too much to swallow.
Will public opinion force the couple to wed? Or, in the immortal words of
the late Robert Maxwell, the time may come for the gravy train to hit the
buffers.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Not just a case of
going to the dogs - Michael Skapinker reports on a sport ripe for a modern
image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On a grim weekday afternoon, a crowd of several hundred has gathered at the
Hackney Stadium in east London to watch the greyhound races.
Robert Parker takes in the shabby wooden benches, the grubby linoleum floors
and the faded advertisements on the walls. 'It's like a time warp,' he says
of the stadium he and a group of investors acquired yesterday from the Brent
Walker leisure and property group for Pounds 5m.
A year from now, Parker says, Hackney will be the most advanced greyhound
track in the UK. Renamed London City Stadium, it will have luxury dining
facilities, corporate boxes and a children's playground.
The sport's insiders are watching Parker, a veteran racing writer and
trainer, carefully. If he succeeds, they say, he could begin to reverse a
30-year decline in greyhound attendances.
There are UK greyhound tracks with better facilities than Hackney.
Walthamstow, in north London, is regarded as one of the best, with trackside
restaurants and brightly-lit stands. Even Walthamstow, however, falls short
of what Parker has in mind. He wants jazz bands performing in the intervals
between races and the dogs greeted with a fanfare of trumpets.
'His is a venture the likes of which has not been seen in this country
before,' says Geoffrey Thomas, deputy secretary of the British Greyhound
Racing Board. As part of a master of business administration degree at
Sheffield Business School, Thomas last year wrote a dissertation on the
marketing of greyhound racing in which he castigated the industry for
offering 'a 1920s sport in a 1990s market'.
Not much had changed, he said, since greyhound racing started in the UK in
1926. Although stadiums now have more seats and more areas behind glass,
they look pretty much the same as in the 1930s. Of the 37 stadiums
controlled by the greyhound board, 23 were built before the second world
war. 'Even those built after bear a striking resemblance to their
predecessors,' Thomas said.
In its early years, greyhound racing provided the post-first world war urban
working-class with the excitement of a novel spectacle and the opportunity
to gamble legally. By the early 1930s, 18m spectators were attending
meetings annually at 220 racecourses. By 1948, attendances had reached 25m.
In the 1950s, however, the sport began its decline, dogged by doping
scandals, criticisms from animal welfare groups and, above all, the growth
of other leisure alternatives.
By 1970, annual attendances had fallen to 7m. Last year, fewer than 5m
visited greyhound tracks. Managers feared their customers were too old.
Peter Shotton, who runs two courses owned by Bass, the brewing and leisure
group, remembers a marketing exercise he did for a previous employer a few
years ago. 'I told them we needed to attract 12 per cent of new customers
over the following year because 12 per cent of our customers were going to
go senile or die.'
There are glimmers of hope, however. Research carried out in 1990 by a
tobacco company showed signs of the sport widening its appeal. Despite
Shotton's worries, the proportion of greyhound racegoers under 35 increased
from 36 per cent in 1967 to 50 per cent in 1990. The social class of
racegoers also changed, with the number in the AB category doubling from 6
per cent in 1967 to 12 per cent in 1990.
Despite the fall in attendances, greyhound racing is still the second most
popular spectator sport in the UK after football. Parker and Thomas believe
that to attract new spectators, greyhound racing needs to market itself as
an enjoyable night out rather than merely an opportunity to see dogs
running. They see an improvement in facilities as a start.
Greyhound racing has another advantage - the growing presence of women and
children among its spectators. Perhaps due to their civilising presence,
both Hackney and Walthamstow are free of the menace and aggression of a pub
or a football crowd.

FT  07 OCT 93 / People: Rustic at Cable &amp; Wireless
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The new director of corporate finance at Cable &amp; Wireless, Richard
Wainright-Lee, is a firm countryside man from his higher education -
agriculture and economics studies in 1971 - to his determination to live in
what he describes as a 'rustic Hertfordshire hamlet'.
With Barclays for 20 years, working in France and South Africa as well as
the UK, he joined C &amp; W in 1991 to develop the role of industry marketing
within the business networks division.
Reporting to Rod Olsen, executive director, finance, on the group's main
board, Wainright-Lee terms himself an 'enthusiastic part-time sheep farmer
and gamekeeper' who is - usefully enough, given his new position -
'intrigued by the implementation of innovation'.

FT  07 OCT 93 / NatWest warns on lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS are likely to be selective about which small businesses they lend to
in future and demand rewards which reflect the risks better, Lord Alexander,
the chairman of National Westminster Bank, warned last night.
He also rebuked the government for failing to ensure a stable economic
environment and said that this had led to banks charging higher margins on
loans to compensate for the additional risks involved.
Lord Alexander, in a speech at Manchester Business School, said that the
'boom and bust' economic cycle had made it impossible for banks to appraise
business plans, and rendered some lending risks 'unacceptably high at any
margin'.
His remarks follow a private initiative by Mr Eddie George, governor of the
Bank of England, who has called in senior executives of banks to discuss his
concern that the economic upturn could be stifled if they are unwilling to
lend.
Lord Alexander, who called for the government to consider a successor to the
Business Expansion Scheme, as part of a partnership of businesses and banks,
said the government and the Bank were responsible for achieving stability.
He said that while small businesses were reluctant to borrow, demand would
increase as confidence returned. Banks would have to guard against being
'shell-shocked' by recent losses, and over-cautious.
Banks would have to 'resist any pressures which may develop to relax the
canons of sound lending'. Although 50 per cent of people were reported to
believe that banks were nationalised, banks were not 'an arm of government
economic policy'.
'Small business customers are not conscripts . . . the relationship should
always be on a business footing and banks need a reward which properly
acknowledges the risk,' he said.
Lord Alexander emphasised that banks would try to encourage small businesses
to seek alternative means of funding to the traditional loan or overdraft.
He said banks 'cannot shoulder equity risk for debt reward'.

FT  07 OCT 93 / One-stop garages attract criminals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW-LOOK petrol stations, with convenience shops, car washes and video
counters, have proved a hit with consumers. But the formula has made them a
magnet for crime, according to an industry committee.
Mr Stuart Howell, chairman of the British oil industry service station
security committee, concedes that the design 'has contributed' to their
attractiveness to criminals.
'The level of business is up, the amount of money kept on the premises is up
and they have extended the range of goods they carry,' he said yesterday.
'The fact that many are open 24 hours a day also poses problems.'
A Gallup survey commissioned by the committee showed that the level of
burglaries and robberies - the two crimes of most concern to operators
because of their potential for violence - was about the same in the year to
July as that recorded by the committee's first survey in 1992. Of the 600
respondents in this year's survey, 37 per cent reported at least one
burglary and 19 per cent said they had been the target of a robbery. One
employee was killed in a robbery in the Midlands when he refused to show the
robbers where the money was kept.
The big rise, however, has been in petty crime. About 84 per cent of
respondents said they were victims of shoplifting, compared with only 59 per
cent in the previous survey, while 94 per cent reported problems with
drivers leaving without paying. A pre-payment scheme, under study in
Manchester, could be extended, said Mr Howell.
The survey also revealed increased efforts by companies to counter crime.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Business registrations rise sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES that the recovery is becoming better established have been bolstered
by a sharp rise in registrations of new companies.
On the basis of the figures for the year so far, 1993 is likely to see the
sharpest rise in company starts since 1987, according to Jordans, a
Bristol-based business information company.
Registrations in the third quarter were up 8.4 per cent on the corresponding
period last year. In the period between January and the end of September,
starts were 6.1 per cent higher than the same time 12 months ago.
The data, based on registrations at Companies House, apply to the UK outside
Northern Ireland.
They suggest that entrepreneurial activity is increasing and that banks and
other financial groups are becoming keener to support new enterprises after
the recession. Jordans said the figures showed a 'sustained growth' in new
companies with each month showing a rise on the corresponding month last
year.
After a quiet period in June and July, August and September have been
particularly strong months. So far this year an average of about 600 more
companies a month have been formed compared with last year.
Assuming the trend continues in the fourth quarter, this year will see the
strongest growth in company registrations since 1987, which recorded a 9.2
per cent increase on the previous year.
That happened after several years of strong growth in new companies, a
phenomenon linked to the economic expansion of the early- to mid-1980s.
However, in both 1988 and 1989, company formations rose by only about 1 per
cent, while during each of the three succeeding years registrations dropped
as the recession took its toll.
The figures have to be treated with caution, because many new registrations
may be for 'shell' companies or subsidiaries of existing ones which do not
contribute significantly to economic output. However new company starts are
believed to be a useful indicator of future levels of economic activity.
In the third quarter, 27,867 companies were registered, compared with 25,688
last year. The figure for the first nine months was 86,714, com-pared with
81,692 last year.
In both August and September, company formations were up by about 11 per
cent on the corresponding months last year.
Last year saw 108,295 registrations, the smallest total since the 104,665 in
1985. The peak year was 1989, with 130,478.
In 1990, the first year of recession, company starts were down 7.1 per cent
on the previous year, while the corresponding falls for 1991 and last year
were 9.1 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Scots aim to boost enterprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Enterprise, the development body for Scotland, yesterday launched a
strategy aimed at improving the poor rate at which Scotland generates new
businesses.
The initiative, which follows research into the causes of Scotland's low
business birth rate, is designed to bring Scotland's rate of new company
formation up to the UK average by the end of the decade. That would mean
creating 25,000 businesses. Scottish Enterprise will redirect its own
activities to focus more closely on new business generation.
The initiative, in which banks, finance houses and other organisations are
already involved, is the brainchild of Mr Crawford Beveridge, Scottish
Enterprise's chief executive. He has been perplexed by the lack of dynamism
of Scots in their home country compared with those abroad, since returning
to Scotland from Sun Microsystems in the US.
Between 1978 and 1990, Scotland created 77 companies employing more than 50
people per 1m of population, compared with 86 in the west Midlands and 116
in the south-east of England.
Mr Beveridge said yesterday that the three main reasons for the low Scottish
business birth rate were: difficulties in getting access to finance, with
would-be entrepreneurs and financiers often 'not speaking the same
language'; a lack of networking with people unwilling to discuss their
ideas; and would-be entrepreneurs being afraid both of failing and of
syucceeding.
The strategy involves the setting up of business forums in which people will
present their business projects to a panel of entrepreneurs, financiers and
business advisers.
Scottish Enterprise and its local enterprise companies are also encouraging
the creation of private-sector-led seed capital funds to invest in pre-start
and start-up projects.
It will try to persuade Scottish schools to make the idea of business more
acceptable to their pupils, and to ask the Scottish media to consider ways
of portraying business in a more attractive light.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Tourist numbers at record level
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOURIST numbers and spending rose to record levels in the first seven months
of the year, but a travel industry spokesman warned that London theatres
were missing opportunities to attract foreign visitors.
The number of visitors to the UK rose 3 per cent to 10.6m in the year to the
end of July, according to department of national heritage figures. Spending
was up 12 per cent to Pounds 4.7bn. During July spending was Pounds 1.1bn,
21 per cent higher than last year.
Mr Iain Sproat, national heritage minister, said the figures provided
'further evidence that the United Kingdom is an attractive and affordable
place to visit'.
However, Mr Stuart Crouch, chairman of the British Incoming Tour Operators'
Association, said London theatres were losing foreign visitors' bookings
through their 'arrogant attitude'.
Mr Crouch said many tour operators bringing tourists to the UK had stopped
selling theatre tickets because of the difficulties they experienced.
These included theatres marking up ticket prices by as much as 10 per cent
on telephone sales and credit card transactions. Mr Crouch said: 'What sort
of message are we giving to clients and government legislators attempting to
outlaw the worst practices of ticket touts if theatre managements are
charging additional fees over and above the face value of the ticket?'
He added that theatres were refusing to hold tickets provisionally for 48
hours pending confirmation and payment.
Farmers in Cumbria are to be offered free advice on developing tourism on
their farms, Chris Tighe writes.
About 1,000 Cumbrian farms, or 20 per cent, already have some form of
tourism enterprise. Research by Adas, the government-owned Agricultural
Development Advisory Service, indicates 63 per cent of farm tourism
operators in England see their enterprise as vitally important to overall
income.

FT  07 OCT 93 / New law will speed equal pay cases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has told the Equal Opportunities Commission that it is ready
to change the law to speed up the processing of equal pay for work of equal
value cases. There have been only 23 successful cases in the past 10 years.
The announcement came in talks begun earlier this week between the
commission and the Department of Employment on ways of toughening the laws
on equal pay. The EOC has also submitted a complaint to the European
Commission over the government's alleged failure to implement the existing
legislation.
Changes proposed by Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, include:
Requiring employers to cite one reason - rather than many, as at present -
why there is a variation in an applicant's pay with that of the comparator
which is not due to difference of sex but another 'material factor'.
Companies have been accused of time wasting by putting up their reasons one
at a time. This must be done by the employer before the preliminary review
of the case.
Accepting that each equal value claim should be subject to a preliminary
review to improve access to the judicial process. Mr Hunt will give this
'further consideration'.
Mr Hunt has turned down the commission's demand for a statutory requirement
that all employees in the same employment should be entitled to the same
award. The government argues that such a move would conflict with the system
of justice. The commission's call for full-time independent experts to
assess equal value cases has also been rejected.
Refusal to accept most of the commission's proposals has strengthened
determination to push ahead with its complaint. If the EC is unhappy with
the government's response, the case will go to the European Court of
Justice.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Council bids guide criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's new guidance on the Transfer of Undertakings (Public
Employees) regulations will allow local authorities to 'drive a coach and
horses' through competitive tendering rules, it was claimed yesterday.
Where Tupe applies, a successful bidder must take over the workforce on the
existing terms and conditions. Under proposed guidelines released last week,
if a local authority has legal advice that Tupe applies but the bid assumes
that it does not, the contractor should be invited to reconsider the bid. If
the contractor refuses to revise a bid, the authority can reject it even if
it is the cheapest.
Mr John Hall, director general of the Business Services Association, said:
'The draft guidance would allow a local authority to determine whether it
considers Tupe applies to a contract, and then reject any tenders which do
not conform to its own interpretation.'
He added: 'The uncertainty of the law is such that, for almost any given
contract, an authority could obtain a legal opinion one way or the other -
and then use this opinion to reject competitive bids. This proposal will
allow authorities to drive a coach and horses, along with their direct
services organisations, through the government's competitive tendering
policy.'
Mr Simon Brocklebank-Fowler, finance committee chair for Westminster city
council, said he sympathised with some of the contractors' points, but
disagreed that competitive tendering could not produce savings and
improvements if Tupe applied.
The Labour-led Association of District Councils also criticised the
guidelines for 'not producing any more certainty'.

FT  07 OCT 93 / AEEU points to Germany as role model
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH industry needs legally-based works councils on the German model, the
AEEU engineering and electrical union has told the House of Commons
employment committee inquiry into the future of trade unions.
The country's largest manufacturing union, in a written submission, said
greater worker involvement in running companies would help Britain compete
effectively in world markets.
'If more British companies are to be world class, it is vital that unions
become part of a wider progressive partnership. In Germany, unions play a
constructive, leading role in the works council system and British unions
would almost certainly do the same.'
The unions' 'negative confrontational history' should be discarded in favour
of a more positive, partnership approach. 'The right to independent employee
representation within the workplace should be embodied in law. This would be
a real test of how representative unions are where it matters most - at the
place of work.'
The concept of employee representation should be apolitical rather than at
the whim of a change of government. 'The present government's approach to
individual rights at work is meaningless without access to employee
representation in order that these rights may be pursued. The right to join
a union is of little use unless recognition is guaranteed.'
World class companies 'unlike the British government' see good wages and
conditions, together with a constructive dialogue with employee
representatives, as 'integral to, rather than contrary to, corporate
success'.
There was praise for the industrial relations systems in Germany, Japan and
Sweden - countries with the 'best long-term trading records in manufactured
goods that have well developed employee representation systems'.
The AEEU drew particular attention to the merits of the Rover agreement
signed by the unions last year.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Station plan may affect rail sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POTENTIAL railway franchisers yesterday argued that government plans to hive
off the majority of British Rail's 2,500 stations could make privatisation
commercially unviable.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, announced on Tuesday that he
intended to lease the 'vast majority' of stations to the franchised train
operators, with only the 13 mainline stations in the UK's biggest cities
being offered to independent operators on leases of up to 125 years.
But potential bidders and transport analysts expressed doubts that any other
stations apart from the 'big 13' would be anything but a lia-bility.
Mr Jim Steer of the transport analysts Steer Davies Gleave said that the
stations could be a 'huge liability' for the franchisers. 'They would be
tempted to run them down,' he said.
Mr Brian Kerslake, the group commercial director of West Midlands Travel,
said he thought only the large stations would present opportunities for
profit.
'The need for the franchisee to take on stations will add another problem,'
he said.
Mr Philip Snowden, the managing director of Badger Line, in
Weston-Super-Mare, said his group would welcome controlling all aspects of
passenger services from car parks to ticket sales.
'We would be wary of taking on lots of ramshackle buildings with a view to
property speculation - it's not our line of business,' he said.
The potential franchisers agreed that the fact that they would be expected
to lease stations would require the government to increase levels of public
subsidy. It added an extra 'layer of uncertainty' to the process of
privatisation which they were anxious for the government to remove.
Mr Brian Cox, of Stagecoach, in Perth, is interested in ScotRail, which,
under Mr MacGregor's proposals, would be auctioned with 300 stations. He
said 'the whole station package has become less attractive'.
However, Mr Bob Hill, managing director of the British Rail Property Board,
said that the stations offered a 'fabulous opportunity for innovative
entrepreneurial people'.
He said that the regulator and franchise director would be responsible for
ensuring the franchisers maintained a basic level of passenger services.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Mercury wins government phone contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERCURY Communications, the main domestic competitor to British Telecom, has
won the contract to manage the government's long distance telecommunications
network.
The network, tendered as part of the government's contracting-out programme,
is one of the largest private telecoms networks in the UK, serving about
250,000 civil servants in 550 government offices across the country.
Mercury won the contract against strong competition from Telstra, the
Australian state-owned operator, which recently gained a government licence
to operate in the UK. Both BT and Sprint, the US carrier, withdrew at an
early stage.
The contract, for five years from next April, is for services including
telephone, video-conferencing and mobile communications. The government
network links offices of central government departments across the country,
as well as a range of defence, health, education and security services
institutions.
The contract, which generated revenue equivalent to Pounds 13.5m last year,
is significant for Mercury, a subsidiary of the UK group Cable and Wireless.
Its other large contracts include the Trustee Savings Bank, General Electric
Company and Sedgwick Group, the insurance brokers.
Mr Mike Harris, Mercury's chief executive, said: 'Our understanding of
government requirements, outsourcing expertise and breadth of communications
services will ensure that central government has access to the latest
telecommunications solutions, offering value for money.'
Mr Graham Markey, Telstra's UK director, said he believed Mercury had won
the contract largely on price. 'But we intend to look for other
opportunities in the UK, and are keen to build up our offshore business,' he
said.
Telstra faces strong competition in Australia from Optus, a newly-licensed
operator which is also part-owned by Cable and Wireless.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Greater financial freedom for Railtrack called for
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FREEDOM from Treasury controls over public expenditure is essential if rail
privatisation is to succeed, according to Mr Bob Horton, chairman of
Railtrack, the organisation that will run the rail infrastructure from April
1994, John Willman writes.
Mr Horton told a Conservative party conference fringe meeting that Railtrack
planned to act as much as possible like a 'commercially-driven plc' and
would require greater freedom from the rigid financial limits that apply to
nationalised industries.
He hoped to attract private investment and would have to develop a
longer-term investment strategy than is possible under the Treasury's
three-year public expenditure planning programme.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Ford accused of distorting market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD came under heavy attack yesterday from the leading UK car dealer
association for 'forcing registrations' and 'distorting' the true state of
the market.
It came as figures were released showing that UK new car sales jumped by
11.7 per cent in September.
In one of the most outspoken attacks ever launched by retail dealers against
the car manufacturers, Mr Alan Pulham, director of the national franchised
dealers association claimed that 'the continuing practice by Ford of forcing
registrations distorts the true market situation and has an adverse effect
on prices and residual values'.
The association represents UK dealers selling around 80 per cent of all new
cars and includes most Ford dealers.
The retail motor industry has become increasingly concerned that the strong
rise in new car registrations could mislead the Government 'into thinking
that the car sales revival is more substantial than it in fact is'. Mr
Pullen added: 'The Autumn Budget must not increase taxes - such a move would
severely damage our fragile revival.'
The increase in new car sales in September followed the 17.8 per cent jump
year-on-year of registrations in August, the key new car sales month, which
now accounts for close to a quarter of annual UK new car sales.
According to figures released yesterday by the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders, new car registrations in September rose to
136,100 from 121,823 in the same month a year ago.
New car registrations in the first nine months of the year rose by 11.8 per
cent to 1,450,717 from 1,297,423 in the corresponding period in 1992.
Ford, the UK market leader, reacted angrily to the attack from the retail
dealers.
'We flatly deny that Ford has taken any action to distort the market,' it
said. 'The surge in registrations at the end of September is nothing
unusual. The late strengthening of the market at the end of the month is a
common feature in the UK market.'
Ford said that 27.3 per cent of new car registrations occurred at the end of
September. It claimed that some 38.3 per cent of its registrations took
place in the last five days of September, compared with 17.1 per cent for
Vauxhall, 28.7 per cent for Rover, 39.5 per cent for Peugeot, 35.7 per cent
for Nissan, 38 per cent for Renault, 40.3 per cent for Fiat, 42.6 per cent
for Citroen and 49.5 per cent for Toyota.
Nearly all the major manufacturers had dealer and customer incentive
programmes during the third quarter, said Ford, and many of these finished
at the end of September.
The US car maker offered dealers bonuses of Pounds 100-Pounds 150 per car
for every Escort and Fiesta registered before the end of September.
The franchised dealers association, which is part of the Retail Motor
Industry Federation, claimed that the pre-registering of cars by dealers or
carmakers before the vehicles had actually been sold was 'a major problem
forcing unreality into the market'.
Despite Ford's denials Mr Pulham alleged yesterday that 'Ford, and its
dealers under Ford direction, are pre-registering cars rather than selling
and registering at the same time. Theoretically the two events should be
linked. Unfortunately success is judged by market share.
'If you wish to promote your market share you increase your registrations
but not necessarily your sales on the same day.
'Somebody, either Ford or a dealer, will register a car in September, which
will then be sold in October or later. It will sit in stock with a tax disc
and an L-registration plate, and a customer will be encouraged to buy it as
a nearly-new car.'
Mr Pulham said that 'every manufacturer of any stature plays this game to
some extent and has done for many years. What we have here is an
exceptionally high level of forced sales'.
Mr Pulham claimed that 'this forcing of the market creates the nearly new
car, which then deflects the buyer from the new car market to the
nearly-new. The recovery could easily peter out'.
Mr Roger King, director of public affairs for the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders said: 'The motor industry is building from a very
low base and, coupled with declining export business to EC countries, true
recovery still seems a long way off.'

FT  07 OCT 93 / MoD official reveals details of secret unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR Ministry of Defence official yesterday gave details to the Scott
inquiry of a previously highly secretive Whitehall committee which was set
up to control intelligence on sensitive defence exports to Iraq.
According to documents made available to the Scott inquiry, the committee
handled highly sensitive information relating to defence exports that the
inquiry wishes to see.
Mr Ian McDonald, head of the MoD's Defence Exports Services Secretariat, was
asked what he knew about the Restricted Enforcement Unit which was set up in
1987 to supervise intelligence flowing between government departments.
He said he had set up the unit together with Mr Eric Beston, a senior
official at the Department of Trade and Industry, who ran the export
licensing system. The unit was intended to 'supplement' rather than to 'take
the place' of other Whitehall committees, he said.
'We thought it would be a good idea to have a small group of people who knew
each other, who had worked with each other, and who could share information
without letting it spread,' Mr McDonald told the inquiry.
The unit - drawn from Customs and Excise, and members of M15 and its sister
intelligence agency SIS - consisted of 15 to 20 people. Information was
discussed in sessions restricted to few people and in premises that had been
'swept for bugs', Mr McDonald said.
The existence of the unit first became known publicly during the trial last
year of three executives of Matrix-Churchill, the Midlands-based machine
tools manufacturer.
Copies of minutes of the unit's meetings carrying Whitehall's security
classification 'secret - UK eyes only' were released only after a judge
overruled an attempt by government ministers to suppress the documents on
grounds of national interest.
Mr McDonald is due to give further evidence to the inquiry today.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Union negotiators to present final pay offer from Vauxhall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNION negotiators will present a final pay offer from Vauxhall to their
9,000 manual members at the company, but without recommending it, after
lengthy negotiations ended early last night, Robert Taylor writes.
The company said it was proposing a two-year deal with a 2.5 per cent
increase for everyone this November and a further 3 per cent in November
1994.
Vauxhall also said it will pay out a further 1 per cent next September to
all manual workers with a further 1 per cent on top of that at the same time
if, by next July, the retail prices index has climbed to 4 per cent or more.
This is an improvement on an earlier proposal to increase the basic rate by
2.1 per cent this year and a further 2.6 per cent in November 1994.
The unions wanted a substantial offer in a one-year deal to take account of
profitability and improvements in productivity.
Negotiators have threatened a strike ballot if Vauxhall did not increase its
offer.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Labour plans to stop ITV takeovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BILL to prevent takeovers of ITV companies until 1996 was published
yesterday by Ms Ann Clwyd, shadow national heritage secretary.
She argued that unless urgent action was taken 'we could eventually see the
existing 14 ITV companies reduced to just three or four'.
The single section bill to amend the 1990 Broadcasting Act has no official
status although Ms Clwyd said yesterday she hoped it would become a private
members' bill.
The government is under considerable pressure from some of the larger ITV
companies to make takeovers easier. They believe that reform of the ITV
structure is both necessary and inevitable. Medium-sized companies which do
not want to be taken over argue the importance of regional independence.
The nine largest companies are forbidden from taking each other over. Until
next year there are also obstacles that make it difficult for anyone to take
over ITV companies.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Legendary guns go under the hammer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A PAIR OF guns that helped build the legend of the wild west went unsold
when they came under the hammer at an auction in Lewes, East Sussex
yesterday.
Neither the Colt .45 used to murder 'Wild Bill' Hickok nor the Colt .36
wielded by outlaw Jesse James - from the collection of US Colonel Carl
Breihan - reached their reserve price. It had been expected that they could
fetch about Pounds 50,000 each.
Hickok was shot during a card game on August 2 1876, by 'Cross Eyed' Jack
McCall in the Mann Saloon at Deadwood, South Dakota.

THE RULES for income tax and national insurance contributions should be
brought closer together to cut the costs to business, a government working
group said yesterday.
The group from the business community, whose report was published yesterday
by Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, said the two systems
should use the same definitions of earnings and expenses, and the
Contributions Agency should use the administrative arrangements used by the
Inland Revenue.
The group also recommended a variety of ways to change the collection of
national insurance. Mr Lilley has yet to decide which aspects of the report
to adopt.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Warning on possible Sellafield leak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GALLONS OF radioactive liquid may have leaked from waste storage tanks at
Sellafield, Cumbria, the government said last night.
British Nuclear Fuels, operator of the site, confirmed that the level of
liquid in one of seven huge concrete silos had fallen. An official from the
Pollution Inspectorate, which reports to the Department of the Environment,
was yesterday trying to establish whether a leak had occurred.
The disclosure comes at a sensitive time for BNF. The company is waiting for
a licence to start operating its Pounds 2.8bn Thorp reprocessing plant, also
on the site. The second public consultation on Thorp ended on Monday.
BNF said that if any liquid had escaped, levels of radioactivity would be
very low, 'equivalent to that which we routinely discharge to the sea'. It
had not detected any increase in radioactivity.
For the past few months BNF has been carrying out a multi-million pound
refurbishment programme on the tanks, which contain intermediate level
radioactive waste.
A final decision on Thorp is expected in mid-November.
It also emerged yesterday that the DoE has decided not to become involved in
the decision on licensing a new plant at Sellafield. The decision will be
made by Copeland Borough Council.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Dublin says peace moves have begun
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, yesterday appealed for
'restraint and patience' regarding the nationalist peace initiative from
Northern Ireland, but affirmed his government is now involved in the efforts
to bring about an end to the military campaigns of the IRA and Loyalist
paramilitaries in the province.
Answering questions in the Dail (Irish parliament) yesterday he quoted from
the recent joint statement by Mr John Hume, the leader of the Social
Democratic and Labour party, and Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader. He
said: 'It is pretty clear that it is a peace process we are talking about .
. . we are engaged in trying to find a formula for peace.' On the talks
between Mr Hume and Mr Adams, Mr Reynolds said: 'I was fully aware of the
objectives of those talks but not of the detail.'
He and Mr Dick Spring, the foreign minister, are to be told those details in
a full briefing from Mr Hume later today, and will consider the proposals
that Mr Hume and Mr Adams have come up with.
Mr Reynolds said loyalist paramilitaries in the province have declared their
violence to be reactive to that of the IRA, and that if the IRA stops its
campaign then the loyalists would stop theirs.
Mr Hume and Mr Adams have been holding bilateral talks since last April,
which Mr Hume has stated are aimed at achieving a 'total cessation of all
violence'.
Mr Reynolds attempted to damp expectations that there would be a prompt
publication of the proposals. He said: 'I want to ask for restraint and
patience from this house and the public in general. There is no overnight
solution . . . I don't think that making every detail public would be
helpful to achieving a settlement.'
He has a meeting scheduled with Mr John Major, the British prime minister,
before the end of the year, and added: 'If a further meeting becomes
necessary before then, then I shall seek one.'
The Northern Ireland Office had not fully digested the detail of Mr
Reynolds' statements last night, but a spokesman said: 'The way forward as
we see it is to get the (round-table) talks going again, and if any document
is presented to us by the Irish government then we will consider it.'
Pressed by opposition leaders as to whether the Irish government is prepared
to amend its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland, which Unionists say
is the main impediment to any progress, Mr Reynolds insisted that there will
be no unilateral move by Dublin.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Details of secret MoD unit given
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR Ministry of Defence official yesterday gave details to the Scott
inquiry of a previously highly secretive Whitehall committee which was set
up to control intelligence on sensitive defence exports to Iraq.
According to documents made available to the inquiry, the committee handled
highly sensitive information relating to defence exports that the inquiry
into Iraqi exports wishes to see.
Mr Ian McDonald, head of the MoD's Defence Exports Services Secretariat, was
asked by Lord Justice Scott and his counsel Miss Presiley Baxendale QC what
he knew about the Restricted Enforcement Unit, set up in 1987 to supervise
intelligence between government departments.
He said he had set up the unit together with Mr Eric Beston, a senior
official at the Department of Trade and Industry, who ran the export
licensing system.
The unit was intended to supplement rather than to take the place of other
Whitehall committees, he said.
'We thought it would be a good idea to have a small group of people who knew
each other, who had worked with each other, and who could share information
without letting it spread,' Mr McDonald told the inquiry.
The unit - drawn from Customs and Excise, and members of M15 and its sister
intelligence agency SIS - consisted of between 15 and 20 people. Information
was discussed in sessions restricted to a few people and in premises 'swept
for bugs', Mr McDonald said.
The existence of the unit first became publicly known during the trial last
year of three executives of Matrix-Churchill, the Midlands-based machine
tools manufacturer.
Copies of minutes of the unit's meetings carrying Whitehall's security
classification 'secret - UK eyes only' were released only after a judge
overruled an attempt by government ministers to suppress the documents on
grounds of national interest.
Mr McDonald is due to give further evidence to the inquiry today.

MR James Molyneaux, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party, gave the
strongest signal yet of his party's willingness to sustain Mr John Major's
government.
In a speech at the Tory party conference, Mr Molyneaux said there was no

In an apparent assurance to Mr Major that he could rely on the votes of the
nine Ulster Unionists when threatened by Tory backbench rebellions, he
added: 'We also take the view that a prime minister should not be evicted
from No 10 by ambitious or nerveless parliamentary colleagues'.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Vauxhall strike talks continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS were contin-uing last night to try to avert a strike ballot
over pay at Vauxhall.
Union officials were threatening to call on the motor company's 9,000 manual
workers to vote in support of industrial action if they did not receive a
substantial pay offer.
The management has proposed a two-year deal with a 2.1 per cent wage rise
next month and a further 2.6 per cent increase in November next year.
Union negotiators insist the company has the financial strength for a
one-year pay deal of 6 per cent or more. Vauxhall argues that falling demand
for car sales in continental Europe has halted its recovery in recent
months. This has led to cuts in output at the company's Luton and Ellesmere
Port plants.
However, high profits and substantial productivity improvements have helped
Vauxhall to weather the worst of the recession.

FT  07 OCT 93 / CAA chief attacks airline subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CIVIL Aviation Authority yesterday opposed calls for more state aid for
financially-troubled European airlines, adding its voice to the growing
debate over government subsidies for the industry.
Mr Christopher Chataway, CAA chairman, said state subsidies were against the
consumer's interest and threatened to undermine the European Commission's
'open skies' policy.
A committee of EC 'wise men' is investigating the problems facing the
industry and is expected to make recommendations by the end of this year.
The UK is fighting against proposals from other European countries,
including France and Belgium, to provide EC funds to assist airlines in the
recession, as well as a temporary freeze on capacity and fares. Mr John
MacGregor, transport secretary, has also attacked efforts by some EC member
countries to re-regulate the European aviation market.
Sir Colin Marshall, British Airways chairman, recently told the wise men
that restructuring should be allowed to proceed so that airlines can either
improve efficiency and competitiveness or, if they fail, go out of business.
'Clearly some further transitional help is going to be given to some
airlines who are faced with the need to make big cost reductions,' Mr
Chataway said. 'What is important is to ensure that any further short term
aid has only a short term effect.'
Strict conditions and limitations should be introduced to ensure that any
state support to an airline did not distort the longer term future of EC
aviation, he said.
The liberalisation of the market had already yielded some tangible, though
limited, results and had acted as an incentive to many airlines to reduce
costs, Mr Chataway argued. The EC reforms, in the longer term, would help
stimulate competition. But this would not happen if subsidies were allowed
to distort the market.
Even when Europe emerged from its longest post-war recession, Mr Chataway
believed any increase in competition was unlikely to be on a comparable
scale with what occurred after airline deregulation in the US.

SHETLAND SALMON farmers are to be paid Pounds 14m compensation for fish
still contaminated by the Braer oil tanker disaster.
One million year-old salmon will be destroyed after the farmers argued
successfully that they could still cause health problems.
One quarter of Shetland's salmon was contaminated by the spill last January.
Until this settlement, the International Oil Pollution Compensation fund had
been paying compensation to farmers on a month-by-month basis in the belief
the fish would clean themselves as they grew.

FT  07 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Patten hails opt-out
schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, forecast that well over half the
secondary schools in England and Wales would have attained grant maintained
status by the next general election.
It would prove to be 'an irreversible change,' he told the conference.
Mr Patten announced that from the start of 1994 votes by governing bodies to
determine whether schools should become grant maintained - and escape
control of local education authorities - would be conducted by secret
ballot.
To applause, he said this would would 'clip the wings' of leftwing elements.
Mr Patten said there were over 1,000 grant maintained schools providing the
quality of education that had been a feature of the old grammar and direct
grant schools.
So far, 983 English schools - and about 1,007 in the UK as a whole - have
voted to opt out. There are more than 30,000 state schools in the UK, of
which 4,700 are secondary schools.
Laughter mingled with applause when Mr Patten contrasted the action of Mr
Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the NAS/UWT, in sending his son to a
grant maintained school while leading his union's opposition to their
creation.
But Mr de Gruchy fiercely rebutted Mr Patten's speech. He said later:
'Accusations that I support grant-maintained schools are absurd. When my
son's school contemplated grant-maintained status, I attended the parents'
consultative meeting and spoke strongly against it. I voted against it in
the secret parental ballot. Personal attacks based upon misrepresentation of
the truth are no substitute for a convincing educational policy.'
Mr Patten apologised yesterday for calling the chief education officer at
Birmingham City Council a 'nutter' and a 'madman'.
Mr Patten had told a fringe meeting that Professor Tim Brighouse, who took
up his post in Birmingham last month, was a liability.
Prof Brighouse said yesterday he was considering what action to take.
Mr Patten said his comments were 'satirical' but he apologised if they had
caused offence.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Sunday Times loses appeal over memoirs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAWYERS for The Sunday Times failed last night in their attempt to stop the
Daily Mirror publishing further material based on Lady Thatcher's
controversial memoirs, The Downing Street Years.
Three Court of Appeal judges refused to overrule two earlier decisions by a
High Court judge not to grant an injunction to The Sunday Times and the
book's publishers, HarperCollins.
Sunday Times editor Mr Andrew Neil called the decision 'crazy' and said the
judges had 'given the green light to theft and bribery on a massive scale'.
After The Sunday Times, which has bought exclusive UK serialisation rights
to the book, failed to get an injunction against the Daily Mirror on
Tuesday, the Mirror went further yesterday.
The paper claimed Lady Thatcher had lost faith in Mr John Major even when he
was chancellor and said that 'intellectually he drifted with the tide'.
According to the Mirror, which clearly has access to some contents of the
book to be published on Monday week, Lady Thatcher says Mr Major had 'a
tendency to be defeated by platitudes which I find disturbing'.
The Sunday Times returned to the High Court yesterday for a second time
seeking an injunction against the Daily Mirror but Mr Justice Forbes decided
publication was in the public interest. The Sunday Times argued that further
revelations, including material about the Falklands war, could not be
classified as of current interest.
Mr Anthony Whittaker, lawyer for The Sunday Times, said it came down to a
question of where to draw the line between the need to preserve
serialisation rights and the need to give way to the public interest in what
the book said.
At the moment the judges had all drawn the line against News International,
he said. But it was also a question of degree. How much should be published
before the balance changed, he asked.
Mr Whittaker said they would wait and see what, if anything, the Mirror
published today before deciding on the next move. It might be that they
would conclude there was very little chance of getting an injunction, in
which case the only remedy open to The Sunday Times would be to sue for
damages.
That would be an extremely long, bitter and expensive exercise, he said, as
the government had discovered when it attempted to obtain an account for
profit against The Sunday Times in the Spycatcher affair.
'It will be very sad if at the end of the day no political memoir can be
protected against the interference of the memoir thief,' he said.
The Mirror reported yesterday that Lady Thatcher was scathing about some of
her colleagues, including Mr John Gummer, environment secretary. Today's
extract includes less-than-complimentary comments about Lord Archer, Mr
Michael Heseltine, Mr Malcolm Rifkind and chief whip Mr Richard Ryder.

FT  07 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Thatcher joins in
spending wrangle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Political Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LADY Thatcher, the former prime minister, arrived in Blackpool last night
and immediately joined the mounting controversy over public spending.
After arriving to a media reception at the seafront Imperial Hotel more than
twice the size of the one which greeted the prime minister earlier in the
week, she appeared later at a Young Conservatives fringe meeting.
In a brief private speech, she argued against further cuts in defence
expenditure, saying it was vital for Britain to maintain a strong defence.
Lady Thatcher told the fringe meeting, according to members of her audience:
'The country needs a strong defence and needs to be prepared for
eventualities.
'There are always threats. It is quite difficult to know where there are
problems, so we have to be strong and resolute to face them.
'We have got to watch out for trouble spots such as Bosnia.'
Lady Thatcher's comments came after Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence
secretary, warned on Tuesday that more cost-cutting reductions in the armed
forces would leave Britain a 'paper tiger', unable to fight another
Falklands war.
As she left the meeting at the conference centre, journalists outside the
gathering could hear Young Conservatives chanting 'Maggie, Maggie, Maggie -
in, in, in.'
Lady Thatcher will sit on the conference platform today as Mr Clarke winds
up the key debate on the economy.
The government is to introduce legislation to speed up its market testing
initiative designed to open government services to bids from the private
sector.
Mr William Waldegrave, public services minister, said the legislation would
end anomalies that have prevented market testing from being applied to a
wider range of services.
The government is expected to include the proposals in the deregulation bill
it is planning for the next parliamentary session beginning in November.

FT  07 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Prison expansion brings
bonus for private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE tough-sounding stand against crime announced by Mr Michael Howard, the
home secretary, yesterday, will bring a substantial bonus for Britain's
growing private prison sector.
Mr Howard unveiled proposals for six new prisons to be built and managed by
private companies.
Two of the six - at Bridgend, Mid Glamorgan, and Liverpool - had already
been announced. But the addition of another four will accelerate the pace of
private involvement in Britain's penal system.
There are only two privately managed prisons - Wolds on Humberside and
Blakenhurst, Hereford and Worcester. In August Mr Howard decided to expand
the private market by asking it to build and run the Bridgend and Liverpool
establishments, and take over the management of eight public sector prisons.
Yesterday's announcement will put about 3,600 more prison places under
private sector management. No sites for the four new buildings have decided,
but there is heavy pressure on prison places in London, the Midlands and the
north-west.
Ministers hope the private sector will finance the new projects as well as
building and running them. There are about eight companies trying to
establish themselves in the private prison market. Those that do not have a
base in the construction industry are likely to be seeking partners to
prepare bids for the new projects.
Prison building in Britain has traditionally been a slow process. Private
companies believe they will be able to bring new sites on stream more
quickly.
The tougher approach to offenders announced by Mr Howard yesterday will,
however, increase the prison population well before new prisons are
available. 'We shall no longer judge our system of justice by a fall in our
prison population,' Mr Howard told the conference.
Britain's prisons are already close to capacity and short-term options such
as opening up disused army camps and housing prisoners in police cells are
likely to be needed soon. The possibility of building extra blocks in
prisons has also been considered.
Penal reform organisations reacted with dismay. Ms Frances Crook, director
of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said the home secretary's package
would prove the 'most comprehensive programme of crime promotion in recent
history'. Mr Adam Sampson, deputy director of the Prison Reform Trust, said
successive home secretaries had increased the capacity of the prison system
but failed to reduce the rate of crime.

FT  07 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Howard aims to curb
'tidal wave' of crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Howard, the home secretary, yesterday announced 27 law and order
initiatives to combat 'a tidal wave of concern about crime'.
He won a standing ovation for a tough speech promising to provide extra
prisons, extend police powers, tighten bail provisions and crack down on
young offenders.
The package met many of the demands from angry representatives speaking from
the floor. However, the debate suggested that party activists are unlikely
to be satisfied.
The biggest ovation went to Mr Andrew Rosindell, the Young Conservatives'
chairman, for demanding the return of hanging and birching.
Lord Archer, the novelist and former Conservative MP, also won a standing
ovation for a rousing speech which was widely seen as a bid to replace Sir
Norman Fowler as party chairman.
Mr Howard's first conference speech as home secretary said the balance of
the criminal justice system had tilted too far in favour of criminals.
He said the government would accept many of the 352 recommendations of Lord
Runciman's Royal Commission into criminal justice.
However, he said no decision had been made on Lord Runciman's suggestion
that defendants should lose the right to elect trial by jury.
The main measures announced were:
Right to silence: suspects retain the right not to answer police questions,
but prosecutors may invite judges and juries to infer guilt.
Policing: part-time rural parish constables; powers to stop trespassers
disrupting country sports; less paperwork to release officers for frontline
duties.
Terrorism: tougher stop and search powers; offences of gathering information
for terrorist purposes and reasonable suspicion of connection with terrorist
activities.
Prisons: four new private sector prisons - in addition to two already
announced; crack down on drug use by testing of prisoners.
Court procedures: relaxation of restrictions on use of DNA samples; faster
eviction for squatters; abolition of warnings by rape trial judges on
truthfulness of victims; ban on jury service by offenders on bail.
Juries: new offence of witness intimidation; retrials where juries have been
'nobbled'.
Bail and cautions: end to repeat cautioning; conditions on police bail;
arrest breaches of police bail; end to presumption in favour of bail for
suspects accused of offences while on bail; power to revoke bail; automatic
custody for convicted rapists and murderers accused of reoffending.
Young offenders: doubled maximum sentence for 15-year-olds; secure training
centres for 12- to 14-year-olds; review of community sentencing toughness.
Victims: accept 11 recommendations of royal commission, including
consultation on bail, better information on trial dates and segregation of
offenders and victims.
Sentencing: Criminal Cases Review Authority to look at miscarriages of
justice; extended attorney general's right of appeal against lenient
sentencing.

FT  07 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Market testing to be
accelerated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to introduce legislation to speed up its market testing
initiative designed to open government services to bids from the private
sector.
Mr William Waldegrave, public services minister, said the legislation would
end anomalies that have prevented market testing from being applied to a
wider range of services.
Under current law, a range of government functions - including pension
administration, the processing of trade statistics and various prison and
local authority functions - cannot be delegated by ministers to anyone but a
civil servant.
The government is expected to include the proposals in the deregulation bill
it is planning for the next parliamentary session beginning in November.
Mr Waldegrave confirmed that the second tranche of the market-testing
programme will affect close to Pounds 1bn of services and not up to Pounds
2bn as originally intended. At least a third of the first programme,
covering Pounds 1.5bn of services, was not completed by the deadline last
week.
Mr Waldegrave said the government had not embarked on its market testing
programme because it doubted the abilities of public service personnel but
because it was 'only through the benign magic of comparison and competition
that we can get the best services and the best value'.
He also echoed chancellor Kenneth Clarke's recent warnings of a tough public
spending round ahead. 'The government and its supporters face an absolutely
crucial test over the next six months,' he said.
Mr John Selwyn Gummer, the environment secretary, said yesterday that he was
revising the criteria by which local authorities can judge applications for
planning permission, with the aim of improving architectural standards in
Britain's cities and rural areas.
Mr Gummer gave no specific details, but he was particularly scathing of the
building of out-of-town shopping centres.

FT  07 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Lilley to cut housing for
foreign 'scroungers'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CURBING the availability of council housing was a better way of combating
the breakdown of the family than changing the welfare system, Mr Peter
Lilley, the social security secretary, signalled yesterday.
In a populist speech, featuring pledges to cut down the social security
benefits available to foreigners and to tighten up ways of preventing fraud,
Mr Lilley highlighted spending on lone parents as one of the three
fastest-rising areas of social security expenditure.
Today Sir George Young, the housing minister, is expected to announce a
review of the legislation which imposes on councils an automatic duty to
provide accommodation for people defined as 'homeless'.
Most ministers believe that restricting entitlement to council housing by
tightening that definition is more likely to have an impact on the numbers
of lone parents, than making changes to income-related benefits. In contrast
to Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, who used a fringe meeting on
Tuesday to float the idea of limiting the benefits available in respect of
second or later children, Mr Lilley said ministers were conscious that
social security benefits did not have much to do with the growth of lone
parenthood.
He made only a passing reference to one of the most controversial issues at
the conference this week - compensation for those most affected by the
imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel. However a speaker during the
debate was warmly applauded for urging ministers to address the plight of
pensioners who were only just disqualified from income-related benefits.
Instead, Mr Lilley won an enthusiastic reception by devoting much of his
speech to cutting back on the benefits for which non-UK citizens are
eligible.
From next spring, housing benefit will no longer be available to foreign
claimants.
There are also plans to impose a residency qualification of some months on
EC nationals claiming benefits in the UK.
The restriction on housing benefit is estimated to save Pounds 50m.
'We have all too many home-grown scroungers,' Mr Lilley said, 'but it's
beyond the pale when foreigners come here expecting our handouts'.
He added that since other EC countries insisted on a period of residence
before benefits became available, he foresaw no difficulties in changing the
UK's rules to introduce one, but added that the 'legal niceties' were still
being dealt with.
In a speech clearly directed at the right of the party, he linked the UK's
improved economic performance with sterling's departure from the European
exchange rate mechanism, and argued that the worst aspect of the social
chapter of the Maastricht treaty would have been the way it would 'surrender
control over our laws'.
Mr Lilley also announced new measures intended to contribute to saving up to
Pounds 1bn by to tackling fraud.
Housing benefit administration will be reformed, and there will be greater
use of new technology to prevent duplicate or false claims.

FT  07 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Call for move to private
regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINISTER in charge of the government's deregulation initiative called
yesterday for the 'privatisation' of large sectors of the state's
responsibility for industrial and commercial regulation.
Mr Neil Hamilton, the trade and industry minister, said that industry should
be handed responsibility for setting environmental and product quality
standards and for granting enforcement certificates.
Citing the French example in which fire certification of buildings is
handled by insurance companies, Mr Hamilton said that business would made a
better job of regulation and would inspire greater public trust.
He told a meeting held by the Conservative Way Forward group: 'People would
have more faith in an industry which set standards and which only accredited
those who attained them than they would in a government which seemed
obsessed with minutiae and which paid no regard to what producers could
offer or what the public wanted to receive.'
Mr Hamilton, a prominent member of the right of the Tory party, confirmed
the government's plans to include an 'omnibus' deregulation bill in the next
session of parliament. But in his speech to the Conservative Way Forward he
went much further than the government has hitherto suggested.
In many areas currently regulated by government, compulsion could be
replaced by voluntary incentives similar to the Kite Mark system operated by
the British standards institute, he said.
In others, regulation should simply be scrapped to allow individuals to make
their own choices and trade-offs.
Mr Hamilton concluded: 'Much of what is presently done by regulation does
not need to be done at all. It denies people to make the choices and
trade-offs they want to make. It takes some products and services out of the
reach of customers and denies them their benefits.'

FT  07 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: The price of sound
finance - Conference Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT'S the economy, stupid. The Conservative party briefly escaped yesterday
the inexorable logic of US President Bill Clinton's dictum. Criminals,
single mothers, leftwing teachers and social security scroungers are
unmissable targets. Messrs Michael Howard, John Patten and Peter Lilley took
full advantage. They scored one or two bullseyes. Today it is back to
reality.
By all accounts Mr Kenneth Clarke is planning a typically combative speech.
There will be some good news. The recovery may be patchy but Britain's
economy is growing faster than any other in Europe. The fall in inflation is
more than a blip. Manufacturing industry has both a grip on its costs and a
real competitive edge. Lady Thatcher's enterprise culture lives on.
As Mr Stephen Dorrell, one of Mr Clarke's Treasury team, put it yesterday on
the fringe, the prize on the horizon is an end to boom and bust. In the
background other ministers are whispering about the opportunity for an early
cut in interest rates.
All that's needed now, Mr Clarke will tell us, is one more heave to get the
country's public finances in order. That means the toughest public spending
round for a decade or more. The chancellor must keep open also the option of
further measures to raise revenue (the phrase does not sound quite as bad as
tax increases) in the Budget. But what is a Tory government for if it is not
to preside over sound finance. No mention, of course, of how the government
got itself in to this particular mess.
In spite of the threat that the economic debate will be the first in
Blackpool worthy of that description, Mr Clarke cannot afford to backtrack
over the imposition of value added tax on fuel. In retrospect he believes it
was a mistake to prolong the agony by deferring full implementation until
1995. He might yet bring it forward to next April. His only hope is that the
promise of a relatively generous compensation package will contain the anger
among the Tory faithful.
It is a plausible package for a conference which would occasionally like to
forget how divided its party has become. Even Lady Thatcher might allow
herself a supportive smile. Mr Norman Lamont, speaking on the conference
fringe only moments after Mr Clarke has sat down, may not be quite so
forgiving.
For all his natural self-confidence, the chancellor is a worried man. So is
Mr John Major, who spent yesterday afternoon poring over Mr Clarke's text.
Promising sound finance is a lot easier than delivering it. Nor can the
beleagured prime minister afford the luxury of the medium-term perspective
of his chancellor.
Mr Clarke has made two basic promises which provide the fixed points for the
Budget. The first is that he will secure a faster reduction in the borrowing
requirement. The second is that he will not cut public spending to below the
level agreed by the cabinet in July. Only faster economic growth, higher
taxes or both will square that particular circle.
There have been one or two signs that faster growth will provide a partial
lifeline over the medium term. Shrewd observers in Blackpool are suggesting
that the doomsters may be pleasantly surprised. Against that, the latest
smoke-signals from the Treasury suggest that for the current financial year
borrowing may still be close to Pounds 50bn.
For all the jeers from the Tory right it is also clear that the spending
round is turning out to be a great deal tougher than generally realised. Mr
Clarke has referred to blood on the Whitehall carpets. Spending colleagues
say the blood is also on the walls and ceilings.
Mr Clarke will not make up his mind on how much extra revenue he needs until
around the end of this month, although the broad shape of the Budget will be
sketched out at Dorneywood in 10 days time. But the best guess of those who
read his lips is that the chancellor is thinking in terms of a net tax
increase of between Pounds 4bn or Pounds 5bn.
For all his public bravado about extending VAT, there is no certainty that
he will bite that particular bullet. The prospective spending cuts already
threaten Mr Major's fragile Commons majority.
The switch in Budget timing will give restless Tory MPs four months before
the start of the financial year to rebel against VAT on transport, books or
children's clothes. Much safer, Mr Clarke might judge, to raise what he
needs by some clever juggling with income tax allowances.
His combative style and the reflex loyalty of the Tory faithful should
guarantee him a standing ovation for his first conference speech as
chancellor. He should make the most of it. There won't be many plaudits from
Tory voters after November 30.

FT  07 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Lockerbie setback for UN chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, told the Security Council
yesterday that no progress had been made with Libya on setting a date and
place for the surrender of two men accused of the 1988 bombing of a Pan-Am
airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, Reuter reports from New York.
The US, Britain and France now intend to press ahead with a resolution
tightening sanctions against Tripoli and hope the Council will adopt it next
week.
A French official said Mr Boutros Ghali's report, which followed several
meetings with Libyan Foreign Minister Omar al-Muntasser, would give Council
members the impetus to move the sanctions resolution, introduced last
Friday.
The allies have been vague about when the resolution would be approved, in
an apparent effort to give Libya more time to arrange a handover of the
suspects.
Libyan authorities can prevent the sanctions by arranging the transfer
before the Council votes. But the three nations will require a definite date
and place for the surrender, which must fall within a two-week time span.
In April 1992 the Council imposed an air and arms embargo on Libya and a
downgrading of diplomatic ties.
Meanwhile, talks between the UN and Iraq on the sale of Iraqi oil worth up
to Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.05bn) have failed, a UN spokesman said yesterday.
Security Council officials said Iraq formally told Mr Boutros Ghali it would
not resume the talks on limited sales, last held in July, and instead would
try to have sanctions lifted completely - a decision which rests with the
Council.
According to diplomats, the UN chief told the Iraqis he was not sure they
would obtain this. One envoy said Baghdad should release foreign prisoners
from jail to 'create a climate of confidence'.
Mr Boutros Ghali also recommended yesterday a further six-month renewal of
the organisation's Iraq-Kuwait observation mission which monitors a
demilitarised zone set up between the two countries after the Gulf war.
The UN mission comprises about 250 military observers from more than 30
countries and about 115 engineers, logistics and medical personnel.
In a written report to the Security Council, Mr Boutros Ghali said the
mission's area of operations had been calm during the past six months. But
he said this 'should not obscure the fact that tensions persist and full
peace has yet to be restored to the area'.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Cross-party backing for rival US healthcare plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of conservative Democrats and centrist Republicans joined forces
yesterday to present an alternative plan for reforming the US healthcare
system. Some supporters believe it could be the principal rival to President
Bill Clinton's health programme.
The group, led by Congressman Jim Cooper, a Tennessee Democrat, and
Congressman Fred Grandy, a Republican from Iowa, backs some of Mr Clinton's
proposals but wants a bigger role for the market and a reduced one for the
state.
The Cooper-Grandy scheme, like the Clinton plan, embraces the 'managed
competition' concept introduced by academic economists as a way of improving
the healthcare market by grouping consumers in alliances.
Unlike the Clinton plan, which would compel employers to provide health
insurance for their workers and pay for 80 per cent of the premiums, it
relies on a more voluntary approach. 'We object to employer mandates, global
budgets, price controls, restrictive regulatory purchasing co-operatives,
excessive state flexibility and the continuation of the unlimited corporate
tax deductibility for health benefits,' Mr Cooper said.
Critics charge, however, that without some form of compulsion no reform plan
can achieve universal coverage, a key selling point of Mr Clinton's plan and
an increasingly popular guarantee.
Mr Cooper and Mr Grandy, backed by 44 colleagues from both parties, would
offer a standard package of healthcare benefits, and would pay for their
reforms principally by stopping companies from deducting from their taxable
income the cost of health coverage exceeding this standard.
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that this kind of limit on
deductibility could increase tax revenues by about Dollars 113bn (Pounds
74.8bn) over five years, and would also add to market pressure for slower
increases in medical costs.
The Clinton administration has repeatedly said it is open to suggestions on
changing its plan, which is still a long way from satisfying most members of
Congress.
Criticism has focused on the administration's estimates of future cost
savings, essential to pay for an expansion in the sorts of healthcare
coverage provided, and on subsidies to small businesses, which will now be
obliged to offer health insurance to their workers.

THE race among Japanese companies to win a larger share of the Chinese
market is heating up.
An expected investment of Y10bn (Pounds 62.5m) by Matsushita, the consumer
electronics group, in a Chinese joint venture to manufacture components for
video cassette recorders for the Chinese market will be the largest yet for
a Japanese company there.
The deal, which could be officially agreed next month, follows Matsushita's
decision in September to set up a wholly owned company in Xiamen to produce
audio equipment.
Matsushita exports about 10,000 VCRs a month to China but aims to
manufacture 1.5m units a year there by the end of 1994. The company already
has a manufacturing facility for colour TV tubes in Beijing and for black
and white TV tubes in Shanghai.
In the audio market, Matsushita is shifting production of cassette players
and clock-equipped radios for the Chinese market from South-east Asia to the
Xiamen economic zone. Although future products from China could be exported,
the company believes production will just meet Chinese demand for the
foreseeable future.
Sanyo, the electronics group, is also investing in a Chinese joint venture
company to manufacture and supply commercial refrigeration equipment. Sanyo
has the largest share of the Japanese market for refrigerated display cases.
The group will have a 55 per cent stake in the new venture, with China
Dalian Refrigeration holding 40 per cent and Nissho Iwai, the Japanese
trading house, 5 per cent. It will be Sanyo's 12th manufacturing facility in
China.
The new company will begin operating in Dalian late next year with initial
production of 500 units, rising to about 12,000 annually within seven years.
China's market for supermarket showcases is estimated at 4,000 units this
year, but is expected to grow rapidly.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Jordan calls time on a high-flying career
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORK bellies may not have moved much yesterday on the Chicago commodity
exchanges, but there was news out of the second city that can be said to
have wobbled the Sears Tower and the nation, at least momentarily.
Michael Jordan, by any yardstick the world's best-known sportsman, who
played basketball for a very large living, quit the sport at the age of 30.
Jordan broke the news late on Tuesday. 'The desire has gone,' he told some
local reporters, who thought their big story of the night was the opening of
the baseball playoffs. At his press conference yesterday he said the same
thing repeatedly. He had been thinking of retiring for at least a year, even
before he led the Chicago Bulls to a third consecutive championship and
propelled himself far into the air for a seventh consecutive scoring title.
Last year he also won his second Olympic gold medal.
He had talked about quitting with his father, who was murdered in North
Carolina last July. 'At least he got to see my last basketball game,' Jordan
said. Investigations into his passion for gambling at casinos and on the
golf course were not material, he said.
But he could not depart without some cracks at press hounding of public
figures.
Just as, in 1962, a certain politician had declared (wrongly as it
transpired) that 'you won't have Richard Nixon to kick around any more,' so
Jordan told his audience pointedly: 'Hopefully I won't be seeing too many of
you guys in the future.' If that message was not received, he added: 'Stay
away from my house.'
Jordan's reputation has probably only been matched in modern sporting
history by Pele, the Brazilian soccer legend. But it was only partly based
on his unquestioned sporting prowess, substantial though this was. Along
with Earvin 'Magic' Johnson and Larry Bird - both retired in the last two
years, the first after declaring he was HIV positive, the second suffering
the effects of age and chronic injury - Jordan made the 1980s a golden age
for basketball, no longer primarily an American inner-city game.
His visibility made him the most successful television advertising salesman
for commercial products around the world. According to Forbes magazine, his
income from promoting Nike shoes, McDonald's hamburgers, Wilson sporting
goods, Gatorade soft drinks and Sara Lee confectionery earned him about
Dollars 32m (Pounds 21.1m) last year, far more than the Dollars 3.9m he
picked up from shooting a basketball.
His loss will be felt hardest in Chicago, which had been unaccustomed to
sporting success. The two local baseball teams, the Cubs and the White Sox,
have not won a World Series since 1908 and 1917 respectively. The White Sox
lost their opening playoff game on Tuesday, after Mr Jordan had thrown the
ceremonial opening pitch.
There was hope in Chicago, and elsewhere, yesterday that his retirement
would not be permanent, not least because quitting at the peak is uncommon
in professional sport. Asked the inevitable question, Jordan merely replied:
'I don't believe in never.'

FT  07 OCT 93 / Bermuda keeps faith with UBP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HAMILTON, BERMUDA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BERMUDA'S ruling party was re-elected on Tuesday night with a majority of
just four seats, retaining the grip on power it has enjoyed since the
British dependent territory became self-governing in 1968.
The United Bermuda party won 22 of the 40 seats in the island's House of
Assembly, against 23 seats in the last election in 1989. The Progressive
Labour party took all the remainder, with an independent incumbent and the
only member of the country's National Liberal party losing their seats.
The UBP's share of the vote remained unchanged at 50 per cent, but two of
its cabinet ministers lost their seats; Sir John Sharpe, minister of
delegated affairs and a former premier, and Mr Gerald Simons, the
environment minister.
The election was fought against a backdrop of anxiety that a PLP victory
would threaten the island's future as an offshore centre. The opposition had
pledged accelerated 'Bermudianisation,' but said it would do nothing to harm
international business.
Local issues dominated the campaign, particularly the future of the US
Navy's air base on the island, which Washington has threatened to close as
part of its defence cuts. Sir John Swan, the premier, said yesterday that
with his new mandate he was re-opening talks with the US and would also be
holding discussions with European Community and Canadian officials.
The PLP, which draws its support predominantly from Bermuda's majority black
population and blue-collar voters, saw its share of the vote rise from 37
per cent to 46 per cent in spite of a UBP campaign which questioned the
opposition's ability to govern. Mr Frederick Wade, leader of the PLP, said:
'We accept the result. Bermuda has spoken. We intend to be on the case.'
In spite of heavy rain during much of the day, voter turnout rose to 78 per
cent, up from 74 per cent in 1989.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Judge delays Brazilian reforms

<DATELINE>
   SAO PAULO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S constitutional revision process got off to a shaky start yesterday
when an opening ceremony was delayed by a court order.
The preliminary order, issued by a Supreme Court judge apparently without
consulting his 10 colleagues, effectively annulled a session of Congress
last month which had discussed the date for the reform process to begin. The
judge ruled the session was opened without a necessary quorum and issued the
order even though the actual vote on starting the revision took place at a
later session, properly convened.
The judge's decision was greeted with surprise. It is likely to delay rather
than threaten the revision, required to take effect five years after the
constitution was approved on October 5 1988. Members of Congress were trying
yesterday to have the decision overturned immediately.
However, the incident showed the capacity for stalling tactics from groups
opposed to the process, such as left-wing politicians, trade unions and
church groups, who filed the request for the session to be annulled.
These groups fear the reform threatens social rights guaranteed in the
constitution. The government and business leaders see change as vital to
solving some of Brazil's economic problems and to allow further
liberalisation of the economy.
If the judge's ruling is not overturned immediately, Congress can possibly
seek a full hearing of the Supreme Court or convene a new series of meetings
to agree on a new date for the process to begin. Either course is likely to
take some weeks.
Many politicians want to complete the revision this year to keep it separate
from next year's elections.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Pension fund in trade credit link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Export-Import Bank and the New York City Police Pension Fund have
agreed on a novel course of export financing which will make available trade
credits to help small and medium-sized companies sell abroad.
The pension fund is to finance a Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.8m) line of credit,
to be administered by the two-year-old New York State Export Finance
Programme, for working capital loans of Dollars 25,000-Dollars 2.5m for
proposed export projects.
The loans will be approved and guaranteed by Eximbank.
Mr Alfred Daibock, director of the New York programme, said the scheme
'addresses the real need (for export finance) right smack in the middle'.
The need was for an agency which would work with exporters and banks and
conduct the labour intensive work, which banks found insufficiently
profitable.
The export finance programme does not need to make a profit, but it expects
to give good returns to the pension fund investors and break even itself in
the next 12-18 months.
Efforts have been under way for some time to utilise pension funds in trade
development schemes.
Ms Elizabeth Holtzman, New York City Comptroller and adviser to the city's
Dollars 47bn pension funds, said that it was the first use of such funds to
revitalise New York's manufacturing sector and create new jobs.
Mr Ken Brody, Eximbank's chairman and a former investment banker with
Goldman Sachs, said the programme, which was initiated before he joined
Eximbank, would serve as a model for other federal and city efforts.
'It increases the amount of financing available for exporters, helps the
local economy and allows pension funds to obtain a good rate of return on
their investments at minimal risk,' he said.
The Dollars 30m in financing may ultimately underwrite as much as Dollars
100m in overseas sales.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Senate delay on Somalia averts clash with Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton avoided an immediate confrontation with Congress over
US policy in Somalia yesterday, when the Senate agreed to postpone by at
least a week a vote that could have led to a cut-off in funds for the
operation.
Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, made it clear the delay was
designed to give the president more time to resolve the administration
debate on the next moves in Somalia. This entered its second day yesterday
as Mr Clinton set aside domestic policy for the moment.
Outside the White House political pressure continued to grow, with members
of Congress demanding either that US troops be withdrawn forthwith or that
the president come up with a clear statement of policy goals.
The debate cut across party lines. A letter signed by 65 Republican
congressmen demanded an early withdrawal, but Senator Bob Dole, the
Republican minority leader, argued that 'this is not a time for panic'.
Democrats were similarly divided. Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, while
criticising the administration's fixation with getting rid of General
Mohammed Farah Aideed, the Somali factional leader, argued that the wrong
global signals would be sent by a premature US retreat.
Congressman Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, appearing on the same TV
programme, contended that after the Gulf war nobody could suggest that US
credibility was an issue. He said the US should declare a victory and get
out.
Opinion polls have also shown little enthusiasm for a long US stay in
Somalia following last week's costly military assault on Gen Aideed's
positions in south Mogadishu. Approximately two-thirds of those questioned
in two surveys favoured an early withdrawal, though a majority in one
believed US forces should continue to try to punish Gen Aideed.
Both houses of congress last month passed resolutions which, though
non-binding, assume greater significance in the current heat of the debate.
They require Mr Clinton to lay out by October 15 the details of his Somali
policy prior to a possible vote by November 15 either to endorse a
continuing mission or to force a withdrawal.
There is genuine concern in the administration not to lose the initiative on
the main domestic legislative agenda - specifically healthcare reform, which
had been proceeding quite well, and the North American Free Trade Area,
where an uphill battle has been joined.
The US yesterday reduced its UN arrears with a payment of Dollars 533m
(Pounds 352.9m), including Dollars 300m for peacekeeping.
This still leaves the US debt of Dollars 472m for the regular budget and for
peace-keeping. Member states' total arrears were put at Dollars 1.7bn,
including Dollars 1.2bn for peacekeeping.

FT  07 OCT 93 / World Trade News: US economists attack 'myopic' trade calls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN should reject 'misguided' American demands for managed trade and
'myopic' calls for a cut in its bilateral trade surplus, according to a
group of leading US economists.
In an open letter to President Bill Clinton and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa,
Japan's prime minister, the economists attacked administration demands that
Japan should lower its trade surplus with the US, which is expected to rise
to about Dollars 60bn (Pounds 39.7bn) this year.
'It is myopic for the US to create the impression that Japan's surplus is
harmful, when its own past profligacy and current budgetary deficit have
crippled its ability to finance its own needs, much less those of the rest
of the world,' the letter said.
It was signed by 25 economists including Nobel-laureates Mr Lawrence Klein,
Mr Franco Modigliani, Mr Paul Samuelson, Mr Robert Solow, and Mr James
Tobin, along with Mr Paul Krugman at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Mr Jagdish Bhagwati at Colombia University, Mr Jeffrey Sachs at
Harvard, Mr John Makin at the American Enterprise Institute, and Mr Gary
Saxonhouse at Michigan University.
On managed trade the group attacked 'the crude and simplistic view that
Japan is importing too few manufactures owing to 'structural barriers' which
make Japan special'.
'The world needs more market-based trade, governed by internationally agreed
rules, not targets set by bureaucrats, politicians and self-interested
complainants from industry.'
Where there were legitimate complaints about access to Japan's market, they
should be resolved in the 'neutral and impartial' context of Gatt.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Australia seeks a bargain at work: Nikki Tait on planned
labour reforms expected to provoke an outcry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S Labor government, re-elected last March, may think it has
problems with a stalled budget, but its parliamentary battles could just be
starting.
For next on the agenda is labour market reform legislation, and a deal
negotiated this week between the government of prime minister Paul Keating
and the nation's trade unions seems certain to provoke maximum outcry.
Full details of the industrial relations reform package have not been made
public yet. The government-union agreement - reached late on Tuesday - still
requires formal ratification by the Australian Council of Trade Unions,
which it will probably get tomorrow. On the government's side, Mr Laurie
Brereton, the industrial relations minister, has yet to sell the proposals
to his own Labor party caucus.
But assuming no big obstacles emerge in either case, the substance of the
package is fairly clear - so much so that employers' organisations are
already limbering up for the fight.
'This is 95 per cent an ACTU agenda, 5 per cent a government agenda and zero
per cent an employer agenda,' said the Australian Chamber of Commerce and
Industry yesterday.
The package will almost certainly contain three elements.
The first will centre on an extension of 'devolved' wage bargaining at
workplace level. Australian wages have long been set by a complex structure
of federal and state commissions, paying little attention to individual
employers' circumstances. But, as the country's protectionist tariff
barriers have come down and a more 'deregulated' economy has been
encouraged, this system has looked increasingly untenable.
Over the past few years, therefore, Australia has been edging towards
workplace-based bargaining. But the changes have been slow in coming. At
present, there are only about 1,150 'enterprise' agreements, covering about
11 per cent of the workforce.
At first the government hoped to boost the use of enterprise bargaining by
making it an option for the 70 per cent of private sector workers who do not
belong to unions. At present, only unions may make certified enterprise
agreements.
But elements within Australia's union movement - still strong but suffering
from declining membership - fought a rearguard action. For months,
negotiations between the ACTU and the government stalled.
What emerged this week was a compromise. Non-union workers would be able to
make enterprise deals through the use of flexibility clauses incorporated
into centralised wage awards. But unions would be able to object to such
deals through the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the federal
arbitration body.
Employers' representatives maintain that such a set-up would be unworkable.
Although unions would have no power of veto over non-union agreements, the
ACCI argues that their ability to obstruct and question deals, through the
AIRC, would be enough to deter employers. It is, claims Bryan Noakes, ACCI
executive director in Melbourne, an 'effective veto'.
The second element likely to be in the reform package would be just as
contentious. The government is likely to propose significant changes to
sanctions against workers who take industrial action.
For a start, the right to strike would be enshrined in law and employers
would lose the right to dismiss employees who engaged in industrial action.
Employers who were victims of secondary action could have to wait for three
days - and would need permission from the AIRC - before seeking legal
redress.
Most of this would be welcome to a union movement that knows it will not
have a Labor government in power for ever and is keen to get protections
written into law.
The third element likely to be in the package is beefing up the protection
of minimum entitlements, including wages, equal pay, parental leave and
termination conditions, for all workers, and giving the AIRC an enhanced
role in the process. A new federal court - the Industrial Relations Court of
Australia - could also be created to take over the industrial relations
jurisdiction.
These measures would be aimed in part at increasing the federal 'safety net'
should individual states choose to pursue more radical labour market
policies. Last year, for example, a new conservative government in Victoria
introduced industrial relations changes that reduced workers' entitlements
and provoked a rash of labour protests.
Although the government holds sway in the House of Representatives, it needs
the support of minority parties - the Green Party and the Democrats - to get
legislation through the Senate.
The two Green senators are an unknown quantity but the Democrats have
already raised some concerns. They have said they need to see more detail on
enterprise bargaining before making a decision.
'We are going to be looking at chapter and verse of how the non-union
arrangements are arrived at and none of that detail has yet been spelled
out. I think it will take another month to make this legislation fit to hit
the floor,' their industrial relations spokesman said yesterday.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Tokyo takes tougher line with Beijing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's new prime minister, starts talking about
China, some bureaucrats in Tokyo hold their breath, wondering if the
self-consciously candid leader will offend the Chinese government.
On hearing that China had resumed nuclear testing on Tuesday, Mr Hosokawa
was particularly blunt, unlike past prime ministers from the Liberal
Democratic party, saying: 'It can only be described in the words 'very
regrettable'.'
One senior Japanese official emphasised the prime minister was 'not reading
a statement' when he criticised the Chinese action, implying that the prime
minister had picked the words himself and had chosen to inject drama into
the delivery.
Japan has not altered direction on China policy, but the changes in style
introduced by Mr Hosokawa and his seven-party coalition mean the government
is apparently taking a tougher public line on Chinese nuclear tests, weapons
exports and human rights abuses.
Last week Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister, told his Chinese counterpart,
Mr Qian Qichen, during a meeting in New York that Tokyo is watching China's
arms export policy very closely and warned him that Japan opposed a
resumption of nuclear testing.
China is accustomed to hearing these warnings from the US government, and
while they are not necessarily new Japanese policies, Beijing officials have
noted that the Hosokawa government is far more willing to make clear its
concerns about Chinese policies.
A separate incident last week gave the Chinese government the impression
that the climate had changed in Tokyo. After several days of bickering, the
Chinese delegation to the Tokyo International Film Festival stormed back to
Beijing because their Japanese hosts planned to screen two 'unauthorised'
Chinese films.
The films - one called Blue Kite, a painstaking but unflattering profile of
Chinese life in the 1950s and 1960s, and the other a rough-and-ready
portrait of Beijing youth, Beijing Bastards - were unauthorised because they
are at the centre of an ideological argument in China. In the past, fear of
offending the Chinese government would have tempted organisers to shelve the
screenings, but they went ahead, and Blue Kite won the grand prize at the
festival, causing more embarrassment in Beijing.
The coming of the Hosokawa coalition has not slowed the economic exchanges.
The prime minister yesterday met a delegation from Dalian, the northern
Chinese port city, which launched a trade fair in Tokyo to sell its
suitability as an investment site.
Japanese electronics companies apparently need little convincing. Sanyo
announced yesterday it will establish a joint venture in Dalian to make
commercial refrigeration equipment and Matsushita is planning to produce
video cassette recorders in the city.
Japan's image as a high-wage society received a dent yesterday with
publication of an official 1.9 per cent rise in average private sector wages
for last year, the lowest growth rate in 34 years.
Some companies might even have to cut wages next year to ensure full
employment if the downturn continues into the tax period starting April
1994, warned Mr Takeshi Nagano, the chairman of the Nikkeiren employers'
federation.
One leading car group has been reported to be considering a cut in bonuses,
while holidays on low pay are said to be under study in the electronics and
steel industries.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Bhutto disputes Sharif's claims: Pakistani rivals both
hopeful as election results trickle in

<TEXT>
THE two main contenders in yesterday's general election in Pakistan, Mr
Mohammed Nawaz Sharif and Ms Benazir Bhutto, both claimed victory last night
as counting was under way.
However, unofficial projections - mostly based on partially completed counts
 -gave Mr Sharif, the industrialist from Punjab province, a lead over his
bitter rival, the feudal princess from Sind.
According to an estimate covering 134 of the 217 seats in the National
Assembly, Mr Sharif's Moslem League party was set to win 70 and Ms Bhutto's
Pakistan People's party 47. The other 17 seats in the 134-strong sample were
going to Islamic parties and independents.
By early today official results had been declared in 65 seats, with the PPP
taking 26 and the Moslem League 24, while 15 were won by smaller parties.
But Mr Sharif claimed victory on the basis of the unofficial tallies. 'We
have won the election,' he told jubilant supporters at his home in Lahore.
A Bhutto campaign manager, Shafqat Mahmood, retorted that it was the PPP
which was set to form a government but also said that a coalition government
appeared likely.
Aides to Ms Bhutto, awaiting the outcome at Larkana, in Sind, said privately
she seemed depressed by the way results were turning out.
The turnout was low, reflecting disenchantment with the bickering between
prime ministers, the president and the army which has disrupted politics
since the death of the military dictator, Gen Zia ul-Haq, in 1988. Both Ms
Bhutto, prime minister in 1988-90, and Mr Sharif, who was forced to resign
this summer, were hounded out of office by the military leadership.
Pakistanis have been called on to vote three times in the last five years.
Only a few violent incidents marred the polls, mostly in the southern city
of Karachi where the MQM, a local militant party, boycotted the elections.
Elaborate precautions, including supervision by 150,000 troops and
monitoring by foreign observers, seemed to have kept cheating to a minimum.
Mr Moeen Qureshi, the interim prime minister, declared the election was 'as
democratic and as transparent' as polls in any country.
Ms Bhutto's party, however, claimed electoral fraud. 'It was clear that some
of the presiding officers (at polling stations) were openly subverting the
sanctity of the poll to the detriment of the Pakistan People's party,' the
PPP said in a letter addressed to the election commission.
Mr Qureshi has launched economic reforms and an anti-corruption drive which
both Mr Sharif and Ms Bhutto have pledged to support. In one of the final
acts of his administration, the State Bank of Pakistan, the central bank,
was yesterday made independent.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund has reinstated Cambodia as a full member and
approved a Dollars 9m (Pounds 5.9m) loan under its Systemic Transformation
Facility, designed to help once centrally planned countries make the leap to
a market economy.
The decision follows pledges from donor countries gathered in Washington
under the chairmanship of France and Japan to pay off Cambodia's Dollars 52m
arrears to the IMF.
Cambodia took advantage of last week's annual meetings of the IMF and World
Bank in Washington to complete negotiations on a Dollars 62.7m emergency
loan from the World Bank, intended to let the country finance essential
imports.
A World Bank mission is due next month to examine the need for
infrastructure investment. But Cambodia's needs present unusual problems
because of years of war.
Reuter adds from Washington: The IMF announced yesterday it would lend
Vietnam about Dollars 223m to help rebuild its economy. Last week Vietnam
made itself eligible for new funding by paying off about Dollars 140m in IMF
arrears for previous loans with the help of a group of wealthy donor
countries, particularly France and Japan.

JAPAN'S image as a high-wage society received a dent yesterday with
publication of an official 1.9 per cent rise in average private sector wages
for last year, the lowest growth rate in 34 years.
Some companies might even have to cut wages next year to ensure full
employment if the downturn continues into the tax period starting April
1994, warned Mr Takeshi Nagano, the chairman of the Nikk-eiren employers'
federation.
One leading car group has been reported to be considering a cut in bonuses,
while holidays on low pay are said to be under study in the electronics and
steel industries. The companies involved have not confirmed their plans.
In real terms, disposable income for the average family of four rose by a
mere 0.1 per cent, the smallest increase since 1982, when average income
stagnated, according to the wage report, by the national tax administration
agency. Last year's average private sector annual wage was Y4.55m (Pounds
28,400) before tax, said the agency.
Last year's 1.9 per cent average wage rise compares with 5 per cent in the
previous year and is the third smallest since the records started in 1949.
Mr Nagano called for a Y10,000bn income tax cut by the end of this year to
stimulate the economy. It had until yesterday been asking for a Y2,000bn tax
cut.

MALAWI'S ruling Congress party has appointed to the top job of secretary
general Mr Gwanda Chakuamba, who served 13 years in prison on a sedition
charge.
His selection after a party meeting in closed session in Lilongwe took place
in the absence of President Hastings Banda, who was flown to South Africa
for emergency medical treatment last weekend.
It is not yet known whether Dr Banda approved the appointment himself, or
whether it was the initiative of senior party colleagues in an attempt to
avert a constitutional crisis.
Under the existing constitution, if Dr Banda is disabled, executive power
passes to a presidential council led by the Congress party secretary
general.
This post had been vacant for 10 years. Its last occupant, Mr Dick Matenje,
died in a 1983 car crash following disagreements with Dr Banda.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEADLOCK over the Australian government's budget proposals loomed last night
when opposition and minority parties in the Senate blocked an attempt to
link planned income tax cuts to revenue-raising measures, Nikki Tait reports
from Sydney.
The government had sought to make its proposed tax cuts for middle-income
earners dependent on, and directly linked to, revenue measures mainly
consisting of increases in indirect taxation. These have been strongly
attacked by the opposition.
An amendment, taking out a government-inserted clause which linked the tax
cuts and revenue proposals, was passed in the Senate by 39 votes to 23,
after the two minority parties, the Green party and the Australian
Democrats, joined the opposition coalition in supporting the change. The
single Independent in the upper house, Senator Brian Harradine, sided with
the opposition.
The legislation will now be referred back to the House of Representatives,
which has already approved all eight budget bills. But the government has
indicated it requires a link between the bills before it will implement the
promised tax cuts, due to come into effect in November.
One possibility is that a parliamentary stalemate will ensue and the tax
cuts be delayed, with the government hoping it can blame the opposition.
Debate on the budget bills was continuing in the Senate yesterday.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN and China have 'weeks rather than months' to agree on Hong Kong's
political development before the legislative process will have to be set in
train, Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, said yesterday.
Mr Patten flies to London early next month for a cabinet meeting at which
ministers will discuss the way ahead for Hong Kong.
It is expected that this meeting will decide whether to push ahead with the
colony's political development without China's approval.
In opening the 1993-94 session of the Legislative Council (Legco), Hong
Kong's law-making body, Mr Patten said Britain believed that a legislature
which was openly and fairly elected was the best way to underpin the rule of
law in the colony.
In seeking a credible legislature, 'there is a point beyond which I do not
believe that we could justifiably go, even in the pursuit of an agreement
(with China) to which we genuinely aspire.'
The governor confirmed that during the summer Britain had offered to reduce
the size of the electorate able to vote in elections due in 1995, and had
fallen in line with China's preferred structure for an electoral college
which will choose 10 of Legco's 60 members.
Pro-democracy politicians have accused Mr Patten of a 'huge climbdown' and a
betrayal of his democratic agenda.
The governor ended his speech with an impassioned defence of the democratic
ideal and challenged Hong Kong and its legislature to stand up for what it
believed.
Britain would not be more bold in introducing democracy than Hong Kong
wanted it to be.
'We cannot be bolder than you because liberty stands in the heart. When it
shrivels there, nothing can save it.'
During his two-hour address Mr Patten made a plea to China to separate
issues relating to Hong Kong's economy from its dispute with Britain over
the colony's political development.
Beijing's failure to approve a planned expansion of Hong Kong's container
port would cost the colony, after 1997, an estimated HKDollars 20bn (Pounds
1.7bn) in lost output, Mr Patten added.
Its refusal to deal with matters before the Joint Liaison Group (JLG), a
Sino-British diplomatic forum negotiating the detail of Hong Kong's transfer
to China, risked the colony's 'vital legal and commercial relations with the
outside world'.
Hong Kong residents' rights to visa-free travel, the validity of air-service
agreements, extradition treaties, and the rights on non-Chinese after the
takeover were in limbo because of Beijing's decision not to co-operate in
the JLG.
'If progress in the JLG does not speed up significantly, there is a high
risk that the work will not be finished before 1997, and we will then face a
legal vacuum,' Mr Patten went on.
He also sought to shrug off his image as a one-issue governor, also
promising more money for education, health, the arts and the environment, as
well more money to fight corruption and to be used for roads to improve
trade with China.
The governor also foreshadowed a government position paper on pensions and
outlined a legislative programme designed to bolster consumer protection and
safety at work.
He reiterated the government's forecast of a 5.5 per cent growth in output
in 1993 but shaved its inflation forecast to 9 per cent from 9.5 per cent.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Israel and PLO to press on with peace talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON

<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL and the Palestine Liberation Organisation will open talks on
implementing their historic peace agreement in Egypt on October 13, Mr
Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO
chairman, said after an unexpectedly productive mini-summit yesterday.
Mr Rabin, who said he had called for the quickly-arranged talks, described
them as 'constructive and positive' and a 'very good beginning' to
implementation of the outline peace deal signed on the White House lawns
three weeks ago.
He told reporters: 'We are committed to whatever we signed - but it's not
enough to sign, you have to translate it through negotiation into reality.'
The two leaders accordingly agreed to set up four joint negotiating
committees to cover all aspects of the deal which will give limited
self-rule to the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. At least two of the
groups will convene in Egypt, satisfying in small part a long-standing
Israeli call to move elements of the peace process from Washington to the
Middle East.
The agreement to begin implementation talks on October 13 follows the
schedule of the outline accord signed in Washington. But the progress came
as a surprise, given PLO anger over recent tough Israeli security operations
against Palestinian activists in Gaza and the West Bank. PLO officials had
accused Israel of 'flagrant violation of the spirit' of the accord.
But while Mr Rabin declined to repeat his historic Washington handshake with
Mr Arafat for the benefit of the cameras, and the leaders insisted on
separate news conferences, no such bitterness was allowed to mar what Mr
Rabin called simply 'a working meeting'.
Under yesterday's agreement, Israel and the PLO will form a joint liaison
committee at ministerial level to supervise implementation of the outline
peace deal.
This group will start work in Cairo next Wednesday. The same day a second
joint committee will start talks in Taba, the Egyptian Red Sea resort near
the Israeli border, on the Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza and
Jericho. The pull-out is set to start on December 13. A third economic
committee will also be established, the details and venue for which will be
decided by the liaison committee.
A further series of talks will continue under the framework of the
22-month-old Washington peace talks on the powers of a Palestinian Council
due for election in July and details of Palestinian 'early empowerment' over
a range of administrative and civic functions across the West Bank.
The separate bilateral talks between Israel and its other Arab neighbours -
Jordan, Syria and Lebanon - are expected to continue in the US capital. No
date has been set for the resumption of these talks since the adjournment of
the 11th round last month.
Mr Arafat also suggested there was progress on the supremely contentious
issue of Jerusalem's status, saying they had appointed negotiators to
discuss proposals to include in the peace process the city both sides
consider as their historic capital. 'We agreed from my side (PLO negotiator)
Faisal Husseini and someone else from the Israeli side will be appointed to
deal with the issue of Jerusalem,' Mr Arafat said.
But an Israeli official dismissed the notion that anyone had been detailed
to deal with Jerusalem at this stage, saying the city's status was a subject
only for talks on a permanent solution in more than two years' time. Where
Jerusalem was concerned Israel had agreed only to 'look into' PLO requests
that Palestinians from the occupied territories be allowed freer access to
the city. Israel currently limits the numbers of Palestinians allowed to
cross from the West Bank and Gaza.
Both sides had agreed to defer the issue of Jerusalem during the secret Oslo
negotiations which led up to the breakthrough agreement signed last month.
In the Cairo meeting hosted by President Hosni Mubarak, Mr Rabin resisted
any ceremonials, telling reporters: 'We believe the time has come to move
from ceremonies, photo opportunities, handshakes, to move from that to
business'.
Neither did Mr Rabin offer any 'confidence-building' gestures, such as the
release of Palestinian detainees in Israel, which Mr Arafat was believed to
have sought. Discussion of Israeli security operations in Gaza and the West
Bank were also referred to the new liaison committee next week.

GOVERNOR Chris Patten of Hong Kong yesterday denied that proposed
legislation banning cross-media ownership was aimed at Mr Robert Kuok, the
Malaysian businessman who recently bought a controlling interest in the
South China Morning Post from Mr Rupert Murdoch for Dollars 349m (Pounds
230m).
The governor was responding to comments made by Dr Mahathir Mohamad,
Malaysia's prime minister, who alleged that the legislation was directed at
Mr Kuok, who owns 20 per cent of Television Broadcasts, Hong Kong's most
popular television station.
Mr Patten said Dr Mahathir was 'curiously ill-informed' about the law in
Hong Kong. He said the legislation, expected to be tabled next April, would
not be retrospective. 'It's certainly not possible,' he said. 'If you start
being retrospective about cross-media ownership, at what point do you
begin?'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAELI officials have reacted with shock to a Clinton administration
decision to cut by almost a quarter an aid package intended to help Israel
finance absorption of immigrants from the former Soviet Union.
Under an arrangement reached towards the end of the Bush administration, the
US agreed to grant Israel loan guarantees worth Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) a
year for five years, enabling Israel to raise funds at lower interest rates
on the international market. The one condition was that the annual Dollars
2bn figure would be cut, dollar for dollar, by the sum Israel spent on
settlement activity in the occupied territories.
This week, the US State Department announced that, in accordance with that
penalty clause, the administration would be authorising only Dollars 1.563bn
worth of loan guarantees for fiscal 1994.
This is a cut of Dollars 437m, reflecting Israeli government spending over
the past year on housing, road building, education and other services for
Jewish settlers in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem.
Mr Avraham Shochat, Israel's finance minister, says Israel is now seeking
'clarifications' of the penalty. Privately, officials say they foresaw a cut
of only Dollars 100m.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, has greatly reduced spending on
settlements since taking office. Much of the Dollars 437m figure, say
officials, represents the fulfilment of contracts agreed by the previous,
pro-settlement, Likud coalition.
Mr Ya'acov Frenkel, governor of the Bank of Israel, has stressed the cut
will have negligible economic impact. When Israel first sought the aid
package, it expected having to house an annual 200,000 new immigrants from
the former Soviet Union. But immigration is running at considerably less
than half that number.
Israeli officials are upset by the political implication: an apparent
get-tough message from the US to Israel at a time when Mr Rabin needs
Washington's full support for his sensitive negotiations with the PLO on
autonomy in the occupied territories.

Russia needs Dollars 30bn-Dollars 50bn a year in foreign investment until
the end of the century to help revive its economy, the economics ministry
said yesterday, Reuter reports.
Foreign entrepreneurs were expected to invest Dollars 1.5bn-Dollars 2bn a
year up to 1995. Investment last year had been Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m.
'From 1996 to 2000, the flow of foreign capital into the Russian economy
could grow to Dollars 2.5bn-Dollars 7bn a year,' the ministry said. The
number of people working at enterprises with foreign capital could grow to
4m by 2000 from 200,000 last year.

climate

IF RUSSIAN reformers are wondering how western business reacted to this
week's bloodshed, they could take some comfort from the Moscow manager of
Perestroika, a Russian-US joint venture construction company.
Yesterday morning, Mr Peter Degermark wrote to Moscow's deputy mayor
congratulating him on suppressing the rebels - a victory he believes will
open the way for more western business in Russia.
But though his relief at President Boris Yeltsin's victory was echoed across
the business community in Moscow yesterday, western businesses remain far
from ready to rush into Russia.
Mr Yeltsin may have ended the paralysis between the parliament and
government, but sorting out the relationship between the regions and the
centre will be as crucial for investment, they say.
Scepticism remains about how fast the president can turn his rhetoric into
consistent legislation. For the moment at least, most businesses are still
nervously assessing the aftermath of the turmoil.
Mr Jean Yves-Durel, eastern European regional sales representative for
General Electric, said although he had been 'very afraid' on Sunday that a
victory for Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov would have 'pushed them back' and created
a climate hostile to western investment, GE was now pressing ahead,
convinced that 'Russia is a huge market for the year 2000'.
Mr George Reese, Moscow manager of Ernst and Young echoed the optimism,
pointing out that dissolution of parliament had removed the key obstacle to
business reform.
But the business community is aware Mr Yeltsin has repeatedly frittered away
opportunities. And with parliament now suspended, there are fears that badly
needed tax and investment laws could be delayed again, or introduced by
presidential decree in the interim and then amended by any future
parliament.
'We just don't know what the situation with laws is now that there is no
parliament,' says Mr Anders Morland, resident manager of Amoco, the US oil
group. 'Until you have the legislation in place you can't expect major
investment.' Mr Morland predicts it will be at least a year before there is
any large investment by oil and gas companies.
One group that has, ironically, benefited inadvertently from events has been
foreign banks. Parliament had been due to debate a plan to ban foreign banks
in Russia from taking deposits from Russians from next January to 1996.
But Mr Sergei Yegorov, head of the Russian Bankers' Union, suggested on
Tuesday that although Russian banks needed protection from foreign
competition there was little point reversing the terms of licences already
given to foreign banks.
Nevertheless, Mr Jurgen Woller, representative of Dresdner Bank, which has
recently opened a joint subsidiary with Banque Nationale de Paris in St
Petersburg, insists that reforming the banking law is a priority. Meanwhile,
as Mr Hans Jochum Horn, Moscow director of Arthur Andersen, the accountancy
firm, points out, a clearer monetary framework is also essential.
The other great challenge for the government, he notes, will be sorting out
the relationship between regions and centre. With the regions increasingly
independent - and in some areas, significantly more reformist - threats by
Mr Yeltsin to impose greater control are viewed with concern.
Mr Gerald Presky, representative of John Brown and Davy Metals, said: 'It
will be difficult to bring the regions back into the fold - it would not be
good for investors.' John Brown has a clutch of projects in the regions and
has found, he says, that local officials are often far more open to
investors than central government.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Crisis in Russia: Moscow hints it may breach troop cuts
treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA has issued a veiled threat that it will breach the terms of the
Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) disarmament treaty unless it is
allowed to raise the ceilings on its forces in the Caucasus region.
President Boris Yeltsin wrote to leaders of several Nato states last month
seeking to change the accord, but this is being firmly resisted.
The initiative is seen as part of Mr Yeltsin's recent campaign to win the
favour of the senior Russian military establishment.
The CFE treaty, cutting holdings of tanks, armoured vehicles, artillery,
helicopters and aircraft in Europe, was signed in 1990 when the Warsaw Pact
and the Soviet Union were both intact. Russia and other former Soviet
republics agreed on how to share out the cuts at a summit in Tashkent in May
last year. But Russia now sees this arrangement as having left it too weakly
armed on its southern flank.
Diplomats at Nato said the Russians had not gone so far as to threaten
withdrawal, but had warned that they might resort to measures outside the
treaty. This was seen as implying that they might move equipment beyond the
limits set in the treaty. Turkey, the Nato member which would be most
affected, has asked allies to oppose the moving of additional Russian
forces.
Russia raised the issue earlier at the Joint Consultative Group which meets
in Vienna to oversee implementation of the CFE treaty.
A breach of the treaty would be taken 'very seriously' by allies, diplomats
said. Nato would try instead to persuade Russia to make use of the treaty's
flexibility over forces in the 'flank zone', which includes Russia's North
Caucasus military district. The treaty, they said, gave it leeway to move
equipment to the Caucasus from the Leningrad district, also part of the
flank zone.
They added that Russia did not, in any case, have to meet its ceilings until
November 1995, the deadline for full implementation of the treaty. 'They
have two years to do whatever they want in the Caucasus,' one commented.
Nato opposes an amendment to the treaty because it fears that would prompt
demands for changes from other countries, undermining the whole accord.
Poland has told Colonel Vladimir Lomakin, the Russian military attache in
Warsaw, to leave because of 'activities incompatible with his status as a
diplomat', the Polish Press Agency said yesterday.
Defence Ministry officials in Warsaw refused to confirm that Col Lomakin's
opposite number in Moscow, General Roman Harmoza, had also been expelled,
saying he had been recalled to Warsaw for 'consultations'.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Crisis in Russia: Fuse burns low on unemployment time-bomb -
Russia's hidden jobless rate will not remain so for long
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO largest barriers to a radical economic reform process in Russia were
the parliament and fear of the effects of radicalism on employment. Only the
latter remains, but it could soon be a critical problem.
Officially, unemployment is still low: around 800,000. But hidden
unemployment is much higher, according to Mr Fyodor Prokopov, head of the
federal employment service. Sooner or later, the part-time work ploys and
unpaid 'holidays' that constitute hidden unemployment will emerge as real
job losses.
'The situation of hidden unemployment cannot last,' says Mr Prokopov. . .
'We have no good figures on this, but we estimate at least 3m people are in
this kind of situation (holidays without pay). Beyond that, many more are on
occasional work regimes, or very part-time work. In all, we reckon between
5m and 7m would be really unemployed in normal conditions.' That is 7-10 per
cent of the working population even before large-scale bankruptcies begin.
The city of Ivanovsk, Russia's textile centre, which has been hit hard by a
loss of market, and even more a loss of cheap raw material from Central
Asia, is a case in point. Factories there have had to close or partly close
 -the official unemployment rate is a mere 4 per cent - in part because the
region's administration has introduced a subsistence wage for people who
remain on companies' books but have neither work nor pay.
'In such a region, and in others, the figure could easily and quickly reach
20 per cent or more, once the hidden unemployment becomes open,' says Mr
Prokopov.
The federal employment service, a creation of the past two years, is 'too
weak yet to assist very much', according to Mr Prokopov. Unused to working
with the service, neither workers without work nor employers requiring
workers inform their local employment bureaux - both still rely on the
traditional word of mouth, friends or relatives.
The employment service is one of the many stepchildren of a government
desperately strapped for cash and too obliged, at least until now, to
subsidise enterprises to prevent their bankruptcy to spare much for a
service which would cope with bankruptcy's results. It has had some
assistance from the German, Canadian, British and Scandinavian governments,
but a World Bank Dollars 70m loan has not been taken up because the finance
ministry is struggling to keep down debt.
Perhaps because of the reluctance of the government to move, labour
militancy is very low. Mr Igor Yourgens, first deputy president of the
General Confederation of Trade Unions (the branch of the old official unions
which groups all the former Soviet era republican unions) says 'people have
their heads down. The government has a clear field for action. Not only is
the parliament gone but unions cannot stimulate militancy in members'.
However, this may change slowly. One of the many decrees passed after
parliament was banned removed the unions' responsibility to administer the
social security system, one of their largest tasks. The intention was to
start creating a system clearly run by the state. The other effect may be to
make the unions more independent of a state on which they have traditionally
depended, and create a far more combative relationship.
The spectre of unemployment concerns more than a few Russian officials. Last
month, the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation, a new UK
think-tank, called for a Dollars 10bn safety net to cushion the effects of
mass unemployment - which it estimated would rise to 10m-11m - to allow
benefit to be paid at the rate of around Rbs16,000-Rbs17,000 (about Dollars
180) a month, less than half the average wage.
It remains the most feared threat: yet it is an inescapable companion of
reform. Once the present government drafts its economic programme, and Mr
Boris Fyodorov, deputy finance minister, presents his budget which will now
have no parliamentary opposition to countermand it, we will be able to see
how real the threat is.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Franc fears for Belgian social pact talks: The country faces
a challenge with possible effects far beyond its borders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST OF the time, it does not seem to matter to many people inside Belgium,
let alone outside the country, what its government gets up to.
But if the country's 18-month-old centre-left coalition fails to meet the
latest economic challenge to its authority, the repercussions could be felt
far beyond the kingdom's borders. Government, employers and unions are
trying to negotiate a 'social pact' - a consensus on how to improve
companies' competitiveness, reduce labour costs and create jobs.
This is not the usual search for a traditional Belgian compromise, the
cornerstone of daily political life in this complex country. The last time
the Belgian government set itself a similar target was in 1944. This time,
the stakes are much higher.
Government forecasts indicate that if nothing is done about generous welfare
payments, the country's social security deficit could rise to more than
BFr70bn (Pounds 1.3bn) next year. That in turn would have repercussions for
the country's national budget deficit, which was nearly 7 per cent of gross
domestic product last year. It must come down to 3 per cent in 1996 if
Belgium is to meet the Maastricht treaty's criteria for founder membership
of a European monetary union. Public debt, meanwhile, stands at more than
120 per cent of GDP, compared with Maastricht's aim that it should be moving
towards 60 per cent.
However, it is the short-term consequences of failure in the social pact
negotiations which most frighten Belgian economists, government officials
and central bankers.
They fear failure could prompt a final speculative assault on the Belgian
franc, which has been under increasing pressure on the exchange markets.
Since early August, when currencies of the European exchange rate mechanism
were allowed to fluctuate more widely against the D-Mark, Belgium's central
bank has stuck to its strict policy of shadowing the German currency. But
weekly reaffirmation of this policy by the central bank has not prevented
rumours circulating about possible devaluation of the Belgian franc.
'Something must come out of (the social pact negotiations), because
otherwise there will be chaos on the exchange markets,' says Mr Diederik
Thibaut, an economist at Kredietbank in Brussels.
Even the faintest prospect of devaluation has prompted a bout of concern
within the EC and in neighbouring Luxembourg, which is part of a 71-year-old
currency association with Belgium. Some 40 per cent of the Grand Duchy's
imports come from Germany, and Luxembourg is already examining just how much
of the economic pain of devaluation it could bear before questioning the
future of the currency association itself.
The weakness of the Belgian currency is also worrying senior Commission
officials, because depreciation would undermine the central core of
currencies which surround the D-Mark, and cast further doubt on the
timetable for European economic and monetary union.
Belgium's recent history on budget negotiations only adds to outsiders'
concerns about the social pact negotiations. When the government was forced
to find a further BFr110bn to prop up the country's public finances in
March, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's pugnacious prime minister, had to
offer his resignation - formally rejected by the late king - to persuade the
coalition partners of the seriousness of the matter.
On this occasion, however, the Belgian government believes that the sheer
weight of responsibility - at a time when Belgium holds the presidency of
the EC - will be enough to prevent the negotiations breaking down.
The biggest taboo which government, unions and employers will have to
confront is the future of Belgium's system of wage indexation, which pegs
wage increases to price increases. Scrapping the system altogether would be
politically impossible for the socialist members of the coalition. But it is
clear to all economists that if Belgium is to regain a competitive advantage
the mechanism will have to be amended.
Possible solutions to the problem include freezing the indexation process,
or removing from the price index items such as tobacco, alcohol and fuel.
The latter proposal - which already seems to have some support from the
French-speaking socialist coalition members - would avoid the benefit of new
indirect taxes being undercut by an increase in inflation and, consequently,
wages.
The government is confident that, if a social pact is achieved, it can meet
the Maastricht targets on the budget deficit and do enough to convince its
EC partners that Belgium would be a worthy member of a currency union. And
Mr Dehaene, a veteran of several hard-fought compromises, has already warned
that, if the negotiations fail, the government will act on its own to tackle
the problem of labour costs, unemployment and the looming deficit.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GREECE'S year-on-year inflation rate declined to 12.8 per cent in September,
reaching its lowest level in the past decade, according to the official
statistical service.
The September rate was down from 14.6 per cent in August, the sharpest
monthly drop this year. It reflects both the government's success in holding
down price increases and the effects of continuing recession.
The statistical service noted that lower prices for fruit and vegetables,
which account for a sizeable portion of household spending in Greece, and a
freeze on fees at private schools contributed to the decline.
It predicted that year-on-year inflation would drop to 11.5 per cent by
December, below the economy ministry's latest forecast of 12 per cent.
However, this would still be more than three times the average rate in the
rest of the European Community.
Containing inflation has been a priority under the Conservative government's
stabilisation programme.
The opposition Socialists are committed to a similar policy if they win
Sunday's general election.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Court rules on equal pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Court of Justice yesterday ruled that employers are not liable
to pay equal pensions to men and women for any period of service before a
landmark ruling in May 1990.
The judgment was issued in connection with one of four cases before the
court. The court was asked to interpret its earlier ruling that pensions are
effectively deferred pay and that employers may not discriminate between men
and women on pay.
Yesterday, the court issued its ruling in the case of Mr Ten Oever who sued
his late wife's pension scheme on the grounds that it provided survivors'
benefits to widows and not to widowers. .Mr Ten Oever asked the court to
decide whether the scheme must also pay benefits to men. The court declared
that pension schemes could not discriminate between men and women in
survivor's benefits, but only in respect of service after May 17 1990.
The case decided by the court in May 1990, Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange,
left key questions about pension equality unanswered, including whether
employers would have to make enhanced pension payments retroactively before
the judgment was issued.
European governments had argued that full retrospection for pensions could
cost employers throughout the EC up to Pounds 100bn in back-payments. Until
May 1990, employers in most EC countries allowed women to retire on full
pensions at 60 while requiring men to work until 65 before receiving the
same benefit. Thus, women had been receiving more generous pensions than
men.
'The court has decided to settle the retrospection question for once and for
all,' said Mr Geoffrey Furlonger, head of EC practice at consulting
actuaries William M Mercer Ltd.
The Ten Oever case was one of a group of cases brought before the court to
try to resolve matters related to retrospection. However, the court has yet
to rule on the most complicated of those cases, that of a group of former
employees of Coloroll, the former UK home furnishings company now in
administration.
The court must there decide how employers are to pay equal pensions despite
the fact that women live longer than men and thus require more money to
finance the same level of benefit. The UK insurance industry and groups of
European actuaries have asked the court to consider whether life insurance
companies which sell annuities to provide pensions must base their rates on
'unisex' actuarial tables which ignore women's greater longevity.

POLISH miners yesterday ended their occupation of coal-mining industry
management offices in Silesia after winning promises of redundancy
settlements twice as generous as those enjoyed by the country's remaining
2.7m unemployed.
The coal industry is facing the prospect of reducing its workforce from
320,000 to 200,000 by the end of the century, and the agreement will serve
as a benchmark for other workers in heavy industry.
The 2,500 miners at the loss-making Zory pit, which is to close by the end
of next year, also went back to work yesterday after a two-week strike
called after redundancy notices were served on the first of 500 men to lose
their jobs this year.
Under the agreement signed between coal industry management and the unions,
miners made redundant as a result of closures will be entitled to 24 months
of pay at half basic rates but not less than 3m zlotys (Pounds 100) a month.
At present, normal unemployment benefit amounting to 1.4m zlotys a month
runs for only one year.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Mitterrand risks Paris split on N-weapons tests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand said yesterday that France and other atomic
powers should 'keep their cool' and refrain from following Beijing in
breaking the recent unofficial moratorium in nuclear weapons testing.
The president, in an interview with Austrian media, went beyond a bland
statement issued jointly with Prime Minister Edouard Balladur which merely
said France would consult with the US, Britain and Russia about possible
reaction to the Chinese move. The socialist president has thus risked a
split with the conservative government which is under pressure from its MPs
and the defence establishment to reverse the unilateral moratorium the
preceding Socialist government imposed on French testing in the South
Pacific in April 1992.
Mr Jacques Baumel, Gaullist vice-president of parliament's defence
committee, said yesterday the Chinese move was 'a new and good reason' for
France to resume necessary modernisation of its nuclear arsenal. This week
Mr Balladur, who is committed to keeping the nuclear deterrent up to date,
received a report from military-industrial leaders on the issue of testing.
It is said to favour France resuming at least a few tests until it has
improved its ability to simulate nuclear tests results by computer. The
issue falls in the area of foreign and defence policy where decisions have
to be shared by French presidents and prime minister even when they are of
different political parties.

SPANISH political leaders and Volkswagen, the German automotive group,
reached broad agreement yesterday on a plan for VW to rid itself of the
Barcelona factory of its lossmaking Seat subsidiary, while protecting
Spain's government from the political fall-out of heavy job losses in
Catalonia.
Further talks will be held soon, to include union leaders, to decide the
fate of the outdated Zona Franca works and the 10,500 employed on the site,
VW said last night. A solution is expected before the end of the year.
Ideas proposed yesterday are believed to include converting the factory into
an industrial park and establishing a state-owned employment company to deal
with those who lose their jobs.
The deal was agreed during talks in Madrid and Barcelona led by Mr Ferdinand
Piech, VW group chairman, Mr Narcis Serra, deputy prime minister, and Mr
Jordi Pujol, leader of the Catalonian government.
The agreement sees a significant relaxation of the conditions under which
Seat is to be given a DM1.5bn (Pounds 600m) cash injection. Ownership of the
Spanish company's Pamplona factory, used exclusively to build VW Polo
models, will not now be transferred to the German parent. Although
operations will be 'steered' by VW, it will remain under Spanish management.
The government said Mr Piech and Mr Serra had agreed to find a solution
which involves an increase in productivity for Seat to recover its
competitiveness. That is likely to mean VW will insist on the loss of most
of the jobs at Zona Franca, although some workers may be found places at
Seat's new plant at Martorell, around 30km from Barcelona.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Top German official says Emu on track
</HEADLINE>

EUROPE remains on track for economic and monetary union, in spite of the
August upheaval in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary
System, Germany's top finance official said yesterday.
Mr Gert Haller, the recently appointed state secretary in the Finance
Ministry, said that all the EC member states which kept their currencies
close together within the broad band ERM after August 2 had proved justified
in resisting calls for rapid interest rate cuts.
'It proves that those countries are determined to pursue a sensible
financial and monetary policy, even without the (narrow band) exchange rate
corset,' he said in an interview. 'If we carry on like this to next year, we
won't need this corset. Then it will be no problem to get back to narrow
bands eventually.'
He said he was looking for three conclusions from the special EC summit
planned for October 29. The first was a statement that 'things are not going
badly in monetary Europe'. The second was to allow the situation to 'develop
calmly without any grand new schemes'.
And the highest priority was for the EC member states to commit themselves
to pursuing economic policies aimed at ever-greater convergence, which would
allow the Emu programme to remain within its timetable, aimed at eventual
union by 1999.
Mr Haller, who was one of Germany's key negotiators for Emu in the
Maastricht treaty, said it was impossible to predict what the situation
would be like in 1999, and admitted that the second phase of Emu, due to
begin on January 1, might last longer than foreseen. He said it was
essential to keep the 'grey area' of monetary policy responsibility, when
central banks will exist alongside the planned European monetary institute,
as restricted as possible.
At the meeting on Monday of the EC monetary committee, Mr Haller pointed out
that long-term interest rates had fallen in all those EC member states which
had kept their currencies close together since August 2, with the exception
of Belgium and Ireland, which remained stable.
'That is also a sign that the market is convinced that the member states
will continue to follow a reasonable stability-oriented monetary policy,' he
said.
He defended in particular the French government for refusing to cut its
interest rates too swiftly. 'What would the French have gained if they had
gone for short-term interest rate cuts?' he asked. 'They would have incurred
exchange rate risks. The markets have a memory like an elephant. The French
would have made a mess of their reputation for a very long time.'
Mr Haller was given a baptism of fire as state secretary, when he had to
attend the EC monetary committee on August 2 to resolve the ERM crisis. He
confirmed he was the first to propose the move to a wider fluctuation band
from the former 2.5 per cent band.
The broad bands within the ERM meant that currency speculators now faced
currency risk in the opposite direction to the former narrow bands. As a
result they have been much less willing to speculate.
He would not forecast when the narrow band 'corset' might be reintroduced,
but insisted: 'It will not be a problem. It is actually a much more credible
policy than by forcing ourselves into a corset.
'If the wrong policies are pursued, then the corset becomes a problem in
itself. That is the lesson we have learned.'

<TEXT>
FRANCE is soon likely to show a further drop in economic activity, which
will only pick up in the second half of next year thanks to a belated German
recovery, OFCE, a leading Paris forecasting institute, said yesterday.
The main reason why OFCE predicts that France's gross domestic product will
grow by only 0.3 per cent in 1994, far below the government's median
forecast of 1.4 per cent growth, is that the country's major partner,
Germany, will not see recovery in its economy until the latter part of 1994,
and even then first in German exports rather than imports. In last month's
presentation of its 1994 budget plan, the government gave a revival in
foreign demand for French goods as its main reason for sticking in its 1.4
per cent growth estimate.
In the shorter term, OFCE is also more pessimistic than the government. It
predicts that economic activity, stable in July-September after four
successive quarters of decline, will now fall again by 0.2 per cent in the
last quarter of this year and in the first three months of 1994.
France may thus suffer a 'double dip' recession, because the government's
very modest fiscal reflation this year and next - unsupported by any real
relaxation so far in monetary policy - may not be enough to break the
vicious circle between consumers' and companies' expectations that
unemployment will continue to rise, their consequent disinclination to spend
and invest more, and the knock-on effect that this has in the form of still
more job lay-offs.
The upshot, according to OFCE, is that unemployment will continue to rise -
to 3.4m, or 12.4 per cent of the workforce, by the end of this year and to
3.7m, or 13.6 per cent, by end-1994. Mr Jean-Paul Fitoussi, head of OFCE,
said the government's five-year employment law, which cleared the national
assembly on Tuesday, and which introduces some new flexibility into pay
rates and work patterns, was a move in the right direction, but not radical
enough to shorten the dole queues much in the near term.
With the absence of any clear panacea for France's chronic unemployment now
making the political debate a bit less partisan, Mrs Martine Aubry, labour
minister in the last Socialist government, unveiled on Tuesday night a new
research foundation on employment issues.
It has an initial FFr39m (Pounds 4.54m) capital provided by a number of
company chairmen, many of them on the right in French politics.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT a third of the German workforce is ready to accept real pay cuts this
year, even before the main annual negotiating rounds get under way.
As union officials yesterday continued their campaign against employers'
calls for a wages freeze, two opinion polls suggested that between 31 and 35
per cent of the working population is apparently resigned to lower incomes.
While almost 50 per cent said they were prepared to strike in support of
claims for higher wages, union leaders were markedly less belligerent.
Mr Hermann Rappe, the leader of the IG Chemie chemicals industry union, said
his aim was an award equal to the expected inflation rate. Members could not
expect compensation for higher taxes and social welfare contributions, he
said in a radio interview.
Most economists suggest consumer prices next year will rise 3.5 per cent.
The DIW economics institute in Berlin said inflation would be relatively
high because of fuel tax and rent increases. While it predicted cuts in real
earnings, it said a freeze was not the way to recoup lost competitiveness.
According to Mr Rappe, a freeze would reduce purchasing power by 5 per cent,
and this was the last thing the German economy needed at present.
Unconfirmed reports that IG Metall, the engineering union, is considering a
claim of around 6 per cent also suggest that expectations have been greatly
reduced by the continuing recession.
Mr Richard Klein, the leading wages negotiator for local authorities,
yesterday proposed performance-related bonuses and flexible working hours
for public service employees as an alternative to the traditional
across-the-board award.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Brussels probes state aid to Bull computer group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday announced that it had opened a state aid
inquiry into a FFr2.5bn (Pounds 290m) capital injection granted to the
French state-owned Bull computers group.
The inquiry will focus on the cash which was advanced to Bull by the
previous French government in February. But it could be extended to take
into account subsidies included in a restructuring package presently being
finalised by Bull.
The French Industry Ministry said that the plan, aimed at stemming losses of
FFr15bn at Bull over the past three years, should be completed within the
next week. Bull has demanded a capital injection of FFr9.2bn as part of the
plan.
A spokesman for Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC's competition commissioner, said
yesterday that the Commission's latest inquiry would consider any new
restructuring proposal once it was submitted.
'We are looking only at the FFr2.5bn at the moment, because that's the only
advance which has been made by the French government,' said the spokesman.
Under the EC's state aid rules, the Commission can clear subsidies which are
aimed at restoring the viability of a company, provided they do not distort
competition within the EC.
It is the second time in the past two years that Brussels has investigated
state subsidies to the troubled French computer group. In July last year,
the Commission approved FFr6.6bn of government aid to Bull aimed at funding
research and returning the group to profitability.
French officials say they are optimistic that the EC will regard favourably
its proposals to restructure the computer group. They describe the proposals
as a necessary and final step in the group's reorganisation. The
restructuring package, which has been under negotiation since the new
centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur took office in March, is
expected to include 6,500 job cuts, a reorganisation of the company's
management and the formation of strategic alliances with other groups.
It may also involve an increased participation in Bull's share capital by
NEC, the Japanese computer group, and IBM of the US. The two companies
presently hold stakes of 4.4 per cent and 5.7 per cent respectively.

</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, said yesterday he intends to
press ahead with tough reform of the country's rigid labour market with or
without agreement between employers, the unions and the government in talks
that started earlier this week.
Addressing concern in financial markets that failure so far to agree on a
much vaunted three-year 'social pact' - designed to help drag Spain out of
recession - Mr Gonzalez said the pact was not an end in itself. If by the
end of next month no agreement was reached on a three-year wage moderation
deal, and the labour reforms the government wants, it would impose the
reforms.
'I hope there will be agreement,' Mr Gonzalez said in his first newspaper
interview since being elected to a fourth term in office last June.
He said the pact was an instrument to create the conditions in which more
jobs could be created, to provide competitiveness. 'We obviously cannot
force pay levels on employers and workers (but) if there is not a pact, the
government will apply the necessary measures within its competence.'
The first phase of the tripartite social pact talks ended badly last week.
The three sides had been discussing pension increases, jobless benefits,
civil service pay and reactivating the economy when the government, forced
to present a budget to parliament by September 30, ran out of time and
included its own conservative targets in the budget.
These were now the sovereign business of parliament, Mr Gonzalez said,
implying that it was no longer possible to discuss them with the unions.
This week the second and final phase of the talks began - on a global
three-year agreement to hold wage rises below inflation, on labour market
reform, including traditional forms of collective bargaining, and on
introducing more flexible lay-off procedures.
Mr Gonzalez said he recognised that the pact talks were 'very difficult' for
the unions. 'We are talking about a pact with special characteristics,' he
said, in which the unions were being asked to make sacrifices. He said the
government was trying to improve the employment situation through gains in
competitiveness. 'We are not saying, 'I will give you this and you will give
that'. The big problem is that the government has nothing to give in
exchange.'
The unions have issued threats of action against the government's hard line
in the talks, but are thought to be in too weak a position to hurt the
government. Mr Gonzalez indicated he did not expect to have too much trouble
getting the budget passed, even though his socialists are now in a minority
in parliament.

A RENEWED United Nations peacekeeping mandate for former Yugoslavia began on
a bleak note yesterday, with Moslems, Serbs and Croats renewing their
struggle for territory in Bosnia, Reuter reports from Sarajevo.
As Serbs and Croats said they would make no more territorial concessions to
the Moslems, all three sides reported flare-ups on several fronts across
Bosnia. Sarajevo radio reported that Croat forces had used Moslem prisoners
as 'human shields' in an attempt to break through government positions in
central Bosnia, killing a number of people.
The Moslem-controlled radio claimed the Croats wired explosives to the
Moslems, who had been held at a Croat-run internment camp, and marched them
towards the frontline at Isakovici, near Novi Travnik.
Fighting was also reported around Maglaj in north-central Bosnia, and in
eastern Bosnia in the Zvornik region and Olovo, Bosnian radio said.
The UN said Maglaj, a mainly Moslem town, was under its 100th day of siege
by Croat and Serb forces, and Mostar's Moslem quarter was under increased
Croat shelling.
All sides reported some sniping and shelling in Sarajevo, and sniper fire
could be heard during the morning.

FT  07 OCT 93 / France prepares to reform state-run pension system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government has started to prepare proposals for its long-awaited
reform of the pension system with a view to presenting a legislative package
to parliament next spring.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, has formed a working party to
produce provisional proposals for reform of the existing state-controlled
system.
At present the working party is operating on an informal basis. However, Mr
Alphandery hopes to have finalised the details of the package by the end of
the year.
Pension reform is one of the most pressing and complex issues on the French
government's financial agenda.
The system worked well in the 1950s and 1960s when France had a large, young
working population. But it now faces collapse as the population has aged and
a proportionally smaller group of workers struggles to support a growing
number of pensioners.
The simplest solution would be to alleviate the pressure on the state system
by encouraging the French to invest in private pensions. However, previous
governments have baulked from the electorally risky task of persuading the
French to pay extra for their own private pensions while continuing in the
state system.
Mr Alphandery is said to be determined to change the system. His ministry
has already demonstrated an ability to devise original schemes, notably the
'Balladur bond', which raised FFr110bn (Pounds 12.8bn) covered by
privatisation sales of the same amount over the next 18 months.

FT  07 OCT 93 / EC central bank expected to be in Germany
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community sum-mit at the end of this month in Brussels is
likely to decide to place the future European central bank in Germany, Mr
Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, said yesterday.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Gonzalez said the expected
decision, dashing British hopes of bringing the central bank to London,
would help rebuild political momentum towards the goal of economic and
monetary union.
The site for the European Monetary Institute, to be set up next year as the
forerunner of the planned EC central bank, would reflect Germany's prime
role in the anti-inflation 'economic philosophy' behind Emu, he said.
'I believe - and everyone else believes the same - that it (the institute)
will be in Germany.'
He admitted the EC currency crisis had placed 'a tremendous question mark'
over whether the EC would accomplish the Maastricht timetable for Emu by
1997 or, at the latest, 1999.
After the emergency move in August to wider currency fluctuation bands, he
said the EC was unlikely to decide a firm date for returning to the previous
narrow bands within the EMS. 'We don't want to be trapped by dates.'
But he refused to endorse recent claims by Mr John Major, the UK prime
minister, that the Maastricht timetable was now unrealistic. Mr Gonzalez
spoke against softening the Maastricht 'convergence' targets designed to
force EC states to curb budget deficits and government debt as conditions
for joining Emu.
Although he admitted that EC budget deficits had been swollen by recession
to well above the Maastricht target of 3 per cent of gross domestic product,
he said: 'I doubt that anyone would want to give up on this convergence plan
. . . the planned convergence targets represent a good path.'
Mr Gonzalez's remarks on the EMI are the clearest prediction so far from an
EC leader that the summit on October 29 will opt for the central bank to be
established in Germany.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Eurofighter setback delays first flight until next year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST flight of the Eurofighter 2000, Europe's Pounds 32bn combat
aircraft project, has been postponed for several more months at least
because of difficulties with the computerised flight-control system.
The first prototype had been expected to fly in Germany this autumn, two
years later than originally planned. It is now thought unlikely to make its
maiden flight before next March at the earliest.
The Munich-based Eurofighter consortium did not give a new target date but
indicated it would not be this year. A Bonn defence official predicted that
the aircraft would not be cleared for flying before next spring.
Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain are jointly funding the Pounds 10bn
development programme for the aircraft.
Eurofighter said the partners had decided to order a further phase of tests
for the flight-control system. The first flight should only take place when
the partners had 'absolute confidence in the airworthiness of the software'.
The software is the responsibility of the UK's GEC-Marconi Avionics as a
subcontractor to Daimler-Benz's Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), which is in
overall charge of the control system. The so-called fly-by-wire system
controls the flaps, rudder and foreplanes - small movable wings at the front
of the aircraft - and the aircraft cannot be flown without it.
Sources close to the project said 'tough negotiations' were now under way
between the industrial partners.
Eurofighter, comprising Dasa, British Aerospace, Alenia of Italy and
Construcciones Aeronauticas of Spain, said it would try to limit the impact
the delay might have on deliveries of the aircraft, due to begin in 2000.
'A further short delay is not considered likely to have a serious impact on
the overall programme,' it said. Britain's Ministry of Defence described the
setback as 'a minor disappointment'. It said: 'Software safety is of
paramount importance and must have priority over any possible delay to the
programme.'
A joint industry task force has been working in Munich since the spring to
resolve the software problems. GEC-Marconi argued earlier in the project
that it needed more processing power than was allowed for by Dasa.
The UK company's development contract is believed to be worth about Pounds
20m, following a 60 per cent increase due to programme changes.
Requirements for the first flight had already been reduced in an effort to
meet a September target date, leaving further work on the system for later.
Programme managers said they needed to ensure the fly-by-wire system worked
in all conceivable circumstances. Concern has increased since the first
production model of Sweden's JAS 39 Gripen jet - a smaller aircraft of
similar design to the Eurofighter - crashed in August. An investigation
found the electronic flight control system was to blame.
The Eurofighter project, relaunched last year after Germany threatened to
withdraw, has suffered other technical problems, involving its electrical
generator and an auxiliary gearbox.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Howard acts to curb crime as Tories shift to the right
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservative party conference gave enthusiastic backing yesterday to
plans announced by cabinet right-wingers for a dual crackdown on criminals
and social security claimants.
Civil liberties groups condemned the announcements, which included the
abolition of the right to silence for defendants in criminal cases and tough
action against benefits claims by non-resident European Community citizens.
Lady Thatcher, who arrived in Blackpool last night, refused to comment on
the announcements or the continuing row over an unflattering description of
Mr John Major expected to be contained in her memoirs to be published later
this month.
However, the conference debates demonstrated the growing confidence among
her supporters that Mr Major is being forced to move towards their position
on crucial issues, including Europe. The prime minister's cabinet supporters
said the right had been encouraged to flex its muscles by a shift in Mr
Major's rhetoric towards the Eurosceptic views endorsed by many rightwing
MPs.
Senior ministers said his attempts to placate the right could backfire by
prompting a rebellion among previously loyal MPs on the centre and left of
the party.
The most striking rightwing intervention came from Mr Peter Lilley, the
social security secretary, who used his speech to launch an attack on EC
social security rules.
Mr Lilley's attack on 'benefits tourism' by EC citizens visiting the UK
contained implied criticism of EC institutions which won sustained applause
from grass-roots members.
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, was also cheered for his promise to
restore 'people's freedom to walk safely on the streets and sleep safely in
their homes'.
He announced a package of 27 initiatives, ranging from new prisons to
greater police powers and support for victims during court cases.
The package was widely regarded as a response to strong campaigning by Mr
Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary, who has challenged the Conservatives'
traditional image as the party of law and order.
It was welcomed by the Police Federation and the Association of Chief Police
Officers, which said it would 'help redress the balance in favour of justice
for victims, witnesses and the mass of law-abiding citizens'.
However, the Prison Officers Association said members would be 'greatly
angered' by Mr Howard's decision to commission private sector companies to
run the extra prisons.
Most attention centred on legal changes announced by Mr Howard which will
allow prosecutors to draw attention to a defendant's refusal to answer
police questions.

FT  07 OCT 93 / Ministers oppose plans for further deep spending cuts:
Rifkind and Lilley resist demands by Treasury to squeeze budgets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FIERCE STRUGGLE has broken out in cabinet over attempts to make deep cuts
in defence and welfare spending as part of the drive to meet public spending
targets for the next three years.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, is demanding a full-scale review of
Britain's armed forces if the Treasury refuses to drop its demands for
further cuts in his budget.
Lady Thatcher last night stepped into the argument by warning against
defence cuts. She told Young Conservatives in Blackpool it was vital for
Britain to maintain a strong defence.
Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, is understood to have
rejected a demand from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, for radical
reductions in a range of welfare benefits.
Several other departments have been forced already to concede in principle
deep cuts in their budgets for the next three years. But senior Whitehall
officials said the gulf between Mr Rifkind and Mr Lilley on one side of the
argument and the Treasury on the other amounted to billions of pounds.
The transport department's roads programme, the environment department's
housing and urban regeneration budgets and the government's subsidy for
local authorities are emerging as the main victims.
The education and health budget also face a tough squeeze but have so far
escaped the worst of the cuts required to meet a freeze in real terms on
overall spending for the two financial years - 1994-95 to 1995-96. For
1996-97 the plans allow for an inflation-adjusted increase of 1 per cent.
Senior Whitehall officials said the row over defence and social security had
stalled the work of EDX, the cabinet committee charged with sharing out the
spending cake. Until the two departments reached a settlement it would be
impossible to finalise other Whitehall budgets.
Mr Clarke admitted at the weekend that the bargaining in EDX had left 'blood
on the carpet' in Whitehall. Mr Rifkind also alluded to the struggle in a
speech to the Conservatives' Blackpool conference. The defence secretary
warned that the cuts in armed forces spending agreed under the Options for
Change programme following the end of the cold war had left the Pounds 23bn
defence budget at close to its acceptable limit.
Mr Rifkind, who earlier this year was forced into an embarrassing U-turn to
save two threatened army regiments, has told the Treasury the additional
billions it is seeking in savings over the next three years would seriously
undermine Britain's defence strategy.
The cuts could only be implemented after a full-scale re-evaluation of
defence requirements and capabilities. The Treasury, however, is aware such
a review could provoke a political storm in which Conservative backbench MPs
would effectively veto significant spending reductions.
Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, has argued that the
cuts are essential to meet the government medium-term spending targets. The
gap between total Whitehall spending bids and the agreed targets is proving
impossible to bridge for 1996-97.
For his part, Mr Lilley has rejected Treasury demands for reductions in his
Pounds 80bn budget going well beyond an agreed clampdown on invalidity
benefit. Among the radical options under discussion in EDX are the
'means-testing' or taxing of child benefit and the transfer to employers of
responsibility for sickness and industrial injury benefits.
Mr Lilley has successfully fought off a suggestion that all benefits should
be frozen rather than uprated in line with inflation next year.
He is also arguing that most of the other cuts demanded by the Treasury
would be defeated by Tory backbench rebellions in the Commons.

FT  06 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Oils slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE, SAQIB QURESHI and CHRISTINE BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A feeling that last week's advance in the oil sector following a production
agreement at OPEC's had been over done, together with general profit-taking,
brought a retreat for many oil stocks.
The biggest decline was in BP which gave up 7 1/2 to 321p, with 5.2m shares
traded. Enterprise Oil fell 8 to 468p, and Shell Transport shed 2 1/2 to
679p.
In their monthly note on the sector, researchers at Strauss Turnbull said
the Opec agreement was, 'a fudged compromise and not a strong agreement
anyway. At best prices could hold at these levels but could easily show
further weakness.'
Hopes of a cut in UK base rates boosted several financial stocks. These
included Gerrard &amp; National 7 up at 515p, Abbey National 10 ahead at 431p.
There was switching out of Scottish Power and into National Power after SG
Warburg advised clients to take profits in the former. The broker said that
dividend and earnings growth at National Power were superior and recommended
switching as, at yesterday's opening share prices, yields on the two shares
were almost identical. Scottish, which hit its all-time high on Monday,
slipped 6 1/2 to 388p in turnover of 6.3m, while National Power added 1 1/2
to 398p.
Shares in British Airways gained 9 1/2 to 368 1/2 p, after traffic data for
September revealed a 14.3 per cent year-on-year increase in passenger
traffic. Some 6.6m shares had been dealt by the close.
International mining group RTZ relinquished 7 to 675p after NatWest
Securities was reported to have downgraded profit expectations.
A strong drinks sector, boosted as one broker highlighted its continuing
recovery potential, saw widespread gains. Bass rose 7 to 475p, Whitbread 7
to 534p and Allied Lyons 8 to 576p.
Hotel-related stocks, hit last Thursday by dull results from Forte,
recovered their losses. Greenalls climbed 10 to 378p, Vaux Group 6 to 248p
and Forte itself 6 to 232p.
Airtours gained 6 to 412p. Smith New Court upgraded the holiday group,
attributed to strong late bookings for summer 1993. The broker, which
remains a strong buyer, is looking for Pounds 45m profits for this year, an
increase of Pounds 3m on its previous estimate.
Ladbroke shook off the remnants of negative press comment and rumours to
close 3 ahead at 181p. Manchester United continued to reflect its good
football league form, the shares jumping 26 to 557p.
Food retail shares continued their good run following further positive
noises from BZW and UBS. Argyll gained 5 to 303 1/2 p, Kwik Save 11 to 679p,
J Sainsbury 9 1/2 to 438p and Tesco 8 to 208p.
Food manufacturer Unilever began a week of meetings with analysts, with
Strauss Turnbull reiterating its buy recommendation. The shares put on 5 to
1063p.
Stores stocks were generally dull, although some of the second liners took
time to do some catching up. Among these, Signet, the former Ratners group,
climbed 1 1/2 to 29 1/4 p, Pentos 2 to 45p and Argos 6 to 347p.
Boots and WH Smith exacted further mileage from reports that they are about
to impose swingeing cuts on their loss-making Do It All home improvements
division. Boots added 4 to 485p and Smith 6 to 448p.
Construction group Raine slipped 6 to 84p after announcing full-year profits
of Pounds 10.8m against Pounds 10m, and a dividend halved to 3p. Analysts
had expected profits of around Pounds 11.5m and a dividend of 4p. However,
many believe that the group still has good recovery potential via the
reviving housing market.
RMC Group climbed 7 to 833p and Redland 9 to 565p as news of Russian
stability calmed German markets where both have a vested interest. Spring
Ram gained 2 to 63p on renewed speculation of a possible takeover from the
US.
Motors group Bostrom gained 8 to 182p. Analysts suggested a buyer had
purchased a large quantityof stock since the weekend.
T&amp;N bounced back 4 1/2 to 188p after conveying confidence over the outcome
of its legal battle in the US. But motors specialists expect the stock to
remain volatile until after the broadcasting of a BBC documentary film which
is expected to repeat allegations of property related asbestos claims later
this month.
The poor fortunes of Wellcome puzzled many market watchers as the stock
climbed 10 and then fell sharply back to close 11 down at 699p. The thin
volume of 1.6m gave creedence to the belief that one sale was responsible
for the decline.
Also weak was Fisons which gave up 2 to 161p. Pharmaceutical analysts pinned
the blame on a weak launch of its drug Tilade in the US.
However, Glaxo benefited from a buy note from Hoare Govett amid generally
positive sentiment surrounding the stock. It moved up 10 to 649p in a
turnover of 4.1m. Hoare's Mr Nigel Barnes said that the expected aggressive
dividend growth and the dispelling of some clouds over the outlook for the
company meant a significant strengthening of its sentiment.
The announcement that SG Warburg owns 10 per cent of the ordinary shares of
Zeneca came as the stock climbed 8 to 737p.

FINBREDA, the quoted finance company of the Breda group and part of Efim,
the state-run industrial holding company, is to be placed in liquidation
following the announcement of a loss of L232bn (Dollars 146m) in the first
half of this year on top of 1992 losses of L359bn.
The company said the losses were mainly due to financial charges relating to
defence subsidiaries Oto Melara and Breda Meccanica Bresciana.
The move forms part of the overall liquidation of Efim set in motion in July
1992. The defence units are being merged with Finmeccanica, the engineering
arm of state-owned IRI.

FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: CarnaudMetalbox plans sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING and CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CARNAUDMETALBOX, the Anglo-French packaging group, plans to sell its
high-performance plastics division to Huhtamaki, the Finnish consumer
products group.
The sale, which is subject to the signing of an agreement by the middle of
this month, comprises all CarnaudMetalbox's activities in the division,
which supplies rigid plastic packaging for the food industry. The division
has factories in France, Northern Ireland, Italy and Portugal. It employs
about 750 people and achieved sales last year of FFr650m (Dollars 112m).
CarnaudMetalbox would not disclose the value of the disposal or the profits
of the division.
The Anglo-French group said it was selling the division because it
represented only about 7 per cent of the European market for rigid plastic
packaging and conditions required a stronger presence.
Mr Jurgen Hintz, chief executive, said the sale would allow CarnaudMetalbox
to focus on its main strategic activities where it has technological and
marketing leadership.
Mr Timo Peltola, Huhtamaki's chief executive, said the acquisition
complemented Polarcup, the company's own packaging division, which last year
had net sales of FM1.8bn (Dollars 316m). 'Although already Europe's leading
company in the field, Polarcup has had no manufacturing presence in France
or Italy. The acquisition will also strengthen our product range in dairy
and other food containers,' he said.
The Finnish group said it may launch an international equity issue to
finance the deal.
It also disclosed a 9 per cent rise in profits after financial items to
FM307m for the first eight months and maintained its prediction that its
full-year result would exceed last year's FM399m profit. The improvement
stemmed mainly from lower financial expenses, with operating income
virtually unchanged at FM405m. Sales grew 14 per cent to FM5.0bn, helped by
the weaker Finnish markka.

GAN, the state-controlled French insurance company, yesterday mounted a bid
to take full control of Simcoe Erie Investors, a Canadian insurance company
in which it is a minority investor.
GAN, the fourth largest insurer in France and one of the government's
privatisation candidates, is offering CDollars 7.625 a share for the
remaining shares in Simcoe Erie, valuing the company at CDollars 19.47m
(USDollars 15m). GAN owns 21.6 per cent of the Canadian insurer.
Simcoe Erie, which is based at Burlington in Ontario, is one of the 20
largest damage insurance companies in Canada with 600 employees.
It made pre-tax profits of FFr14m (Dollars 2.4m) on turnover of FFr1.5bn in
its last financial year to June 30.
GAN, which has been more cautious than its French competitors in terms of
international activity, described the Canadian deal as 'evidence of its
willingness to expand into other countries'.
It also sees the transaction as an eventual stepping stone into the US which
has been closed to GAN because of restrictions over inward investment by
public-sector companies.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Denmark expects to be among elite of EMS: Finance minister
Mogens Lykketoft sees the krone as a core hard currency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK expects to be among the core hard-currency countries when new
arrangements are made for the European Monetary System, according to Mr
Mogens Lykketoft, the finance minister.
'The Danish economy in fundamental respects is strong and we shall have no
problem joining the core (ERM) counties. That is our clear intention,' Mr
Lykketoft, a leading figure in the Social Democrat-led coalition, said in an
interview with the Financial Times.
However, he said he does not expect new ERM arrangements to be implemented
'for some time' following the forced move to wider 15 per cent bands two
months ago.
He said the original January 1 deadline for a return to the previous 2 1/4
per cent fluctuation bands had little chance of being realised.
Mr Lykketoft is presiding over an economy registering a large current
account surplus and an inflation rate of just over 1 per cent. However,
unemployment is around 12 per cent.
As a result of a shift to fiscal policy expansion this year, the budget
deficit has grown to about 6 per cent of gross domestic product.
The Danish krone, which came under severe speculative pressure during the
summer monetary crisis, has lately been holding up relatively well on the
currency markets.
The krone has appreciated slightly against the European currency unit since
the end of July, although it has fallen by about 4 per cent against the
D-Mark. After two cuts in the official discount rate, the most recent by 0.5
points to 8.25 per cent on September 27, the financial markets are expecting
further gradual reductions in short-term interest rates.
Mr Lykketoft said Denmark's opt out from the Maastricht treaty commitment to
economic and monetary union had only limited relevance to the government's
monetary policies.
The minister said: 'This (the third stage of the move to Emu) lies a very
long way ahead and so the question is without any interest.'
The government's fiscal expansion is expected to produce some extra buoyancy
in an economy which will show no growth this year and has only grown by
about 1 per cent annually since 1986.
The government is planning a DKr12bn (Dollars 1.81bn) increase in spending
power, equivalent to 1.2 per cent of GDP, in the 1994 budget, accomplished
by temporary reductions in personal taxation and increases in budget
spending, especially on infrastructure.
Mr Lykketoft does not see any incompatibility between the expansive fiscal
policy and an easing of monetary policy and lower interest rates. He said
that both the reduction in taxation - a consequence of a big reform of the
tax system which will take effect in 1994 - and expenditure increases are
temporary.
'There will be no further easing of fiscal policy after 1994,' he said. The
fiscal expansion will make only a minor dent in the current balance of
payments surplus, which will slip from about DKr27bn - 3.5 per cent of GDP -
to about DKr23bn in 1994, he said.
The government expects a demand boost to increase the GDP growth rate to 2.9
per cent in 1994, with real private consumption rising by 4 per cent.
Virtually all non-government forecasters consider the government growth
forecasts too optimistic. The right-wing opposition parties predict
continued stagnation, leading to a new crisis next year caused by a rising
budget deficit.
However, Mr Lykketoft, an economist by training, said he considers the the
forecasts 'fully realistic'.
The tax concessions alone mean that real disposable household incomes will
increase by 4-5 per cent next year.
Mr Lykketoft said that the fact that home-owners can extend mortgages from
20 years to 30 years will give the typical householder extra spending money
of several thousand kroner a month next year, so his forecast was not 'too
optimistic'.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Italians unveil plan to shed 11,600 steel jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ILVA, the loss-making, state-run steel group, has unveiled plans to axe over
a quarter of its 40,000-strong workforce in response to EC pressure to cut
Italy's over-capacity and end state subsidies.
The job cuts are part of Ilva's plan to split the group into two companies -
flat products and special steels - in order to privatise.
The project is due to be decided at the end of the month by the Ilva board,
headed by Mr Hayao Nakamura, the Japanese executive brought in earlier this
year to reorganise the group.
According to the plan, 11,600 jobs will be lost between 1994-96, the bulk of
which will come from the workforce producing flat products at Taranto,
Europe's largest steel plant, and Novi Ligure, near Genoa.
Some 5,000 workers already laid off will not be re-hired.
This is a far more radical solution than originally envisaged. It has been
drawn up in the past three months after the government recognised the EC
would only be satisfied with a clear commitment to rationalise Ilva.
The trades unions have been warned well in advance and their protests are
likely to be directed less at the job cuts than at the redundancy terms,
retraining and investments in fresh employment - especially in the Taranto
area of southern Italy.
Ilva currently has debts of L8,400bn (Dollars 5.33bn) and in order to split
the group into two for privatisation a complex book-keeping operation is
expected to take place where some L5,800bn is written off. The main battle
will be over the future of Taranto and the smaller flat products plant at
Novi Ligure.
One proposal is that Lucchini, the Brescia-based private group, take over
the flat products.
Lucchini has already acquired Ilva's Piombino works with France's
Usinor-Sacilor, and the unions see the latter lurking behind its offer.
A second proposal, apparently favoured by Mr Nakamura is that a group of
local businessmen back a management buy-out in conjunction with commitments
to the work-force.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Germany set to oppose Spanish rescue scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government is likely to oppose a European Commission-backed
restructuring plan for the Spanish steel industry unless significant changes
are made to it, Bonn officials said yesterday.
The plan, which EC industry ministers will be asked to approve next month,
was 'completely unacceptable in its present form', they said.
A go-ahead for the Spanish scheme is crucial for the Commission which is
negotiating with other state-subsidised steelmakers in order to rescue
Europe's recession-hit industry.
But opposition to the Spanish deal has been mounting and is now threatening
to derail Brussels' attempts to have a EC-wide plan in place by next year.
Under the Spanish proposal, which aims to reduce capacity and
state-subsidies, the authorities must close a Basque plant at Anzio by
mid-1995. But they can rescue another at Sestao if private investors are
found for it.
The plan foresees state aid amounting to Ecu2.77bn (Dollars 3.2bn).
German officials say these state subsidies remain 'much too high'. They also
want the Anzio plant closed earlier. 'We need capacity cuts now and not in
two years,' a senior official said.
They further object to the Sestao plant being allowed to survive in the
hands of private investors.
'We cannot accept an ailing steelmaker being rescued by an investor which
will only take a 51 per cent stake, and which may be partially owned by the
state itself,' an official added.
Nor would the German government accept a restructuring package it
disapproved of in return for subsidies for its Ekostahl plant in east
Germany. Bonn argues that Ekostahl is a separate case because its
privatisation belongs to the restructuring of eastern Germany as a whole.

Eutelsat's bird takes wing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASTRA IS the best-known television satellite system in Europe with three
16-channel satellites already co-located in space so that their channels can
be received on a single dish. A further satellite is due to be launched next
year and a fifth is planned.
But Eutelsat, the Paris-based European satellite organisation owned by the
PTTs of Europe is intensifying the competition. It is trying to establish an
alternative 'hot bird system' - the satellites that everyone wants to be on
 -in opposition to Astra.
Mr Giuliano Berretta, marketing director of Eutelsat, concedes there was no
point in duplicating the service offered by Astra. As well as offering
conventional European coverage, Eutelsat also offers a special wide beam
which carries programmes to north Africa and on to the Middle East.
Already 37 television channels are carried on four Eutelsat satellites,
ranging from Deutsche Welle, the international German broadcaster to the
Egyptian satellite channel.
The organisation aims to concentrate as many channels as possible at 13
degrees east and plans to launch its 16 channel Hot Bird satellite next
year. This month, the Eutelsat board will decide on a third television
satellite for the 13 degrees east position with up to 20 channels. The
satellite - Hot Bird Plus - will be able to deliver digital satellite
television direct to the home on dishes of 40cm diameter.
Eutelsat is already delivering channels to more than 30 homes attached to
cable networks and direct to an estimated 3m homes.
By the end of last year 89 satellite television channels were available in
Europe on four satellite systems and the number is likely to continue
growing, particularly with the introduction of digital compression.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Survey of Cable TV and Satellite Broadcasting (3): The film
that can erase itself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For years Mr William Graven has been working away at his concept of an
electronic video store through his company EMC3 - Entertainment Made
Convenient 3. The idea is that the viewer orders a feature film from a
library by using a free telephone number and the film is squirted down to
the consumer in a five-minute digitally compressed burst to a specially
adapted video recorder. The recording can be watched twice but erases itself
on its second play.
Mr Graven says he already has reached agreement with a number of Japanese
consumer electronics companies to manufacture the new video recorder and
believes his dream of creating an international electronic video store which
never runs out of even the most popular films is now not far off.
New video recorders with the EMC function are expected to become available
by November 1994 and would cost around Dollars 500 although the cost could
drop to Dollars 350 in mass production. Research carried out in Japan showed
that consumers understood the concept of video-on-demand and said they
preferred it to the existing subscription channels.
While video-on-demand is likely to be one of the big themes of the next few
years, and a possible financial driving force for the introduction of
digital compression technology into the home, another will be the way US
media companies are determined to drive their films and programmes around
the world using all available and emerging technologies. Soon hardly
anywhere on earth will be entirely safe from at least the potential of
tuning in to cheerful American voices revealing the latest news or
introducing the oldest films.
Mr Ted Turner's Cable News Network and CNN Inter- national proudly boasts
that it is already on 12 satellites around the world, soon to be 13, and
that only some parts of Greenland and Antarctica are still deprived of
24-hours-a-day television news.
Mr Turner may have been the first to take his channel international,
followed by Viacom's MTV, but more US channels are now trying to break out
of the large but increasingly saturated American market and a number of
significant US media companies are buying into regional satellite channels
or investing in the setting up of new channels.
There are also growing moves to create integrated media businesses that
create film and television programmes in Hollywood and distribute them
through everything from video to satellite and cable around the world.
Increasingly, the name of the game is the creation and exploitation of
intellectual property rights, and the more universal the appeal the better.
One of the most recent examples of the drive towards integration was Mr
Turner's purchase in August of two independent Hollywood production
companies, New Line and Castle Rock, in a deal worth Dollars 672m.
'I had to (buy into Hollywood). No question. I have more than 3,000 old
movies (from the MGM library) and no new movies except television movies. If
you are going to be a big player you have got to have the product,' says Mr
Turner who began transmitting two of his channels, TNT, based on old films
and some sport and the Cartoon Network to Europe in the form of a single
24-hours a day channel. The integrated channel schedules cartoons during the
day and films at night.
Mr Turner did not quite get the welcome he might have expected in Europe.
Although the UK gave the channel a licence, which ought to have given it
clearance throughout Europe under existing conventions and directives, both
the French and Belgian governments blocked its entry to their cable networks
because it did not have enough European content. As Belgium is virtually
completely cabled, it was a serious blow to the channel.
According to the EC Television Without Frontiers directive, which came into
force two years ago, satellite channels should have majority EC content
where practicable. And although it is difficult to see how a film channel
could be run without a considerable proportion of Hollywood movies, even an
old movie channel, attitudes on the issue of American 'cultural imperialism'
appear to be hardening.
The UK, which has traditionally taken a rather laissez-faire approach to the
issue of European content, although much less so to issues of eroticism or
pornography beamed in by satellite, is starting to take a firmer line on
content.
Mr Peter Brooke, secretary of state for National Heritage, told the Royal
Television Society's Cambridge convention last month that maybe it was time
for Sky One, the general entertainment channel that has just recently been
scrambled and included in the Sky Multi-Channel subscription package, to
start thinking about including more UK-made programmes. The channel relies
heavily on programmes bought in Los Angeles.
Mr Sumner Redstone, the Viacom chairman, has not yet seemed to run into
cultural resistance to his channels. He also plans to take Viacom channels -
Nickelodeon, the children's channel and Nick-at-Nite and VH-1 around the
world.
He has a vision of an international children's channel, created with local
partners that would give 'a chance of an international lobby for the kind of
world we want to live in'.
Nickelodeon has already arrived in the UK, with Nick- at-Nite and VH-1
following early next year.
Mr Rupert Murdoch has also recently been spelling out his international
ambitions, linked with the Dollars 525m purchase of Star TV and with it
potential entrance to the Asian television market. 'It's a global dream that
you never quite dared have, and suddenly it's there,' he says.
The global dream is not universally shared in the region. The Malaysian
government has already expressed reservations about Mr Murdoch's intentions.
Partly maybe to answer such criticisms, Mr Murdoch is planning to create
separate Star services for India and China, and possibly a third Star at a
later stage for the 200m people of Indonesia to reflect, at least partly,
the enormous cultural and linguistic differences that are involved.
The News Corporation chairman makes no bones about wanting to take his UK
channels, such as Sky Sport, around the world. 'We will also take Sky News
around the world. There will be a parallel international service and Sky
News as we know it today will be for Britain and Europe,' Mr Murdoch says,
adding that he plans to work with local partners for the international
service in different parts of the world. 'Maybe Kerry Packer in Australia,'
he muses.
An increasingly tense battle is now likely between international television
news organisations. The well- entrenched CNN, already facing growing
opposition from BBC World Service Television, is likely also to come up
against competition from Mr Murdoch's Sky News.
However, Mr Ted Turner of CNN is irritated at all the publicity that Mr
Murdoch has had for his international news plans, which tend to put in the
shade the fact that CNN is already there and has already done what Mr
Murdoch is only hoping to do. Mr Murdoch in turn has long had the ambition
to bring to the occupants of hotel rooms around the world news that is less
obviously American than CNN - or at least less American than CNN used to be
before CNN International was developed.
Independent Television News of the UK is not yet a contender in the
international television news battle but would like to become a player.
Reuters, the international news and financial information group, now an ITN
shareholder alongside Mr Michael Green's Carlton Communications, is making
no secret of its television ambitions. Given Reuters' expertise in business
and financial reporting some sort of television business channel might make
sense.
The latest American arrival on the European media scene is NBC, the US
network which runs cable channels in the US including a business news
channel, and which has been looking at the pan-European market for some
time.
NBC has bought a 75 per cent stake in SuperChannel the general entertainment
satellite channel which has access to around 60m cable television homes in
western and eastern Europe. The deal is believed to be worth around Pounds
40m. Set up originally by a consortium of ITV companies, apart from Thames
Television which declined to take part, the channel made significant losses
until it was sold to the Marcucci family of Italy with Mr Richard Branson's
Virgin group retaining a minority stake for only Pounds 9 and the assumption
of around Pounds 2.5m in debt. So far nearly Pounds 25m has been invested in
the channel which has specialised in niche programming because it could not
afford the big new movies or top exclusive sports events.
As the Marcucci family move on to specialise in inter- national television
production, the resources of NBC, both in programming and finance, could
make all the difference to the outlook for SuperChannel.
Time Warner has also been trying to maximise revenues from its programme
library by taking its Home Box Office around the world. There have been
pay-television joint ventures in Venezuela, Hungary, New Zealand and
Scandinavia and through HBO Ole, the first Spanish-speaking movie and
entertainment service available to all of Spanish-speaking Latin America and
the Caribbean.
Other US investors in the UK include Cox, the Atlanta-based media company,
which has taken stakes in two new sat- ellite channels, UK Gold, based on
the libraries of the BBC and Thames Television and UK Living, a channel
devoted to women's interests. Inter- national Family Entertain- ment, a
company linked with American television evangelist Pat Robertson, has bought
TVS, the ITV company that lost its south of England franchise and brought
The Family Channel, its successful American cable channel, to the UK.
The strongest European opposition to growing American dominance of the
international television news airwaves is coming from BBC World Service
Television, which was finally launched two years ago after long delays. The
British govern- ment, which funds BBC World Service Radio, refused to
contribute any money to set up the service and forbade the BBC from using
licence fee money to fund it. In the end, a modest sum was found from the
sale of subscriptions in Europe for an existing BBC general entertainment
channel to get World Service Television under way.
Because of shortage of funds, Mr Chris Irwin, its chief executive, has had
to proceed via a series of self-financing joint ventures. The service is now
available in Africa and on cable networks in Canada. Next spring it will
launch in Japan in a 10-year deal worth Pounds 150m, and there are hopes of
getting into the US market.
But perhaps the greatest impact that BBC World Service Television has had so
far is in Asia, where it is delivered from London to 38 countries as one of
five channels, including MTV, on the Star satellite system. In India alone,
World Service Television has more than 13m regular viewers, according to
independent research earlier this year. Indians are able to watch the BBC 6
O'Clock News live in the evening and Newsnight, the BBC evening current
affairs programme, is shown the next morning.
The BBC has recently signed a deal with Intelsat to use digital compression
to help add the US and Latin American to its existing markets.
Mr Tom Johnson, president of CNN, recognises that BBC World Service
Television is very professional and represents growing compet- ition.
However, he cites its lack of finance as one obvious weakness. In 1992 CNN
in all its forms had total revenues of Dollars 535.6m and made operating
profits of Dollars 150m.
The Murdoch purchase of control of Star has caused uncertainty over the
future of BBC World Service Television in Asia but Mr Murdoch has stated
unambiguously that he will honour the BBC's 10-year contract with Star. It
probably makes good business sense for him to do so because the BBC name is
well regarded, partic- ularly in India, and the service is believed to bring
in a signif- icant proportion of the advert- ising revenues of the Star
system.
In all this brave new world, the UK is playing a key role, not because of
the size of the market but because of the number of things going on there.
To a considerable extent North American media and telephone companies view
the UK as a laboratory whose results merit careful study.
It is the only place in the world where telecommun- ications deregulation
has gone so far as to allow cable com- panies to offer a full range of
telephone services in compet- ition to the PTT. As a result, most of the
regional Bell operating companies from the US have piled into the UK cable
market, partly because they see a good business opportunity but also to
learn about cable in the hope that a similar pattern of deregulation is not
far off in the US.
At the moment, US telephone companies cannot run cable television franchises
in their own telephone operating areas although they can buy systems
elsewhere in the US. The issue is heading for the US legal system. Bell
Atlantic recently won a local ruling in Alexandria, Virginia, allowing it to
start up a cable system there in competition with Jones, a large cable
operator, a decision that is being appealed against.
The other interesting factor about the UK is the scale of the satellite
subscription business that has been built up by BSkyB. Mr Murdoch, who owns
50 per cent, quite simply describes it as the leading satellite company in
the world and points to an important lesson learned in the UK which is
influencing his decision- making in other parts of the world such as Asia.
'There is no question we have shown here (in the UK) that first in gets the
market,' he says. Canal Plus, the French pay television company is probably
still bigger, but it enjoys one enormous advantage - control over
conventional television frequencies so that it can broadcast over normal
land-based transmitters.
On the face of it, cable television's performance in the UK would give
snails and tortoises a good reputation. After 10 years of effort, according
to the latest official figures to the beginning of July, only 658,884 homes
were connected to any form of cable and that involves a broad definition
including blocks of flats connected to an antenna and old-fashioned
television relay systems upgraded to carry at least a basic selection of the
new satellite channels. The total for the modern broadband or multi-channel
systems was 473,415 although the symbolic 500,000 figures was expected to be
passed sometime this month.
When it comes to broadband homes offering the full range of cable programme
services, the total number takes on an even more pessimistic hue compared
with the number of homes in the UK which could subscribe if they wanted to.
That total by July 1 stood at 2,327,257, which meant that precisely
1,853,842 householders whose homes are passed by a cable network have
decided not to subscribe so far. This gives a disappointing penetration rate
 -the ratio of those subscribing to those who could subscribe - of 20.3 per
cent.
Indeed, the official quarterly bulletin from the Independent Television
Commission carries the headline: 'Cable Growth Slows In 1993'. The report
begins: 'The increase in the number of broadband cable subscribers slowed
down in the first half of 1993, apparently as recessionary factors generated
higher rates of disconnection.' This meant that although there was a net
increase in subscribers in the first six months of 1993 of 33,000 because of
faster rates of building cable networks, the average take-up rate dropped to
levels last seen in early 1992.
And all this has been happening at a time when Sky Television has been
dominating the headlines with its 18-channel package and more on the way. At
Pounds 19.99 a month, including three movie channels and a sports channel,
it appears superficially, at least, to be so much better value than cable.
Quite apart from the aesthetics of having a dish on the wall, whether flat,
see-through or not, this illusion is at least partly created because
satellite viewers have to buy or rent the receiving equipment. With cable,
it is all included. Although the difference may be more apparent than real,
it does not make cable's marketing task any easier.
Against such a background, why are a growing number of big banks getting
excited about backing cable while their lack of interest in earlier years
blocked the development of cable? Why does Mr Richard Woollam of the CTA
find his lunch diary clogged with engagements to expound on the newly
discovered virtues of cable?
The change can partly be explained in two words - cable telephony. Cable
television as a business selling just more television channels always seemed
like a long haul in the UK, where unlike the early days of the industry in
the US good quality television signals carrying good quality programmes from
the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 are almost universally available. But add
telephone services and the economics are transformed.
'We are not a cable TV business. We are an entertainment and information and
communications business,' says Mr Michael Turner, chairman of the CTA and
chief executive of Southwestern Bell International, whose franchises cover a
total of 1.14m homes in the midlands and north-west of England. The number
of cable telephone subscribers is still small - around 200,000 - but the
rate of increase and the effect on the revenues of cable operators are quite
dramatic.
Three years ago Mercury Communications supplied 200 telephone lines a month
to the cable industry and revenues were in hundreds of thousands of pounds.
The rate is now running at more than 20,000 lines a month and between Pounds
60m and Pounds 70m is expected to be generated at the retail level this
year.
By the end of September just under 250,000 telephone lines had been handed
over to cable franchises, though not all of these are yet in use.
There are now 32 cable franchises in the UK offering telephone services,
compared with 17 a year ago and many operators are installing their own
switches. In August Mercury announced marketing and operations agreements
with the largest cable operators, including Encom, General Cable, Nynex,
CableComms, Southwestern Bell, TeleWest Communications and Videotron.
Nynex, with franchises in the Brighton, Poole and Worthing areas, is
providing telephone links for public services in the region.
'We have tied together Hampshire police stations and we are working on
ambulance stations and other things,' says Mr Peter Lynch, marketing
director of Nynex, the telephone company for New York and New England.
Mr Alan Bates, managing director of Jones Cable, with interests in more than
1m homes under franchise including Aylesbury and Leeds, is very clear about
the benefits of telephone services. 'We thought this year that 40 per cent
of our revenues would come from telephony and 60 per cent from cable. We
have just passed through where it's 50-50 and we are fast heading for 60-40
the other way around. To double your revenue on a margin additional cost (to
install telephony) is phenomenal,' he says.
The joint cable television/telephony package is much easier to sell than
cable TV alone, Mr Bates emphasises. The English middle classes, he
believes, habitually lie about what they watch on television and find it
difficult to buy anything so vulgar as cable. But discounts of up to 20 per
cent are something they understand, even though there is the inconvenience
for domestic subscribers of changing their number. 'Then they say we'll take
cable for the children,' laughs Mr Bates.
The spread of telephone services on cable network will increasingly pose
competition for BT, which the national operator will find it difficult to
meet.
The cable operators are local and geographically dispersed and each
individual network can offer different packages of discounts, including free
local calls in some areas.
A BT price cut to tackle small cable discounters in a few hundred thousand
homes would have to be offered nationally, costing the company millions of
pounds.
The emerging importance of telecommunications has led to a measure of
consolidation in the industry as the well-funded American phone companies,
which like to boast that they understand all about 'burying loads of money
in a hole in the ground', have been buying up franchises that come on the
market.
For example, in March Nynex bought three franchises in Greater Manchester,
Bolton and Derby that were previously held by Pacific Telesis, which decided
to concentrate its investment thrust on mobile communications and began to
withdraw from the UK cable market. More recently TeleWest, the joint venture
between Mr Malone's TCI and Bell West became the largest cable operator in
the UK when it bought seven Scottish cable franchises owned by Post-Newsweek
Cable.
Up and down the country, a rough pattern is beginning to emerge in cable
sales: that of every 100 sales the cable industry makes, 70 people will take
the combined television and telephone service, 20 people cable television
only and 10 people telephone only. They are percentages that certainly
impressed Mr Bates's bankers recently to enable him to negotiate what was
seen as a landmark financing deal for cable.
NatWest Markets, the corporate finance arm of National Westminster Bank,
arranged a Pounds 152.5m financing for the 'construction and operation of a
cable television and telecommunications franchise' in Leeds. The money is
made up of Pounds 77.5m in equity and Pounds 75m in non-recourse finance.
It is the first 'fully-funded' cable deal concluded before construction
actually begins, although of course performance thresholds are built in.
Five UK investors are involved including Cable &amp; Wireless, the parent of
Mercury Communications, although most of the money came from US investors
such as Capital Cities/ABC and Paine Webber and the debt was underwritten by
the Bank of Nova Scotia and other banks.
Even bigger cable finance deals are in the pipeline. It is believed that
Citibank is in the process of raising Pounds 250m for the UK cable
franchises of Nynex. If the deal goes through, it could further improve the
investment climate for cable, though the bankers will be watching carefully
to see that their positive analysis on the prospects for cable works out in
reality.
Mr Michael Turner is not downhearted at the slowdown in cable subscribers.
'It's been a mixed year for cable, but if you look at the fundamentals of
the business there has been record investment, record build. Yes, the
penetration rate is coming down a bit. We're disappointed but not really
concerned. We are convinced it will come back, that the market is going to
buy the product,' the CTA chairman says.
This year a total of Pounds 750m will be invested in the construction of
cable networks in the UK, more than in any previous three- or four-year
period. But what if the British people simply do not want multi-channel
television or at least the programmes now being offered? Many of the big
cable operators have carried out their own consumer research just to make
sure that there is not an invisible, insuperable barrier. 'I don't think
there is anything in the culture of the British people that says that over
time they won't want multi-channel,' says Mr Bates. And even if adults, were
to behave in that 'perverse' way, then the children will certainly
understand cable and the choice it offers.
Another straw in the wind is the fact that not all cable operators are
performing so very modestly. In Birmingham, for instance, the penetration
rate is running at 33.5 per cent - and anything over 30 per cent, bankers
say, is definitely a business because of the cash flows generated. If only
the rest could lift their game to the Birmingham level, cable enthusiasts
say.
To Mr Turner the real challenge does not come from BSkyB but from the 75 per
cent of the population who do not have multi-channel television of any kind.
BSkyB itself has recently taken an enormous risk in moving towards a nearly
total subscription package. The only BSkyB exception is the loss-making Sky
News.
On the day Sky Television was launched in February 1989, Mr Murdoch made it
clear that other services apart from movies could be encrypted, or scrambled
and charged for on a monthly basis.
There is a large risk in charging for a service that has previously been
'free'. Last year Sky started to charge for its sports channel and this
autumn Sky One disappeared from the gaze of those not prepared to pay. Mr
Murdoch himself feared there could have been uproar at the decision to
charge but, against all the odds, if anything the opposite has happened.
Satellite dish sales started to rise after a period of slower growth. Partly
this was the result of massive publicity and partly it was a response to
carefully structured special deals and discounts.
Perhaps above all else, the pill of having to pay was sugared by the arrival
of new non-Murdoch channels in the package so that, at least by the
beginning of next year, there will be a total of 18 channels under the Sky
marketing banner at a total monthly cost to the consumer of Pounds 19.99.
Twelve scrambled channels ranging from Discovery and The Family Channel to
UK Gold, which draws on the programme libraries of the BBC and Thames
Television and Country Music Television, are available in the Multi-Channel
package for Pounds 6.99 a month - the equivalent of the basic tier of
channels in the cable television package.
Paradoxically, the simple subscription package may be easier to sell than
the previous mixture, where some channels were only on subscription and
others were free.
'People understand the subscription package. It's easier to sell,' says Mr
Paul McMullan, of East Antrim Electricals, who has sold satellite equipment
since the early days of Sky Television. The logic of the move to
subscription is unassailable in financial terms, as long as Sky can retain
most of its existing viewers and start to build again.
As each new satellite channel becomes available the audience for the new
media, as opposed to the traditional broadcasters, is further fragmented.
The smaller the audience, however good the targeting or the demographics,
the less significant that audience is for advertisers. Although there will
inevitably will be elements of cross-over, the most obvious way to maximise
the choice available to the public is for it to be funded by three separate
streams of revenue - a licence fee, advertising and subscription.
The new subscription revenues could transfer BSkyB's balance sheet, although
the company will have to be sure that the subscribers are being given value
for money and not progressively milked once they are 'hooked' on the extra
choice.
Viewers have been persuaded to pay a monthly subscription for a sports
channel that used to be free, largely as a result of the exclusive Pounds
305m deal to show live premier league games. But if Sky were to take some of
the best games out of the existing package and charge an additional
pay-per-view fee, that might turn out to be a step too far for many of their
customers.
Sky has said it will launch a pay-per-view service next year, possibly at
the same time as a second sports channel begins broadcasting although little
has been said about what sort of events will be offered on the pay-per-view
menu.
BSkyB has made considerable financial progress in the past two years, and at
least at the operational level, is now making more than Pounds 2m a week
although there is still a pre-tax loss of about Pounds 70m a year when
notional interest payments on the Pounds 1.7bn invested in the project are
included.
Next year, the money will start to flow back to the owners of the consortium
who have so far not actually paid each other the interest on their loans to
the venture. Apart from News Corporation and Pearson, the main investors are
the Granada Group and Chargeurs of France.
Compared with the enormous losses of the past, the figures that Mr Richard
Brooke, BSkyB chief financial officer, announced for the year to June 1993
were remarkable.
The operating profit of Pounds 61.5m represented a Pounds 108m turnaround on
the previous year and turnover was up by 63 per cent to Pounds 380m - 80 per
cent of it coming from subscription revenue. In addition, the satellite
consortium had needed no new funding from shareholders since May 1992 and
Pounds 34m of available funding had not had to be drawn down. It seemed like
a turning point of some significance and, executives promised, the improving
trends were continuing into the current financial year.
Mr Gary Davey, the BSkyB deputy managing director, pointed out last month
that 100,000 new movie channel subscriptions had been signed up in August
alone, taking the total of movie subscriptions past 2m for the first time.
BSkyB is facing a growing problem of pirate subscription cards. News
Corporation's VideoCrypt system, based on a microchip embedded in a cards
rather like a telephone card which 'unlocks' the scrambled pictures, was
claimed to be pirate-proof. In fact, pirate cards are being openly
advertised and sold in Scandinavia and Germany, and the trend is starting to
spread to the UK.
One company in England is already offering pirate cards for sale at Pounds
200 in what amounts to an unofficial subscription service of its own. If
BSkyB changes the codes in the chip, the company offers to provide a
replacement for an additional fee of Pounds 30. Like many transactions
involving intellectual property, it is apparently not illegal to offer such
cards for sale although it is illegal for consumers to use them.
If the number of pirate cards in circulation were ever to become
substantial, it would damage BSkyB in two signif- icant ways. In the UK
piracy would simply mean the loss of revenue or potential revenue but in
continental Europe the problem could be even more significant. The satellite
company buys only the UK subscription rights to Holly- wood films which are
sold by the studios on a country-by- country basis. The agreements with
BSkyB are conditional on the films not being available all over Europe.
Widespread piracy, unless tackled, could call vital film contracts into
question.
Overall, BSkyB was in more than 3.5m homes by the begin- ning of September
including 2.57m homes with satellite dishes, according to BARB.
Yet although the new channels are available in more than 15 per cent of UK
homes, it has to be emphasised that their performance in terms of audiences
and ratings has been modest. It is a rare satellite programme that has been
able to assemble an audience of 1m and few apart from The Simpsons have
achieved it.
Despite the rapid growth in the number of channels avail- able, the new
media still account for less than a third of total viewing in homes which
can receive satellite channels. This ratio looks like staying fairly
constant, or only increasing slightly, as more channels are added. This
suggests that satellite channels, at least at their present stage of
development, will have to content them- selves with sharing a finite amount
of viewing time and rely instead for growth in getting their services into
an increasing number of homes.
For instance, in March, before the latest burst of new channels on the Astra
satellite such as Bravo, Discovery, Nickelodeon, the Family Channel,
TNT/Cartoon Network and UK Living, the official BARB figures show that the
non-terrestrial channels took 29.4 per cent of viewing in cable and
satellite homes. For the week ending September 19 with the new channels on
stream, the total satellite share from more than 15 channels had risen only
to 31 per cent - virtually the same as that achieved by the BBC with its two
channels in new media homes.
It is, of course, early days for the new channels in the BSkyB package but
according to BARB the average weekly viewing to Bravo in cable and satellite
homes was 10 min- utes, one minute ahead of Nickelodeon, although the
Children's Channel was more successful at 13 minutes. The Family Channel was
watched for an average seven minutes and UK Living for five minutes. This
compared with an average 7 hours 23 minutes for ITV and even 1 hour 38
minutes for Channel 4 in cable and satellite homes.
Zenith Media, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's media buying arm, believes that by the
year 2003 satellite's share of viewing in satellite homes will, at 32.3 per
cent, have hardly moved at all. Increased penetration for cable and
satellite will enable the new media channels to account for 17 per cent of
total television in all homes by 2003 compared with their 1993 figure of 5.2
per cent.
More competition could yet be on the way in the UK television market. All
hopes of establishing a national Channel 5 have not yet been abandoned.
Following the decision last December by the Independent Television
Commission to reject the only bid from a consortium led by Thames
Television, mainly on the grounds of inadequate shareholder commitment, the
whole issue is being reviewed this autumn.
The ITC has called for expressions of interest by October 15 in three
options:
A national channel capable of reaching 74 per cent of the population, very
similar to the one originally advertised.
A much more local city-based television service, a concept that would need
legislation to implement.
Use of the Channel 5 frequencies as part of an overall plan to introduce
digital television.
The ITC has made it clear that the UK could have as many as 100 television
services if the existing four national channels were also to move to
digital.
In practice, the ITC concedes, at least 10 years' notice would have to be
given before ending existing broadcasts in PAL and there would have to be
'simulcasting' - broadcasting the existing main channels in both PAL and
digital. In most parts of the country this would still allow the
introduction of new digital channels. There could be as many as 20 new
channels in some areas although the number would be much fewer in the south
and south-east, where the spectrum is relatively crowded.
The ITV companies, still coming to terms with the effects of competitive
tenders for their new franchises, are now debating what extra services could
be offered to persuade consumers to buy the necessary decoders. There are
also suggestions that the new digital television services could effectively
be funded by giving over part of the spectrum to the running of a digital
communication system for industry and finance.
Despite the technological attractions of the endless choice being offered by
digital, a number of serious players are still interested in running Channel
5 as a conventional television channel.
The big advantage is that unlike most of the ITV companies, the channel
would not have to pay a percentage of its advertising revenue to the
government and a small bid - Thames offered the minimum Pounds 1,000 a year
 -would be enough to win the franchise.
The main disadvantage is that any successful applicant will have to pay for
the retuning of millions of video recorders at present tuned in to the
frequencies Channel 5 would use.
Across Europe the new media, particularly cable, have been making
considerable progress.
According to the 11th annual study of the European cable industry by CIT
Research, the market research group specialising in communications, at the
beginning of this year 68m out of western Europe's 152m television
households had either cable television or a communal system fed by a
satellite dish. A total of 30m homes were connected to cable networks, up
from 26m the previous year.
About 40 per of Europe's cable homes are in Germany, where the Bundespost's
Telekom division has been pursuing a vigorous building policy, with 30 per
cent in the Low Countries and the rest elsewhere.
CIT believes that western European viewers spent nearly Ecu4bn on cable
television in 1992 including pay TV revenues - up 24 per cent on 1991.
'Given that Europe is still in the teeth of recession, the industry can
congratulate itself,' CIT concludes.
By June this year, 12.8m German households were connected to cable networks,
most of them in the western Lander. There are also plans to spend DM55bn on
improving telecommunications in the east, DM3.5bn of which will be devoted
to cable.
In France cable is at last beginning to grow steadily, although cable
subscribers still account only for 5.5 per cent of the country's 20.6m
television households, according to CIT.
The sixth Pan-European Television Audience Research survey, published
earlier this year, was based on viewing figures from cable homes in Flanders
and five European countries: Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Norway and
Sweden. It showed that the viewing of commercial channels transmitted by
cable or satellite continued to expand at the expense of the state-owned and
public service sector.
The audience shares of channels funded wholly or in part by licence fee now
ranges from 32.1 per cent in Flanders to 56.3 per cent in Denmark.
In Germany, Europe's largest cable and satellite dish market, the public
broadcasters achieved a 32.6 per cent share in new media homes, although
this dropped to 25.5 per cent among the 16-34 age group.
The choice available somewhere in Europe continues to grow with more than
100 services available over both cable and satellite, not all subscription
based.
Eurospsort continues to provide Europe-wide competition for the UK-based Sky
Sports and Euronews, the multilingual news and information service backed by
more than a dozen public service broadcasters, is increasing its reach after
a difficult birth at the beginning of this year.
By the end of August the channel was reaching 11m cable and communal dish
homes and, with the help of rebroadcasting on conventional transmitters, was
available in a total of 43m homes.
One of the most interesting uses of satellite television is to provide
special services for ethnic minorities all over Europe. There are
programming segments for Japanese and Chinese minorities, while TV Asia, the
Asian channel on the Astra satellite, has expanded to 18 hours a day with
programmes ranging from Indian and Pakistani films to daily news coverage in
five Asian languages.
MBC, the Arabic language television station based in London, recently
reached an agreement to co-operate with the Arab Network of America, the
main Arabic language network of the US. There will be programme exchanges
and joint productions.
MBC - the Middle East Broadcasting Centre - was launched more than two years
ago and broadcasts its service all over Europe, North Africa and the Arabian
Gulf.
Back at the former studios of TV-am Mr Bill Roedy, chief executive of MTV
Europe, insists: 'We don't take ourselves too seriously. It's only
entertainment after all.'
He is right, of course, about the ultimate significance of the new media and
the technological driving force behind it - except that the new
international channels will have growing cultural influence and new media
empires will be created as public service monopolies give way, at least in
part, to an era of greater choice and intensified competition.

sometimes, as in Germany, also broadcasting on conventional land-based
transmitters - is beginning to make life more difficult for public service
broadcasters.
Next month public service broadcasters from all over Europe will meet under
the auspices of the European Broadcasting Union to assess the competitive
threat and try to adopt a co-ordinated response.
Earlier this year, for example, Mr John Birt, director-general of the BBC,
conceded that by the turn of the century the new media could account for
about one-third of the revenues in British broadcasting and a similar
proportion of the audience.
A recent study by McKinsey, the consultants found private broadcasters
taking an increasing share of the audience in a number of countries.
In Germany, for instance in 1987 the total public service had an audience
share of 83.1 per cent of viewing. By 1992 it had dropped to 46.5 per cent.
McKinsey concluded that the licence fee was potentially the most attractive
funding source to meet public service obligations in a difficult competitive
world.
'Experience from France, Germany and other comparable countries does suggest
that advertising dependence can drive a decline in programme mix that
undermines public service broadcasting goals,' the consultants argue.

The new headquarters of MTV Europe, in a North London building that was
designed by architect Terry Farrell, are impressive by any standards. The
international pop music satellite channel has recently expanded out of its
former modest, cramped premises in a far less fashionable part of London, to
inherit the Camden premises of TV-am, the commercial breakfast television
station that lost its licence and went off the air at the beginning of this
year.
The office of Mr Bill Roedy, the MTV managing director, overlooking the
Grand Union Canal, used to be occupied by David Frost, and the MTV executive
has kept a picture of TV-am's most famous broadcaster on the wall.
The famous TV-am egg cups are still on the roof of the building, but
nowadays instead of chat at breakfast the studios transmit MTV 24 hours a
day to about 55m homes around Europe and the Middle East. Two more channels
are on their way across the Atlantic from Viacom, owners of MTV Nick-at-
Nite, which offers entertainment for younger adults, and VH-1, Video Hits
One which focuses on video hits from the past. They could also come out of
studios where until recently Mr Bruce Gyngell, the chairman of TV-am,
reigned supreme.
The progress of MTV Europe over the past six years, symbolised by its new
headquarters, is to a considerable extent a paradigm of the growing
international ambitions, reach and technical potential of the new media.
So as to improve its coverage, MTV Europe is now on four different
satellites and last month it arrived for the first time in both Cyprus and
Turkey, through deals with local broadcasters and cable operators. There was
also a press conference, held on a bomb site, to mark the arrival of the
service in Lebanon.
In January MTV Europe will use digital compression technology on at least
one of its satellites so that it can squeeze four channels into the
satellite capacity presently occupied by one in providing a service to cable
networks.
The company declines to disclose financial figures but it is now believed to
be at least modestly in profit, almost certainly the first pan-European
channel to move out of loss, with revenues of more than Dollars 70m a year
and more than 200 advertisers.
'In September (ie last month) we took more advertising revenue than in the
whole of 1990,' is all Mr Roedy will say.
He adds, however, that on his travels he has seen MTV not just at the Czech
airport in Prague, in nightclubs in Moscow, or in Reykjavik in Iceland but
also in the En Gedi kibbutz at the base of Masada in Israel, in souks in
Marrakesh and in a fallout shelter converted into a nightclub in Bratislava,
Slovakia.
Mr Roedy only just stops short of claiming credit for the fall of the Berlin
Wall for his irreverent service although he points out that MTV was there
two days later, broadcasting to the former east Germany and was invited into
Lithuania as a step towards democracy and free flows of information while
President Landsbergis was barricaded in his office, resisting the Soviet
army.
He says he is going to try to make sure that MTV gets to the Gaza strip and
Jericho following the Middle East peace agreement, whether or not it adds
much to his advertising revenues.
Across London in Battersea, a new consortium has inherited the plush remains
of another broad- casting misfortune in Marco Polo house, headquarters of
British Satellite Broadcasting until it was rudely merged with Mr Rupert
Murdoch's Sky Television to form British Sky Broadcasting.
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, was a major shareholder in BSB and
has a 17.5 per cent stake in the merged BSkyB satellite venture.
Now, the magnificent atrium and the marbled toilets, where in the BSB days
fresh flowers were placed every day, are occupied by broadcasters of a very
different hue.
On October 1 QVC, a joint venture between QVC of the US and Sky Television,
went on the air - the UK's first 24-hours-a-day, 365 days a year shopping
channel.
In the US the QVC channel, run by Mr Barry Diller, former head of the
Twentieth Century Fox studios, had a turnover of Dollars 1bn in 1992-93. The
company is bidding against Viacom to take over Paramount, one of the
Hollywood majors. In the UK the joint venture will be pioneering the round-
the-clock selling of a wide range of domestic, consumer and electrical goods
costing between Pounds 10 and Pounds 500, largely by credit card.
Presenters will be responsible for three-hour live stints - with a
particular theme bringing together groups of goods being offered every hour.
At least to begin with the programme will not be live for all of the
24-hours with repeats being broadcast in the early hours.
All the goods will actually be owned by the consortium and be ready for
dispatch from their own warehouse to customers who should receive them
usually within three or four days. Because the productions are live, if a
item sells out the presenter can move on rapidly to the next series of
goods.
Mr Peter Ridsdale, the chief executive, promises that the channel, which is
part of the Sky multi-channel subscription package, will emphasise quality
rather than cheapness but adds that discounts will average around 20 per
cent on shop prices because of the lower overheads involved. In the begin-
ning a wide range of goods will be offered to see which go down best.
The service will be the first of its kind in the UK with its own dedicated
channel although there are rivals such as Sell-A-Vision, a joint venture
between two cable programme companies, Flextech of the UK and Quantum
International, part of the National Media Corporation of the US.
The Sell-A-Vision service, aimed at the larger European market, takes on
unused morning hours on other channels and focuses on 'infomercials'  - long
films on the virtues of a particular product. It is broadcast in four
languages, English, Dutch, German and French, for up to 55 hours a week on
the Astra satellite. According to Mr Roger Luard, chief executive of
Flextech, profits are rising month-on-month.
In London leading cable operators have also improved their prog- ramme
services by building a link between their franchises - 'the London
interconnect' - and setting up a special channel for cable called Wire TV.
The London interconnect allows cable operators to exchange new programme
services such as Performance, devoted to the arts, and Identity,
specialising in black programmes, which no single cable operator could
provide on its own. Satellite transmission would be too expensive for such
services and the interconnect is much more practical than delivering video
cassettes by motorcycle all over London.
There are even plans for a London news channel and talks are believed to be
going on with a number of newspaper groups. The next stage is to link the
London cable network with Birmingham and in time it is expected that all the
big cable franchises in the UK will be able to communicate with each other
and exchange programmes.
Such links not only open up the possibility of creating a greater diversity
of new channels but should also make the cable audience more interesting to
advertisers. At the moment the multi-channel universe - a total of 658,884
households at the beginning of July could receive at least some of the new
channels - is too frag- mented to appeal to national advertisers. The
ability to reach all the cable households in London with a single
advertisement could begin to change that.
Down in Bristol, the head- quarters and studios of Wire TV, the new channel
supported by the large cable players and operated by United Artists
Programming, are much less plush.
In fact, in an echo of the access television pioneered by Mr Moses Znaimer's
CityTV in Toronto, a lot of the prog- ramme time is set in a shopping mall
and there are experts such as doctors and lawyers on hand to give advice.
But the emphasis is on informality and almost anything can happen.
Mrs Joyce Taylor, chief executive of United Artists Programming, whose prog-
ramme interests range from Discovery, the documentary channel to Bravo, the
classic films channel, or as they are trying to market it today 'timewarp
television', sees Wire TV as closer to a commer- cial radio station with
pictures than conventional television.
Wire TV is meant to provide a national backbone of prog- rammes to hold
together the local programme offerings of cable operators around the UK and
an outside broadcast van trundles around the country making programmes.
The 5-7pm period each evening is designated as an opt-out slot when
operators can insert their own local news prog- rammes. It is also part of
the process of making sure cable television has channels and attractions of
its own on top of those common to satellite.
The life and diversity of international, national regional and local
programmes ranging from MTV to QVC and Performance to Wire TV gives a
suggestion of what is happening in the cable and satellite television market
and the way an increasing number of services is being delivered, in addition
to the offerings of the traditional broadcasters.
Yet all the signs are that what is available now is very much the beginning.
Large international corporate forces taking advantage of rapid technological
change are gathering, which are likely to transform the media business over
the remaining years of this century and equally transform the level of
choice available, at least in theory, to consumers.
Politicians glibly revive old visions of creating 'super- highways' of
limitless capacity down fibre optic strands as thin as a human hair, usually
without going into the specifics of how it is going to happen and who is
going to pay.
But 10 years after the first wave of such talk, this time at least there is
some reality to the vision.
In a notable piece of investment research last year Goldman Sachs predicted
that because of rapid technological developments in computer software and
hardware, consumer electronics, cable and telecommunications industries, 'a
true revolution in the delivery of enter- tainment, information, trans-
actional and telecommun- ications service may be at hand'.
The analysts argued that the marrying of the cable converter box with the
computer, the turning of television pictures into digital form and their
compression and the use of fibre optics and personal computer software would
ultimately allow 'immediate access to and manipulation of a bounty of
information and informational products'.
They called it the new world of Communacopia.
Predicting the precise timing of such a process, when the consumer will
start realising he lives in Communacopia, and be prepared to pay, and
forecasting who will be the winners and losers in such a world are
challenges of a different order to noting that a number of industries are
con- verging.
According to Mr Nicholas Negraponte, director of the media laboratory at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, there is simply no doubt. The future
is digital. And when everything from television to telecom- munications can
communicate in digits, the language of computers, the extra choice that
becomes available will lead to a gradual move away from the concept of mass
media to one of personal media and individual choice.
Of course people will still read a general newspaper or magazine and watch a
mainstream television channel to be surprised, amused, come across something
they did not know they wanted to know, or share in the feeling of being part
of a larger society or culture.
But increasingly, Mr Negraponte believes, there will be a growing tier of
personal media both visual as well as print and that computers will be
programmed to hunt databases and programme libraries to assemble specific
packages of information or programmes to match the taste and needs of
individual consumers.
Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of the News Corporation, would certainly not go
so far as Mr Negraponte - or at least not yet - but he keeps in touch with
the latest developments in media technology.
Last month he expressed what is rapidly becoming conventional wisdom at a
high-powered dinner in London's Whitehall held to mark the transformation of
Sky into a largely subscription package.
Five major industries - computers, telecom- munications, television,
entertainment and telecommunications - were converging into a single giant
industry which would be the third largest in the world, he said.
'We feel that our company, with its worldwide network of talent, can make an
important contribution to this exciting industry and, in the process enrich
the countries in which we and their peoples work,' the News Corporation
chairman said.
The speech and a flurry of announcements that preceded it - everything from
the purchase of a controlling stake in Star TV in Hong Kong which broadcasts
to 38 Asian countries, to joint television ventures in Mexico and Germany,
led critics to conclude that Mr Murdoch had embarked on a new phase of his
bid for worldwide media domination now that he had largely broken free again
from the debts and bankers who nearly took the company under three years
ago.
He did not manage to persuade everyone with his further claim that
technology was undermining the power of the individual media mogul by
greatly increasing the number of possible competing choices available.
One of the key technologies Mr Murdoch was talking about was digital
compression - turning television pictures into a digital stream and
manipulating them.
Digital television equipment is already commonplace in the backrooms of the
television industry, in such places as editing suites and special effects
where they can turn reality on its head and send things whizzing through the
air.
But much more than visual gimmicks can be achieved. Turn a picture into
digital form and you can either have a wide screen with enhanced quality
picture, a large number of new channels or a trade-off between the two.
Consumer electronics manufacturers would very much like to sell their
customers new high definition television sets .
One day no doubt they will, but early indications from the marketplace would
suggest that more consumers are interested in having an increase in channels
than seeking sometimes evol- utionary enhancements in the television picture
that are more readily noticeable to television engineers than those who
already quite happily watch appalling pictures with badly tuned aerials.
Companies such as National Transcommunications, the former transmitting and
engineering arm of the old Independent Broadcasting Authority in the UK,
Scientific Atlanta and Compression Labs of the US are already offering
digital compression systems.
A National Transcom system is being used this autumn to turn one channel
into three for FilmNet, the Brussels-based European film channel.
The Astra satellite system is planning to offer digitally compressed
channels from 1995 - as long as agreement has been reached on standards -
something that seems increasingly likely.
Last month 85 manu- facturers and broadcasters from 12 countries met in Bonn
to set up the Digital Video Broadcasting project to draft a European
standard by the end of this year which will incorporate, where possible, the
work of the Motion Pictures Expert Group and the emerging standard known as
MPEG 2 .
Agreement could mean the prospect of 150-channel television systems for
Europe would then open up. Eutelsat, the rival satellite system to Astra
which is owned by the post and telecommunications organisations of Europe,
plans to offer digital on a satellite due for launch in 1996  - Hot Bird
Plus. A large number of compressed channels is also likely on the Star
system by 1995.
In digital compression a great reduction in the amount of information that
has to be transmitted is achieved by storing the elements of a television
picture that do not change from one frame to the next.
Instead, only the information covering movement, or any other new elements
in the picture, is transmitted.
The savings in information are so great that, depending on the quality of
picture required, as many as 10 television channels can be squeezed into the
space previously occupied by one channel.
Not only does digital technology make more channels possible, by reducing
the cost of delivery a wider range of minority channels broadcast by
satellite becomes financially viable.
So far, digitally compressed channels are being sent only to cable networks
rather than direct to the consumer. This is the quickest way to achieve
savings because only one decoder is needed at the cable head end to serve
the entire cable network. Domestic decoders are now being designed and the
first digital television service to the home will be launched next year.
This December a Hughes Aircraft company satellite will be launched from
French Guyana, a satellite which by April 1994 will be broadcasting a
digitally compressed service of between 70 and 80 channels to dishes of less
than 18 inches diameter over the entire US continent. A second satellite is
due to go up in mid-1994, which will mean the system will be able to offer a
total of 150 channels.
'Everything is on schedule,' the operating company DirectTV said this month.
The domestic equipment is being manufactured by Thomson Consumer
Electronics.
About 50 to 60 of the channels will be given over to 'nearly
video-on-demand'. Five or six satellite channels can be devoted to a single
popular film and the showing times staggered so that the viewer is never
more than 15 or 20 minutes away from the beginning of the film on one of the
channels.
DirectTV also plans to run a batch of channels aimed at rural areas of
America which are not cabled or cannot receive television signals without
erecting enormous dishes. There will be special events and sports channels
covering games not shown on network television. DirectTV expects its
subscribers to spend something like Dollars 25 to Dollars 30 a month on the
services available.
It is too early to judge how well DirectTV will fare - previous high power
satellite television services in the US have foundered largely because more
than 60 per cent of the population are already hooked up to cable networks.
The receiving equipment is expected to sell at Dollars 699 to Dollars 899,
not including installation. This compares with between Dollars 1,800 and
Dollars 2,500 for existing backyard dishes which can be as large as three
metres in diameter.
Some US observers think that DirectTV could at least dent cable's growth as
well as making inroads into the 3m homes in the US that have very large
dishes.
A number of large US media groups are looking at different ways of
delivering greatly increased choice and pay- per-view movies, through cable
networks as well as satellite.
Time Warner, for instance, the world's largest media group, is already
running a 150-channel service on a conventional cable network in the New
York borough of Queens - and again, apart from the normal selection of cable
channels and several ethnic minority services such as Korean and Japanese
channels, a large block of channels is set aside for the staggered showing
of a small number of hit movies in the hope of generating new revenue.
The company is also building an experimental cable system in Orlando,
Florida, to look into the market for advanced interactive services of all
kinds. Viacom is setting up its advanced cable system at Castro Valley,
California, as virtually a cable laboratory to test a range of possible ways
of delivering and charging for new services.
'There may not be a single answer. There may be two or three ways to play,'
Mr Frank Biondi, chief executive of Viacom, says.
TCI, the Denver-based cable operator run by Mr John Malone, which is the
largest in the world, is even pushing ahead with a 500-channel cable service
using compression.
A lot of the activity flows from the hope in many US media companies that
pay-per-view could begin to generate enormous revenues. So far, the hopes
have far outstripped the performance.
Mr Biondi recalls that, when satellite film channels such as Home Box Office
were launched in the early 1970s, the talk was of pay-per-view but instead
it went down the monthly subscription route because the billing was more
convenient, although technical developments have now eased that particular
problem.
According to Mr Biondi, 'there has been no serious take-up for pay-per-view
for 20 years. We are way behind revenue projections on motion picture
pay-per view.' He believes there is still a great deal of posturing in the
marketplace.
'If there is a tremendous jump in revenues people will do it much more
quickly,' he adds.
When 50 to 60 channels were first introduced at Queens, it is believed that
the monthly revenue for home pay-per-view on five channels rose from Dollars
4 to Dollars 8 or Dollars 9 per home.
'Good but not great,' one industry observer commented. By contrast, film
subscription channels in the US have an annual take of between Dollars 4bn
and Dollars 5bn, a figure that totally dwarfs pay-per-view, which so far is
little more than Dollars 200m a year.
At this year's FT cable and satellite conference Mr Edward Bleier, a Time
Warner pay-per-view specialist, suggested that although conventional systems
produced only Dollars 5 a month from each pay-per-view subscriber, Dollars
10-Dollars 15 might be possible with movies 'nearly on demand'.
He warned, however, that all the evidence suggested that there was a limited
range of things that the public were willing to pay for - mainly hit movies
and genuine events such as a world boxing title match. Run-of-the-mill
concerts do not register at the pay-per-view box office.
The outlook could, however, improve further, he added, when 'we finally
achieve electronic Nirvana'.
What Mr Bleier had in mind was massive libraries of films stored
electronically which can be directly switched to individual viewers' homes.
Nirvana has hardly arrived yet but a number of organisations, apart from
cable and satellite companies, are working hard on developing ways of
competing directly with the video shop by enabling consumers to order the
film of their choice electronically.
Later this month British Telecom will decide whether to go ahead with a
video-on- demand service down existing conventional telephone lines. The
plan would cost several billion pounds. A number of American telephone
companies have been carrying out similar work.
BT technologists insist that pictures of a 'merchantable' quality - as good
as video recorder reception can be deliv- ered over a high proportion of the
BT telephone network which goes into 23m homes. There is enough capacity for
the pictures to be transmitted down a telephone line while a conventional
telephone conversation is taking place.
BT concedes that picture quality may fade the further away a consumer is
from the local telephone exchange. Cable television critics say it is all
very well demonstrating good quality pictures in the laboratory with brand
new copper wire connections, but quite another matter to deliver such
pictures down ancient copper wires installed decades ago.
Mr John Sheridan, chief executive of Encom Cable, which operates cable
franchises in London from Newham and Tower Hamlets to Redbridge and Waltham
Forest, says that BT will be in a weak competitive position with its
pictures down telephone wires.
'It's something that has been invented after it is too late,' he says. 'It's
going to be very limited in terms of bandwidth (capacity). The technology
will expand it but if it is competing with fibre which is much deeper in the
neighbourhood (through cable ),' Mr Sheridan adds.
Last month appeared to clear a major regulatory hurdle which might have
blocked the introduction of such a service. The Independent Television
Commission after discussions with Oftel, the telecom- munications watchdog
and the Department of Trade and Industry said it did not think that pure
video-on-demand, where a programme was requested by and shown in an
individual household, needed a local delivery licence under existing
broadcasting legislation.
If BT had needed a local operator's licence from the ITC, it would almost
certainly not have got one one in cable franchise areas. The Commission has
always taken the view that it will not license competitors to cable, at
least while networks are still being built. The ITC's view of the matter,
which is subject to seeing detailed proposals might yet be tested in the
courts.
Mr Richard Woollam, managing director of the Cable Television Association,
the industry trade organisation, is phlegmatic in commenting about the
challenge from such a service.
'What we are seeing from the US is that while video-on-demand may be the
cherry on the cake as a stand-alone product, it isn't proving to be a
commercial success.'
The CTA managing director adds that BT has not fully sorted out its voice
business yet. 'To try to stick in some form of digitalised compressed video
service is very much Hans Christian Andersen stuff,' he adds.
In spite of his doubts about the financial viability of such a service, it
is likely that the CTA, on behalf of the cable industry, will sue BT if it
tries to go ahead. Under the Duopoly Review BT is for- bidden from competing
directly with cable television in programme services until at least the year
2000.
Any legal dispute is likely to revolve around what sort of service under
existing legislation video-on-demand is deemed to be.
Certainly, many of the big players in the UK media industry have been to see
BT's telephone pictures, including companies such as Pearson and ITV groups
such as London Weekend Television.
Apart from trying to expand into a new business, and perhaps applying
indirect pressure for the loosening of restrictions on its activities, BT is
probably not averse to trying to shake some of the growing confidence in
cable television.
The cable industry has been causing BT a small but growing headache by
offering competing telephone services at a discount and video services could
help stunt cable growth although the main threat would be to video shops.
The BT decision to enter the satellite dish market, and put considerable
marketing weight behind the initiative, is once again designed to try to
stop cable in its tracks. The more satellite dishes there are out there, the
fewer customers there will be for cable, the hope goes, and with it fewer
customers for cable telephone services.
But as BT tries to make up its mind at board level whether to commit itself
to a national video-on-demand system, another approach to the market shows
signs of coming to fruition.

Shares in Invergordon surged on reports that one of its biggest
institutional shareholders had been approached by Whyte &amp; Mackay, the US
group which holds a 41.2 per cent stake in the Scottish spirits company
following a failed bid over two years ago.
Fleming Investment Management was reportedly unsuccessfully approached to
sell its 13.6 per cent stake in Invergordon for 300p a share. Yesterday, the
shares closed 20 ahead at 288p, although the turnover at 680,000 was not
excessive. The US group launched its Pounds 350m hostile offer at 275p a
share and has never discounted rebidding. Recent dull results from
Invergordon were seen as encouraging for the predator.

Shares in British Aerospace (BAe) fell sharply as doubts about its proposed
regional jets joint venture with Taiwan resurfaced following a renewed
attack on the deal by the country's opposition political party.
Opposition deputies were reported to have suggested that the Taiwan
Government may drop its support for the proposed Pounds 250m venture. The
reports once again led to jitters on the London market which saw the shares
tumble 13 to 407p at the day's worst, before they steadied, assisted by the
strong market trend, to close 9 off at 411p, in thin trading of 1.6m.
One analyst said: 'There is nothing concrete or new in these doubts but it
brings to the surface worries that the deal may yet fail.'

THE downward slide in tobacco and financial services group BAT Industries
continued yesterday after Hoare Govett and SG Warburg joined the list of
houses that has recently downgraded profit expectations at the group.
Active selling of the stock brought volume of 9.4m by the close as the
shares ended 5 off at 456p, having touched 450p earlier in the day.
Hoare Govett was said to have moved its current year forecast from Pounds
1.86bn to Pounds 1.80bn citing pressure on the US domestic tobacco market
and in international exports for the move.
Researchers at Warburg are believed now to be expecting current year profits
of Pounds 1.8bn against a previous estimate of Pounds 1.828bn. The group
reported profits of Pounds 1.65bn last year.
Shares in BAT fell sharply at the end of last week after UK analysts on a
visit to the group's US insurance operations came away with a less than rosy
picture of near term trading.

FT  06 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Overseas buying drives shares ahead

THE renewed strength of stock markets across Europe, emphasised in the UK by
hopes of an early cut in domestic interest rates, took the London stock
market yesterday to within a few points of the all-time high on the FT-SE
Index. The dramatic events in Russia, reflected in calmer oil and currency
markets, set the scene for confident buying of equities.
US and continental European funds bought into the UK market, often by way of
the December contract on the Footsie which continued to trade at a strong
premium. Trading volume in equities, as reported by the day's catch-all Seaq
total, was the highest since mid-August.
Shares opened higher and extended their gains as stock index futures raced
ahead. At best, the Footsie was nearly 29 points ahead at 3,096.4, barely
five points under the closing all-time high. The pace then slackened, but
the FT-SE closing level of 3,085.2 was 17.5 points up on the day. At the end
of August, the Footsie traded, but did not close, around 3,115.
The enthusiasm spread across the range of the market, lifting the FT-SE Mid
250 Index by 18.4 to 3,457.7. Seaq volume jumped by 40 per cent from Monday
to a total of 774.3m shares, with non-Footsie business contributing around
62 per cent. Monday's retail business was worth Pounds 1.01bn, sustaining
the twelve month long record of profitable trading in equities in the London
market.
Renewed buying of UK stocks by fund managers from across the Atlantic
provided a significant boost to confidence as well as to share prices.
Salomon Brothers International, the US investment bank which turned positive
on London this week, was believed to be a buyer yesterday of both equities
and stock index futures.
At Nomura Research Institute, Mr Nicholas Knight, the noted bull of the UK
market, repeated his forecast that the Footsie will close the year around
3,500, although adding that to concentrate unduly on December 31 is to 'miss
the essence of any forecast.'
Hopes for a cut in UK base rates are focused around the annual conference of
Britain's Conservative party, now in session in Blackpool, and in particular
on tomorrow's speech by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer.
However, there was not much activity in UK fixed interest stocks yesterday
and few City analysts expect base rates to be cut immediately.
With crude oil prices no longer responding to tensions in Russia or to last
week's Opec agreement, the blue chip oil stocks lagged the stock market.
Pharmaceutical stocks improved with the general trend but were not the
favoured stocks of the US buyers.
Domestic consumer and banking stocks, however, were in good form as the
market regained its confidence in prospects for a cut in base rates. Banks'
burdens of bad debt would be eased if rates were cut.
Across the broader range of the stock market, expectations that the recovery
in the UK economy will soon show itself in corporate profits appeared
undimmed by the slightly disappointing outcome of the third quarter profits
reporting season which has just ended. Optimism has been moved forward to
cover prospects for the fourth quarter season which opens early in January.

OPTIMISM continued in derivatives trading with a mix of rumours of an early
interest rate cut mingling with relief at the stemming of the Russian
crisis, Christine Buckley writes.
The December contract on the FT-SE 100, in good health after the previous
day's performance, began trading at a strong premium to the cash market. It
pushed up to reach a day's high of 3,127 though that peak was short-lived
and most of the high-level trading centred around 3,124-25.
Trading talk in the morning had Salomon as a keen buyer in a market that the
large institutions largely watched from the sidelines. Independent traders
took the most active roles and interest was keen from US buyers. Volume was
steady at 8,656 contracts.
The arrival of sellers in the afternoon sent the contract drifting and
December closed at 3,118 - a 13 point lead over the fair value premium to
cash.
Some words of caution were uttered by bearish traders who felt that the
continuation of Monday's enthusiastic buying of the December contract meant
that the market had run ahead of itself.
Traded options saw good activity with volume jumping to 46,462 lots, more
than 20,000 up on the previous session. Of the stock options Asda was
highest at 10,493 with confidence in the food retailers buoyant after a
recent strong buy note by BZW.

FT  06 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities lifted by
European gains

Wall Street
RISING European markets, buoyed by the apparent resolution of the Russian
political crisis, provided US share prices with an initial lift yesterday,
but losses in semiconductor stocks kept any gains to a minimum, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 9.50 at 3,587.26. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 0.13 lower at 461.21,
while the Amex composite ended up 0.10 at 461.68, and the Nasdaq composite
down 2.61 at 762.23.
Trading volume on the NYSE was 285m shares, while rises and declines ran
neck and neck at 986 to 988.
Stocks moved higher at the opening bell as investors and traders reacted
positively to news of substantial gains on foreign equity markets.
Stocks in London, Frankfurt - where they rose to a record high - and Paris
were all higher yesterday morning as investors breathed a sigh of relief at
the victory of President Boris Yeltsin over the anti-reform hard-liners who
had occupied the Parliament building in Moscow.
Overseas stocks were also lifted by talk of a more positive outlook for
European economies, something which also contributed to early gains in US
prices. Among individual stocks, Daimler-Benz made its debut on the NYSE
yesterday - the first German company to obtain a full listing on US mar
kets. Amid much publicity, trading began with Daimler's ADRs (every 10 ADRs
represent one Daimler share) rising to Dollars 47, close to their equivalent
price in Frankfurt. By the close, the ADRs had eased back to Dollars 46 3/4
, in volume of 1.4m shares.
Semiconductor and technology stocks, which had been in demand lately,
suffered a setback yesterday when Advanced Micro Devices reported third
quarter earnings of 61 cents a share, up from 51 cents a share a year ago
but well below analysts' estimates. The news left Advanced Micro down
Dollars 4 5/8 at Dollars 21 7/8 in volume of 7m shares.
It also depressed Texas Instruments, down Dollars 4 7/8 at Dollars 70 1/2 ,
Motorola, down Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 98 1/2 , and Hewlett-Packard, down
Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 67 5/8 . Paramount Communications rose initially as
investors reacted positively to Monday's late announcement that Nynex, the
regional telecommunications group, was investing Dollars 1.2bn in Viacom,
the cable television company which has made an agreed Dollars 7.5bn bid for
Paramount.
The investment from Nynex was seen as giving Viacom more room to increase
the size of its bid, and possibly match a rival Dollars 9.5bn offer made by
QVC, the home shopping television network. Later in the day, QVCN announced
it had completed the financing for its bid. The day's events left Paramount
down Dollars 1 at Dollars 76 3/4 , Viacom down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 57
1/8 on the American Stock Exchange and QVC up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 55 7/8
on the Nasdaq market.
Safeway climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 19 3/4 after the retailing group
announced third quarter earnings of 34 cents a share, double last year's
comparable figure.
Canada
TORONTO prices closed higher in busy trading, as the TSE-300 index
strengthened its position above the 4,000-point level. It rose 12.08 points,
or 0.30 per cent, to close at 4,014.11.
Advancing issues outnumbered declines 365 to 345 while volume was 68.78m
shares, up from yesterday's 38.43m shares. Trading value rose to CDollars
620.6m from CDollars 418.2m.
Twelve of 14 sub-indexes closed higher. The real estate group jumped 3.2 per
cent, led by Intrawest Development, up CDollars  7/8 to CDollars 13 5/8 .
The day's volume was boosted by Falvo Corp., which closed up CDollars 0.04
at CDollars 0.29 on volume of about 8.5m shares.

FT  06 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Strategists plump for Pacific Rim
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PACIFIC RIM equity markets, already attracting US analysts, continue to win
converts.
The global strategy team at Nomura in London has doubled its model portfolio
weighting for Hong Kong to 6 per cent and is introducing Malaysia with 3 per
cent and the Philippines and Korea with 2 per cent each.
The re-rating, at the expense of the US, doubles Nomura's total weighting
for emerging markets to 20 per cent.
Mr Nicholas Knight, who heads the Nomura team, said that the attractions
were growth rates which look outstandingly good by western standards, and
generally reasonable market valuations.
Mr David Roche of Morgan Stanley, which again raised its Hong Kong weighting
yesterday, suggested that one outcome of events in Moscow could be
convergence between Russia and China if an authoritarian, pro-reform
government was installed. He advised building equity weightings in the Far
East, particularly connected to the China story, at the expense of Europe.

FT  06 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region climbs as Nikkei
vacillates
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Bleak corporate news discouraged investors and margin-linked selling in the
afternoon eroded earlier gains, but share prices finally closed marginally
higher on investment trust buying at the session's close, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed up 57.50 at 20,321.93. Relief over the ending of
the turmoil in Russia and an overnight rise in the Chicago futures market
prompted arbitrage linked buying. The index rose to a high of 20,410.04, but
later fell to the day's low of 20,237.82 as margin traders facing
settlements liquidated positions in small lots.
Volume remained thin at 230m shares against 183m. An unexpected downward
earnings revision by Nintendo, the video game maker, added to the
uncertainty over share prices, and many investors remained on the sidelines.
Advances led declines by 550 to 440, with 192 issues remaining unchanged.
The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 0.90 to 1,634.93, while in
London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.08 to 1,269.20.
Some traders remain hopeful that the Nikkei will remain above the 20,300
75-day moving average, but most investors chose to focus on gloomy corporate
news yesterday. Video game makers and other amusement stocks were slack due
to the Nintendo forecast of a 21 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, to
Y121bn, for the current year to next March.
Discount menswear retailers continued to weaken on the Fair Trade
Commission's investigations into allegedly misleading advertisements, and
construction companies were lower on the spate of bribery allegations and
the arrest of an executive at Taisei, a leading construction company.
Nintendo fell Y510 to Y8,790, Sega Enterprises lost Y400 to Y10,700 and
Konami Y120 to Y4,930. Among menswear discounters, Aoki International fell
Y80 to Y5,420.
Taisei lost Y26 to Y613, while Shimizu declined Y14 to Y816 and Obayashi
fell Y21 to Y624. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the bellwether stock of
the Tokyo stock market, lost Y8,000 to Y868,000.
Foreigners supported high-technology issues. Sony rose Y40 to Y4,650 and
Sharp rose Y10 to Y1,560. Toyota Motor gained Y40 to Y1,750 and Honda Motor
rose Y30 to Y1,570 on buying by overseas investors.
Semiconductor related issues were stronger, with Nikon up Y32 to Y947 and
Tokyo Electron advancing Y70 to Y3,100.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 22.69 to 22,274.63 in volume of 19.7m shares.
Roundup
Pacific Rim markets took their cue to move ahead from the easing of Russian
tensions, as well as diverse local factors.
HONG KONG continued to benefit from strong US institutional demand and the
Hang Seng index finished at its third consecutive record high, up 125.16 at
7,869.48 and close to the intraday high of 7,878.35.
Several leading US houses have increased their weighting for Hong Kong in
recent days, triggering heavy demand for local stock, with immediate
political developments taking a back seat in the current rally.
Turnover improved to HKDollars 4.93bn from HKDollars 3.72bn on Monday, with
turnover in index futures and options twice that of the share market.
AUSTRALIA ended at a six-year high, boosted by a new allocation of funds at
the start of the new quarter and strong performances by BHP and News Corp.
The All Ordinaries index closed 21.5 ahead at the day's high of 1,998.5,
with analysts commenting that only weakness in the gold sector preventing it
from breaching the 2,000-level.
BHP jumped 52 cents or 3.2 per cent to a record close of ADollars 16.94,
after an intraday high of ADollars 16.96. News Corp also at a peak, touched
ADollars 11.00 before easing back to end 14 cents stronger at ADollars
10.92.
BANGKOK jumped 2.1 per cent with across-the-board rises in active trade and
the SET index ended above 1,000 for the first time in three years. The index
leaped 20.74to end at the day's high of 1,019.45 in heavy turnover of
Bt8.39bn.
SINGAPORE moved higher in record volume of 618m shares against a previous
peak of 550.12m set on April 14. The Straits Times Industrial index rose
10.44 to 2,033.51.
NEW ZEALAND moved higher, ahead of the government's pre-election fiscal
update which came after the market closed, and the NZSE-40 capital index
added 9.25 to 1,955.61 in turnover of NZDollars 38m.
TAIWAN was unable to maintain its best levels with profit-taking leaving the
weighted index to finish 5.02 higher at 3,813.26, after an intraday high of
3,832, in thin turnover of TDollars 10bn.
MANILA rebounded strongly as the currency stabilised and the composite index
rose 46.52 to 1,951.06 after Monday's 55-point plunge as volume swelled to
504m shares.
SEOUL closed slightly higher in a day of improved trading volume in spite of
rumours of a debt default by a leading business group. The composite stock
index added 2.66 points to 717.71.

FT  06 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses rise in response to
interest rate theory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BULL argument for European equities was put yesterday by Mr Anthony
Thomas, of Kleinwort Benson: 'Our strategy is unashamedly unsophisticated:
we see interest rates triggering a shift out of cash and into equities.'
Bourses backed the argument up, writes Our Markets Staff, particularly in
Germany where the yield on five-year notes, or Bundesobligationen, was
reduced by six basis points to 5.55 per cent.
FRANKFURT rose by 2.6 per cent to a new all-time closing high, the DAX index
ending 49.01 higher at 1,972.73. Traders said that investment funds had
chosen not to roll over call money investments from the third into the
fourth quarter because of current low short-term interest rates.
Turnover more than doubled from DM5.25bn to DM10.8bn. Apart from the
interest rate argument, said Ms Barbara Altmann at B Metzler, DTB traders
caught short by Mr Yeltsin's victory in Moscow were said to be covering
their positions in the cash market. Allianz, which weighs in at over 12 per
cent of the DAX, rose by DM127, or 4.9 per cent to DM2,708.
Daimler took its place on the New York stock exchange with the underlying
shares up DM14 to DM760, still a below average gain on the day. Above
average performers included Degussa, the metals and chemicals group,
disposing of a lossmaking subsidiary and climbing DM25, or 6.7 per cent to
DM385.50; and Kaufhof, the retailer, planning to list ADRs on Wall Street
and rising DM32.50 to DM560 on the excitement of it all.
PARIS was optimistic about benchmark interest rates, and decided that the
bargain price for the BNP privatisation was a bull point. The CAC 40 index
rose 30.11, or 1.4 per cent to 2,158.77 and Rhone Poulenc, depressed by the
BNP pricing on Monday, recovered FFr3.50 to FFr156.50.
US investors were reported to be snapping up companies such as LVMH and Club
Med, which have strong interests in North America and rose by FFr172 to
FFr3,880, and by FFr16 to FFr392 respectively.
However, Schneider, the electrical equipment and construction group, dropped
first on plans to raise FFr3bn, and secondly on a report that the company's
chairman, Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, faces a legal investigation in
Belgium. It closed FFr28 lower at FFr358.
MILAN continued to be driven by the Fiat rally and the Comit index added
5.95 to 596.47. Mr John Stewart, of InterEuropa in Milan, noted that Fiat's
share price had picked up by 10.4 per cent since last Wednesday's sell-off
as the market reassessed its rights issue, and the terms of the sale of its
Rinascente stake.
Fiat rose another L100 to L6,180. Rinascente was L102 higher at L9,920.
Ifil, the Agnelli holding company, picked up L61 to L5,866, recouping some
of Monday's sharp losses, as it sought to reassure analysts by forecasting
that 1993 pretax profit would rise to L315bn from last year's L198bn.
Fondiaria gained L700 or 5.4 per cent to L13,500 on short covering ahead of
its rights issue.
ZURICH took its lead from a higher Frankfurt and the SMI index overcame
recent hesitancy to push convincingly through the 2,500 level. The index
finished 31.0 or 1.2 per cent higher at a record 2,521.3.
Insurers were supported by recent profits figures and investors beginning to
adjust portfolios to match the SMI index which will weight the sector more
heavily from next year. Swiss Re was SFr100 higher at SFr3,480 and
Winterthur advanced SFr23 to SFr748.
Swissair posted a further SFr28 rise to SFr718 amid continued speculation
about the outlook for the Alcazar alliance.
AMSTERDAM found early support from the options market and pushed higher
after Wall Street opened firmly with a further round of investment buying.
The CBS Tendency index rose 1.2 to 126.9.
Financials were in demand with ABN-Amro Fl 1 up at Fl 46.40 and Ing,
recommended by Goldman Sachs as 'one of the most attractive European
financial shares. . .',adding Fl 1.70 to Fl 75.70.
STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden General index rose 26.7 to 1,325.74, and
HELSINKI's Hex put on 35.03, or 2.5 per cent at 1,325.74.
Headlines included a SKr7 rise to an all-time high of SKr444 in Ericsson B,
and Nokia's further FM21 gain to FM283 after a chart topping performance
this year.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Conditions soften
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MORE relaxed trend in the UK money markets continued yesterday as a
number of operators sat back and waited for clues on impending monetary
policy to filter from the Tory party conference, writes Peter John.
Short sterling maintained its very tight range and the Bank of England
operations were completed by midday.
The central bank offered the money market an early round of assistance after
forecasting a liquidity shortage of around Pounds 900m.
The shortage, slightly less than recent days, was well bid and easily taken
out.
Among the main factors affecting the position were the take-up of Treasury
Bills and paper maturing in official hands which were expected to drain
Pounds 273m from the system.
Bills for repurchase by the market took out Pounds 647m and bankers'
balances below target removed Pounds 150m. Partly offsetting these,
Exchequer transactions added Pounds 50m and a fall in note circulation
injected Pounds 115m.
The Bank provided Pounds 750m of early assistance, buying Pounds 750m of
bills for resale to the market in equal amounts on October 25 and 26 at 5
29/32 per cent.
It provided a further Pounds 150m later in the morning, bringing total help
to Pounds 900m.
This compared with its latest forecast of a Pounds 1bn liquidity shortage.
Short sterling moved within a very narrow range with the most actively
traded contract, for delivery in December, recording paltry turnover of
10,200 lots and closing only four basis points lower at 94.34. That level
discounts a third of a percentage point off base rates and is seen as a
reasonable hedge on a half point cut around the time of next month's budget.
Also, three-month money which is seen as the crucial indicator of where base
rates will be in the short term, held fast at between 5 15/16 per cent and 5
7/8 per cent.
One dealer said: 'The money market doesn't expect a cut at the moment but it
is watching the conference with half an eye and without getting too upset.'
German Euromark futures traded on Liffe held fast around 93.80 with nearly
30,000 lots dealt.
The market decided the Bundesbank was unlikely to cut interest rates at
tomorrow's council meeting as it comes too soon after the inauguration of Mr
Hans Tietmeyer as the German bank's new head.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Dollar recaptures lost ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By  PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US dollar regained some of its early losses yesterday as investors took
a more balanced view of events in Russia and hopes of positive US economic
data at the end of the week, writes Peter John.
It weakened against the D-Mark in early European trade, hitting DM1.6140 at
one stage and settling at DM1.6173 at the midday price fixing in Frankfurt.
From there it rallied strongly throughout the afternoon as the market looked
towards the publication of non-farm payroll figures - the most important
monthly business indicator in the US - on Friday. The rally was further
helped by encouraging housing figures - US housing completions for August
rose 11.3 per cent after a revised fall of 6.4 per cent in July - and by the
close in London the dollar had ticked back up to DM1.6235, barely changed on
the day.
It also pulled back more than a cent from an early low against the pound to
close at Dollars 1.5170 in London, against Dollars 1.5150 on Monday.
The US currency has slumped from just under DM1.75 at the time of the
collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism at the beginning of August
and by mid-September it had reached a low of DM1.5860. The fall was fuelled
by growing nervousness over the state of the economy. Since then, dealers
have decided that the currency was oversold and there has been a technical
rally.
The D-Mark joined an across-the-board rise in German financial markets as
the country breathed a general sigh of relief that the status quo in Russia
appeared to have been restored: the DAX index gained more than 2.5 per cent
to close at a record high and bund futures rose nearly half a percentage
point at best.
The currency held sway in Europe reflecting a belief that the German
Bundesbank will not reduce key interest rates at its council meeting
tomorrow. However, it had already risen strongly against the dollar on
Monday in response to President Yeltsin's victory and the rally proved
unsustainable.
Sterling failed to respond to indications coming from the Tory party
conference in Blackpool that the government would not instigate a
politically inspired interest rate cut but regained earlier D-Mark losses to
close marginally firmer at DM2.4625, up from DM2.4600 previously.
The Canadian dollar, which has been very badly hit ahead of general
elections on October 25, recovered earlier losses. On Monday, in spite of
intervention from the Bank of Canada, the Canadian dollar broke through
CDollars 1.34 against its US equivalent for the first time June 1987.
Yesterday, it opened at CDollars 1.3373.
The Japanese Yen responded to positive comments by Mr Yasushi Mieno, the
governor of the Bank of Japan, and ignored the latest current account
figures which showed that, in Yen terms, exports were down by 13 per cent
against the same time last year. It rose slightly to Y105.50 against the
dollar.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lithuania seeks western help
with exploration
</HEADLINE>

LITHUANIA is aggressively seeking western investment to help tap the
country's oil reserves and restructure the refining industry.
The Baltic state holds a small cache of high-grade crude in its north-west
corner. At present 16 fields are being explored, containing 25m tonnes of
crude, of which 9m tonnes is recoverable.
Total on-shore potential has been pegged at 137m tonnes, of which 40m tonnes
is recoverable - not insignificant for a country barely bigger than Belgium,
but a far cry from Russia's 152,000 wells and 327m-tonne annual output.
Sea Search, a Dutch oil concern, and RWE-DEA, a subsidiary of the German
group, are finalists in the competition for rights to a field near Klaipeda,
the western Baltic port city, according to Lithuanian energy ministry
officials. A contract should be awarded by the end of this month.
The two companies had expressed interest along with Svenska Petroleum, Neste
and Knight, a US company - which, the officials said, also made preliminary
offers before pulling out.
This contract will follow an April agreement between Svenska Petroleum and
Lithuania's Gargzdai Enterprises to form a joint-venture to develop the
north-western fields.
Exploration of the Baltic off-shore fields awaits the resolution of
political questions. With newly independent states still settling sea
borders, Russia and Lithuania are bickering over rights to a field that lies
in Lithuanian and the Kaliningrad region's waters.
Mr Robertas Timosiunas, a Lithuanian deputy minister of energy, expects that
the disputed area designated as D-6 , a tiny plot with some 7m tonnes of
oil, will be divided between the two countries. Negotiations are continuing.
The undisputed off-shore field holds an estimated 150m tonnes of crude,
about a quarter of which is recoverable, and needs outside investment as the
Lithuanians cannot afford exploration efforts.
The state's refining business similarly lacks western money and know-how to
stem the decline in supply and output since the collapse of the Soviet
Union.
After a 2 1/2 -year dispute with environmentalist, Lithuania plans to
restructure the Mazeikiai refinery. A modern structure dependent on imports
from former Soviet republics, Mazeikiai operates below its 12m tonnes-a-year
capa-city.
An Ecu450,000 (Dollars 525,000) grant from the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development will help restructuring efforts, plans for
which are being drawn up by the UK consultancies NM Rothschild and Trichem.
The eventual programme, which Lithuanian officials expect to cost at least
Dollars 80m, will include a new hydrocarbons port on the Baltic near the
Butinge area, a pipeline connecting it with Mazeikiai and renovations at the
refinery itself.
The Baltic state, weary after two years of intermittent Russian supplies and
infrequent payments for deliveries, wants a western partner to ease the move
into new market.
Above all, however, a refinery needs crude oil: 'We're looking for an
investor who can guarantee delivery,' Mr Timosiunas said.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: King defends LME copper squeeze
move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR David King, chief executive of the London Metal Exchange, has rejected
sharp criticism of the exchange's action last month in imposing a limit on
the cash premium for copper, which was being inflated by a technical squeeze
on metal available for immediate delivery, Reuter reports.
He declined to elaborate on a statement he made at the time that the LME
board had taken the action 'in anticipation of the development of an
undesirable situation', but he strongly defended the exchange against any
suggestion of irregularity in the way the decision was taken.
Mr John Champagne, president of Magma Metals Company, has said he was
extremely disappointed by the LME move. At a lunch of mining analysts last
month, he also suggested that the exchange had too many short position
holders on the board and criticised it for delaying announcement of its
decision for one and a half hours.
'In view of the comments made in the press,' Mr King said yesterday, 'it's
appropriate that people know that behind the scenes there are all sorts of
checks and balances.
'Standard practice is that whenever significant decisions are made in the
board, our compliance people automatically track trading activities of
directors' firms. . . We need to be able to confirm that no advantage has
been taken of that information.'
He said he had been unable to read the decision across the floor of the
market immediately because it was not in session.
'We announced the decision at the first available time in the afternoon when
the market was operating,' he declared.
'In wanting to ensure a level playing field we need really to announce it on
the market floor,' he explained. 'Then all the ring fraternity instantly
knows at the same second what the board's decision is.'
Mr King said it was totally wrong to say, as some had, that the copper price
fell precipitously prior to the announcement. Even at the end of the day the
market had not dropped much.
The slide in copper prices has been resumed at the exchange this week, with
the three-months position closing yesterday at Dollars 1,686 a tonne, down
Dollars 12.75 since Friday's modest rally and about Dollars 200 below the
level ruling when the squeeze suddenly evaporated at the and of last month.
With the cash position falling even more steeply the Dollars 56 cash premium
over three-months metal has been replaced by a Dollars 23 discount, which is
regarded as a normal level for the cash/three-months spread when supplies of
the metal are freely available. The cash discount, or 'contango', represents
the costs of holding physical metal, chiefly storage, insurance and lost
interest on the capital employed.
Business on the exchange hit a record in September, driven mostly by
volatility in copper, which plunged to six-year lows after the LME limited
the cash premium.
Copper futures traded 2.24m lots (25 tonnes each), up from just 771,105 in
the same month last year, and copper options were traded on 220,380 lots, up
from 44,399.
Altogether in futures and options, LME volume hit 4.2m lots in September, up
from 2.42m in the same month last year, while the total for the first nine
months soared to 25.28m lots from 17.76m.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Analysts expect smaller Florida
orange crop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1993-94 Florida orange crop could be as low as 160m boxes or as high as
190m, but most analysts' estimates are concentrated in the 165m- to 175m-box
range, Reuter reports from New York.
That is well below last year's figure of 186.5m 90-lb boxes issued by US
Department of Agriculture, which was the state's third largest orange
harvest.
Analysts said brisk activity on New York Cotton Exchange's frozen
concentrated orange juice futures market was linked to recent buying ahead
of USDA's report, due for release on October 12. Ms Celeste Georgakis, first
vice president futures specialist with Dean Witter, said uncertainty would
continue until the release of the estimate.
'But most of the consensus is still pointing toward 165m to 185m,' she said.
'I feel the estimate could come in the mid-170m box area.'
Factors that could hurt this season's production included a late cold snap
last winter in Florida, which was reported to have killed some bloom, and
some outbreaks of blossom blight disease, according to analysts.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbeans lose interest in
sowing cotton - The decline of the famed sea island fibre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMBINATION of apathetic farmers, rows among investors and legal disputes
over trademarks has denied four eastern Caribbean islands of the benefits of
increasing demand for a unique and costly type of cotton that they once
produced in substantial quantities.
Despite the efforts of some governments and farmers' organisations, there
appears little prospect that the islands will again produce the famed sea
island cotton in quantities that will satisfy the demand in the world's
fashion centres, where ties, shirts and suits made from the product are
commanding higher and higher prices.
'There has been a general decline in the production of sea island cotton in
the Caribbean, although there is continuing high demand for the product,
particularly in Japan,' says Mr John Spence, an agronomist who specialises
in sea island cotton production in the eastern Caribbean. 'The decline is
linked with the fact that in the Caribbean today, agriculture is not a happy
pursuit. Any real expansion of production will take some time.'
The government of Barbados, the leading producer of the four producing
islands - Barbados, Antigua, St Kitts and Montserrat - has been attempting
to raise the interest of farmers in the production of sea island cotton as
part of wider efforts to diversify agriculture on the island, which is based
mainly on the production of sugar cane. 'There is now a different problem
as, while prices are up, farmers are uncertain about stepping into another
form of agriculture,' says Mr Spence.
He explains that cotton is less hardy than cane, and demands greater
attention and care from farmers. Many farmers consider this higher degree of
husbandry as not being worth the effort. 'With cotton one needs to establish
the proper infrastructure, and much of this has been missing. The plant is
easily affected by pests, a closed season is needed for the crop and the
entire industry needs to be regulated.'
In the 1950s there were more than 5,000 hectares under sea island cotton in
the four islands; this year the crop is growing on only about 200ha. The
problems troubling the potentially lucrative industry are illustrated by the
failure of one plan to raise production.
Eight years ago the government of Guyana, located on the north-eastern
shoulder of South America, offered to provide 40,000ha for a joint venture
with the four islands to produce sea island cotton. But the project was
aborted when it was revealed that, legally, the term 'sea island cotton'
could be applied only to the product grown in specified islands in the
eastern Caribbean.
'Sea island cotton is different from all others in that it has the longest
and finest fibre in the world,' explains Mr Spence. 'It can be spun into the
world's finest yarns to make the best fabrics. There have been one or two
cases in which there have been attempts to equate cotton from other parts of
the world with sea island cotton. Some Egyptian and some Indian cotton have
some of the qualities of sea island cotton. But the only pure sea island
cotton is grown in the West Indian islands.'
There has been foreign interest in kick-starting production of the prized
fibre in significant quantities. Japanese investors have offered to buy
500,000lb of the product each year from Caribbean producers, but farmers
could not guarantee consistent delivery in such quantities.
The four islands established a company, in which Scothalls of Canada was a
major investor, with a plan to spin cotton and produce fabric and garments
in the region. Faltering production and disagreements among the partners
over management practices left the venture unable to meet its targets. The
small quantities being produced in the eastern Caribbean are being sold to
Japanese trading houses. All spinning and weaving of sea island cotton is
done in Japan.
The faltering industry has also been adversely affected by legal arguments
over the use of the sea island cotton trademark. Producers have alleged that
US companies have attempted to pass off high quality Egyptian cotton as the
sea island product.
'Because demand is high and production is low, there will always be an
opportunity for some people to claim that what they have is the genuine
product,' says a former Barbadian cotton farmer. 'There is a good market for
the product but farmers have long memories and the earlier problems do not
encourage many to jump into cotton production.'

FT  06 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bigger sugar shortfall forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHORTFALL in world sugar supply is expected to more than double next
season, leading to sustained price rises, according to a report published
today by ED &amp; F. Man, the London trading house.
Man estimates that there will be a production deficit of 734,000 tonnes for
October 1993 to September 1994 compared with 338,000 tonnes the previous
year.
'The resulting draw down in stocks in a number of countries particularly in
India and China leaves these markets without a buffer for further
substantial de-stocking,' it says.
A cloud of uncertainty hangs over the coming season, and many crops that
suffered last year are not expected to recover fully, says Man.
'The resulting supply deficit is expected to have a more lasting influence
on prices. . . in the 1993-94 season the possibility of further de-stocking
has diminished and the prospects for white sugar supplies have declined.'
Man predicts that world production, based on individual countries' crop
years, will rise by nearly 1m tonnes to 112.4m tonnes compared with 1992-93,
still well below the levels of the previous two years.
It puts consumption, which is calculated differently, using the October to
September period, at 113.7m tonnes, an increase of 1.8m tonnes or 1.6 per
cent on 1992-93.
Man has revised its production and consumption estimates for last season,
bringing it into line with other forecasts. It has reversed its May forecast
of a supply surplus of 562,000 tonnes into a deficit of 455,000 tonnes.
It accounts for the change by saying there has been a big fall in estimated
sugar cane production and concomitant strong demand for white sugar from the
former Soviet Union. Its estimate for Russian consumption last season now
stands at 6.5m tonnes compared with 5.4m tonnes in May.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec's September oil output
above new ceiling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAGOS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ESTIMATES of September production by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries show that it will have to cut output to reach its new ceiling of
24.52m barrels a day agreed last week in Geneva.
Opec wellhead crude oil output edged back up in September to 24.68m b/d
after an August dip, but it seems to have remained below this year's peak,
according to a Reuter survey released yesterday.
The September estimate compares with a revised 24.49m b/d in August and the
1993 high in July of 24.79m b/d. The agency attributed the August drop
mainly to a temporary reduction by Iran, which it said appeared to have
restored volume in September.
The Middle East Economic Survey estimated this week that Opec's September
production was likely to be around 24.7m-24.8m b/d.
But neither the Opec production estimates nor political events in Russia
have had any substantial impression on the oil markets. 'They have decided
in their collective wisdom that there is no danger to the supply of Russian
oil,' according to Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at Smith Barney
in London. 'And as for Opec, they are just waiting for the dust to settle.'
The price of Brent blend for November was Dollars 17.10 in late London
trading yesterday, compared with a closing price on Monday of Dollars 17.12.
Nigeria has implemented a contingency plan to enable lifting of crude oil at
loading terminals during a strike by inspectors, oil industry sources said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Lagos. 'They are still on strike,' said an
official of a major oil company. But 'as far as I know loading is going on
normally now'.
The inspectors at loading terminals began an indefinite strike on Monday to
press their demand for autonomy from the petroleum ministry.

The COCOA market made a fresh attempt at breaking overhead resistance but,
as on Monday, early gains were lost in the afternoon. 'It's been a funny old
day - a bit like yesterday,' one trader said. 'Every time we run up a
little, the market doesn't see any real follow-through buying.' The March
futures position at the London Commodity Exchange ended Pounds 3 up at
Pounds 970 a tonne, after touching Pounds 978 at one stage. At the London
Metal Exchange ZINC trading slackened in the afternoon after a lively start.
A speculative surge ran into overhead resistance above Dollars 920 a tonne
for three months metal and the price ended after hours trading at Dollars
916 a tonne, up Dollars 13. The LEAD market moved away from early 20-year
lows on late commission house buying and covering, although prices still
finished softer following a morning mini-collapse. The final three months
delivery price was Dollars 371 a tonne, down Dollars 7 on balance but
Dollars 6 above the low. Despite 1994 consumer interest and option business,
the market's short-term fundamentals were poor, with supply continuing to
outpace demand, traders said.

EUROPEAN government bond markets soared yesterday, spurred on by renewed
buying interest as the Russian crisis appeared to abate and investors were
able to focus once again on the favourable economic background.
ITALIAN government bonds climbed more than a point as investors took the
view that Europe's high-yielding bond markets are likely to see the most
scope for interest rate cuts. 'There's been quite a push from the big US
houses who are hoovering up Italian bonds,' noted one Italian trader.
The Liffe BTP futures contract broke through the resistance level of 117.50
to hit an all-time high of 117.53, ending the day at 117.49 to give a gain
of 107 basis points.
GERMANY also hit an all-time high yesterday, with the futures contract
bursting through an important resistance level which triggered further bouts
of buying in the futures market.
'We've seen the market hit the 99.20 resistance level five times recently:
this time it has broken through resistance and this is clearly a buy
signal,' said one dealer.
The Liffe futures contract moved from a low of 99.03 to a high of 99.45
before closing at 99.39. Volume was heavy with about 109,000 contracts
traded.
Few dealers expect the Bundesbank to ease official interest rates at this
week's council meeting - the first with Mr Hans Tietmeyer as president. At
yesterday's repo the Bundesbank left its two-week fixed rate repo unchanged
at 6.70 per cent, while the 35-day variable rate repo result will be
announced today.
UK government bonds took their cue from Germany, and the rally in gilt
prices enabled the Bank of England to sell the remainder of its tap stocks.
The Bank exhausted an Pounds 800m tranche of 9 per cent stock due 2011,
which was announced on Friday. It also sold out its index-linked stock
(Pounds 250m of 4 1/8 per cent stock due 2030) which was issued on September
14.
Dealers said that the gilt market continued to be supported by yield curve
plays, with investors borrowing at the short end to buy longer-dated issues.
The long end of the market witnessed the strongest gains with the 8 3/4 per
cent gilt due 2017 rising from 116 1/2 to 116 27/32 to yield 7.24 per cent.
FRENCH government bonds also hit new highs, with the December notional bond
contract on Matif reaching a peak of 124.14. It slipped back to 124.02 on
late profit-taking, up 0.26 point from Monday.
The central bank's announcement that it plans to auction between FFr13bn and
FFr15bn of 10-year and 30-year OAT's on Thursday, against market
expectations of between FFr18bn and FFr20bn, also lifted sentiment, one
trader said.
HEALTHY domestic buying buoyed the Japanese government bond market yesterday
as investors shrugged off concern about the political situation in Russia
and took encouragement from a successful auction of long-dated stock.
The futures market outperformed cash bonds: the December futures contract
rose from 113.30 at the opening to end at 113.49, up 0.44 on the previous
day's close. Dealers noted a favourable response to yesterday's auction of
20-year bonds.
The Ministry of Finance accepted bids for Y350bn of 20-year bonds with a 4.7
per cent coupon. The average accepted price was 100.45, giving a yield of
4.656 per cent.
US bond prices weakened slightly across the maturity range yesterday after
the Treasury announced an unexpected increase in the size of the weekly bill
auction.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/32 at 103
11/32 , yielding 6.003 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was
down  1/16 at 100 1/32 , to yield 3.842 per cent.
Prices opened mixed, and traded quietly until mid-afternoon when they
suddenly turned down after the Treasury said it was upping the size of next
weeks' bill auction from Dollars 23.6bn to Dollars 25.6bn. The scale of the
increase surprised dealers and analysts, and expectations that the fresh
supply would pressure prices lower quickly undermined market sentiment.
Technical considerations apart, attention yesterday was primarily focused on
this week's September employment report, which will provide the most
up-to-date view of labour market conditions.

FT  06 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Denmark sets benchmark with FFr7bn
Eurobond offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Kingdom of Denmark established a new benchmark in the French franc
sector of the international bond market with a FFr7bn offering of six-year
Eurobonds.
This is Denmark's largest single offering in the French franc sector and
equals the record for a French franc Eurobond, set in May by the Republic of
Spain. Spain initially raised FFr6bn through an offering of 15-year
Eurobonds but swiftly increased the deal by FFr1bn.
Lead manager Paribas said Denmark's offering injected badly-needed liquidity
into the six-year area of the yield curve since the 8 1/8 per cent French
government's OAT due 1999 now traded at around 111.75. The bonds have become
difficult to trade because of their significant premium to par.
However, Paribas acknowledged that the pricing of Denmark's bonds, at a
spread of 15 basis points over the yield on the underlying OAT, was
aggressive. The view in the market was that the spread should have been five
basis points wider.
By late afternoon, the bonds were trading at 98.27, compared with a re-offer
price of 98.61, and the spread had widened to 21 basis points, traders said.
Mr Niels Sorensen, head of the foreign debt department of Denmark's National
Bank, said that the proceeds of the issue would kept in French francs and
would be used to refinance the large amount of outstanding commercial paper
which was falling due this month.
He said that this issue was likely to be Denmark's last large Eurobond issue
for some time because of the DKr8bn rise in the country's foreign exchange
reserves to DKr68bn in September.
'This is higher than we consider necessary,' he said, adding the reserves
would be reduced in order to refinance commercial paper as it fell due.
The Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) raised CDollars 250m through an
issue of 10-year Eurobonds. They were priced to yield 23 basis points over
the 7 1/2 per cent Canadian Treasury due 2003.
Lead manager SBC said the pricing of the issue was in line with levels in
the secondary market for 10-year Canadian dollar paper issued by other
triple A-rated borrowers. However, some syndicate managers said that the
spread should have been in the high 20s in view of the uncertainty in the
market ahead of Canada's general election later this month.
SBC said that the bonds were selling well to institutions who were attracted
by the differential of 170 basis points between the yields in the Canadian
and US bond markets.
Mr Stephen Abrahams, head of the IADB's capital markets division, said the
proceeds of the issue had been swapped into Swiss francs. He added that the
IADB had a further Dollars 1.2bn to raise before the end of the year and was
considering an issue in yen, Swiss francs, guilders or dollars.
The IADB was also looking closely at the French franc sector where funding
rates had become much more competitive, he said. The IADB's funding
programme for 1993 is around Dollars 4.5bn and is likely to raise the same
amount next year.
Elsewhere, Banco Mexicano, a private-sector Mexican bank, is due to make its
debut in the Euromarket next week with a five-year issue of between Dollars
125m and Dollars 150m. The issue will be made under the bank's Dollars 350m
global MTN programme.
Lead manager Chemical said the bonds were likely to be priced to yield
between 340 and 360 basis points over underlying US Treasuries.

FT  06 OCT 93 / International Equity Issues: Firm demand for emerging market
Euroconvertibles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and CONNER MIDDELMANN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECENT spate of Euroconvertible issues from emerging markets in east
Asia indicates that investor demand for equity-linked bonds is far from
satisfied.
Around Dollars 2.5bn has been raised so far this year, and deals worth a
further Dollars 1bn are expected to be launched by the end of the year.
Hong Kong issuers have been the most active, raising about Dollars 1.3bn,
followed by Thai companies with just under Dollars 600m. South Korean,
Taiwanese and Indian companies have also made an appearance.
International investors have been keen to buy these issues so that they can
obtain exposure to some of the world's faster-growing economies. At the same
time, they are protected against the volatility and the illiquidity which
are endemic in emerging stock markets.
The relatively high yield on the bonds is another attraction, especially to
European investors.
The two main advantages from the issuers' point of view are an ability to
raise relatively large amounts in one go, a feat which would be much more
difficult to achieve in domestic markets, and an opportunity to expand their
investor base worldwide.
Investor demand has reached such a pitch that last week's issue for
Guangzhou Investment Company, the Hong Kong-listed vehicle for southern
China's wealthiest city, was eight times over-subscribed.
As a result, the five-year issue, lead managed by Morgan Stanley, was
increased by Dollars 30m to Dollars 105m. The issuer also achieved an
aggressive conversion premium of 24.6 per cent and a coupon of 4.5 per cent,
at the low end of the 4.5 per cent to 5 per cent range.
The bonds were launched at par but were trading at 104 3/8 yesterday. Morgan
Stanley said the bonds' rapid rise reflected the demand across the globe for
high-quality convertible paper as well as news that Cheung Kong, a core
shareholder in Guangzhou Investment, had taken up Dollars 30m of the issue.
Syndicate managers say the pricing of emerging market Euroconvertible issues
depends on several factors, including how well-known the issuer is, the size
of the issue, whether there are any calls or puts on the bonds, and the
volatility in the underlying stock market.
Hong Kong borrowers tend to achieve the highest conversion premiums, of
between 20 per cent to 25 per cent, because most are already familiar to
international investors. In addition, investors have shown themselves
willing to pay higher prices for securities which offer exposure to mainland
China.
By contrast, Thai and Indian issuers can only expect a premium of perhaps 10
per cent to 15 per cent because their names are relatively new and their
stock markets are not as developed as Hong Kong's.
However, syndicate managers warn that any attempt to force investors to pay
unrealistic prices could spoil the party for everyone. 'The market will be
fine provided people don't indulge in silly pricing,' says one syndicate
manager.
Syndicate managers report that there is a long queue of issuers waiting to
tap the market. Among Hong Kong names, Sino Land issued a seven-year Dollars
150m offering yesterday and Henderson Land is expected to launch a Dollars
400m offering in the near future. Several Thai issues are also in the
pipeline.
SCICI will be the first Indian financial institution to tap the
Euroconvertible market when it launches a Dollars 100m offering later this
month through BZW with joint-leads Lazard Brothers and James Capel.
ITC, the Indian tobacco and hotels company in which BAT of the UK has a
stake, is expected to launch a Dollars 100m convertible bond issue before
the end of the year.

FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Liffe in discussions over
listing for Euroyen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFFE, the London Inter-national Financial Futures and Options Exchange, is
exploring the possibility of listing a Euroyen futures contract in order to
extend its range of short-term interest rate contracts.
Liffe is in discussions with the Tokyo International Financial Futures
Exchange (Tiffe) the possibility of listing Tiffe's Euroyen futures
contract, rather than developing its own product.
Liffe already has a link with the Tokyo stock exchange which allows it to
list the TSE's Japanese government bond futures contract.
Mr Roger Barton, managing director of business development at Liffe, said
preliminary research had suggested that several members of Liffe see the
need for a Euroyen contract.
'A substantial number (of members) think we should list a contract which is
linked into Tiffe,' he said, stressing this would provide members with a
product that could be traded in the European time zone.
However, some traders see little need for Liffe to list a Euroyen contract,
given that the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (Simex) already
lists a Euroyen contract that can be traded during the early part of the
European day.
The Simex Euroyen contract is similar to Tiffe's product, but not as heavily
traded. Mr Barton said the average daily volume for Tiffe's Euroyen contract
is about 83,000 contracts, compared with about 12,000 for the Simex.
The OM Stockholm and OMLX exchange in London traded 2.49m contracts in
September, down from August's 2.83m but a rise of more than 50 per cent
compared with September last year, Reuter reports.
The exchanges said the rise this year was fuelled by growth in Swedish bond
and interest rate futures.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUTCHISON Whampoa, the Hong Kong-based conglomerate controlled by Mr Li
Ka-shing, is to dominate further China's container-terminal business by
acquiring control of the port of Yantian in Guangdong province. The deal is
valued at Rmb3.5bn (USDollars 605m).
Hutchison owns 60.5 per cent of Hong Kong International Terminals (HIT),
which controls more than 60 per cent of the Hong Kong port's container
throughput. The expansion into China is seen as a move to ensure the group's
continued monopoly on container business within the Pearl River delta
region.
Yantian, in the north-east of the colony, is the most commercially viable of
the Chinese ports being developed near Hong Kong and one of only four
government-designated, international deep-water ports.
HIT is the largest shareholder in a consortium composed of Cosco, the
Chinese shipping group, Mitsui and Kumagai Gumi (Hong Kong). The consortium
has taken a 70 per cent stake in Yantian International Terminals, funding a
Rmb5bn development programme. It is constructing five 50,000-ton container
berths and four general cargo berths, to be completed by the end of 1995.
Last year, Hutchison bought a 50 per cent stake in Shanghai's container
operations for HKDollars 1.4bn. It has formed a joint venture with the port
authorities of Zhuhai to operate feeder facilities for Hong Kong and develop
a deep water port.

FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Seiko Epson reduces PC
production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEIKO Epson, the Japanese electronics maker, is to stop manufacturing PCs
for overseas markets as a result of severe price competition.
Seiko said that it is halting production of IBM-compatible PCs at its US and
Singapore facilities and will meet overseas demand through OEM purchases
from PC makers in Taiwan. In an OEM purchase a company buys a product from
an outside manufacturer which it sells under its own brand name.
Price competition in the world PC market has hurt Seiko badly and the
company saw production in the US fall to less than a third of its peak of
600,000 in 1989.
Seiko's US facility has been transformed into a base for the production of
printers, and the number of employees there has been halved to about 500.
A facility in Singapore where the company manufactures PCs will now make PC
peripherals.
Seiko said that fierce price competition was the main factor behind its
decision which will allow it to reduce fixed costs substantially.

<TEXT>
MITSUBISHI Petrochemical expects to post a pre-tax loss for the six months
which ended in September, the group's first deficit since 1982, Reuter
reports from Tokyo.
The size of the expected loss was not spelled out, but a spokesman said the
company is planning to issue a downward revision of its earnings outlook
early next week.
The company said that the announcement would also clarify if there will be
an interim dividend.
Mitsubishi Petrochemicals had been expecting to pay a dividend of between Y4
and Y6 a share for 1993-94.
Like other companies in its industry, Mitsubishi Petrochemical has suffered
from the decline in petrochemical sales during the economic slowdown.
Mitsubishi Rayon plans shortly to announce revisions to its forecasts as the
six-month results are likely to deviate more than 30 per cent from earlier
estimates. These suggested that the group was heading for a Y800m (Dollars
7.6m) parent net profit in the six months ended September, against Y1.28bn a
year earlier.

FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: UK moves towards paperless
trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK securities industry took a small step forward in its quest for a
paperless trading system yesterday when the three vendors of electronic
trade confirmation (ETC) systems said they had set a date for testing a link
between their systems.
ETC is an automated screen-based process which replaces the current practice
of sending paper contract notes between brokers and their institutional
clients. ETC also shortens the time taken to confirm equity or fixed-income
trades between brokers and institutions. This means any failed trades can be
detected before they turn into expensive errors.
Many institutions and brokers have backed the introduction of ETC, but few
have subscribed to one of the three systems because they operate
independently. As a result, they would have to subscribe to all three in
order to confirm trades with each other.
There has been an agreement in principle between the vendors to set up
inter-vendor links (IVLs), but progress has been hampered by discussions
about who will bear the development costs and how the charges for using the
links will be divided.
Yesterday, the International Securities Market Association (Isma), the
London Stock Exchange (LSE) and Thomson Financial Services announced an
implementation plan for the trilateral testing of IVLs.
Isma and the LSE will begin testing on November 29 and testing by Thomson
will begin in early 1994. The first link between Isma and the LSE is
expected to go live in April 1994 and Thomson expects its links with the
other two to go live in August 1994.
Mr John Lambert, chairman of a group of ETC users and operations director at
Schroder Investment Management, said that brokers and institutions should
now feel confident to make decisions about which system is most suited to
them.

FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Japanese carmakers agree supply
deal

THE DIVISION of labour within Japan's motor industry gathered pace yesterday
as three car manufacturers announced plans to supply each other with
vehicles for the domestic market. The moves are to allow the companies to
maintain product ranges while reducing development costs.
Nissan, Japan's second-largest carmaker, will supply Fuji Heavy Industry,
maker of Subaru cars, with vans from early next year. Nissan will also
supply Mazda with vans and estate cars, but in return buy vans and trucks
from Mazda.
Nissan will provide Fuji Heavy with 200 vans a month. Fuji will terminate
production of its Subaru Leone van, now running at about 200 a month.
Nissan will supply Mazda with 1,400 vans and estate cars a month, for sale
under the Mazda Familiar marque in the Japanese domestic market.
Mazda will stop producing its Familiar vans and wagons for the domestic
market, but continue to manufacture the vehicles for export.
The moves, which follow an agreement between Honda and Isuzu earlier this
year to supply each other with vehicles, reflect the efforts of Japanese
carmakers to survive one of the worst recessions in the industry by reducing
development costs for less successful models. The industry has seen weak
demand for three consecutive years, while the yen's appreciation has hurt
the price competitiveness of Japanese carmakers abroad.
Mazda has not been as successful with its smaller vans and estate cars sold
under the Familiar marque. It produces less than 2,000 of these vehicles a
month, and announced recently that it will close one production line where
it manufactures the Familiar vans and estate cars.
Nissan will also stop making the Vanette van and truck from early next year,
when it will replace those models with products from Mazda.
The vehicles have been manufactured at a Nissan subsidiary in which Nissan
has a 33 per cent stake, but the company has seen production of these models
fall from a monthly average of 2,820 last year to 2,440 a month in the first
eight months of this year.
Nissan said that it was reviewing models which were not profitable, while
Mazda noted that it would be more cost-effective for it to buy the vehicles
from Nissan than continue developing them itself.
Part of Nissan's supply to Mazda will come from Nissan's facility in Mexico,
where it recently increased capacity. The company expects to ship 1,500 vans
a month from Mexico and increase that number after several years to about
30,000 to 35,000 units a year.

SHARES in Woodside Petroleum, the Australian oil and gas producer, jumped 7
cents to a two-year high of ADollars 4.07 yesterday, after the company
announced the go-ahead for development of the Cossack and Wanaea oilfields
on the North West Shelf, off the west coast of Australia.
Six equal partners are involved in the project - BHP Petroleum, BP
Developments, Chevron Asiatic, Japan Australia LNG (MIMI), Shell Development
and Woodside.
The six groups are committed to spending more than ADollars 1bn (USDollars
647m) to bring the oilfields into production and construct a liquefied
petroleum gas extraction scheme around a site at the Burrup Peninsula in
Western Australia.
The Wanaea oilfield was discovered in 1989, and has estimated recoverable
reserves of about 200m barrels of crude oil.
The neighbouring Cossack field, which was discovered a year later, has a
further 33m barrels.
The first contracts for the LPG plants are due to be awarded in November,
and the plant is expected to be finished early in 1996.
The Wanaea and Cossack oil projects are due to be completed by the end of
1995, when initial production will start.
Planned peak production is 115,000 barrels a day.

INVESTCORP, the Arab-led investment consortium, plans to expand its
retailing operations into the music sector through the acquisition of
Camelot Music, the third-biggest US music retailer.
Investcorp is believed to be paying more than Dollars 350m for the
privately-held Camelot, which had revenues of Dollars 421m in fiscal 1993.
Neither company would reveal the terms of the acquisition, which is expected
to be complete by the end of the year.
Mr Paul Soldatos, a member of Investcorp's management committee, said
Camelot had 'significant growth potential'. Investcorp is expected to expand
Camelot's foothold in the music retailing business through other
acquisitions.
Investcorp has a significant presence in the US retail world through its
ownership of Saks Fifth Avenue, the upmarket department store group which it
bought in 1990 for Dollars 1.6bn from the UK's BAT group.
The company's North American interests also include the Tiffany jewellery
chain, Peebles Department Stores and the Circle K convenience store chain.
Earlier this year Investcorp gained control of Gucci, one of the best-known
luxury goods groups. In the UK, it bought Thorn EMI's Lighting division for
Dollars 162m in what was effectively a management buy-out.

HERSHEY Foods, the US chocolate producer, said yesterday that Mr Richard
Zimmerman would step down as chairman and chief executive at the end of the
year, writes Frank McGurty.
Mr Kenneth Wolfe, currently president and chief operating officer, was
elected by the board of directors as his successor. Mr Joseph Viviano,
president of Hershey Chocolate USA, will replace Mr Wolfe.
'These changes have been studied by the board over the past two years and
are part of a planned, orderly succession,' said Mr Zimmerman, who has
headed the Pennsylvania-based company since 1985.
Hershey, which expects record earnings this year in spite of an overall
slump in domestic candy sales, recently launched a white chocolate version
of its Kisses candy. The new product, Hugs, is expected to generate annual
sales of Dollars 100m.

FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Retiring Ford chief warns on
excess capacity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXCESS capacity is the biggest problem currently facing the world auto
industry, Mr Harold Poling, who is to retire as chairman and chief executive
of Ford at the end of the month, has warned.
'Overcapacity will result in some down-sizing and some consolidating in the
world industry for the rest of the decade,' said Mr Poling.
The worldwide recessions had masked 'the more fundamental concern' of
overcapacity, said Mr Alex Trotman, who will take over as chairman, chief
executive and president of Ford from November 1.
'Overcapacity will cause the consolidation and restructuring of the auto
industry worldwide,' said Mr Trotman.
'Not everyone will be around by the end of the century, certainly not in
their current configurations.'
Both Mr Poling and Mr Trotman ruled out any early move by Ford to increase
its present 24.5 per cent stake in Mazda, the troubled Japanese carmaker,
which warned recently that it faced losses of around Y32bn (Dollars 302m)
this year.
'It is a key issue how we go with Mazda in the next 10 years. They do have
serious problems,' said Mr Trotman. 'We have no plans to increase our stake
in Mazda. It is a big decision for us. The terrain is changing with the
difficulties they are having in Japan.'
Mr Poling said that Ford, which lost Dollars 2.76bn in 1991 and 1992 (before
a one-time charge of Dollars 6.88bn, principally to fund healthcare payments
for retired workers) had to strive to be a low-cost producer.
'When you are the low-cost producer you are in charge and regardless of what
the opposition does, they will hurt more than you do.'
Both Mr Poling and Mr Trotman indicated that a member of the Ford family
could succeed to the chairmanship. The corporation has been been led by
non-family members since Henry Ford II resigned from the chairmanship in
1980.
Two great grandsons of Mr Henry Ford, the founder, are currently on the Ford
board. Mr Edsel Ford II, 45, the only son of the late Henry Ford II, is
president and chief operating officer of Ford Motor Credit, while Mr William
Clay Ford Jnr is general manager of the climate control division. Both now
serve on the board's executive and finance committees.
Mr Trotman said that Ford's worldwide capital spending in the next few years
would 'substantially exceed' the Dollars 30bn spent in the five years to
1992.
Overall profitability was improving - it earned Dollars 1.35bn in the first
six months of the year - but its financial performance was still burdened by
higher marketing costs, lower capacity utilisation and record spending
worldwide on new product programmes.
US new car sales remained below trend and the economies of most large
European markets continued to worsen.

FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: AMD results hit US semiconductor
sector
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in US semiconductor manufacturers were dragged down yesterday after
Advanced Micro Devices' third-quarter results failed to live up to analysts'
expectations.
AMD's share price ended the day down Dollars 4 3/4 at Dollars 22. Among
other semiconductor companies, Intel lost Dollars 2 3/4 to close at Dollars
70, Motorola was down Dollars 3 3/8 at Dollars 98 1/2 and Texas Instruments
closed down Dollars 5 1/2 at Dollars 70 1/8 .
AMD's third-quarter net income rose 25 per cent to Dollars 61.3m before
preferred stock dividends, or 61 cents a share after dividend payments. In
the same period last year net income was Dollars 49.1m, or 51 cents a share
on the same basis. Revenues increased 17 per cent for the quarter, to
Dollars 418.4m from Dollars 356.7m.
Analysts had forecast third-quarter income of about 66 cents a share,
following second-quarter net earnings of 65 cents a share. AMD's share price
drop reflected 'downbeat' comments by company executives, they said.
However, Mr W. J. Sanders III, AMD chairman and chief executive, said the
company had had 'another outstanding quarter', noting that operating income
rose more than 50 per cent compared with the same period last year.
'We are on track to achieve a third consecutive year of record sales and
earnings,' said Mr Sanders.
Revenues were boosted by strong sales of AMD's latest 'clone' of the Intel
microprocessors used in personal computers. Sales of 486 microprocessors
more than offset declining sales of the older 386 microprocessor and
seasonally slow sales of most other product lines, AMD said.
AMD is involved in series of legal battles with Intel over intellectual
property rights that have cast a shadow over its success in the
microprocessor market.
Sales of flash memory chips and CMOS programmable logic products reached
record levels in the quarter, the company said.
However, Mr Sanders noted that Intel's expanding production of flash
memories, used in notebook computers, is likely to bring prices for these
devices down.
For the first nine months of 1993 the company reported revenues of Dollars
1.2bn, an increase of approximately 11 per cent over the previous year.
Net income was Dollars 187.1m before the preferred dividend, or Dollars 1.89
a share after the dividend, compared with net income of Dollars 175.4m, or
Dollars 1.84 a share, on the same basis last year.

SAFEWAY, the North American grocery retailer, yesterday said that its
earnings had more than doubled in the third quarter in spite of persistent
economic sluggishness in the western US and Canada, where most of its 1,100
stores are located.
In the quarter to September 11, net income was Dollars 42.1m, or 34 cents a
share, compared with Dollars 20m, or 17 cents, in the corresponding period
of 1992.
Revenues climbed 3 per cent to Dollars 3.6bn, in spite of a declining
exchange rate for the Canadian dollar and low price inflation throughout the
food sector.
On a same-store basis, Safeway sales increased 3.1 per cent, at a time when
most of its west coast competitors were experiencing flat sales growth or
small declines.
Wall Street responded enthusiastically to the results, which exceeded
analysts' consensus forecast of 29 cents a share. At the close on Wall
Street, the stock was at a 52-week high of Dollars 19 3/4 , up Dollars 1 1/2
.
The earnings improvement reflects the company's continued success in
controlling costs through staff reductions and improved purchasing
procedures. Operating and administrative expenses in the quarter slipped to
23.8 per cent of sales, against 24.4 per cent last time.
The California-based chain has staged an impressive turnround under the
leadership of Mr Steve Burd, who assumed the job of chief executive in
March.

FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: QVC arranges Dollars 4bn finance
for Paramount bid

<TEXT>
QVC Network, the home shopping channel headed by Mr Barry Diller, yesterday
said it had arranged financing of Dollars 4bn to back its Dollars 9.5bn bid
for Paramount Communications.
It also said it had delivered evidence of the financing arrangements to
Paramount in an approach which could spark discussions for the first time
between the company and directors of Paramount.
The board of the besieged TV and film production company, which is backing a
rival Dollars 7.5bn offer from cable TV group Viacom, has said it would
consider the QVC bid when there was 'satisfactory evidence' of financing to
support it.
Paramount confirmed yesterday afternoon that it had received financing
documents and said it would review them. Sources close to the company said
the board was expected to meet next week to decide if the QVC bid could be
fully financed, and if so, to authorise discussions with QVC.
QVC's Dollars 4bn comprises two Dollars 500m equity investments in the
company that had already been reported, from Comcast and Liberty Media, and
commitments from six banks to provide Dollars 500m each towards a bid.
The six are Chemical Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Barclays, LTCB Trust,
NationsBank and Toronto Dominion Bank.
QVC's cash-and-share bid for Paramount includes Dollars 30 per share in
cash, or Dollars 3.52bn.
Viacom gained a powerful ally on Monday for its bid when Nynex, the 'Baby
Bell' regional telephone company serving the north-eastern US, agreed to
invest Dollars 1.2bn in the company.
The deal, together with a similar Dollars 600m investment in Viacom last
week by video retailer Blockbuster Entertainment, will give the company a
war-chest of almost Dollars 2bn with which it could increase its bid, which
contains only Dollars 9.10 a share in cash.
QVC declined to comment yesterday on reports it had been talking to other
'Baby Bell' telephone companies about potential alliances, including
BellSouth, the Atlanta-based company which covers the south-eastern US.
Moody's Investors Service, the credit rating agency, said yesterday it had
placed Nynex under review for possible downgrade because of the Viacom deal.
Shares in QVC rose Dollars 1 1/8 yesterday to Dollars 55 7/8 , valuing its
bid at Dollars 80 a share, while Viacom's A shares dipped Dollars 7/8 to
Dollars 57 1/8 and its B shares Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 53 1/8 , valuing its
bid at just over Dollars 62 1/2. Paramount closed down Dollars 1 at Dollars
76 3/4.

SAFEWAY, the North American grocery retailer, yesterday said that its
earnings had more than doubled in the third quarter in spite of persistent
economic sluggishness in the western US and Canada, where most of its 1,100
stores are located.
In the quarter to September 11, net income was Dollars 42.1m, or 34 cents a

Revenues climbed 3 per cent to Dollars 3.6bn, in spite of a declining

Wall Street responded enthusiastically to the results, which exceeded

reached a 52-week high of Dollars 19 1/4 , up Dollars 1.
The earnings improvement reflects the company's continued success in
controlling costs through staff reductions and improved purchasing
procedures.
Operating and administrative expenses in the quarter slipped to 23.8 per
cent of sales, against 24.4 per cent last time.
The California-based chain has staged an impressive turnround under the
leadership of Mr Steve Burd, who assumed the job of chief executive in
March.
'Mr Burd has changed the culture at Safeway,' said Mr Richard Church, an
analyst with Smith Barney Shearson in New York. 'The company has not only
cut costs, but has become more focused on its customers by passing the
savings along through lower prices. That is reflected in the sales
improvement.'
Mr Gary Giblen, who follows the company for PaineWebber, expects Safeway to
continue showing improvement as a reduced cost structure enables the chain
to lower prices, offer better service and further improve sales. 'Mr Burd
has entered the virtuous circle of retailing,' he said.

<TEXT>
SENIOR debenture holders of Trizec, the troubled North American property
group, will continue studying the company's financial restructuring plan for
another two weeks, almost certainly delaying approval beyond October 20.
Trizec, a publicly-held affiliate of the Hees-Edper group of Toronto,
proposed a CDollars 1.86m (USDollars 1.39m)debt and preferred stock
restructuring in August. It sought approval by October 20 to avoid default
on a CDollars 84m Swiss-franc debenture issue due then.
The trustee for the senior debenture holders owed CDollars 1.1bn said
advisers are studying Trizec's legal and financial situation closely to
determine whether the restructuring is acceptable. When they have all the
information needed they will resume negotiations with Trizec.
The company said it was willing to delay the approval meeting beyond October
20 and find means to avoid technical default on the Swiss debenture issue if
necessary.
Trizec's debt, some in bearer form, is held widely in North America and
Europe, making the approval process for the restructuring complex. The
company was caught by the 1991 slump in North American property markets.
The senior debenture holders' steering committee is headed by a
representative of the Union Bank of Switzerland.

interests also include the Tiffany jewellery chain, Peebles Department
Stores and the Circle K convenience store chain.
Earlier this year Investcorp gained control of Gucci, the luxury goods
group. In the UK, it bought Thorn EMI's Lighting division for Dollars 162m
in what was effectively a management buy-out. According to US trade
publications, Investcorp bid against HMV of the UK for Camelot.
Camelot, which has 365 stores in 34 states, was founded by Mr Paul David in
1956. Most of its stores are in shopping malls. They sell compact discs and
cassettes in addition to video-cassettes and other home entertainment
products.
Mr David is expected to retire as Camelot's chairman, president and chief
executive. Mr James Bonk, 45, will take on the positions of president and
chief executive.

FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Newfoundland to privatise power
unit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NEWFOUNDLAND plans to follow the example of neighbouring Nova Scotia in
privatising the Newfoundland &amp; Labrador Hydro Power generating utility in
order to ease the province's severe financial pressures.
The initial proposal is to sell Newfoundland Hydro to Fortis, a
publicly-traded holding company which provides 85 per cent of the island of
Newfoundland's power through its distribution subsidiary.
Talks with Fortis are expected to take up to six months, but the provincial
premier, Mr Clyde Wells, says that if a deal cannot be reached, another
privatisation route will be found.
Fortis also has interests in telecommunications and a property management
unit. Newfoundland Hydro generates most of its power at the Bay d'Espoir
hydro plant.
The province's plan would effectively merge Newfoundland Hydro with the
Fortis distribution company. The merged company would have assets of
CDollars 1.8bn (USDollars 1.35bn), capacity of nearly 2,000MW, annual
revenues of more than CDollars 700m and more than 2,000 employees. After the
merger it would be taken public.
Mr Wells, himself a former Fortis chairman, said the new company would still
be subject to regulated power rates. He wants to reduce the province's
indirect obligations to Newfoundland Hydro, escaping a guarantee of the
utility's CDollars 1.4bn debt.
Newfoundland Hydro is planning to privatise certain activities to reduce
debt. Hydro-Quebec, one of Canada's two biggest utilities, has considered
following a similar path.

FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Kuwait sees BNP stake as first
move in French sell-off agenda

<TEXT>
KUWAIT may invest in future French privatisations following the announcement
earlier this week that it plans to take a 2 per cent stake in Banque
Nationale de Paris (BNP), the banking group which is the first candidate in
the French government's share sales.
The Kuwait stake - which is divided between the Kuwait Investment Authority
and the Kuwait Public Institution for Social Security, each with 1 per cent
 -is one of the noyau dur, or hard core, holdings in BNP that the French
government has sold to provide a stable base of long-term shareholders for
the bank.
The Kuwait Investment Office, part of the KIA, said yesterday that Kuwait
saw BNP as a good investment opportunity and regarded the stake as a medium-
to long-term investment. It said Kuwait would scrutinise forthcoming French
privatisations for attractive investments.
A number of other foreign companies have taken noyau dur stakes in BNP,
which is valued at FFr43bn (Dollars 7.4bn) by the FFr240 a share offer
price.
These include General Electric (GE), the US electronics group; BAT, the UK
consumer products concern; Roche Holding, the Swiss pharmaceuticals company;
and Dresdner, the German bank with which BNP has a partnership agreement.
Noyaux durs were prominent in the earlier privatisation drive between 1986
and 1987. However, most of those investors were French concerns. This time
the government is encouraging foreign shareholders to participate.
Roche and GE, like Kuwait, plan to take noyaux durs holdings in BNP - of
about 0.77 per cent and 0.76 per cent respectively - as financial
investments. Roche said its investment was being made through its portfolio
management division. GE will take its stake through three pension funds.
Similarly, BAT is buying its proposed 0.5 per cent stake in BNP as an
investment on behalf of its insurance operations and pension fund. It
decided to participate as a noyau dur to ensure that it was guaranteed a
stake in the bank even if, as expected, the issue was over-subscribed.
However, the UK group, which has substantial tobacco interests, sees the BNP
investment as a strategic step towards securing a stake in Seita, the French
state tobacco monopoly which is scheduled for sale later in the
privatisation programme.
BAT said that its participation in the BNP issue was 'a sign of our
commitment to France' that 'should help strengthen our relations with the
French government', thereby improving its prospects of being accepted as a
noyau dur in Seita.
Dresdner Bank's decision to take a 1 per cent stake in BNP was driven by
strategic reasons.
The German bank, which has for some time operated a commercial partnership
with BNP, recently negotiated a cross-shareholding agreement whereby each
bank would take up to 10 per cent of the other's equity.
That agreement is awaiting authorisation from the European Commission.
Many of BNP's French noyaux durs are industrial groups in which the bank is
already a minority investor, such as Saint-Gobain, Pechiney, Compagnie
Generale des Eaux and Saint-Louis.
Most of the other domestic noyaux durs are clients of the bank.

property in California

<TEXT>
OBAYASHI, the Japanese construction company, is to withdraw from the US west
coast property market by liquidating three Los Angeles-based subsidiaries
and writing-off losses of Y30bn (Dollars 278m) in the year to March.
The Japanese contractor can apparently afford to bear the losses this year,
as it has avoided the worst of a corruption scandal in which executives from
five other leading construction companies have been arrested in recent weeks
for the alleged bribery of provincial politicians.
Japanese construction companies, hit by the fall in property prices and
orders at home, have been reducing their exposure in the international
market. The scandals in Tokyo have given them another reason to minimise
investment risks.
Companies implicated in the scandal, including Taisei and Hazama, have been
temporarily suspended from bidding for some public works projects, creating
opportunities for Obayashi and other contractors which have so far avoided
the ignominy of arrests.
The government suspensions for contractors implicated in the scandal are
expected to influence private orders received by the companies. Taisei said
yesterday that it had not lost private contracts, but private orders for the
industry are down 30 per cent to 40 per cent because of the depressed
property market.
In spite of a record fall of 40.6 per cent in national and local government
orders received by the largest 50 Japanese contractors in August, Obayashi
said pre-tax profit for the year to March would be Y60bn, up from a
previously forecast Y52bn.
The write-offs arising from the Los Angeles liquidations will cut net profit
to Y13bn from a projected Y23bn, the company said. Sales for the period are
expected to be Y1,600bn, down slightly from the forecast Y1,640bn.
Obayashi will remain active in Hawaii and Europe.

FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Kaufhof Holding plans sponsored
ADR scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KAUFHOF Holding, one of Germany's largest retailing groups, announced
yesterday that it plans a sponsored American Depository Receipt programme
for its shares in North America.
The sponsored ADR programme is the second to be set up by a German
industrial company. It falls short of the full listing obtained by
Daimler-Benz yesterday, but the timing of the announcement suggests that
other leading German companies have recognised the logic behind Daimler's
move to the world's largest capital market.
Volkswagen, the carmaker, is the only other German non-financial company to
have a sponsored ADR programme.
Kaufhof said that in setting up the programme it was reacting to US
institutional investors' interest in buying US dollar denominated shares in
German companies. It said 2 per cent of its share capital was owned by US
investors, but it had no plans to raise funds directly in the US equity
market.
A sponsored ADR programme is one of three ways that shares in non-US
companies can be traded in North America. Under such an agreement the
company formally appoints a bank as trustee for its shares.
These are packaged by the bank into dollar-denominated securities which are
then available over-the-counter to US investors. The company undertakes to
bear the costs of the programme.
Foreign company shares can be traded via unsponsored ADR programmes: this
takes place without the co-operation of the company and any trust bank can
act as depository institution.
A full listing, such as Daimler obtained for its ADR issue, is at the other
extreme. Under this, the company has to comply with the strict disclosure
requirements of the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, the watchdog for the
US securities industry.
The sponsored ADR programme is a half-way measure: Kaufhof has obtained SEC
approval for the move, but as the shares are not to be listed it will not be
obliged to restate its accounts according to US Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP), as Daimler has done.
The requirement to publish figures according to US rules is regarded with
circumspection by German companies, many of which are angry at Daimler's
unilateral move to the NYSE.
Kaufhof said it expected sales this year to rise 8.3 per cent to DM22.2bn
(Dollars 13bn).

CARNAUDMETALBOX, the Anglo-French packaging group, plans to sell its
high-performance plastics division to Huhtamaki, the Finnish consumer
products group.
The sale, which is subject to the signing of an agreement by the middle of
this month, comprises all CarnaudMetalbox's activities in the division,
which supplies rigid plastic packaging for the food industry. The division
has factories in France, Northern Ireland, Italy and Portugal. It employs
about 750 people and achieved sales last year of FFr650m (Dollars 112m).
CarnaudMetalbox would not disclose the value of the disposal or the profits
of the division.
Anglo-French group said it was selling the division because it represented
only about 7 per cent of the European market for rigid plastic packaging and
conditions required a stronger presence.
Mr Jurgen Hintz, chief executive, said the sale would allow CarnaudMetalbox
to focus on its main strategic activities where it has technological and
marketing leadership.

issue

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE selection of a US airline partner for the Alcazar project to merge the
operations of four European airlines has been given fresh urgency.
Swissair said yesterday that it and the three other airlines in the project
 -KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian Airline System (SAS) and Austrian
Airlines - had decided to resolve the issue of selecting a US partner before
signing a memorandum of understanding in the next few weeks.
In August, the four agreed to shelve the US partner issue in the interest of
reaching early agreement on other important issues by mid-September.
However, that timetable has slipped, creating time for consideration of the
US partner issue.
'We now intend to solve the big questions before the memorandum of
understanding. To leave a question like this to future discussions would not
make sense. It has to be solved anyway,' Swissair said, adding that there
was no longer a definite timetable for conclusion of the talks.
The airlines' dilemma is that three of the four have trade ties with
different US airlines - Swissair with Delta Airlines, KLM with Northwest
Airlines and SAS with Continental Airlines - but Alcazar would need only
one.
Moreover, the issue is sufficiently important that none of the four would
want to go ahead with the Alcazar project without knowing and being
comfortable with the selection.
The KLM-Northwest connection would appear to be the most promising because
the US and the Netherlands have an 'open skies' agreement. Also, KLM has a
20 per cent equity stake in Wings Holdings, Northwest's parent.
However, Swissair feels strongly about being associated with Delta's quality
image. The ties between the two are just beginning to bear fruit. 'It would
be very difficult for us to break the Delta link,' Swissair said.
Potential US partners are reported to have been asked to make presentations
to the Alcazar companies, but Swissair said only that there were active
negotiations.

TELEFONICA, the Spanish telecommunications company, stands to lose about 25
per cent of its domestic market within the next four years under new
liberalisation guidelines, according to a report on the sector presented
yesterday by Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm.
British Telecommunications, which has formed an association with Grupo
Santander, the Spanish banking group, will be bidding for a data
transmission licence later this month, and at least three Spanish consortia,
linked with international operators, are in the running for cellular
telephone licences. These will be awarded by the government in the second
stage of the deregulation process early next year.
Price Waterhouse forecasts that independent companies will gain 15 per cent
of the data transmission business, up to 50 per cent of the cellular
telephone sector and up to 55 per cent of the value added network services
that are currently provided by Telefonica.
The businesses that are being opened to competition represented just 1 per
cent of Telefonica's revenues in 1990 but had grown to nearly 15 per cent of
the company's turnover by last year.
Voice transmission and the basic Spanish network, which accounted for 82 per
cent of Telefonica's revenues in 1992, will not be deregulated until 2003.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Frankfurt stock exchange, the largest of Germany's eight stock
exchanges, is to merge with the Deutsche Terminborse, Germany's screen-based
futures and options exchange, at the beginning of next year, the Deutsche
Borse announced yesterday.
This is the first change in the structure of Germany's security markets
since the creation of the Deutsche Borse, the German stock exchange, at the
beginning of the year. This organisation is a holding company which brings
the Frankfurt exchange, the DTB and the Deutscher Kassenverein settlements
organisation under one administrative roof.
The Deutsche Borse said the aim of the merger of the DTB and the Frankfurt
exchange was to integrate the markets for equities and fixed interest
securities with that for options and futures. It would lead to further
meshing of trading and settlement between the two markets, the Deutsche
Borse said.
These changes are administrative in nature and are unlikely to bring
immediate benefits for investors in German securities. However, they are
part of a campaign on the part of the German securities industry to improve
its competitiveness and are likely to presage significant changes.
'These steps are required in order to achieve a considerable improvement in
the competitiveness (of the German securities markets) against other
European markets,' it said. They would lead in time to faster settlement and
lower costs for investors, the Deutsche Borse said.

The London Business School has responded to Observer's appeal for names of
suitable guests to be invited to tonight's private dinner in Blackpool for
Lady Thatcher.
It has just published the results of a poll of its latest intake of MBA
students, which asked the budding business brains which three people they
would most like to wine and dine.
The exercise - part of the admissions procedure - is not entirely frivolous;
it's designed to reveal something about the character and interests of the
candidates themselves.
Two of the three 'winning guests' - Richard Branson and Mikhail Gorbachev -
might be appropriate dinner companions at tonight's bash. The other one,
Leonardo da Vinci, is unfortunately unavailable.
Also popular were Jesus Christ, Einstein and Margaret Thatcher herself. At
the other end of the scale were Hitler, Rommel and Jeffrey Archer.

The fightback has begun. After more than a decade of men colonising the
fellowships and student intake of Oxford's former women's colleges, a woman
has finally been elected to head one of the university's former male
preserves.
Professor Marilyn Butler, elected yesterday as Rector of Oxford's Exeter
College, is currently King Edward VII professor of English literature at
Cambridge.
Her husband is David Butler, the renowned academic psephologist. While he
became a household name in the 1960s, she was bringing up three children at
the same time as writing the doctoral thesis that launched her academic
career.
Given the inter-college battle for her services, Butler may be the first of
many female heads of House. Both Merton and Keble Colleges approached her
before the summer, but Exeter came up with a definite offer while the other
two were on collective vacation.

<TEXT>
If nothing else, John Major will one day leave behind him a lasting
curiosity; what on earth did he see in that dreary late Victorian novelist
Anthony Trollope?
But Trollope is a terrific cure for insomnia, so the prime minister has
probably packed some of his 50 or so novels to help him get a few good
nights' sleep in Blackpool this week.
It must be hoped, though, that Major's advisers will steer him clear of one
particular edition of The Prime Minister, Trollope's novel dealing with that
by-now probably extinct breed, the Liberal party prime minister.
For in the Oxford edition of 1973 the preface describes Trollope's prime
minister as having 'no clear idea what to do with himself and with his
colleagues'. The hero is delineated thus: 'A virtuous, dutiful, sensitive
type, easily offended as well as easily wounded. Above all, completely
without any ideas about policy . . .'
At least there's no mention of bastards.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Observer: Young advice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tories love gossip as much as anyone. But a topic cropping up rather
more than most at Blackpool is whether John Major may be about to ring the
changes in the ranks of his leading advisers.
One thought is that David Cameron, the home office special adviser who will
be 27 this Saturday, might be in line to replace the somewhat older Gus
O'Donnell, 41, in the press secretary's hot seat.
The helpfully courteous O'Donnell, a successful economist, has long made it
clear he does not see his current job as the pinnacle of his career. He
could well return to the Treasury - also a previous home of Cameron - for
the right job.
Cameron is clearly a survivor; he was one of Norman Lamont's special
advisers, but Lamont's sacking left Cameron unscathed. He also combines
amiability with a cool head and a firm hand - not a bad set of attributes
for tough times ahead.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Observer: Branching out at Delta
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What would Sir Martin Jacomb, chairman of the British Council and Postel
Investment Management, deputy chairman of Barclays Bank and the Commercial
Union, non-executive director at Marks &amp; Spencer et al, want with a non
Footsie company involved in power cables, circuit protection and extrusions?
Sir Martin, who turns 64 next month, was yesterday named chairman designate
of electrical engineer Delta, 'a very fine little company' which interests
him given the 'vital importance of the manufacturing sector at this
juncture'.
A distinguished City grandee, Jacomb was obviously wooed by Delta for
something other than his skills in electrical engineering. As chairman of
BZW, he knew the company well, though it was not until after he stood down
from the BZW post, in 1991, that Delta changed its merchant banking advisers
from Kleinwort Benson to BZW.
He certainly fits into a line of rather pukka Delta chairmen - and luckily
has the right school-tie. Lord Caldecote, Delta chairman for a decade from
1972, is an old Etonian, as is outgoing chairman Geoffrey Wilson, who is the
son of Lord Moran, Churchill's doctor. Jacomb was in the same year at Eton
as Wilson, although the two only got to know each other much later.
If Jacomb seems to have his plate full already - he is also on the board of
the Daily Telegraph and RTZ - it could well be that the Delta job presages a
shift away from other commitments.
Now that the top job at Barclays has been split, and Martin Taylor brought
in as chief executive, it may be that Jacomb will not tarry long on the
clearing bank board.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Crime and punishment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LAW AND order is one of the themes the Conservative party has chosen to
highlight at this year's annual conference in Blackpool. Traditionally, the
electorate has seen the Conservatives as the party which is toughest on
crime and criminals. But Mr Tony Blair, Labour's home affairs spokesman, has
been skilfully exploiting the government's failure to halt the rise in
crime. The prime minister is keen to win back the initiative.
Much, therefore, is expected of Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, who
will reply to the conference debate on law and order later today. The record
he must defend is not impressive. Since 1979 the number of crimes reported
has doubled while the clear-up rate, the proportion of crimes solved, has
fallen from 41 per cent to 26 per cent. Confidence in the criminal justice
system is low, according to the opinion polls. Yet the UK continues to send
a higher proportion of the populace to prison than almost any other country
in the Council of Europe.
The mood among constituency representatives is likely to be in favour of
stronger measures to fight crime. Mr Howard may be tempted - like some of
his predecessors - to announce high-profile initiatives that appear to
address current concerns. Juvenile offenders who are out of parental control
can expect harsh words. So can persistent offenders who are undeterred by
repeated police cautions when they are caught.
Overburdened courts
But the home secretary would be wise to recall the fate of earlier nostrums
such as the Dangerous Dogs Act and the Aggravated Vehicle Taking Act. The
former has added greatly to the burden of the courts, while the latter has
done little to stop joy-riding or the death and injury associated with it.
The failure of such well-publicised measures further erodes public
confidence in the ability of the system to curb crime. It would be much
better for Mr Howard to address his bulging in-tray which is full of
well-considered plans for reforming the system.
At the top of the pile is the report from Sir Patrick Sheehy on police pay
and conditions. This contains a plethora of suggestions for rooting out
restrictive practices in the police service and improving its performance.
The report has produced a ferocious campaign of resistance among the police
staff associations, sundering the close relationship the Conservative
government has enjoyed with the police since 1979. Ensuring that its main
thrust is achieved without forfeiting police goodwill will require all Mr
Howard's skill and finesse.
Prison service
Also needing care and attention is the government's programme for
modernising the prison service. The creation of a competitive private sector
in prison management offers the prospect of improvements in the prison
regime and lower costs for the exchequer. But a sudden surge in prison
numbers could lead to overcrowding which would undermine both objectives.
The cost of a conference promise to send more convicted criminals to prison
and to make their life harsher could be expensive indeed.
Finally, Mr Howard must make his mind up on the recommendations of the Royal
Commission on Criminal Justice, where he faces apparently contradictory
pressures. On the one hand, he needs to re-establish confidence in a system
damaged by a series of miscarriages of justice. That suggests steps that
might make it harder for convictions to be obtained. On the other hand, he
must deal with concern over the failure of the system to punish those who
are palpably guilty. That suggests making convictions easier to obtain.
In practice, the chances of conviction are best improved by making
miscarriages less likely to happen. Juries that have no confidence in the
fairness of the criminal justice system will be reluctant to convict. The
flow of information upon which crime solving depends also relies on
improving the relationship between the police and the public.
Low-key measures to achieve these aims may not win conference acclaim, but
they offer the best chance of making an impact on crime levels by the next
election. Restoring the effectiveness of the criminal justice system
requires a long-term strategy rather than quick fixes.

FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Allied Irish gets Dollars 55m
compensation from E&amp;Y
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN

<TEXT>
ALLIED IRISH Banks, the Republic's largest clearing bank, has accepted a
Dollars 55m (Pounds 36m) out of court settlement of a claim for damages
against Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm.
The firm were auditors to the Insurance Corporation of Ireland which AIB had
bought for IPounds 45m (Pounds 43m) in 1983. However, two years later it was
put into receivership with outstanding liabilities of more than IPounds
300m.
A total of Dollars 110m is to be paid to AIB and Icarom, formerly Insurance
Corporation, divided equally between the two.
AIB's disastrous foray into the insurance business became apparent when it
was discovered that there had been significant underprovisioning in
Insurance Corporation, involving a wide range of insurance cover throughout
the world, including horse-breeding and space rockets.
The level of provisions for reinsurance business written through London was
apparently especially poor. In many cases business was placed with
reinsurers without a strong track record.
AIB attempted to shore up the company with a further injection of IPounds
40m, but in 1985 disposed of the company to the government for a nominal sum
of IPounds 5.
The government called in a receiver, and AIB agreed to contribute IPounds
5.5m for 15 years to meet Insurance Corporation's outstanding liabilities.
By the end of 1991, the liabilities still remained in excess of IPounds
270m. In a final settlement last year with the government, AIB agreed to
contribute a further IPounds 8.8m per year for the next 20 years. The final
cost to AIB of its involvement with Insurance Corporation will be close to
IPounds 250m.
Mr Gerry Scanlan, AIB's group chief executive said yesterday: 'I am pleased
the issue has been brought to a conclusion and all of us in AIB can focus
fully on the task of growing and developing the group at home and abroad.'
The damages claim was made against E&amp;Y's Irish partners and is to be paid by
the firm's insurers. It is thought to be the largest settlement to be made
in a damages case against an accountancy firm outside the US.
The payment has been made without any admission of liability.

FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Office products fall hits J
Crean
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A REDUCED contribution from its office products division meant pre-tax
profits of James Crean, the Dublin-based industrial holding company, slipped
from IPounds 7.78m to IPounds 7.68m (Pounds 7.34m) in the first half of
1993.
Sales grew 8.5 per cent to IPounds 120.9m, while earnings per share edged up
to 12.8p (12.5p) because of the buy-out in January of the minority in Valley
Fresh Foods and a slightly lower tax charge.
An interim dividend of 5.635p (7.865p) is declared but a final of not less
than 6.865p is forecast for a maintained total of 12.5p. The directors have
reiterated their policy of a progressive dividend policy.
Crean blamed a Pounds 1.1m fall to Pounds 600,000 in profits from office
products on adverse market circumstances. Elsewhere, food and beverages
turned in Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 4.8m), Inishtech made Pounds 4m (Pounds 3.7m)
and electrical wholesaling Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 700,000).
Directors said the trading pattern had not changed materially since the end
of June and with the exception of office products, all operating divisions
continued to perform satisfactorily.
Market conditions are expected to remain difficult for the office products
businesses for some time.
The US contributed the bulk of profits with Pounds 5m (Pounds 4.4m), helped
by a more favourable dollar/punt rate. Irish profits were unchanged at
Pounds 1.1m, while the European performance was lower at Pounds 4.7m (Pounds
5.4m).
Group borrowings at June 30 were IPounds 86m, against IPounds 72m at the
same time last year and IPounds 70m at the year end. This represented
gearing of 93 per cent, compared with 77 per cent at the year end.
Profits of TRD Group were included up to the date of disposal in June.

FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Barry Wehmiller rises 8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARRY Wehmiller International, the packaging equipment manufacturer, lifted
pre-tax profits by 8 per cent, from Pounds 6.55m to Pounds 7.1m, for the
year ended July 31.
Turnover of the group, which makes about half its sales in dollars, rose by
more than 15 per cent from Pounds 73.7m to Pounds 85.2m. About Pounds 4m of
the increase was a result of the strength of the dollar against sterling.
Mr Stewart Brown, chief executive, said yesterday that the group had
benefited from its industrial and geographic spread at a time of difficult
markets.
It had found new business in the Far East and Latin America to offset lower
sales in its traditional European and US markets. However, margins in the
new markets were lower, while margins in Europe and the US continued to be
under pressure.
Turnover in the pharmaceutical and general packaging division rose from
Pounds 38.6m to Pounds 46.1m, generating operating profits of Pounds 3.5m
(Pounds 2.26m). The group said that sales to the pharmaceutical and personal
care markets now accounted for 33 per cent of the group total.
The vision division, which scans bottles and packages, also lifted operating
profits, from Pounds 670,000 to Pounds 1.26m on turnover of Pounds 20.9m
(Pounds 18.2m). Both volumes and margins had strengthened, Mr Brown said.
Operating profits at the food equipment division fell from Pounds 3.49m to
Pounds 2.1m on turnover of Pounds 18.2m (Pounds 17m). Mr Brown said the fall
reflected an unprecedented low investment level from the UK dairy industry,
which is undergoing a structural change with the demise of the Milk
Marketing Board.
Mr Brown expected demand for capital equipment to remain slow and
unpredictable in the US and Europe. Nevertheless, he felt that the last two
years of consolidation were now behind the group, which has started to look
for acquisitions.
Total operating profits were up from Pounds 6.42m to Pounds 6.8m. Net
interest receivable was Pounds 279,000 (Pounds 133,000).
Net cash in hand at the year end was Pounds 2.6m, down from Pounds 4.9m last
year, mainly because of exchange factors.
Earnings per share rose to 11p (10.7p). An unchanged final dividend of 4.3p
is proposed, giving a maintained total for the year of 6.7p.

FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: Ulster TV results overtake
'unsustainable' business plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALAN WRIGHT, the independent television producer who failed to win the
Northern Ireland commercial television franchise with his TVNI consortium,
is one of the most frustrated would-be broadcasters in the UK.
The Independent Television Commission threw out TVNI's business plan, based
on a Pounds 3.1m-a-year bid, as unsustainable. However, Ulster Television,
the incumbent which survived with a bid of Pounds 1.03m, is already
performing better in the battle for advertising revenue than TVNI's
projections.
'We were projecting advertising revenues of Pounds 25.25m for 1993 and a
share of net advertising revenue of 1.65 per cent,' Mr Wright said
yesterday.
Last month Ulster Television announced a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.97m on
revenues of Pounds 13.2m for the first six months. Last year Ulster had
higher revenues in the second half and this year there are signs of rising
ITV revenues this autumn.
The advertising industry believes that Ulster's share of the ITV total has
risen to 1.78 per cent, boosted by a growing tendency for large companies to
buy their advertising on an all-Ireland basis.
Mr Wright, who was director of programmes in the TVNI consortium, says his
company would have been profitable at the advertising levels now being
earned by Ulster despite the higher bid.
'My reaction is is one of enormous frustration, particularly because we did
not have the opportunity to test the ITC's judgment in court.'
TVNI and TVS applied for a judicial review of the ITC's decisions but were
turned down by the High Court because of delay. The application came eight
weeks after the ITC decision following Television South West's granting of a
review, which ultimately failed.
The ITC declined to comment, although the authority would clearly argue that
it made its best judgment on the facts available at the time.

FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Europa Minerals returns to black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A strong gold price, increased production and reduced costs helped Europa
Minerals, the mining group, return to profit in the six months to July 31.
Pre-tax profits for the first half were Pounds 652,000 against a loss of
Pounds 313,000 last time; after tax and minorities there was an attributable
profit of Pounds 86,000, against a loss of Pounds 575,000. Turnover was up
8.6 per cent at Pounds 9.7m.
Earnings per share were 0.3p (losses of 4.3p).
Details of the proposed three-way merger between Europa, Burmine and Austmin
are being finalised and should be posted to shareholders at the end of the
month.
Meanwhile, Mount Edon Gold Mines has announced a conditional cash offer for
Burmine. This will be considered when a formal offer is made, but at this
stage Europa - which has a 38.5 per cent stake in Burmine - intends to
proceed with the planned merger.

FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: A&amp;C Black slips to Pounds 244,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A DROP in its publication programme led to reduced turnover at A&amp;C Black,
but some improvement in margins together with a further fall in net interest
payable, meant first-half 1993 pre-tax profits were only Pounds 10,000 lower
at Pounds 244,000.
Turnover of the group, which publishes yearbooks, children's and general
books, fell 10 per cent to Pounds 3.38m. Mr Charles Black, chairman, said
the publication programme for the second half was comparable with last year
and directors were hopeful of a reasonable outcome for 1993 as a whole.
Net interest charges were Pounds 10,000 (Pounds 35,000). Earnings per share
slipped from 11p to 10.6p, while an unchanged interim dividend of 4.25p is
declared.

FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Netherlands acquisition strengthens IWP's
core
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IWP, the Dublin-based industrial holding group, has announced the
acquisition of Levendaal Beheer, a Dutch toiletries and household products
manufacturer from PLA, a Netherlands Antilles company, in a cash and shares
offer worth IPounds 51.2m (Pounds 48.8m).
The deal is expected to boost turnover to about IPounds 150m and pre-tax
profits by more than 50 per cent to about IPounds 20m in a full year.
Mr Joe Moran, the executive chairman, said the acquisition 'is a very
important one in terms of strengthening our customer base, product
portfolio, increasing market share, and developing the group's strategy'.
IWP has refocused its activities into two core areas: chemically-based
household products and printed cartons and self-adhesive labels. Its main
markets are the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands.
The acquisition will make the Netherlands an increasingly important profit
centre for the group, which has three of its 18 companies there.
The consideration will be satisfied by IPounds 31.8m in cash and IPounds
4.57m from the sale of a loan note. The vendor will also receive a dividend
from Levendaal of IPounds 1.52mand IPounds 13.2m for its holding of
preference shares in Levendaal, which are being sold to a syndicate of Dutch
institutions. Mr Moran said that IWP intended to buy these shares at a rate
of 25 per cent per year.
There is also to be a placing of 1.35m ordinary shares in IWP at 315p
raising IPounds 4.24m, to help finance the deal.
In 1992 Levendaal reported turnover of Fl 111m (Pounds 40m) for pre-tax
profits of Fl 15.3m. IWP said that the results for the first seven months of
1993, showing pre-tax profits of Fl 8.7m 'are ahead of the budget set by the
management of Levendaal'.
On completion of the acquisition, which has to be approved by an
extraordinary meeting of IWP to be held on October 28, Mr Moran will join
the board of Levendaal.

FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: James Halstead rises to Pounds 8.7m -
Diversity of operations helps overcome difficult conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAMES HALSTEAD, the Manchester-based floor-coverings, weatherproof clothing
and trailers group, more than doubled pre-tax profits in the year to June
30, though the rise was flattered by the adoption of FRS 3 accounting
standards.
Profits grew to Pounds 8.7m, against a restated Pounds 3.84m, affected by
bringing the Pounds 4.2m costs of closing the Belstaff operations above the
line. The group said that the operating profits before interest, which rose
by 7.5 per cent to Pounds 8.48m (Pounds 7.89m), gave a truer measure of the
trading performance.
Turnover looked flat at Pounds 59.4m (Pounds 58.9m), but the latter included
some Pounds 5m from Belstaff. Group margins were broadly maintained, said Mr
Stephen Knight, finance director.
He ascribed the group's ability to overcome difficult trading conditions
partly to the breadth of its operations.
James Halstead Ltd, the core floor-coverings division which accounts for two
thirds of turnover, was 'marking time for the first time for some time,' he
said.
With brand leadership and dominant market share in commercial sheet vinyl
flooring, he added, it was difficult in the current climate to raise sales
without cutting prices.
Profits at Conway Products, the trailer tents, trailers and security cabins
business which received an offer to buy during the year, fell in all its
areas, though none will be abandoned.
Driza-Bone, the Australian stockman's coat company, did well in spite of a
second consecutive rain-free winter there. However, exports now account for
30 per cent of sales.
Cash balances grew to Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 3.1m) over the year and
complementary infill acquisitions were being considered, said Mr Knight.
Interest receivable fell to Pounds 45,000 (Pounds 156,000).
Earnings advanced to 20.23p (8.94p) and a 4p final dividend makes 6.5p for
the year - an increase of 8 per cent.
COMMENT
There does not seem to be too much wrong with the management, the products
or the group - it has a market beating brand name in its core business and
has the sense to invest heavily in that when there is no growth in the
market. The benefit should accrue when the construction and refurbishment
sectors are beginning to come back. Conway is sufficiently highly thought of
for an offer to be made. And the smaller parts of the group have sparkled.
Yet, a question nags: is the group doing enough to exploit its brands? With
almost Pounds 9m pencilled in for the current year, the p/e will be 17,
quite high but supported by the dividend yield.

FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Change of strategy at Murray Enterprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MURRAY Enterprise, the investment trust, is switching its investment
strategy from European unlisted securities to UK listed smaller companies.
It was also announced that Murray Johnstone had liquidated the holdings in
Murray Enterprise of its other managed trusts, Murray International, Murray
Smaller Markets and Murray Ventures.
The shares rose 25p to 233p, reducing the discount on its net asset value
which was put at 246.7p on October 4. An analyst said that as a result of
the liquidation of the stake the shares were not trading at such a large
discount and this was pushing the shares higher.
Murray Enterprise forecast that it would pay a dividend for the year to
September 30 1994 of not less 4p, against 1.31p last time. In addition it is
planning a bonus issue of warrants for early next year.
Proposals should be ready to be put to the annual meeting.
The trusts sold their total holdings of 25.82 per cent of the ordinary
shares and 44.8 per cent of the zero-coupon convertible unsecured loan stock
1994 at 222p. They were placed with institutional investors.
Murray Enterprise's existing portfolio will be liquidated when investments
conditions permit, the proceeds being invested in accordance with the new
policy.
Enterprise's main investments are in Fleet Call and Envoy Corporation as
well as holdings in Bowater and BAA.

FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Albert Fisher builds up US fresh produce
side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALBERT FISHER, the food processing and distribution group, has agreed to pay
up to Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.6m) for Imperial Produce, a Washington-based
distributor of fresh produce and prepared salads and vegetables.
Imperial, which has annual sales of more than Dollars 15m to food service
businesses in the US capital, is the latest US acquisition by the UK group,
which already has strong market positions in Florida and California.
In July Fisher paid Dollars 4m for a Texas distributor. Mr Stephen Walls,
executive chairman, said this acquisition 'completed the jigsaw' in the
south-east of the US.
Imperial was already well down the road of Fisher's chosen route, which was
to focus increasingly on providing more profitable products - such as
pre-cut salads - to customers in the catering business.
This is the latest in a series of deals by Mr Walls, who took over as
chairman last year from Mr Tony Millar, who built Fisher rapidly by
acquisition during the 1980s.
In January, Fisher paid Pounds 29m for Hunter Saphir, the fresh produce,
herbs and spice company, and assumed Pounds 9.8m of debt. In May it sold
Hunter Saphir's herbs and spices business for Pounds 25m to Burns Philip,
the Australian group.
The group also hopes to raise an estimated Pounds 20m-Pounds 25m by this
month by spinning off Charles Sidney, its Yorkshire-based Mercedes-Benz
commercial and passenger car dealer, through a full stock market flotation.

FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Fine Decor marginally ahead of forecast
with Pounds 1.33m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINE DECOR Group, the wallpaper designer, manufacturer and distributor,
yesterday announced interim results marginally ahead of its own forecasts
made when it came to the market in June.
Actual trading figures revealed pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.33m (Pounds
871,000) for the six months ended July 31 while at the operating level there
was a surplus of Pounds 1.66m (Pounds 1.32m), ahead of its prospectus
forecast of Pounds 1.62m.
The board declared a 1p interim dividend, again meeting its flotation
forecast, out of earnings per share of 8.1p (5.8p).
The board is maintaining its prospectus promise to recommend a total for the
current year of not less than 7.5p on an annualised basis and an actual
value of 4.7p.
Mr Roger Regan, chairman, said that 'the board are satisfied by the
continuing trend of sales during the second half in the light of prevailing
economic conditions'.
Mr Regan, who is also chairman of Spring Ram, said trading conditions in the
first half had been 'difficult' in the UK and elsewhere for the company,
which exports to 30 countries.
Total sales rose to Pounds 19.2m (Pounds 17m). Exports rose 14 per cent to
Pounds 7.48m (Pounds 6.56m) with 'significant progress' achieved in North
America.
Interest charges dropped to Pounds 333,000 (Pounds 447,000).
At the half way stage the company had net borrowings of some Pounds 4m for
gearing of 49 per cent. This compared with net borrowings of Pounds 8.24m
and gearing of 437 per cent, reflecting the company's origins as a
management buy-out.
Net cash inflows from operating activities dropped drastically to just
Pounds 47,000 (Pounds 1.26m). The company said the change reflected stronger
than expected sales in July which pushed up the level of debtors, a seasonal
build up of stocks and the launch of some new products ahead of schedule.

FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Walker Greenbank at Pounds 3.4m as demand
picks up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERIM pre-tax profits at Walker Greenbank rose from Pounds 1.89m to Pounds
3.35m as demand for domestic wall coverings began to pick up early this
summer followed by an increase in commercial orders.
The comparison was flattered, however, by the restatement of the year
earlier figure to reflect new accounting standards. One-off items netting
out to a charge of Pounds 393,000 were increased to Pounds 1.19m, mainly
because of the treatment of property disposals.
Operating profits from continuing activities in the six months to July 31
rose to Pounds 3.54m (Pounds 3.38m) on flat sales of Pounds 29.9m (Pounds
29.5m).
'We definitely see a gradual underlying improvement in the UK. We see
economic recovery coming through on to the bottom line,' said Mr Charles
Wightman, the chief executive.
He added: 'The turn on the consumer side came last summer, but I think it
has been particularly marked in the last four or five months. The recovery
is stronger on the consumer side, but it is present in the commercial side
too and it is sustained.'
He believed the improved trading picture partly reflected the company's
increasing market share. Walker Greenbank has about 10 per cent of the total
UK market in wall coverings, but 60 per cent of the UK market for commercial
wall coverings.
He said overseas sales were growing by about 30 per cent but from a low
base.
The company's acquisition in April of John Hartley, the Yorkshire-based
furniture upholstery fabrics company, contributed Pounds 752,000 to sales
but turned in an operating loss of Pounds 12,000.
'Hartley's has now traded profitably for the last three months,' Mr Wightman
said.
He said the company had anticipated that the Pounds 1.6m acquisition, which
was funded by a Pounds 2.7m share placing, would not affect earnings per
share, but now thought it might enhance earnings this year.
The placing had helped strengthened the balance sheet and interest charges
dropped to Pounds 181,000 (Pounds 301,000).
The company had borrowings of Pounds 2m (Pounds 6m) at the halfway stage
giving gearing of 6.6 per cent (23.8 per cent). It expects to be virtually
ungeared by the year end.
The interim dividend is held at 1.2p with the board aiming to reach dividend
cover of 2 times. Earnings per share rose to 2.44p against a restated 1.08p.

FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Sustained rise in cabinet sales assists
Silentnight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SILENTNIGHT Holdings, Europe's biggest manufacturer of beds, said a full
contribution from its recent German acquisition and remedial action in the
US helped the group increase interim pre-tax profits 27 per cent to Pounds
5.2m.
Turnover rose 13 per cent to Pounds 79.6m in the six months to July 31.
In the UK, sales were ahead by 6 per cent and margins were broadly
maintained in what the group said was still a 'very tough market'.
Mr Bill Davies, chairman, said: 'Improvement on last year's excellent
second-half performance will depend largely upon a recovery in the UK
furniture market which is not yet evident.'
Silentnight's shares, which have outperformed the market by 50 per cent this
year, closed 1p lower at 377p.
Matthias Houben, the German manufacturer of beds and mattresses which
Silentnight bought last year for Pounds 3.2m, made operating profits of
Pounds 737,000in the six-month period, compared with a two-month
contribution last time.
Mr Davies said sales in Germany had flattened in recent months, but margins
and return on investment remained good.
Sales in the US were not markedly changed from last year, but new management
had improved margins and reduced costs, taking the business out of losses.
Mr Davies said profits in the US could grow quickly, if and when recovery
took off.
In the UK, bed sales were slightly ahead in a flat market, but cabinet sales
rose 20 per cent, maintaining a three-year record of consistent growth.
Cabinets now account for nearly 30 per of total UK sales.
Silentnight increased capital expenditure from Pounds 4m to Pounds 4.2m and
had net cash of Pounds 5.6m. Devaluation of sterling was blamed for the
shift to interest payable of Pounds 66,000 from the previous period's
interest receivable of Pounds 180,000. This is because the group's debts are
in Germany and the US, matching assets there, but cash is held in the UK,
where interest rates have fallen.
Earnings per share rose 24 per cent to 7.41p (5.98p). The interim dividend
is lifted 22 per cent to 2.75p (2.25p).
Mr Barry McKenzie, finance director, said the interim dividend had been
pegged for the last five years, and was being increased to reduce the gap
between the interim and final payments.
Silentnight said that it continued to maintain its dominant position in the
UK beds market, of which it controls more than 30 per cent, even though
sales had increased only marginally in the six months to July 31.
Mr Davies said the main opportunity for growth was in the rapidly-expanding
cabinets business. where the group only had about a 6 per cent share of the
UK market.
Silentnight has invested heavily in cabinet technology using sophisticated
printed foils, which have a similar appearance to cheaper wood veneer
finishes.
COMMENT
These were an impressive set of results, with the core UK beds business
continuing to generate cash and healthy margins in spite of a flat market.
The German acquisition has also performed better than expected, even if the
onset of recession suggests it may now mark time for a while.
The group will also be pleased to have stopped losses at its US operation
which - though never quantified - were described to analysts as 'big enough
to be unpleasant'.
However, Silentnight shares have outperformed the market by 50 per cent this
year and are now trading on a prospective multiple of 20, a significant
premium.
The group's success in Germany, the US and with cabinets bodes well for the
future, but the chairman's downbeat note on the second half would suggest
the shares are up with events.

FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Doeflex dips to Pounds 725,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Doeflex, the Surrey-based PVC and thermoplastic sheet manufacturer, reported
profits before tax of Pounds 725,000 for the half year to June 30, a decline
of 17 per cent on the comparable outcome of Pounds 876,000.
Turnover improved to Pounds 15.9m (Pounds 12.9m). Mr Richard Bickerton,
chairman, said trading conditions remained competitive in the UK and
deepening recession in Europe affected volume and margins for the group and
its competitors.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.6p, payable from earnings of 5.22p
(7p) per share.

FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Mercury Asset has 9.65% of Zeneca
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERCURY Asset Management, the investment management company controlled by SG
Warburg, has built up a 9.65 per cent stake in Zeneca, the pharmaceuticals
company spun off from Imperial Chemical Industries last June.
Warburg advised Zeneca on its demerger from ICI and its Pounds 1.3bn rights
issue in June.
Yesterday, Warburg disclosed that it and MAM together owned 10 per cent of
Zeneca's shares, triggering a notification requirement to the Stock Exchange
under new Companies Act rules which took effect on September 18. Up until
then, institutions had to notify the Exchange when they held voting rights
of 3 per cent or more of a company's shares.
MAM said that since the flotation it had been building the stake on behalf
of clients. But because its policy was not to seek voting rights from the
clients whose money it handles, there had been no need to notify the
Exchange.
Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that the amendment to the Companies Act had
several drafting errors in that exemptions from notification requirements
should have been included for authorised members of investment exchanges,
such as Warburg. Had the rule been properly drafted, Warburg would not have
needed to make its announcement yesterday.
The Department of Trade and Industry said that amendments to correct the
omissions were expected to be submitted to parliament shortly.
Warburg said that of the 94.5m shares, only 3.3m, or 0.35 per cent of
Zeneca's issued equity, was held by non-MAM parts of the group.
At yesterday's closing share price of 737p, a rise of 8p, Warburg's holding
is worth Pounds 697m.

FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Whyte &amp; Mackay talks continue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whyte &amp; Mackay, the UK drinks subsidiary of American Brands, is continuing
talks with Fleming Investment Management about the possible acquisition of
Fleming's 13.6 per cent stake in Invergordon Distillers.
A joint statement last night confirmed that 'discussions are taking place
which may or may not lead to the sale by clients of Fleming Investment
Management, including Fleming Mercantile Trust, of the whole of their
holdings . . . to Whyte &amp; Mackay.'
The statement said that acquisition of the shares by W&amp;M, which already
holds 41 per cent of Invergordon, would result in a mandatory offer for the
remainder of Invergordon's share capital.

FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Johnston cuts loss to Pounds 393,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDUCED pre-tax losses of Pounds 393,000 were announced by Johnston Group,
the construction and engineering concern, for the half year to June 30.
Losses of Pounds 765,000 were reported last time.
Turnover increased to Pounds 64.2m (Pounds 58.4m) including Pounds 3.5m from
the sale of a development property at Esher, Surrey.
Mr Graham Johnston, chairman, said the UK construction side suffered from
reduced volumes and severe price competition, resulting in 'significant
losses'.
In the engineering division, the road sweeper manufacturing companies
suffered a small deficit, largely because of losses in the Californian
business acquired in April 1992.
Mr Johnston said that changes were in hand which would improve the US
performance. Cost savings, however, had enabled Johnson Engineering in the
UK to improve results and the construction materials division had shown 'a
considerable increase in profits.'
The result benefited from a fall in interest charges to Pounds 693,000
(Pounds 779,000).
Losses per share were reduced to 4.62p (7.52p). The interim dividend is cut
to 1p (2.25p).

FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Risky changes for a secure future - The new
strategy being pursued by Amstrad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALAN Sugar, Amstrad's colourful chairman and chief executive, was in the
City yesterday to give analysts the chance to quiz him on the company's
1992-93 trading figures.
An unusual move; he traditionally demands they trek out to his stronghold in
Brentwood, Essex.
But anybody hoping that the irrepressibly combative entrepreneur had been
chastened by last year's trading loss and the rejection by shareholders of
his 30p a share plan to buy back the company would be disappointed.
He was in London to donate a new operating theatre to Great Ormond Street
Sick Children's Hospital. 'Otherwise it would be Brentwood as usual', he
grunted.
Nothing, however, is going to be 'as usual' at Brentwood for the foreseeable
future. Amstrad is set on a series of changes designed to secure its future
but which are, also, in Mr Sugar's opinion, the riskiest of the options open
to it.
They include the appointment of a chief executive to oversee a series of
acquisitions to take Amstrad into new growth areas, attempts to forge
alliances with services companies to secure more dependable revenue streams
and a gradual move away from reliance on personal computers which have been
Amstrad's biggest money spinner in recent years.
The new strategy arises out of Mr Sugar's argument that Amstrad's core
businesses - personal computers, facsimile machines, video recorders and
satellite dishes - can produce Pounds 15m-Pounds 20m a year in pre-tax
profits, but not a lot more.
Yesterday's results, showing a Pounds 16.3m operating profit including
interest, are his evidence: 'It is a mature business that we are in. It is
highly competitive. The day of the blockbuster product seems to be over -
although if one comes along, we are not going to turn it away.'
'We have to glue on to the core business other businesses that have a
synergy with electronics, electrical goods and so on.'
Hence the need for a chief executive. Mr Sugar has no liking for the notion
of running a group of 30 or so separate autonomous companies: 'It would be
very boring. It would be very much accounting, very much reporting. What we
need is a chief executive whose qualities lie in these areas'.
'We have to have a management capable of looking after all these companies.
We've seen the fallen idols of the 1980s; all those people who bought
companies one after the other. The only people who seemed to make any money
out of it were the lawyers and the merchant bankers.'
He points to DanCall Radio, the digital telecommunications company which
Amstrad bought last month as an opportunistic deal. Tipped off that the
company was for sale by a mutual supplier, Sugar bought the lossmaking
Danish concern for Pounds 6.4m. It gave Amstrad cheap entry to a complex and
potentially lucrative technology.
'When we bought the company we bought a lot of inventory and we will churn
and turn that into cash and that cash will be used to run the company. The
fruits of what is about to start now will be seen in a year to 18 months
time when the new digital telephones start to roll off the line.'
Mr Robert Watkins, who was identified with many of Amstrad's earlier
blockbusters but left to work for Binatone last year, has been lured back as
managing director of DanCall.
The main shift, however, is in Mr Sugar's thinking on product strategy. He
is clearly irked that markets which Amstrad pioneered - compact audio
systems, inexpensive personal computers and satellites - have been hijacked
by competitors prepared to lower margins.
He has no doubt that Amstrad can build, for example, a competitive cellular
telephone: 'It will not be long before the rest of the world catches up. So
we have to find ways to make sure that when we create things, we can hold on
to it a little longer.'
His idea is to strike a deal with cellular service providers. In exchange
for a lower-cost handset than they are able to supply at present he will
claim some form of commission on the use of the service. Customers in the
UK, for example, buy a digital handset for Pounds 350-Pounds 400. The cost
is subsidised by more than Pounds 100 by a service provider like Mercury
One2One. While nothing has yet been decided, according to Mr Sugar, it will
only make commercial sense for a service provider to pay a small commission
to reduce or eliminate the subsidy.
Cellular experts agree that Mr Sugar's strategy makes sense. While they
question whether he has not left it too late they agree that the DanCall
acquisition must have saved several years of basic research.
Would he be following the same strategy today if his attempt to take the
company private last year had been successful? 'No. The contraction I had in
mind was the safest approach for Amstrad. One that could not go wrong. That
is not good enough for shareholders. There is no guarantee of success in the
route we are following now but it is the only way to try to find a stream of
profits.'

FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Raine cuts dividend despite rise to Pounds
10.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAINE, the housebuilder and contractor, made a greater than expected cut in
its final dividend yesterday after reporting a modest 8 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits.
The group is paying a 1p final, down from 4p, halving the total for the year
to the end of June to 3p.
Earnings per share increased from 3.73p to 4.34p, but this included an
exceptional gain of Pounds 3.42m, mainly from foreign exchange gains and a
Pounds 2.1m provision for closure of its Plumb joinery operation.
Raine's shares fell only 6p to 84p on the unexpectedly large dividend cut.
But the shares are now 12 per cent below the 95p rights issue price in March
1992 when Raine paid Pounds 33.5m in shares for Walter Lawrence.
The profits increase from Pounds 10m to Pounds 10.8m came on sales up 23 per
cent at Pounds 446m.
The group also made a further Pounds 3.5m provision - directly against
reserves - to cover a reduction in value of land bought in Kent and
Hampshire as part of the Walter Lawrence acquisition.
Strong cash generation, partly from sale of stock acquired with Walter
Lawrence, helped reduce gearing from 35 per cent to 22.3 per cent on net
debt of Pounds 26.2m.
Mr Peter Parkin, chairman, said housebuilding was becoming an increasingly
important part of group profits. The group increased the number of homes
built from 2,442 in 1992 to 3,337 and had enjoyed an increase in visitor and
reservation levels in the spring.
Mr Parkin said economic conditions for West Venture, the southern
Californian housebuilding business, were similar to those in the UK but
without the benefit of the increased spring activity.
With no sign of economic recovery in southern California, 'profit margins
may come under increasing pressure,' he said.
Mr Parkin said West Venture, which is tying up Dollars 57m (Pounds 38m) of
gross assets, was up for sale but that there was no pressure for a quick
sale.
COMMENT
Raine's greater than expected dividend cut is hardly surprising. Underlying
earnings stripped of such funnies as the unrepeatable foreign exchange gains
just cover the new total of 3p, giving the group a sound base from which to
resume dividend growth in a couple of years. But there was much in
yesterday's results to explain why Raine trades at a discount to its peers.
There is, so far, little sign of additional profits from the Walter Lawrence
acquisition 18 months ago - and the group made further provisions against
the value of the business, bypassing the p&amp;l account to boot. There was also
the foreign exchange gain that had little to do with cash or profit. Nor is
Raine as pure a UK housing play as Barratt or Wimpey, weighed down as it is
by its contracting side, and its distant Californian business. Add to that
the fact that like other housebuilders, Raine is hostage to a good budget in
November - in its terms, few VAT increases and further cuts in interest
rates - and Raine at a prospective multiple of about 20 on pre-tax profits
this year of Pounds 13m, deserves to be approached with some caution.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Shell and BP link for oil and gas venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and ROBERT CORZINE

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHELL OIL and BP said yesterday they would spend Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 790m)
to develop the largest oil and gas discovery in the Gulf of Mexico for the
past 20 years.
The field, known as Mars, was discovered by the two partners in 1989. It
will mark the site of the deepest platform in the Gulf at 2,933ft when
production starts towards the end of 1996.
Shell Oil, the US subsidiary of the Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch/Shell group,
will have a 71.5 per cent interest in the development and bear a similar
proportion of the costs, with BP Exploration of the US representing the
remaining 28.5 per cent.
For Shell Oil the development, 130 miles off the Louisiana coast from New
Orleans, will mark a significant addition to production.
The first phase of development is expected to yield 500m barrels of oil
equivalent, with a further 200m barrels potentially available in later
stages of development. The company's total proven reserves at the end of
1992 amounted to just under 2bn barrels.
At its peak around the year 2000, Mars is expected to produce 100,000 b/d,
not far short of the total 136,000 b/d that Shell currently produces in the
Gulf of Mexico. The development is also expected to produce 110m cu ft of
natural gas a day.
Deep-water sites in the Gulf of Mexico have become a focus for US
exploration and development as companies apply new seismic and production
technology to the area. Mr John Browne, BP's London-based exploration chief,
said the tension-leg platform technology used in the Mars project will, for
example, 'have valuable applications both elsewhere in the Gulf of Mexico
and in other parts of the world'.
Although many US-based companies are investing heavily in long-term
exploration elsewhere, the application of new technology has made the Gulf
of Mexico a more immediate and accessible source of new production from
proven reserves.
BP has sold its interests in the El Qari'a gas field in the Nile Delta
concession about 100 miles north of Cairo to Amoco, the US company announced
in Chicago yesterday. The price was understood to be about Dollars 50m. The
project is run by the Egyptian subsidiary of Agip.

FT  06 OCT 93 / The time has come to cut Japan down to size
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Japanese stock market is posing one of its periodical challenges to the
practice of setting performance benchmarks for international equity
portfolios. Tokyo's market capitalisation has bounced back and is once more
threatening to impose its own unrealistic values on global fund managers.
Benchmarks are usually based upon stock market indices, and indeed the
global stock market index series - such as the FT-Actuaries World Index -
were constructed primarily with this purpose in mind. A fund manager's
starting point can therefore be, say, the World ex-US Index, which he must
track or beat.
But once before, in the late 1980s, the Japanese bubble threatened this
approach. At the peak in late 1989 the Tokyo market was worth 45 per cent of
the world market capitalisation. What was worse, it amounted to more than 60
per cent of the global market outside the US, a degree of concentration
which threatened to destroy the whole purpose of international
diversification for US pension funds.
A lesson was learned. If you follow the index-based approach too slavishly
you can wind up overexposed to the overvalued markets and underexposed to
the cheap ones. It was enough to encourage dabbling with alternative
weighting schemes, such as GDP weights. But then, to everyone's relief,
especially to that of western fund managers who were underweight in Tokyo,
the Japanese bubble was deflated.
By mid-1992 the Japanese market was down to a 24 per cent World Index
capitalisation weighting. It was still a bit high for comfort, but was not
wildly out of line with the Japanese share of GDP of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development area (about 20 per cent).
Given that the Nikkei Dow Average is still at only just over half its peak
level, there the matter might have rested. But in the past year a new bubble
has blown up, this time involving the yen. Unhedged UK investors could have
achieved a return of 60 per cent over the past year, in the unlikely event
of matching the performance of the Tokyo index, and in sterling terms Tokyo
is within 20 per cent of its end-1989 peak.
Thus Tokyo has zoomed back, to represent nearly a third of the world market.
To US eyes, it amounts to half of the non-US capitalisation. To be fully
weighted could be dangerous, but to have been underweight in the past year
has been agonising.
None of this would matter much if Japanese companies were powering ahead.
Then heavy investment in them might look sensible. But many are facing a
currency shock that could prove disastrous and will certainly be
uncomfortable. The average return on equity in manufacturing has collapsed
to about 2 1/2 per cent, and the average p/e ratio for Tokyo stocks is no
longer (as it was in the late 1980s) 40 or even 60 but more like 90.
Here is how the problem appears to UK pension funds. A manager following a
median benchmark will know that the typical exposure of his peer group funds
to overseas equities is 24 per cent. Tokyo represents 35 per cent of the
World ex-UK capitalisation. So about 8 1/2 per cent of his portfolio ought
to be in Japanese equities. However, the actual exposure of UK pension funds
is only half as much. They are strongly angled instead towards continental
European equities where they have nearly 10 per cent of their portfolios
compared with a 'neutral' 4 per cent. Our manager with a median benchmark
can safely stay on half a full Tokyo weighting and not run much of a risk of
performing very differently from his peers. If he had an index-based
benchmark, he would be under greater pressure to adopt the full exposure.
The new Tokyo problem is the result of curious circumstances. In theory,
when a currency soars the domestic stock market will tumble because
profitability is undermined. But Tokyo is underpinned by support from public
pension funds. The optimists see a big jump in profits in 1995 as pay levels
are cut and the Japanese corporate sector starts to shed surplus workers. It
would require a revolution in employer-employee relationships.
How this will work out is the subject of various opinions, but in the
meantime those fund sponsors being pulled by benchmarks into heavy exposures
to the Tokyo market are being braver than perhaps they realise.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Amstrad beefs up its top management: Share price rises as
consumer electronics group cuts pre-tax losses to Pounds 20.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMSTRAD, the troubled con-sumer electronics group, has rehired the
technological wizard behind many of its earlier successes and is looking for
a new chief executive as it seeks to restore profitability through growth
and acquisition.
The strategy includes closing Amstrad's Spanish subsidiary and measures to
reduce the company's dependence on the professional personal computer
business.
Mr Alan Sugar, Amstrad's founder and chairman, said that Mr Robert Watkins,
who left Amstrad last year to become group managing director at Binatone,
had returned to manage Dancall Radio, which Amstrad acquired last month.
Mr Watkins, who was Amstrad's technical director, had been credited with
helping to develop many of the company's 'blockbuster' products. Mr Sugar
said: 'Mr Watkins put us in the satellite business and the personal computer
business. His sole responsibility now will be to look after Dancall Radio.'
The Danish cellular radio company is seen as the key to Amstrad's ambitions
in mobile communications.
Mr Malcolm Miller will take charge of the consumer products group, Amstrad's
core business, while the new chief executive will be responsible for finding
and managing acquisitions in areas, such as mobile communications and
satellite systems, which have synergy with electrical and electronic
products.
Amstrad's results for last year showed that the group returned to
profitability before charges. The share price gained 3p yesterday to close
at 48p.
Operating profits were Pounds 15m and the group earned interest income of
Pounds 7.2m. Closure of the Spanish subsidiary, however, meant that Pounds
25m in goodwill was charged, leaving a pre-tax loss of Pounds 20.5m,
compared with Pounds 70.7m.
Turnover for the year to June 30 was Pounds 308.5m, 13.5 per cent down on
the previous year's Pounds 356.5m. The 1992-93 figure included a
contribution of Pounds 12.2m from acquisitions.
Losses per share were 2p, cut from 6.7p; the company is paying a final
dividend of 0.3p making a total of 0.5p.
Mr Sugar said that Amstrad had continued to reduce both inventories and the
lead-time of products, enabling it to increase net cash to Pounds 167m, from
Pounds 162m last year.
Analysts are suggesting pre-tax profits of between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m
for next year. Mr Sugar, who tried unsuccessfully to take the company
private last year at 30p a share, says the core businesses can only generate
profits of Pounds 10m-Pounds 20m a year. Split between 580m shares, he
contends that earnings would be very low without substantial growth.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Daimler shares take a back seat to sports car
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AIDED by helicopters, fire trucks, jet engines and a prototype sports car,
Daimler-Benz - Germany's biggest industrial group - made a splashy debut on
the New York stock exchange yesterday.
Amid a scrum of German and US television camera crews and journalists, Mr
Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler's managing board, pledged to boost US
ownership of its stock to 10 per cent of the total. Currently, only 3 per
cent is in US hands.
Daimler is the first German company to obtain a full listing on US equity
markets. In an important compromise earlier this year, it agreed with the US
Securities and Exchange Commission to produce its accounts according to US
standards, paving the way for the listing. The NYSE has been trying for
years to attract more foreign companies to its market, especially from
Germany.
Both Daimler and the exchange marked the debut in some style. Outside the
NYSE's imposing entrance on Broad Street, Daimler products were on display -
a BK117 'Whirly Angel' helicopter, a shiny red S-class convertible Mercedes,
a Freightliner fire truck and models of Eurofighter jets, high-speed trains
and Ariane space rockets.
NYSE traders stopping for a cigarette break, office workers and tourists all
took time to admire the goods. Star attraction was a sleek, metallic-blue
prototype sports coupe. 'No drooling on the car please,' shouted one
gruff-voiced trader.
Back inside the exchange, Mr Reuter was explaining why Daimler was bringing
its stock to New York. He pointed out that the group employs 13,000 people
at its US operations, which generate 17 per cent of worldwide sales. Last
week the Mercedes-Benz car division announced plans to build a plant in
Alabama.
Meanwhile, the shares - traded like most foreign stock on the NYSE as
American Depositary Receipts (each ADR represents one-tenth of a Daimler
share) - opened in a flurry at Dollars 47, but slipped back to Dollars
46-5/8.
The people gawking at the Mercedes cars were oblivious, however. 'Let's go
off in it, just you and me, baby,' said one man to his girlfriend as they
stood over the red convertible. 'Nah,' she replied, 'I'm taking the
helicopter.'

FT  06 OCT 93 / AT&amp;T appoints president to target UK as growth area
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Tele-graph, the US telecommunications giant, has
appointed its first UK president, to spearhead its growing ambitions in the
UK.
Mr Merrill Tutton is one of only three AT&amp;T country presidents outside the
US. The other two are in Spain and China, which AT&amp;T also views as growth
markets.
Mr Tutton, 52, was formerly responsible for AT&amp;T's residential long-distance
business in the US, which has more than 32,000 employees. It forms a large
part of the company's telecommunications services group, which last year
generated turnover of Dollars 40bn (Pounds 26bn).
The appointment of such a senior manager indicates the priority AT&amp;T
attaches to developing its UK business.
With 7,000 UK-based employees, AT&amp;T has only a modest foothold in the UK.
But it has an application pending with the Department for Trade and Industry
for a full public network operating licence. It could use the licence either
to build its own infrastructure or - more likely - to provide services in
conjunction with existing and new operators in the UK's increasingly
competitive market.
Either way, it would give added intensity to AT&amp;T's international battle
with British Telecommunications. Both operators are seeking to establish
themselves as global companies, providing cross-border services to
multinational companies. 'This is a tangible sign of our long-term
commitment to the UK market,' said Mr Tutton. 'There are many new areas we
could develop if we gain a licence: our whole notion is to grow this
market.'
BT yesterday made large cuts in its prices for international digital private
circuits. It made average reductions of 29 per cent on circuits to North
America and 11 per cent to most of Europe, and launched special offers for
companies agreeing fixed-term contracts for circuits to North America and
parts of Asia-Pacific and the Middle East.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Government to provide extra short-term export insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is to provide extra short-term export insurance cover worth
Pounds 1.4bn for the remainder of 1993 in a move aimed at protecting
Britain's export drive in fast-growing markets, particularly in the Pacific
rim.
The move marks an important breakthrough for private sector insurers, which
have been warning the government since early this year that they could not
cover exporters' needs. This was due in part to the fragile state of the
reinsurance market and in part to a surge in exports from the UK following
the devaluation of sterling in September last year. Exports to China, for
example, were 90 per cent higher in the first half of 1993 than in the first
half of last year.
Mr Colin Foxall, chief executive of NCM Credit Insurance, the
Dutch-controlled company which accounts for 80 per cent of short-term export
credit cover in the UK, yesterday welcomed the development.
He emphasised that the private sector would continue to meet more than 80
per cent of the export insurance needs of UK exporters. The Pounds 1.4bn in
additional cover will be of greatest value in 'concentrated markets' where
high levels of exposure have arisen because of strong export growth. Key
markets are Turkey, South Korea, Malaysia, China, Indonesia and Thailand.
When the UK government privatised the short-term export insurance arm of the
Export Credits Guarantee Department in late 1991, its stated aim was to
withdraw completely from the reinsurance of short-term risks - generally,
exports where payment is due within two years.
A crisis arose early this year, when NCM revealed that at least Pounds 1bn
of exports were in jeopardy because the private sector did not have the
capacity to reinsure the risk. Exporters were having to use expensive bank
letters of credit to cover themselves against the risk, or risk losing the
business altogether.
The government moved to answer this shortage in June, when it announced that
'top-up' reinsurance to bridge the gap would be extended to 1997.

FT  06 OCT 93 / CBI chief calls on ministers to end policy 'vacuum'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Howard Davies, director- general of the Confederation of British
Industry, yesterday called on ministers to develop strategies to counter
what he called 'the current vacuum' at the heart of government economic
policy.
He also outlined the areas the CBI would like to see reformed. They will be
included in its new policy document, The Competitiveness of British
Industry: the role of government, to be published next week.
Mr Davies said: 'The government needs a framework of policy guidelines
setting out its industrial strategy. It is no good if the Department of
Trade and Industry produces a new definition of policy if it fails to get
its message across to other departments.'
The CBI's industrial paper outlines seven areas in which it would like to
see significant changes in government policy. These include public
expenditure and taxation, education and training, transport planning, trade
and investment and regulation. 'This should provide the framework for a
restatement of government industrial policy,' Mr Davies said.
He described the present government spending round as a 'ridiculous horse
trade' which inevitably resulted in unsatisfactory decisions. 'It often ends
in government investing in failure instead of investing in success.'
Speaking earlier at a fringe meeting at the Conservative conference in
Blackpool, Mr Davies said nothing short of a new definition of the aims of
government industrial policy would do.
He warned his audience against believing that each government department was
formulating its own policy towards industry. 'That is not adequate to fill
the vacuum at the heart of government economic policy. Businessmen do not
understand the government's objectives.'
Mr Richard Needham, trade minister, replied that manufacturing industry was
crucial to Britain's economic success, but said it would not be politically
sensible for the government to publish its industrial objectives which could
be open to criticism.

FT  06 OCT 93 / China explodes nuclear device despite US plea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA yesterday defied the US by going ahead with an underground nuclear
explosion, the first test by any country for more than a year.
Its action prompted President Bill Clinton to order the US Department of
Energy, which is responsible for nuclear warheads, to prepare for a
'possible' resumption of testing.
China was explicitly rejecting a plea made last month by Mr Clinton to
suspend its plans and join the other recognised nuclear powers - the US,
Russia, France and Britain - in a moratorium.
China said it favoured a global test-ban treaty by 1996. But it is feared
that yesterday's test could set a precedent and undermine prospects for a
comprehensive ban, on which negotiations are set to start in January. This
in turn would cast a shadow over the future of the Non-Proliferation Treaty,
the international instrument for preventing the spread of nuclear weapons,
which is due for renewal in 1995.
China's action may be privately welcomed by officials in the other nuclear
powers who have been arguing the need for further tests of their own.
Russia first announced a moratorium two years ago, followed last year by
France and then the US. Britain is bound by US policy since it uses the
Nevada test site. The US moratorium, extended in July for at least another
15 months, is conditional on no other nation conducting tests.
Mr Clinton said in July that if another country broke the moratorium he
would order additional US tests. However, resumption of US testing in
response to a single Chinese explosion is thought unlikely, and would face
strong opposition in the US Congress.
The test, recorded by foreign monitoring stations, took place at around 0200
GMT at the Lop Nor test site in Xinjiang province, some 1,500 miles west of
Beijing.
Mr John Lanchbery of the London-based Verification Technology Information
Centre said it was a relatively small device with a yield of between 20 and
40 kilotons, roughly twice that of the 1945 Hiroshima bomb.
France is also considering whether to resume testing at Mururoa Atoll in the
South Pacific. Early today New Zealand, which has opposed the French tests,
accused Beijing of 'a callous disregard of world opinion' and of
irresponsible behaviour.

FT  06 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Amstrad
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Amstrad is barely recognisable from the apparently dead-end company Mr Alan
Sugar tried to take private a year ago. The dividend has been restored,
albeit at a modest level. Cash amounts to very nearly 30p a share, the price
at which Mr Sugar pitched his offer. Even allowing for the seasonal demands
on working capital, Amstrad has Pounds 100m to invest in new projects. That
alone justifies the shareholders' decision to reject Mr Sugar's proposition.
How he and the new chief executive choose to use this financial muscle will
determine how much more than the offer price Amstrad is worth.
The acquisition last month of Dancall, the Danish mobile phone manufacturer,
provides an opening into cellular telephony. Like home computers and
satellite dishes, digital mobile phones look like a technology on the verge
of a mass market and therefore susceptible to the Amstrad treatment. Since
the big service providers are paying subsidies to keep the retail price of
digital handsets down, a low-cost manufacturer might expect a fair hearing.
Whether that would extend to giving Amstrad a share of subscription revenues
 -as Mr Sugar hopes - is more doubtful.
Either way, the project turns on Amstrad undercutting established
manufacturers such as Motorola and Nokia. Since their operating margins are
anything but fat, Amstrad will have to find manufacturing efficiencies or
technological short-cuts overlooked by the competition. Given Mr Sugar's
record in other markets it would be foolish to dismiss his chances of
success. But cellular phones looks a much more difficult target than home
computers in the mid-1980s.

FT  06 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Paramount
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite its denials, Viacom's recruitment of a star-studded cast of
investors clearly suggests the entertainment group is preparing to boldly go
where no bidder has gone before in its quest for Paramount Communications.
With the rival QVC Network now trying to prove the colour of its money to
the Paramount board, the need has become more urgent. The near-Dollars 2bn
contributions from Blockbuster and Nynex - as well as the share
price-boosting impact of their involvement - should at least enable Viacom
to match QVC's higher Dollars 9.5bn offer.
But although the help of additional investors greatly strengthens Viacom's
financial cause, it will considerably complicate the managerial challenge
should its preferred bid succeed. Both Blockbuster and Nynex will have
strong views about what to do with Paramount. A similar worry also besets
QVC following its recruitment of allies. Given the strained finances and
fuzzy industrial logic of both bids, it is tempting to think a more strongly
capitalised media giant will enter the fray and sweep up the prize. It is,
however, hard to identify just who this might be.

FT  06 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: UK housebuilders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest confusing house price figures from the Halifax illustrate the
difficulty of trying to assess the health of the housing market. Part of the
trouble is that no-one can remember what a 'normal' market should feel like,
given the mind-bending experiences of recent years. The monthly comparisons
are vaguely disappointing, the annual comparisons encouraging. Yet it should
be remembered that last September, many house owners thought the UK economy
had just fallen off the edge of the world as interest rates - momentarily -
shot skywards. Nevertheless, the survey confirms the anecdotal impression
that the housing market is gently drifting upwards, although not
sufficiently quickly to have a significant impact on the prices either of
houses or the materials used in their construction. Turnover remains muted
for a variety of well-rehearsed reasons: the threat of unemployment has not
abated; the negative equity trap still grips many; looming tax increases are
unsettling confidence; real income growth remains depressed.
Such a backdrop must be beginning to worry those investors who have bid up
the construction and building materials sectors so enthusiastically. At
present, the market seemingly wants to have it both ways on inflation. It
partly justifies housebuilders' high P/E ratios because of the historically
low cost of money which it believes will stimulate the market. But it
conveniently overlooks the fact that the anticipated earnings recovery for
housebuilders will crucially depend on the return of house price inflation.

FT  06 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Daimler's new gloss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Given some of the hype which has gone with privatisations in the UK, it is
perhaps churlish to jib at the hoop-la which accompanied Daimler Benz's New
York listing. Yet the US placing is of primarily symbolic significance. Only
a small percentage of Daimler's stock is being sold and much of that to
retail investors - presumably in the hope that it will not find its way back
across the Atlantic on the next departing Concorde. That hardly provides a
market broad and deep enough to raise substantial new capital; Daimler will
need to work hard expanding the current New York base if it is to garner
significant funds there.
Perhaps that is not the point. There have long been hints that Deutsche Bank
is keen to reduce its stake and it may thus be significant that some of its
shares are on offer. That is a direct pressure on Daimler's management,
since its new shareholders may not be as tolerant of flabby performance as a
long-term German partner. It is also an indirect squeeze since the US
accounting practices which Daimler has had to follow show just how deep a
hole the company is in. Ironically, that shock may actually help Daimler's
board market an aggressive retrenchment programme to the company's managers
and workforce.
Further cutbacks seem inevitable given the car and truck division's bloated
cost base and the less than scintillating performance of the businesses
acquired in the drive to diversify. Whether the company is moving fast
enough in that direction is, however, a moot point. More radical surgery may
be needed if US investors are to help fund a future rights issue at anything
like the current price - especially when one notes that US carmakers sell at
almost a third the rating of sky-high Daimler.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Cultural imperialism
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IDEA of Catherine Deneuve engaging in hand-to-hand combat with The
Terminator on the world's cinema screens may seem far-fetched, even by
Hollywood's standards. However, it is a fitting metaphor for a source of
conflict which is increasingly exercising US and European Community
negotiators as they seek to clear the remaining obstacles to a world trade
agreement.
At issue are plans to liberalise international trade in audio-visual
services, chiefly films and television programmes. Though promoted largely
by the US, such an agreement is also favoured by Sir Leon Brittan, the EC
trade commissioner, who wants the Uruguay Round to cover as many services as
possible.
However, negotiations have hit a stumbling block in the form of French
demands - which have won support in some other parts of the EC - that
audio-visual services be exempted from the round. Protesting that
liberalisation would sweep away Europe's last defences against a flood tide
of American mass-market entertainment, France argues that culture is too
important to be abandoned to the free market.
It would be absurd if the dispute were allowed seriously to threaten a world
trade deal. Not only are the economic gains and losses at stake relatively
minor; the central issues in the debate have been obscured by the
exaggerated rhetoric and claims of the protagonists. As a consequence,
economic and cultural principles have become unnecessarily confused.
Cultural identity
France's case deserves sympathy, up to a point. It is not the only country
concerned with maintaining its national cultural identity in the face of an
international mass-media barrage. It also has an understandable interest in
seeking to keep alive the only sizeable film production industry left in
Europe. That this has only been possible thanks to special levies and
subsidies should not be a matter of great concern. After all, other
performing arts, such as music and theatre, are subsidised everywhere in the
world.
It may be objected that films are different because they are traded
internationally. However, it is hard to argue that state support seriously
distorts competition in a business where financial viability is determined
far more by audience size than by production costs. In pressing for an
agreement to curb subsidies, the US is tilting at windmills.
A far greater obstacle to free trade is the EC's four-year-old restriction
on the proportion of programming from outside the Community which may be
broadcast on national television networks. Though technically non-binding,
these are widely observed. France has gone further, legislating even stiffer
restrictions on domestic broadcasters. That is the target on which the US
should focus its attack.
Defeatist argument
Defenders of European quotas say they are needed to prevent the market being
swamped with cheap US programmes, the costs of which have already been
covered by sales to their large home market. That is a defeatist argument
which ignores the fact that US programme makers owe much of their success to
effective marketing and distribution in the EC, which local rivals have
failed to match.
The principle of applying a local content test to films and television
programmes is, in any case, a logical nonsense. What is it supposed to
measure in an industry where capital, talent and production resources flow
freely across frontiers and are drawn from an increasingly wide range of
international sources? Should the output of the MCA studios, located in
Hollywood but owned by Matsushita, count as American or Japanese?
But the strongest argument against quotas is that they are a form of
censorship. That is not only objectionable in itself. It amounts to
self-delusion by governments at a time when public service broadcasting
channels face growing competition from newer media such as cable, satellite
and video systems.
How these media should best be regulated is a legitimate policy concern,
which lies outside the scope of the Uruguay Round. For the moment, the
priority for the US and the EC should be to sweep away unnecessary and
economically damaging impediments to audio-visual trade.

FT  06 OCT 93 / A rose by any other name: Guy de Jonquieres examines the
malaise affecting several product brands as consumers switch to
private-label lines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since Philip Morris, the US tobacco company, stunned Wall Street six months
ago by slashing the price of Marlboro cigarettes in the face of sliding
sales, manufacturers of other consumer products, from chocolate to
toothpaste, have anxiously protested that such a catastrophe could not
happen to their brands.
Yet the humbling of Marlboro increasingly looks like one, particularly
dramatic, symptom of a wider malaise afflicting consumer goods industries.
On both sides of the Atlantic, many branded products continue to lose share
to retailers' cheaper private-label lines. With prices under pressure,
manufacturers everywhere are relying heavily on cost-cutting to bolster
profit margins.
Recession, the growth of more powerful retailers and 'value-conscious'
consumer attitudes are often held responsible. However, the search for
culprits has recently found another target - the marketing skills which most
consumer products manufacturers have long considered the bedrock of their
business.
Even the industry's harshest critics agree brand leaders such as Coca-Cola,
Gillette and Kellogg, and some smaller players, such as Britain's
Cadbury-Schweppes and Ferrero of Italy, remain models of excellence. But in
other companies, the austere climate of the 1990s is exposing underlying
weaknesses which were masked by buoyant consumer spending and steadily
rising profits in the 1980s.
Professor John Quelch of Harvard Business School, a marketing expert and
adviser to companies including Mars, Nestle and Procter &amp; Gamble, blames
complacency. 'Consumer products manufacturers tend to think they are the
fount of all marketing wisdom. But in reality many have become
excruciatingly myopic and arrogant,' he says.
Similar criticisms have been levelled by McKinsey, the management
consultancy, which has many leading consumer goods companies as clients. In
a hard-hitting article entitled 'Marketing's mid-life crisis', two of
McKinsey's European directors say consumer marketing has grown ineffective
and needs to be radically rethought.
Some industry executives agree. Mr Crispin Davis, a former top marketer with
P&amp;G who now heads United Distillers (UD), Guinness' spirits division, says:
'Much consumer goods marketing has not been nearly as good as it should have
been.'
The situation is even worse than it appears, he says, because in some
companies marketing spending has lagged sales growth in the past decade  -
or even fallen in absolute terms - while a growing share of it consists of
price discounts to retailers.
In the US, such attitudes appear so prevalent that the lead article in the
current Harvard Business Review argues, as if reporting a recent discovery,
that companies which invest consistently in marketing over a long period
earn better returns than those which insist on quick results.
Marketing departments are increasingly faulted, often within their own
companies, for taking their eye off the ball. McKinsey blames creeping
bureaucratisation: it estimates that the typical department in larger
companies spends 80 per cent of its time on routine administrative chores
and only 20 per cent working on product innovation strategy and ways of
serving retailers and consumers better.
If that sounds reminiscent of companies such as General Motors and Philips a
decade or so ago, it may be partly because consumer goods producers have not
been exposed to the Japanese export competition which has forced so many
other western manufacturing industries to slim down, restructure and
re-examine their approach to customers. Of Japan's consumer goods companies,
only cosmetics maker Shiseido and drinks companies such as Asahi and Suntory
have made much effort to expand abroad.
Japanese competition has, however, found a proxy in the retail trade. As the
power of big supermarket groups in many countries has increased, they have
not only driven harder bargains with their suppliers but are increasingly
challenging their traditional franchise with consumers.
The threat is coming from two main directions. One is the rapid growth of
aggressive discount retailers, such as Aldi of Germany and and US warehouse
'clubs' such as Costco. Though many offer only limited grocery ranges, their
high volumes, thin margins and low costs result in exceptionally cheap
prices which are challenging the traditional marketing strategies of both
manufacturers and other retailers.
A potentially even more menacing development is occurring at the other end
of the market, due to the growing sophistication of private-label ranges.
These were long dismissed by manufacturers as commodity products or inferior
imitations which sold purely on price - much as Detroit derided early car
exports from Japan. Yet in several countries private-label lines are now
taking on estab-lished brands on their own terms.
In the US, private-label has recently eaten into high-margin categories once
held to be impregnable, such as breakfast cereals, cookies and beauty
products, and many consumers now rate its quality equal to that of
manufacturer brands. In the UK, where private-label is stronger than in any
other country, it dominates some newer markets for fast-growing premium
products, such as chilled recipe dishes.
Out of these developments, a new battlefield is emerging. Manufacturers have
gradually recognised that their struggle with retailers is no longer simply
over prices and shelf space but over the essence of their competitive
advantage - brand strength and the profit margins which go with it.
The trend has been particularly pronounced in Britain, where supermarkets'
success in fattening margins by moving private-label up-market in the 1980s
has recently inspired similar efforts by some North American and continental
retailers.
J. Sainsbury and Tesco, the two biggest chains, now rank among the 10 most
heavily advertised UK brands - ahead of those of almost all their suppliers
 -while their marketing emphasises image and intangible benefits such as
quality, service and value, as well as individual product lines.
Whether that repositioning will prevent them losing sales to 'hard' grocery
discounters is uncertain. But the big supermarkets' efforts to place
private-label on a par with manufacturer brands seems likely to continue
thanks to two strengths, also shared by retailers such as Marks and Spencer
and Boots.
One is investment in highly efficient distribution systems and stringent
product and quality control standards, which sometimes exceed those of
branded manufacturers. The other is unmatched access to immediate
information about consumer purchasing patterns.
Retailers have no clearer idea than branded manufacturers how housewives
will behave tomorrow, or why. But they know far more about what they bought
yesterday, thanks to the reams of data churned out by their point-of-sale
systems.
That offers a big advantage in bringing new products to market. While
manufacturers have to spend months test-marketing innovations and large sums
to market them, supermarkets can experiment cheaply at low risk by stocking
their shelves with goods developed to their specifications and watching how
they sell.
Faced with these challenges, how can branded manufacturers regain the
initiative? Some have sought to turn from confrontation to co-operation with
retailers. The trend was pioneered by an informal partnership between P&amp;G
and Wal-Mart, the large US discount chain, and has been emulated by other
manufacturers such as Mars and Coca-Cola.
Such arrangements aim to increase both partners' sales and manage the supply
chain more efficiently by sharing information. Their success may depend,
though, on manufacturers being undisputed brand leaders which can offer
retailers in-depth product market expertise. Even where that is the case,
the spread of such partnerships is still inhibited by mutual suspicion and
hostility, particularly in Europe.
But the toughest challenge remains to come up with products which consumers
really want to buy. Though recession has made low price the overriding
concern for some consumers, there is plenty of evidence that many are ready
to pay a premium if they are really convinced they are getting something
special for it.
Few producers have found it easy to come up with such products in recent
years, despite a frenzy of new product launches. There were 11,500 in the US
food industry last year, double the number in 1985. However, many involved
minor brand extensions, cosmetic packaging changes and copycat products.
There is a growing belief in the industry that such tactics have proved
counter-productive by cluttering supermarket shelves with similar goods and
heightening consumer scepticism towards advertising claims.
Some manufacturers now accept that a bigger effort is needed to raise the
standards of new products and differentiate them from the competition, by
focusing development more tightly and concentrating more marketing resources
behind fewer brands. That, in turn, is prompting a rethinking of management
and marketing methods.
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch group, has radically restructured Elida Gibbs, its
UK personal products subsidiary, by abolishing traditional management
divisions and creating teams which co-operate at every phase of the product
cycle, from research to sales. Kraft General Foods, part of Philip Morris,
is also experimenting with teamwork in an effort to beef up product
development and marketing in Europe.
But the benefits of such reorganisation also have to be effectively
communicated to consumers. That is an issue on which opinions differ
sharply. Unilever, for instance, stoutly defends the virtues of classic
mass-market advertising. But Nestle of Switzerland, the world's largest food
group, is far more sceptical.
Mr Peter Brabeck, Nestle's chief marketing strategist, believes the growing
power of retailers, the fragmentation of television media and more
sophisticated shopping habits have made it increasingly hard to influence
consumers: 'People today don't just act because someone tells them
something,' he says. 'You have to find a way to communicate which is
believable and relevant to them.'
One option favoured by Nestle and a growing number of other companies is to
resort to more direct channels of communication. With the aid of detailed
databases about shoppers, they hope to encourage loyalty by rewarding
regular customers and informing them directly of new products and special
offers.
Some industry experts say, though, that what producers really need to do is
to listen more. A survey by Professor Quelch found that US consumer brand
managers typically spent only three per cent of their time in face-to-face
contact with buyers of their products and relied for most of their
inform-ation on numerical market research data.
'Most companies are not spending enough time really understanding
consumers,' says Mr Davis of UD. He says some of his most useful market
research is done on Saturday mornings, when he regularly visits his local
supermarket to watch shoppers in action. He has also arranged for his
managers to spend evenings serving at bar counters.
One recent result was the discovery that Black Label scotch was selling
poorly in Greece because status-conscious drinkers thought the bottles could
not be seen clearly in dark night clubs.
Successful marketing has always required fanatical attention to such
apparently trivial details. If brands have lost some of pulling power, it is
because too many producers have forgotten that their value depends largely
on finding out what consumers want and giving it to them at the right price.
In that sense, their biggest challenge is to get back to basics.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Shop front needed for design
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER YORK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report on the break-up of the Design Council ('Design Council
break-up decided by government', September 24) and Christopher Lorenz's
accompanying article ('The Design Council on a crash diet') confirm that
government is anxious to maintain a design consultancy and an educational
role. However, there is no mention of salvaging the considerable and largely
self-financing promotional activity the council used to undertake on behalf
of British manufacturers in the Design Centre and overseas.
The trade and industry minister correctly suggests that 'design as a subject
needs to be moved into the mainstream'. Nothing can be more 'mainstream'
than getting British design into the marketplace. This more than anything
determines whether designs are commercially relevant and experience of
market factors is an essential design ingredient.
There is little point in indulging our aptitude for creating innovation
while neglecting to exploit inventive achievements. We need trade and
industry and therefore to rescue the Design Centre shop front and not just
the back room of design consultancy.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Tales of human interest: The Council of Europe is an
important defender of minority rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This weekend, in Vienna, the Council of Europe will hold its first ever
summit meeting. The most common reaction to that piece of information is
blank incomprehension.
Remarkably few people seem to have any idea what the Council of Europe is.
Even among those who know of its existence, many imagine it as yet another
talking shop which, while it may once have had a useful role, could be
dispensed with now.
They could hardly be more wrong. In the words of Mr Jeremy Greenstock,
assistant undersecretary at the UK Foreign Office, it is 'the one
institution in Europe at the moment which is matching its machinery to its
rhetoric'.
The Council suffers, of course, from confusion with the EC, and that is
understandable. Its headquarters are in Strasbourg, and its parliamentary
assembly uses the same chamber as the European Parliament. To make matters
worse, the EC has twice-yearly summits under the name of 'European Council'.
But it was the Council of Europe, not the EC, that drew up the European
Convention on Human Rights - a unique document in that it allows individuals
to seek redress against their own government in a supranational court. The
existence of a commission to investigate such complaints and a court to hear
them puts this convention in a quite different category from the Universal
Declaration on Human Rights, which is habitually violated by many of the
governments that have signed it.
The Council is a club of democracies, and it takes that description very
seriously - unlike the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe,
which in 1990 proclaimed all sorts of high-sounding principles and then
opened its arms to a whole host of ex-Soviet and ex-Yugoslav republics, some
of which do not even pretend to apply those principles.
The Council has been much choosier. To qualify, you have to have both an
executive and a legislature which clearly derive from free and fair,
multi-party elections. You must have a free press and - the most contentious
point - you must make a show of respecting minority rights. Above all, you
must sign and undertake to ratify rapidly the human rights convention -
including, nowadays, its provisions on the right of individual petition and
on the compulsory jurisdiction of the court.
Slovakia only scraped in last June, after promising to repeal laws that
discriminated against ethnic Hungarians, notably by banning the use of
non-Slovak Christian names on official documents. And last week the
parliamentary assembly voted to admit Romania, despite doubts about its
human rights record. In both cases, Hungary was persuaded, with some
difficulty, that the rights of Hungarian minorities could be better
safeguarded by obtaining undertakings from the states concerned, and then
monitoring their implementation, than by keeping them out in the cold.
(There is a valuable precedent for dealing with backsliders: in 1970,
Greece, then under military rule, resigned from the Council, forestalling
expulsion by minutes, after being found guilty of torturing political
prisoners. It was readmitted after the restoration of democracy in 1974.)
Other former communist states that have gained admission are Hungary itself,
Poland, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Slovenia and the Czech Republic. Latvia,
Albania, Russia, Ukraine, Croatia, Belarus and Moldova have applied for
membership, but have yet to meet the standards set. Their leaders will have
a special meeting with the existing members on Friday morning, before the
summit proper gets under way.
Why are governments so keen to get in? The Council has no divisions and no
'cohesion' funds. It can guarantee no one's security, and has little to
offer economically. But the badge of belonging to the club of European
democracies is important to the self-respect of post-communist countries,
and to the legitimacy of their governments. Moreover, although there is no
formal connection between the Council and the EC, it is unthinkable that the
latter would consider an application from any state the former had rejected
on human rights grounds.
So the Council has gained in importance since the fall of communism in
central and eastern Europe. It is playing a significant role in bringing the
two halves of Europe together again - a role the summit is intended to
solemnise.
It will also discuss at least two areas where the Council's machinery badly
needs improvement. On the table will be proposals to streamline the human
rights procedure, so that it no longer takes five or six years for the
average case to reach a conclusion; and a draft additional protocol to the
human rights convention, dealing specifically with the rights of national
minorities.
Unhappily, on both issues the UK government (which will be represented by
Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor - Mr John Major being otherwise engaged at
his party's annual conference) is dragging its feet. It wants to keep a
two-tier structure for the court of human rights, with provision for appeals
 -although the court is already effectively an appeal court, addressed only
when domestic legal remedies are exhausted  - and it objects to any
justiciable protection of national minorities on the grounds that these are
too difficult to define and (according to Mr Greenstock) more than 200
linguistic groups within the UK might qualify.
Given the gravity of ethnic conflicts, the fragility of new democracies, and
the need for legal remedies as an alternative to violence, these objections
seem rather frivolous. Is Britain determined to fiddle while eastern Europe
burns?

Sir, The Risk and Reward column of October 4 ('Setback for active

management techniques give rise to new problems for performance measurement

In fact, there is little reason for doubting that greater accuracy in
performance measurement should be a normal by-product of quantitative
investment approaches.
To suggest otherwise really is rather controversial.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Case for ITV rules change 'flawed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr LOUIS SHERWOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Central Television's chairman, Leslie Hill, says he thinks those
pressing for changes to the ITV ownership rules have won the commercial
argument (UK Company News, September 30). Not so. The fact is that the
amazing array of ever-changing 'commercial' arguments put forward by those
pushing for change has been found to be hopelessly flawed. Their logic has
been questioned by the City, politicians from all parties, the regulator in
the shape of the Independent Television Commission, and many others.
Mr Hill refers to the 'commercial logic' of these arguments. They are
anything but logical. Try this one for size: 'Only by joining together can
ITV defend itself from foreign takeover.' Yet, allowing ITV to group into
two or three companies would actually make it easier for foreign predators
to take over ITV. Where's the logic in that one]
We have also been told of the 'commercial logic' of the imaginary Pounds
100m savings through takeover and of the
four-companies-could-run-ITV-better-than-15 routine. And, finally, there is
the cry that ITV will go broke in the face of competition from satellite, in
flat contradiction to the relatively optimistic tone of recent reports from
the boards of individual licensees.
There is now a clear majority of ITV companies rejecting ownership rule
changes. Each company has a board of directors responsible to its
shareholders, and we at HTV certainly do not accept that the commercial
argument has been won. Quite the opposite. Despite the fact that the burden
of proof should fall on those who seek to change the existing regulations,
the arguments in favour of change are weak and superficial  - but
potentially dangerous in their consequences.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Fresh feather in their caps: Brazil's constitution has
slowed economic growth. Reform is in sight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Five years after adopting a new constitution, Brazil's congress today sits
down to discuss important changes to a document now blamed for some of the
country's most serious problems. If adopted, the changes could help
stabilise the country's economy. If not, the government's attempts to tackle
inflation of almost 2,000 per cent a year are unlikely to succeed.
Many of the ideals behind the 1988 document were admirable, but have proved
unrealistic for a developing country such as Brazil. The constitution was
designed to reverse a process of centralisation imposed during 20 years of
military rule, and restore individual rights. Instead, it reflected the
utopian dreams of its drafters and now looks awkwardly socialist and
nationalist in character.
To entrench workers' rights, the constitution imposed a country-wide minimum
wage, ruled that public employees could only be sacked through the courts,
and forced through a retirement system based on length of service, which let
female teachers retire after only 25 years' work.
Five years later, the minimum wage is driving employers in the poorer,
northern half of the country to hire and fire through the informal economy,
outside the government's tax net. The public sector salary bill has doubled
to 11 per cent of the government's creaking budget, and the social security
system is nearly bankrupt because more people will soon be receiving
benefits and pensions than are contributing.
Mr Mailson de Nobrega, finance minister when the constitution was approved,
says the government was powerless to avert these problems because it lacked
support in congress. 'We could only cry, and pray,' he says.
Brazil finally has the chance to address its constitutional weaknesses over
the next few months. Except for clauses that guarantee the basic federal
structure and individual rights, every aspect of the constitution is open
for discussion. Amendments will be passed by simple majority among the
combined members of Brazil's congress, the senate and house of deputies.
The most important area for change is the relationship between the federal
government, the states and municipalities. The constitution, in a bid to
decentralise power and spread wealth to the poorer regions, forced the
federal government to transfer more resources to states and municipalities.
For example, the federal government's share of total tax revenues fell 10
percentage points to 33 per cent in 1988 as a result of the changes.
But there was no corresponding decrease in the federal government's
responsibilities, and it remained burdened with spending commitments in
areas such as schools, health and public services.
Transfers to states and municipalities and wage bills accounted for 70 per
cent of the federal government's revenues last year, while a further 17 per
cent went in interest costs on its debt. As a result, the government could
only fund its commitments by borrowing at high, short-term interest rates
and printing money, both of which are highly inflationary.
The constitution also made compulsory the earmarking of certain
expenditures. For example, 18 per cent of total tax revenues has to be spent
on education. These rules make government efforts to cut its budget deficit
difficult and will have to be relaxed for the revision to be successful.
Equally, observers note, resources should be better related to
responsibilities. This means the federal government should be allowed to
claw back some transfers, or the states and municipalities should assume
more responsibilities.
'We have to get a fair sharing of revenues and expenditures to restore
feasibility to the federal government and tackle inflation,' according to Mr
Nobrega.
Persuading congress of the need for fiscal reform will be tricky, especially
since the largest political party, the Party of the Brazilian Democratic
Movement, is suspicious of the intentions of Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso,
finance minister. It fears that he is planning a 'shock' economic plan, the
fifth since 1986, which could bolster his chances of running for president
next year.
The biggest obstacle to constitutional reform will be the states, which
would suffer through either smaller transfers or more spending commitments.
For this reason, the government is likely to call for a political consensus
to make the sacrifices necessary to solve the federal budget deficit.
'Without a political pact on how to distribute resources, you won't get the
ball rolling. You won't do much by simply changing the rules of the
constitution,' according to one minister.
The chances of reaching such a pact are mixed. There is widespread support
for the revision process in congress but it is opposed, sometimes violently,
by a coalition of leftwing and church groups which fears workers' rights are
at stake. Although this group only involves about 25 per cent of congress,
it can delay progress and has threat-ened to challenge the revision through
the courts.
Perhaps more important, the coalition government of President Itamar Franco
is weak and seems unlikely to be able to generate enough support within
congress for the more unpopular measures that are needed, including thorough
fiscal reform. With only a year before presidential and congressional
elections, there is a danger some members of congress will place their
re-election interests ahead of those of the government's budget.
Mr Roberto Campos, federal deputy for Rio de Janeiro and a leading critic of
the constitution's weaknesses, is cautious about what the revision can
accomplish. 'It can't worsen the constitution, and that's the only cause for
optimism,' he says.
Areas that could see important change, according to Mr Campos and others,
include foreign access to the economy. The constitution discriminated
against foreign investment in fields such as mining and transport, and
guaranteed state monopolies in petroleum and telecommunications. These are
today hindering new investment because of the government's lack of
resources.
Following vocal lobbying from organisations such as Fiesp, the Federation of
Sao Paulo Industries, it seems likely the discrimination clause will be
dropped and foreign-controlled companies will be allowed once more to
exploit Brazil's mineral reserves. It is also possible that Telebras, the
monopoly telecommunications company, will slowly be forced to face private
sector competition. Less likely to be questioned is the monopoly over
petroleum exploration and refinery enjoyed by Petrobras. A newspaper poll of
congress members at the weekend showed them divided over the Petrobras
issue, mainly for nationalist reasons, and the government appears equally
split.
There could also be much-needed reform of the retirement system. Because of
generous provisions in the constitution, and special treatment for groups
like teachers, there are now some 14.5m Brazilians receiving state
retirement benefits and pensions, at a cost of about USDollars 6bn a year.
But contributions to the system are too low, and the shortfall has been met
with money meant to pay other types of benefit.
The government wants to delay the retirement age, which would be the same
for men and women, and privatise some services. However, opposition will be
formidable, both inside and outside congress, from groups who see Brazil's
retirement system as one of the few successes for workers in recent years.
Progress in these areas will be difficult because of the government's
political problems and the unfortunate timing of the revision, one year
ahead of elections. Brazil should emerge with an improved constitution, but
this is likely to remain far from ideal.
As an indication of the difficulties, congress seems split on the
constitution's most notorious ruling, that real interest rates should not
exceed 12 per cent a year. The clause is widely ignored, but its removal
would have important symbolic effect. However, the poll of congress members
showed a small majority, 46 per cent to 42 per cent, in favour of keeping
the rule in place - probably reflecting popular mistrust of the banks.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Goode proposal unworkable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID PARSONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There is a fundamental flaw in the reasoning behind the Goode
Committee's proposed minimum solvency requirement for occupational pension
schemes ('Big pensions reforms urged', Octo-ber 1). Owing to the different
investment profiles needed for ongoing pension schemes and for transfer
value calculations, generally equities and gilts respectively, it is obvious
that in the long term the proposed minimum funding requirement will nearly
always exceed the projected accrued liability on a prudently assessed basis.
This is simply due to the lower expected level of returns on gilts. This
goes against what appears to be common sense, but it is a fact of life.
The result of having to maintain such a solvency standard is likely to be a
need for less volatile and lower yielding investments than are currently
used, thus increasing the financial inefficiency of pension provision in
this way. In fact, final salary pension schemes could become as inefficient
and expensive as money purchase schemes.
A further problem is that, if trustees wished to continue to have an
efficient investment policy, the required margin in the funding target to
ensure that the solvency requirement causes few difficulties would lead to
an excessive level of funding under the surplus regulations.
Let us hope that this is one area where common sense will prevail.
As I identified in my presentations at the Institute and Faculty of
Actuaries' convention in Harrogate last month, a rigorous minimum funding
standard such as is proposed by the Goode Committee would be unworkable in
practice.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Monetary union in UK no triumph
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof D R MYDDELTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr John Szemerey (Letters, October 4) says: 'There has been a British
monetary union in the UK for years. No one challenges or questions that. Its
advantages are so obvious that it is taken for granted.'
I notice that Mr Szemerey writes from Belgium. He may not be aware that the
pound sterling has lost about 85 per cent of its domestic purchasing power
in the last 25 years. This debasement of the currency may have been
deliberate government policy. Or perhaps the incompetence of the authorities
has frustrated their genuine attempts to maintain the value of sterling. Or
maybe it was all just bad luck.
Whatever the reason, the average annual decline in purchasing power over the
last quarter-century of more than 8 per cent a year has caused very serious
problems to those on fixed incomes, to the foreign exchanges, to the tax
system, and not least to commercial accounting. In each case political
interference has exacerbated the problems caused by the government's
monetary monopoly.
In short, I can assure Mr Szemerey that the British monetary union of which
he is so enamoured has by no means been an unmitigated triumph.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Arts: Tales for fun - and tales for real - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Happy the writer who not only sees the TV adaptation of his book puffed on
billboards but has his name hoisted into the title. Armistead Maupin's Tales
of the City (Tuesdays, C4) has earned golden opinions as a faithful
adaptation of a book with the status in Britain of being a minor classic of
20th-century American fiction. Interestingly, Maupin is not nearly such a
phenomenon in the US where he is seen principally as a gay writer for a
'niche market'.
Tales of the City originated in 1976 as a daily serial contributed by Maupin
to the San Francisco Chronicle - not exactly a heavyweight but a family
paper all the same. Running Maupin was a bold editorial decision, and some
of the book's pleasure lies in imagining the impact that its light-hearted
description of bath-houses, gay bars and cruising supermarkets must have had
on the newspaper's more uptight readers.
Inevitably, that piquancy is missing now that Tales of the City has been
translated to the small screen. However, my disappointment with the TV
version arises from the great virtue of the book. Maupin's chapters are only
a page or so long and written with such clarity that it is impossible not to
wolf one of his books down in one gulp. In Richard Kramer's respectful
screenplay, the scenes are correspondingly short and the result is dialogue
so sparse that it sags like an old curtain.
Tales of the City started off like a somnolent alternative soap. Only into
hour three has it picked up speed as the charm of Maupin's characters takes
effect. Acting ranges from fair to terrific. There is a problem with DeDe
Day, the spoilt little rich girl, who even by California standards hardly
seemed fat enough to make sense of her crash diet to win back Beauchamp, the
tomcat husband. Olympia Dukakis and Donald Moffat play a touching autumnal
romance as Anna Madrigal and Edgar Halcyon, the advertising executive living
on borrowed time. If you have not guessed Mrs Madrigal's secret, it is safe
with me.
Plain Tales from Northern Ireland (Thursday, BBC 2) is an outstanding
documentary series about the people of County Fermanagh, a beautiful region
of pastures and lakes that borders the Irish Republic. It is essential
viewing for anyone who has ever wondered gloomily what kind of an insane
society Northern Ireland must be.
Writer and director Carlo Gebler is an outsider who has chosen to live and
work in Ulster. As Gebler explained in a particularly illuminating programme
earlier in the series, he chose to move to Enniskillen, Fermanagh's
principal town. Imagine telling them in New York that a sane person might
actually choose to raise a family in the place sometimes described as the
British Bosnia.
One objective of the series is simply to show that life in the province is
not as bad as outsiders think. 'Such an appealing place to raise a family',
Gebler calls Northern Ireland. 'An unspoilt world . . . crime is low . . .
children can play in the street.'
Nonetheless, the knowledge is inescapable that in this redoubt of
old-fashioned family values, families are destroyed and blighted by violence
every new day. Gebler went to Enniskillen as a resolutely impartial outsider
and yet he admits that as time has gone by, it has become harder not to be
affected by the tug of ancient allegiances which lie 'like an old magnet in
a drawer' beneath the attractive surface of life in the province.
It would be wrong to give the impression that Plain Tales from Northern
Ireland is just another of those all too familiar television ego-trips for
writers. Gebler's real subject is the people of Fermanagh. Without sentiment
or prurience, Plain Tales evokes the stoicism of Fermanagh people and their
matter-of-fact way of dealing with shock and tragedy.
In one programme we met the affable proprietor of a chain of drapery stores,
preparing to move back into premises destroyed by an Easter fire-bomb. A
former lieutenant-colonel of the UDR, he never knows when he may not again
stare into the eyes of the gunman. Last time, it was at point-blank range as
he arranged a shop-window. As is the way of the place, he knew his assassin.
In 15 years, three of his staff have been widowed by the Troubles. 'It's
just part of the game,' he commented.
Northern Ireland conforms to what a visitor expects when there are armoured
cars in the streets, flags are flying and kerbstones are painted out in
sectarian colours. The puzzlement comes in the towns and villages, which
outwardly lack the tribal markings. Outsiders are misled by the signs and
symbols, warns Gebler, who intentionally does not point out whether it is
Catholic or Protestant who is speaking.
This week's programme about 'The Impartial Reporter' was the most subtle so
far and could have seemed a trifle dull to anyone who had not watched the
rest of the series. A Unionist newspaper, The Reporter, has been owned by
four generations of the Trimble family of Enniskillen. Everyone in Fermanagh
reads it, Catholic and Protestant, and it makes a profit for its
proprietress.
The paper prides itself on impartiality but more than that, its editor
pursues a policy of stimulating debate. As Gebler points out, in a society
where each side is convinced it knows what the other one thinks, even to
point out that there are legitimate grounds of debate requires courage. If
you have not been watching Plain Tales, there is just one part left. Anyone
who has will surely agree that this series has made a significant
contribution to helping outsiders see the people of Ulster more clearly and
sympathetically.
As everyone knows, Hitler was an incorrigible showman. This week's
fascinating Timewatch: The Mother of All Battles (BBC 2, Wednesday),
provided yet another example of Hitler's extraordinary propensity to turn
life into theatre. A German general recalled the meeting with Hitler on July
1, 1943, four days before the start of the epic Battle of Kursk in the
Ukraine.
It was a conflict months in the preparation that was to claim more
casualties than the entire British losses during the second world war. The
generals stood in a semi-circle, waiting for their Supreme Commander to
discuss the battle plan. Hitler strode in and stared each man in turn full
in the eye and then, without a word, strode out. The stunned generals could
only think that Hitler must have been reenacting a famous painting of
Frederick II, addressing his commanders on the eve of battle. Who said
something about hearing the word culture and reaching for a revolver?

The idea of a documentary about traffic jams is hardly more appealing than a
programme about having teeth descaled at the hygienist. However, tonight's
Inside Story: Traffic Jam (BBC 1, 9.30), holds out the lure of providing
answers to the questions that circle mantra-like in the numbed mind of the
impotent driver. Why do roadworks take so long? Why is there never anyone
working in the closed lane?
As every admirer of Anthony Trollope knows, John Major, the prime minister,
is a character who could step straight out of a Trollope novel. On Bookmark:
The Trollopians (BBC 2, 8.00), the prime minister has more to say about his
affection for the novelist. ScreenPlay: The Vision Thing (BBC 2, 9.25) is an
entertaining satire on a premier in touch with the Almighty.
Years ago I was told that chips are full of vitamin C so it has always been
a surprise to hear people inveighing against children eating chips. Perhaps
Eat Up (C4, 8.30), the new series on the eating habits of the modern child,
will explain the position.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Arts: Matthus's 'Song of Love and Death' - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glyndebourne Touring Opera's production of Cornet Christoph Rilke's Song of
Love and Death, the first opera by Siegfried Matthus to be mounted in
Britain, completes the repertory of the company's autumn season. Much
excitement and many high hopes have been stirred by the project. The
experience itself surpasses them all.
I know of few things in life more exhilarating than the first encounter with
a contemporary operatic 'voice' capable of singing out truly, effectively,
involvingly, and with its own clear-cut theatrical identity. In Cornet Rilke
Matthus reveals, it seems to me, exactly that sort of voice; I hope the
British opera-going public can be enticed to Sadler's Wells - or any of the
other sojourn-points on the GTO tour plan - to undertake their own first
encounter with it, and to share in the exhilaration.
This 59-year-old German (formerly East German) has eight operas to his
credit; Cornet Rilke (1985), his fifth, is already his most frequently
performed. In these columns last Saturday Andrew Clark charted the progress
of Matthus's career (much of it spent as resident creator for the Komische
Oper in the former East Berlin) and outlined both the general
characteristics of his compositional persona and the particular ones of a
90-minute 'opera vision' drawn from a famous prose-poem by Rainer Maria
Rilke and written for bomb-destroyed Dresden.
My colleague touched on the marriage of hard practicality, questing
imagination and highly personal yet approachable musicality that goes to
make up the Matthus persona. GTO's account of Cornet Rilke bears him out in
every particular. On the simplest level this is real opera, not a musicked
play or some other kind of music-theatre conception inadequately founded on
musical vision.
At every point the music sets the theatrical agenda, intervenes, sums up,
carries the impulse forward; there is no question of the text (a fascinating
Rilke adaptation by the composer) existing independently. The score, and
therefore the drama, take their tone from Matthus's extraordinarily
distinctive and beautiful writing for an 11-person chamber-orchestra and
vocally far-flung (but never over-extended) chorus.
On paper the choice of instruments may seem quirky or modish - horn (in some
ways the protagonist of the whole show), flutes, harps, electric guitars,
and a big battery of percussion. Not in the theatre. Animated by tingling
metal, punctuated by guitar and harp flourishes, and personalised by
ruefully lyrical wind and horn, the scoring lacks the sustaining strength of
strings. Intentionally so: as the opera deals with the hallucinatory
vitality and disconnectedness of war, the sound embodies the theme.
Alternations of fast- and slow-moving stage activity, clothed in a musical
language that will alarm no one comfortable with the later Mahler symphonies
or the late-Romantic attitudes to tonality of Britten and Shostakovich,
possess a comparably picaresque absence of surface logic. Yet, just as the
full span of Matthus's scenes is traceable to a single eight-note tone-row,
so the diversity of his war-vision is similarly based on a thematic unity.
To the opera's stripling hero - played by two Cherubino-like mezzo-sopranos,
representing respectively his outer and inner existence - war brings
vigorous, courage-testing life but also sudden, meaningless death.
For all its late-Romantic musical patina this is an intensely modern work.
To that modernity the GTO production team - producer Aidan Lang, designer
Lez Brotherston, lighting by Davy Cunningham, movement Stuart Hopps - have
responded with enthralling boldness: their staging proves full of
kaleidoscopically vivid imagery created by elliptically mobile screens,
sudden foreshortenings of physicality in chorus and principals and
economically-stated bursts of colour.
The flaws, on Monday, were a barrage of stage noise and a shortage of
intelligible English words (Bernard Jacobson's translation is used) - but
musically there was always sufficient compensation. Conducted by Martin
Andre, the show boasts outstanding instrumental and choral delivery, a crisp
concentration in pace, and admirable confidence in the solo voice parts.
In an ideal world Matthus's laconically sensuous combination of female
timbres is probably achieved with voices of more naturally sumptuous
quality. That said, the accomplishments of Julie Unwin and Beverly Mills
(the two mezzo Rilkes) at the head of a cast including Edith Pritchard,
Eirian Davies, Peter Savidge and David Thomas deserve high praise.
In sum, and as Don Giovanni might say, 'Bravo, bravo, arcibravo]' to
Glyndebourne Touring Opera. And this is the company the Arts Council is
threatening with extinction . . .

FT  06 OCT 93 / Arts: A pianist, and some pianos - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Twenty years ago, Martin Jones's recordings of Busoni piano music made a
fine impression. Those of us who thought Busoni's 'modernism' hugely
overrated by an earlier generation were stirred nonetheless by the pianist's
sharply musical commitment, and his stinging polish. Since then Jones has
become an 'academic' pianist: 17 years as pianist-in residence at University
College, Cardiff and now a Guildhall professor, recording the 'complete'
Mendelssohn, Debussy and Percy Grainger and doing the occasional concert.
He gave an occasional concert in the Wigmore Hall on Monday. The programme,
appealingly off-beat - early, mostly unfamiliar Debussy and Szymanowski,
noble but low-profile Mendelssohn and Ravel, a pair of Alun Hoddinott
sonatas - attracted the tiniest of audiences. It included, however, a lady
with multitudinous plastic bags (but not necessarily a bag-lady), searching
noisily among them for some nameless thing while Jones began the limpid
Andante of Hoddinott's 10th Sonata - and then, interminably, folding them up
again. Jones displayed admirable restraint by simply giving up, remarking
that he was trying to 'create a quiet atmosphere', and asking was she
THROUGH?
Shades of the old Wigmore, when audiences were often so sparse that anybody
could wander in] . . . but Jones was playing below his best commanding form.
In Mendelssohn's Variations Serieuses and Ravel's lean Valses nobles et
sentimentales, his indulgent pedalling left harmonic smudges that would have
offended both composers' ears. (Though Chopin called the pedal 'the soul of
the piano', on all the evidence British pedal-training remains even now the
crudest in Europe.)
Despite that, Jones secured a broad, expressive arc for Mendelssohn's
faultlessly crafted set, and in Ravel's svelte, exacerbated fantasies he
struck to the heart of the matter again and again. It is some while since
I've heard the second Waltz sound truly haunting, or some of the later ones
pointfully distraites - as Jones rendered them here. All that one missed was
his super-accurate pounce of old (there were a lot of finger-slips, and in
Ravel even some ingrained misreadings), and his old high-definition attack.
He should spend much more time performing, and less on academically
'interesting' stuff.
He played on a Steinway, presumably the Wigmore's own. I stand rebuked by
the Wigmore director's letter-to-the Editor last week: the Nash Ensemble
pianist did not play the Hall's 'big, booming Bosendorfer', but the
Steinway. In the absence of any programme-warning to the contrary, I
supposed that he must have that Bosendorfer under his hands. How else could
a pianist so adept at adjusting to string-colleagues' dynamics find himself
swallowing them up instead?
It would be wrong to claim that the big new Bosendorfer must make everybody
sound opaquely loud, for (as the Wigmore's William Lyne has protested) some
pianists have been able to make it sing - in the Viennese repertoire. For
pianists with different specialities, and for chamber-players, it needs more
practised handling than they can afford; but that is no peculiar fault. Many
Francophile pianists and Liszt exponents love their Bechsteins (and in
America, their gentle Baldwin cousins too), despite perennial difficulties
with keeping their pearly trebles in good order.
Though European Steinways are good all-rounders, many European pianists find
American-made Steinways designed for gross, clangorous noise. (When Alicia
de Larrocha complained to a local American piano-technician that she could
not make soft repeated-notes sound, as in Ravel's Gaspard, he explained
cheerfully that she had to do it like this] - stabbing one note repeatedly
and rapidly with his thumb: not really a feasible option.) It would have
been nice to hear Jones striving harder to light up his piano-sound in
detail, and not just relying upon his chunky, virile grasp of the whole
keyboard, whatever its brand-name.

FT  06 OCT 93 / People: Jefferies - ear for tenants' grouses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Some 500,000 housing association tenants in England will soon have someone
new to complain to if they are unhappy with the management of their homes.
Roger Jefferies, chief executive of the London borough of Croydon until
March, will become the first housing association tenants' ombudsman on
November 1.
Jefferies, 53, should be able to offer a particularly sympathetic ear to
tenants' grouses. A qualified solicitor, he is author of Tackling the Town
Hall, published in 1982, about ways in which citizens could complain about
or appeal against their local authorities.
After leaving Oxford, Jefferies entered local government as an articled
clerk with Coventry city council. Having qualified as a solicitor, he became
assistant town clerk at Southend-on-Sea in 1968. In 1970, he was appointed
operations director for the London borough of Hammersmith, becoming chief
executive of the west London borough of Hounslow in 1975.
In 1990, Jefferies moved to Croydon, taking early retirement three years
later during a reorganisation of the council's management structure. At the
time, he was London's longest serving local authority chief executive.
Between 1983 and 1985, Jefferies was seconded to the Department of the
Environment where he was under secretary responsible for planning and land
use policy. He was president of the Society of Local Authority Chief
Executives in 1990-91, the period during which the poll tax was introduced,
and its abolition announced after the fall of Lady Thatcher.
As ombudsman, he will be armed with statutory powers given by parliament to
the Housing Corporation, the quango that regulates the housing associations
that receive government grant. However, he will operate independently of the
corporation, so that he is not bound by its policy in dealing with tenants'
complaints.
Jefferies says he is looking forward to setting up the new service, and to
working with the interesting variety of organisations that make up the
housing association movement.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Business and the Environment: Big guns to fire green shells
 -Companies meet in Paris on Friday hoping to form an environmental pressure
group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business initiatives on the environment are proliferating. The latest - and
possibly most ambitious - gets under way this Friday when executives from 90
large companies gather in Paris under the auspices of the World Industry
Council for the Environment (WICE).
They hope to forge a common position on a series of green issues, from trade
and technology to the role of the financial markets in conveying the
environmental message. The resulting position papers will then form the
basis of a drive to influence the international environmental debate.
The 90 companies come from 21 countries and include names such as AT&amp;T,
Johnson &amp; Johnson, Texaco, Sony, ICI, Volkswagen and Rhone-Poulenc. 'It's a
good list,' says Rodney Chase, the managing director of British Petroleum
who is chairman of the group.
WICE was formed by the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce in the
wake of last year's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro as a way of addressing
issues which had an international, rather than just a national, relevance.
The positions have been prepared by task forces using the technical
expertise of the companies involved, and bear the stamp of their
managements.
One of the concerns which prompted it was that the global environmental
debate launched at Rio would influence national government policies before
business had a chance to have its own say. These policies could affect
competition, the use of resources and the spread of technology, businessmen
thought.
Much of WICE's work will be concerned with striking balances, for example
between environmental standards and the flow of trade, or between regulation
and cost, and even between population growth and living standards. 'We want
to ensure that the Rio initiatives are not at the expense of expanding world
trade,' says Chase.
He cites as an example the recommendations that WICE is proposing to make to
governments on the use of incentive regulation to promote environmental
standards. Governments should be clear about their objectives, they should
estimate the cost and be satisfied that the economy can stand it. They
should not try to prescribe the answer, but should set a sensible timetable
and then stick to it.
'On all these issues we should have a quality position or we shouldn't say
anything,' says Chase, who admits that the danger is that WICE's utterances
will be diluted to meet the lowest common denominator of its members. But he
adds: 'If it wasn't important for BP, we wouldn't be doing it.'
Chase is in broad agreement with the items on the global environmental
agenda, and sees WICE's role as trying to establish priorities. 'They (the
items) are set by world concern,' he says.
His personal priorities centre on the impact of what he calls 'late 20th
century consumerism': the problems of short-lived commodities which generate
waste which stays around for a long time.
'We are not trying to understand and plan for the consequences of population
growth,' he says. 'There is a trade-off between economic growth and its
impact on the environment. But the trade-off has not been calculated or
managed.
'We should have a business plan. We should establish priorities on where to
spend money and brainpower. The debate on climate change will be a good
example.' Science has a lot to contribute to ways of curbing pollution, and
promoting sustainable development.
Chase believes the business community has 'upped its game' on the
environment. 'It's patchy, but moving in the right direction. Environmental
agendas are more deep-seated in company plans than many people realise.
Unfortunately, this is not as well matched by the image.
'Companies which can combine environmental performance with good business
should flourish.'
But there is also an attitude in the business world which says that
environmental regulation is OK, so long as companies can pass the cost on to
their customers.
One question WICE will doubtless prompt in business minds is: why yet
another action group? We already have the Geneva-based Business Council for
Sustainable Development which published the widely read book Changing Course
describing the environmental experience of its 50 blue-chip company members,
and is now working on a number of post-Rio assignments.
'I don't know enough to know why those other initiatives have not satisfied
our members,' comments Chase, cautiously.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Business and the Environment: Recycling begins at home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RWE, the German energy-based conglomerate, Greenpeace, the environmental
pressure group, and paper recyclers in the UK have one thing in common: they
want German waste exports to stop.
In the case of RWE, based in Dusseldorf, the motivation is money. About to
start building one of the largest waste recycling plants in Europe, the
company wants to be sure it will find enough customers. The success of the
project is pinned on the introduction of EC-wide waste requirements which
would destroy the incentive of German companies to dump their waste abroad.
At the moment, recycling in Germany (or paying for landfill space) costs a
local company more than transporting and recycling (or dumping) waste
material abroad. Foreign destinations can be just across the border in
France, or as far away as Asia, with returning cargo ships charging
relatively little for transport. Turning used steel into scrap, for example,
costs an estimated DM600 (Pounds 240) per tonne in Germany compared with
DM250 in France, according to analysts.
The tendency of German companies to export their waste, often circumventing
labelling requirements, has led to a string of scandals. Michael Stock,
director of the plant which RWE plans to build, believes the only solution
to curb such practices is an EC-wide waste disposal regime.
RWE is betting one will be in place by the end of the century. And it wants
to offer the most modern and cost-advantageous recycling technology to
German and other European companies faced with it. 'Our aim is to operate
the most modern recycling plant in Europe by the time German producers can
no longer export their waste,' he explains.
The project will regroup three plants dealing with 60,000 tonnes a year of
toxic waste (such as fats, oil-contaminated substances and paints), 80,000
tonnes of scrap metal and 40,000 tonnes of biological waste (such as
contaminated water from sewage or agricultural lands). Thyssen Handelsunion,
the diversified trading arm of the Thyssen conglomerate, is co-investor.
As part of the project, RWE also plans to develop the know-how and
technologies to rehabilitate contaminated soils.
The plants should be operational by 1998, after a four-year construction
period starting next year. Local authorities in Duisburg, which studied the
project for three years, are expected to give the final go-ahead in the
spring.
While the project will be a considerable boost for local enterprises, which
are expected to provide 48 per cent of the DM600m investment, it will not
offer many jobs to offset the rising levels of unemployment in the
traditional coal-and-steel Ruhr region. Fully computerised, the entire
'centre' will be operated by 180 people at most.
The project also offers an example of how energy groups in Germany are
moving towards becoming large, indispensable players in the recycling
industry. Smaller recyclers were prompted to complain to the Federal Cartel
Office in Berlin early this year about this trend.
But with the success of Germany's strict recycling models at stake and with
a dearth of local recycling capacity to make them work, the cartel office
has kept silent.

UK Detention Services, the private prison company that last week attracted
Michael Quinlan, 51, former director of the US Federal Bureau of Prisons, to
its board, is strengthening its management with a second US appointment.
LT (by which he is known) Brown is to become director of operations for UK
Detention Services, which manages Blakenhurst Prison, Redditch. After 22
years in the US public prison service, Brown joined Corrections Corporation
of America, a US private prison operator, in 1988. CCA is, with John Mowlem
and Sir Robert McAlpine, a partner in UK Detention Services.
David Brooke, who joined UK Detention Services as director of Blakenhurst
this year, is to become director of business development. He has a long
career in the British public prison system, including serving as governor of
Wormwood Scrubs, London, and on HM Inspectorate of Prisons.
The new director of Blakenhurst will be Bernard Higgins, who spent 14 years
as a governor in the British public prison service before joining UK
Detention Services.
Although there are currently only two privately run prisons, the government
is committed to extending private management to about 10 per cent of the
system. Potential private sector operators are strengthening their
management teams with experienced recruits from the public sector and
overseas.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Business and the Environment: Timber watchdog ready to bark
 -The launch of the Forest Stewardship Council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's first independent body which will help control the trade in
forest products, the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), will be operating
within a year.
This emerged at an assembly in Toronto, Canada, at the weekend, following a
tortuous two-year process that brought together business, environmental and
human rights groups from around the world.
But the effectiveness of the FSC is already in doubt after some influential
western environmental pressure groups, including Greenpeace and Friends of
the Earth, withdrew their support in protest, when business was granted
voting rights and seats on the FSC board. 'It is a dangerous and unnecessary
compromise to involve industry in the process of determining the
environmental standards by which industry is judged. We have withdrawn from
the FSC because it has accorded industry such a decision-making role,' said
Simon Counsell, forests campaigner at Friends of the Earth.
The FSC was set up to verify the authenticity of environmental claims made
by producers of forest products. Such assurances - that wood products and
wood pulp come from sustainable forests - have grown, following widespread
concern about the destruction of the world's forests.
The idea behind the FSC was ambitious and its creation has been difficult.
Organisers, including the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF), the US-based
Woodworkers' Alliance for Rainforest Protection, non-governmental
organisations from around the world and business, have had to create a body
that reflects the conflicting interests of social, economic and
environmental groups from rich and poor countries.
The Toronto meeting divided itself into three factions, representing
environmental campaigners, human rights groups and business interests. But
even within these groups there were splits. A Brazilian environmental
coalition, for example, refused to support the arguments of Greenpeace and
Friends of the Earth.
'We are in uncharted waters, but we have definitely taken an important step
forward in verifying certification. We have got a compromise. Industry has a
say but it does not have control of the FSC,' said Francis Sullivan,
forestry officer at WWF UK.
'The writing is on the wall for those among the timber trade who do not pay
attention to the social and environmental issues affecting their business,'
he said. Torbjorn Sjodin, project manager for forest and timber at the Ikea
furniture retailer, said the formation of the FSC was good news for his
company, its employees and the customers.
'It means a lot to us. The FSC is unique because it has brought together
social groups, environmental groups and business,' he said.
Mark Eisen, manager of environmental marketing at Home Depot, the US's
biggest home improvement chain, said the FSC will help its company's policy
of buying wood products from properly managed forests.
'The FSC will legitimise the process of certification. It will clear some of
the uncertainties felt by our suppliers. It will give us more credibility in
our efforts to get our supplies from sustainable sources,' he said.
Alan Knight, environmental co-ordinator at B&amp;Q, the UK's biggest DIY chain,
was on the FSC's interim board. He hopes the environmental groups will
eventually support the council.
'For the first time it has been shown that enlightened environmental
organisations and the trade can share the same objectives in achieving
socially beneficial and environmentally benign forestry.'
But some of the more extreme environmental campaigners do not agree.
Rosalind Reeve, a consultant to the German-based Rettet den Regenwald, said:
'At best the FSC initiative is naive, at worst it provides a framework for
the timber industry to achieve a much-desired green veneer and defuse
pressure to attack the real issues of illegal trade, indigenous peoples'
rights and overconsumption.'

FT  06 OCT 93 / Management: Japan keeps up the pressure - Competitiveness is
still improving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ

<TEXT>
If, like many western managers, you are heaving a sigh of relief at all the
current cases of recession-hit trauma in Japanese industry, you should look
again - and worry.
A few fat multinationals in Tokyo and Osaka may be suffering - with their
suppliers hurting, too - but many medium-sized Japanese companies with
sizeable export ratios are responding to recession by raising still further
their already daunting competitiveness.
They are doing so, not through the sort of quantum-leap 're-engineering'
which has become fashionable in the US and Europe, but by maintaining their
traditional commitment to 'kaizen' or 'continuous improvement' on every
front: in the 'time-to-market' of new products; in speed of manufacture and
delivery; in stock turn rates; and in their cost and total productivity
levels. This strategy is effective, since most Japanese manufacturers start
from a higher level of efficiency and effectiveness than their western
rivals.
These are the main messages to emerge from a late summer research trip to
Japan by a consultant who is helping Britain's Department of Industry
organise a series of high-level autumn 'benchmarking brunches' on how
manufacturing companies can learn from Japanese best practice. Starting at
the end of this month in Newcastle as part of the DTI's Priority Japan
campaign, they will also be held in Reading and Birmingham*.
Mark Smalley, who heads PA Consulting's Midlands office, as well as acting
as one of its chief Japan watchers, studied a sample of eight
export-orientated companies of similar size and sector to many UK
enterprises. Most employ between 1,000 and 2,000 people. Their industries
include pumps, compressors, electronics components and test equipment, cycle
parts, and materials handling equipment.
His many conclusions include the following:
Almost every company spends heavily on product development and production
plant.
Although product life cycles are now being lengthened in some Japanese
industries - a move which has given false comfort to some of their western
competitors - the time required to develop new products is being shortened
further, as companies postpone their design decisions as late as possible.
One of the study companies has cut its already rapid development cycle by 50
per cent over the past three years.
Almost every company is slashing still further its order-to-delivery cycle
for products and services, whether they are standard or customised items. In
one instance, this has been cut from seven to two days over a period of
several years, in another from four months to one. Logistics and production
improvements are rife. Since 1991, one company has raised its annual stock
turn from 13 to 14.3 times, while another has gone from 6.25 to 7.8. A third
has climbed from eight to 12 times since 1989. One company now makes a
sophisticated calculation of the optimum trade-off between stock turns and
shorter delivery times.
Companies are looking for annual increases in total productivity of about 10
per cent. More ambitiously, one has aimed for some time to make its unit
cost improvements track the surge in the yen-dollar exchange rate. With two
exceptions, the eight companies have raised sales-per-employee by between a
fifth and two-thirds over the past four years.
Overall, Smalley says the companies are placing even greater emphasis than
before on collaboration between marketing, sales, design, engineering and
production. 'They don't use phrases such as 'marketing-led',' he comments.
'They see everything having to work together.'
The half-day 'benchmarking brunches', for up to 100 participants at a time,
will differ from many DTI initiatives, in that they will be aimed at
leading-edge UK companies as well as average performers. In addition to
presentations from top industrialists, the events will include workshops led
by academics in three areas: closeness to market, production and logistics.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Management: Same formula, different race - What can managers
learn from sportsmen? Jackie Stewart and his son Paul tell Tim Dickson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Damon Hill may be British motor racing's most famous son. But 27-year-old
Paul Stewart, whose father Jackie scored 27 Grand Prix victories in his
time, is fast proving to be another chip off the old block.
Young Stewart is no all-conquering driver just yet - he is currently seventh
in this year's Formula 3000 championship, the class below Formula One. But
what marks him out for special attention is Paul Stewart Racing, the company
he founded with his father in 1988.
On first acquaintance it is not an exceptional business. It runs several
cars, employs around 45 people at offices and workshops in Milton Keynes,
and besides Formula 3000 concentrates on racing in two other 'formative'
classes, Vauxhall Lotus and Formula Three. Like other motor racing teams its
income - in excess of Pounds 3.2m this year - is dependent on corporate
sponsors.
What distinguishes Paul Stewart Racing in a sector notoriously short of good
management talent is the rare commercial flair of its celebrated founder. He
is now passing this on to his son. Professional sportsmen often earn a
living from their admiring contacts or dining out on past glories - but
relatively few develop genuine business careers or can claim to have
established and grown a new venture. Jackie Stewart is one of them.
The three-times world championship winner has brought to his son's company
some of the lessons which sport can teach businessmen - sound preparation,
good teamwork and the like. But he has also applied his experiences of
commercial life gained over 10 years at the wheel of a Formula One car. 'As
a professional sportsman I had the privilege of working with some of the
best business and technical brains in the world,' says Stewart senior. 'I
learnt a lot about marketing, generating enthusiasm and the importance of
communication.'
Appreciation of risk - a skill which comes in useful in business as well as
at speeds of more than 200mph - could also be added to the list. 'I survived
as a driver by minimising the downside risks, meticulously analysing those
that were worth taking and those that weren't,' explains Stewart senior.
'In a sports business like ours there's no puffing up a balance sheet to
disguise short-term performance. Either you win or you don't, that's what
it's about.'
At the heart of the company's philosophy is a belief that talent on the
track should be matched by professionalism off it. Take Stewart senior's
ideas on the increasingly competitive and cut-throat world of corporate
sponsorship.
'Sponsorship is almost an obsolete word,' he explains, outlining how it now
goes well beyond dangling a bit of media exposure in front of a few motor
racing enthusiast chairmen. 'What it's really about is bringing people
together.'
With the 31 sponsors, many of them Scottish-based, effectively the
'shareholders' - among them Highland Spring, the Marshall Food Group, Bank
of Scotland and the Forte hotel group - Stewart works hard to provide a
worthwhile 'return'. Companies get their names on the cars and a chance to
invite clients and employees to races. But the most interesting part of the
'dividend' - and the one Stewart claims gives the company an edge - is the
potential business to be won in the sponsorship group.
Neil Kirby, deputy general manager of Forte's Grosvenor House Hotel in
London, says the group is stocking Highland Spring thanks to a meeting
arranged by Stewart, while conference and hotel business has come its way
from other members of the 'network'. David Paterson of Bank of Scotland does
not expect to win vast numbers of new accounts or deposits, but underlines
Stewart's readiness to make introductions and says this may produce a more
tangible return to the bank than merely having its name emblazoned on the
side of a car.
If Paul Stewart Racing could teach some businesses a trick or two about
pleasing 'shareholders', the company is no slouch when it comes to staff
development. Its 'staircase of talent' idea may sound like something out of
a management consultancy brochure, yet it neatly reflects the view that
drivers and mechanics can be 'grown' through experience in all three
formulas. With unprecedented Formula Three and Vauxhall Lotus championship
wins for the team this season the drivers have excelled on the track. But
away from it each one is trained in public speaking, both to represent and
entertain sponsors at events.
'Today they understand that they are part of a service industry. And service
means, being where the sponsors want them, dressed appropriately, ready,
willing and able to talk about the investor's business,' explains Paul.
Modern management thinking, indeed, trips off young and old tongues alike
with Stewart senior particularly obsessed by change. 'I've seen the goal
posts move so much with the Japanese motor industry,' he says before
delivering an image of the British motorcycle industry unlikely to be found
in any business school textbook.
'It is not as if they were shot in the back by a high-powered rifle from a
great distance, nor stabbed from behind a curtain on a dark night. They died
in their own beds, asleep, suffocated by their pillows.'
A recent example of their own challenges came when a rival team developed a
chassis which threatened their early season lead in the Formula Three
championship (which their driver subsequently won). 'We decided to get a
different car, which was not only very expensive. With the championship
slipping away we also had to learn quickly to engineer it and adapt to it.'
Paul Stewart Racing aims to reduce its dependency on sponsorship income
through diversification and is trying to exploit the expertise it has so far
developed in telemetry - the use of radio waves to transmit readings and
measurements of instruments to a recording device. It has no proprietary
technology, but its 'racing mentality' is attracting the interest of Ford's
North American vehicle dynamic engineers.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Management: Shorter low-fat lunches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The days when staff ate spam and chips in the canteen and directors had rack
of lamb in their own dining room are long gone.
In the modern canteen, directors sit next to cleaners, and they eat a
subsidised, healthy lunch washed down with soft drink in a smoke-free
environment. And both regard this mid-day meal as being one of the most
important perks of the job.
This rosy view of lunching at work emerges from a survey* of British mangers
which was carried out jointly by Director magazine and Compass Services, a
catering company.
The survey finds that nine out of 10 directors think that it is iniquitous
for directors and staff to eat separately; in a similar number of companies,
segregated dining has been scrapped completely.
In only 8 per cent of British companies is it possible to have an alcoholic
tipple over lunch, and in only 5 per cent is smoking unrestricted.
Directors not only pay lip service to their classless canteen, they actually
use it. Two-thirds of the directors eat in their canteens frequently, while
85 per cent believe that the long business lunch out at a restaurant is a
thing of the past.
However, the clean-living egalitarian lunch is better established in some
areas than others.
Blue-collar workers are still offered processed, fatty food, as fewer than
half of their companies have any policy on making food in the canteen more
healthy.
By contrast, 80 per cent of employers in the service sectors have healthy
eating programmes, encouraging employees to eat as many fresh vegetables as
they care to.
The vast majority of companies provide subsided or free meals, and despite
the effects of recession, almost none plans to make staff pay more for their
meals.
In return, companies felt they were buying better staff morale, higher
productivity and shorter lunch-breaks.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Recruitment: The source of effective innovation - Why the
setting of clear-cut goals when seeking new business ideas can end in little
net profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUITE who first cut spiral grooves up the inside of a musket barrel in
Germany 500 years ago, nobody knows. Nor, while the longer and more accurate
shots resulting from the 'rifling' grooves led others to follow suit, did
anybody then know why the new rifles outperformed smooth-bore guns.
So in 1547 the Archbishop of Mainz did an experiment to find out. He got
riflemen to fire at targets with two sets of bullets. One set was made of
silver, almost as sacred as gold by religious tenets, and the rest of unholy
lead. The lead bullets hit the bull far more often than the silver, which
mostly fell short. Why?
The conclusion now would be that the bullets made of silver, a hard metal,
resisted the grooves of the rifling and so were held back; whereas the soft
lead kind yielded to the grooves, taking on the spin which did the trick.
But that wasn't what the Archbishop concluded from the experiment.
His conclusion was that rifle bullets must be guided by devils. And that -
in a society which believed the air was filled with invisible angels and
demons fighting one another - served as a perfectly scientific explanation.
What brings the said episode to the Jobs column's mind is an uncanny
coincidence which may betoken that I'm being guided by something (although
which side of the fight it's on is another question). The sequence began at
Spain's Instituto de Empresa management school, when I was hearing about the
way the school teaches would-be top executives how to be successful
innovators. The method is first to analyse markets to find a niche for a new
product, then devise a product to fit the niche.
The description of same reminded me of some research into the matter which
I'd reported, as I thought, about four years ago. So on returning I leafed
back to January 1989, only to draw blank. That meant a long search, which
miffed me because I wanted to get on with reading about a fairly new
development in psychology I'd chanced upon, called reversal theory.
Among its suggestions is that, when taking action, people can be in either
of two distinct frames of mind. In one of them, which the theory terms the
telic state, the action is undertaken solely as a means to some pre-set end.
For example, when the goal of passing an examination causes you to delve
into a textbook, you are reading in a telic way.
The other kind of action, termed paratelic, consists of things you do simply
because you want to do them. When you get the feeling that you'd like to
read and settle down with a book, you're reading in a paratelic way,
probably with no clearer goal than just to see what happens.
Moreover, while we can change (or 'reverse') from one to the other, we tend
to be either telic- or paratelic-biased in our actions.
But, as I said, my own reading of the theory was interrupted by the hunt for
the research report, which turned out to date from 1987. The study, by Dr
Rolf Berth, was of 73 successful innovations in companies. It found that
only nine of them had been achieved by the method, essentially telic, taught
in the Spanish school. The rest resulted from someone just having an idea
and developing it to see what happened.
After reporting as much in the 1987 article, I went on to hazard a guess
that folk with the clear-cut ambition needed to climb to the top of
companies 'have minds which operate in fundamentally different ways from
those of effective innovators'. Hence my feeling of awe on returning to the
book on the theory, and reading of a trial in which some telic-biased people
and others with a paratelic bias were individually set to work on a problem
while wired to a device measuring the electrical activity in their brains.
Not only was the activity greater in the paratelics' case, but the pattern
differed. Their whole brain was directed towards a single focus, whereas the
telics seemed to be applying different bits of their brain in separate
directions. Gorblimey]
That is unfortunately all I can tell you about the theory until I've learned
more. Even so, it's surely enough to raise a question about the widespread
belief that the best way to run a company is to fill all its influential
positions with people of the decisive, goal-orientated telic mentality.
Doesn't it smack of the sort of belief which led the Archbishop to his
conclusion about rifle bullets?N
OW to the table below, which gives the going rates of pay for British
managers as shown by the Reward company's latest six-monthly survey. Anyone
wanting to know more about it should contact Vivienne Copeland at Reward
House, Diamond Way, Stone, Staffordshire ST15 0SD; tel (0)785 813566, fax

My extracts relate solely to managers just below director. To update to
October 1, all pay figures should be increased by 0.44 per cent. Regional
variations from the median base salary of Pounds 31,058 were: higher -
London by 16 per cent, Scotland by 6.8, South-east England by 3.0, and
Northern Ireland by 0.2; lower - South-west England by 1.9 per cent, West
Midlands by 3.2, North-east by 6.1, North-west by 7.2, and Eastern counties
by 8.8.
Variations by company turnover were: higher - Pounds 500m-plus by 41.9 per
cent, Pounds 200m-500m by 12.8, Pounds 100m-200m by 10.5, Pounds 50m-100m by
4.3; lower - Pounds 20m-Pounds 50m by 2.6 per cent, Pounds 10m-Pounds 20m by
3.2, Pounds 3m-10m by 10.7, and under Pounds 3m by 15.9.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Mountain bikes that go beneath the sea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSMANCHE Link, the contractor building the Channel tunnel, has resorted
to pedal power to transport workers through the underground construction
site.
In a move designed to minimise delays, the consortium has purchased 200
mountain bikes so that workers can cycle along the tunnel.
The decision was prompted by concerns that productivity was being hit by
delays and congestion on the motorised shuttles which currently ferry
workers underground.
The bicycles, with 21 gears and specially designed tyres, are available at
six points along the service tunnel between the two main rail shafts.
Before using them, workers must pass a cycling test and carry a 'riding
licence' while underground.
The consortium bought 125 bicycles from manufacturers in Britain and 80 from
France.
The bikes supplied to UK contractors have been hand-built by Saracen, the
Warwick-based bicycle manufacturer, and coated in titanium to withstand
conditions beneath the seabed.

FT  06 OCT 93 / TUC says unions help competitiveness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TRADE unionism
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'a great British invention' - can help employers become more competitive,
according to the Trades Union Congress in evidence to a forthcoming
parliamentary inquiry into the future of organised labour.
The TUC document, which has been submitted to the House of Commons
employment committee, argues that collective bargaining offers economies of
scale and time to the employer by simplifying the fixing of terms and
conditions of employment.
It is particularly economical in large companies and 'minimises resentment
caused by distinguishing between individual workers'.
The document says strong collective bargaining systems give employers the
flexibility to meet local needs or market conditions. 'In practice, in
workplaces unions work in partnership with employers,' it says.
The TUC also argues that change in the workplace is less difficult to
achieve when unions have a key role. 'They bring expertise to the process
and help prevent problems.'
Union involvement means the introduction of new information technologies can
be achieved more efficiently and with fewer problems.
The TUC denies any inherent conflict between capital and labour in the
workplace. Although unions are independent of an employer this 'does not
imply a division of loyalties. It does not follow that trade unionists are
less committed to their company than other employees.'
The document recognises the structural changes taking place in the British
labour market. These include a shift from manufacturing to services; the
growth of employment in multinational companies and small companies; the
deregulation of work; a tight legal framework; a larger female workforce and
greater pay inequality.
'The typical worker of the nineties is likely to be a part-time woman worker
whose employment is casual or semi-casual, working for a company whose own
status is that of a sub-contracted or franchise operation,' it says.
However, it argues that the 'basic rationale' for unions remains the same.
'They are needed now more than ever to ensure workers get a fair deal.
Workers in unions earn better wages, have better conditions and are better
protected against arbitrary employer action.'

FT  06 OCT 93 / Poor basic skills 'cost Pounds 10.2bn each year'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POOR BASIC skills, part-icularly illiteracy, are costing the UK Pounds
10.2bn each year, according to a report by management consultants Ernst &amp;
Young.
The report says industry could save up to Pounds 8.4bn if basic skills were
improved. Ernst &amp; Young's estimates are based on a Gallup poll of 400 large
companies conducted earlier this year for the Adult Literacy and Basic
Skills Unit and grossed up to take account of companies of all sizes.
The total annual cost of rectifying customer orders despatched incorrectly
estimated at Pounds 4.3bn, while the cost of cancelled orders was put at
Pounds 1.6bn and the cost of customers lost through errors Pounds 1.5bn.
Poor basic skills also affect recruitment. According to Ernst &amp; Young,
companies could save Pounds 300m a year by shedding staff if basic skills
were better, while the cost of recruiting employees whose problems with
literacy and numeracy limit their chances of promotion is estimated at
Pounds 600m.
Ernst &amp; Young say areas of savings for the public purse would include the
penal system, because 45 per cent of those under 30 in prison have no
educational qualifications, more than double the figure for the population
as a whole.
Mr David Rees, of Ernst &amp; Young, added that the lack of skilled staff in the
UK was a 'major concern of potential investors'.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Plans to tax lottery proceeds attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LOTTERY Promotion Company, backed by eight economists, will next week
attack the government's national lottery plans.
The aim is to 'improve' the Lottery Bill before it receives royal assent
early next month and make sure more of the proceeds go to good causes.
The company has been campaigning for the national lottery, which could be a
Pounds 4bn to Pounds 5bn business, to be a charitable foundation.
Mr Denis Vaughan, the company's executive director, yesterday said: 'Big
business - and the Treasury - are going to make hundreds of millions profit
from a lottery designed for the benefit of the country.'
The company argues against the Treasury imposing a 12 per cent tax on the
lottery's proceeds.
'The economists point out the only reason for a monopoly lottery is to
maximise funding for good causes,' said Mr Vaughan. 'Therefore the lottery
should be untaxed.'

FT  06 OCT 93 / BP sells orimulsion stake to Venezuela
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum is to sell its 50 per cent stake in the company which
markets orimulsion, a bitumen-based substance which has been labelled by
environmentalists as the world's dirtiest fuel.
The disposal of its share in BP Bitor will be welcomed by the UK coal lobby
which sees orimulsion as a growing threat in the power market and a factor
in the contraction of the mining industry.
The lobby will argue that BP Bitor, to be renamed Bitor Europe, is likely to
have less influence in Europe once BP's stake goes to Petroleos de
Venezuela, the state-owned company which owns the other 50 per cent.
Earlier this year the government rejected calls for a ban on orimulsion. The
coal lobby suffered another blow in August when the Pollution Inspectorate
issued authorisations to PowerGen, the power generator, to burn orimulsion
at Ince on Merseyside and Richborough, Kent.
BP said the sale, effective from January 31, was aimed at helping it
concentrate on its core activities. It was this, rather than orimulsion's
image, which had influenced the disposal decision, it said.
The sale of the stake for about Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.3m) will have a minimal
impact on BP's financial performance.
BP Bitor said it expected UK sales to remain at about 1.3m tonnes annually
in the next two to three years.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Decline in footwear spending deepens to 'slump'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES OF footwear in Britain have declined sharply in the past year despite
signs of an upturn in overall consumer spending, the British Footwear
Manufacturers Federation said yesterday. Spending fell Pounds 198.7m - a 4
per cent drop - in the 12 months to July.
The federation said there had been an 'across-the-board slump' with
retailers selling 19.3m fewer pairs of shoes, boots and slippers. The
downturn represented a 7.6 per cent fall in volume sales, it added.
Figures compiled for the federation show a further decline in the first half
of the year with volume sales down by 8.6 per cent. In July, the worst month
for the sector, sales of men's footwear declined 22 per cent and women's
10.2 per cent.
Weakening demand has forced employers to cut the total workforce by 6.2 per
cent to 36,000, although the federation said this trend was likely to be
reversed in forthcoming months.
The main impact of the downturn appears to have been felt by overseas
manufacturers who saw direct exports to the UK decline by 18 per cent in the
12 months to July.
Companies based in the Far East, which have the lion's share of the export
market to Britain - Pounds 217.8m out of a total of Pounds 299m  - saw
volume sales fall by 19 per cent. Worst affected was Hong Kong where sales
fell by 70 per cent.
Sterling devaluation, meanwhile, helped UK manufacturers offset poor demand
at home by increasing exports by 17 per cent. Exports of children's footwear
showed the strongest growth, up 92 per cent.
While welcoming the increase in overseas orders, the federation said export
production represented only about 10 per cent of total output.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Tests for video link may cost BT Pounds 75m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecommunications is proposing to test its video-on-demand
entertainment service in as many as 250,000 homes next year.
The experiment is expected to cost about Pounds 75m and would probably be
conducted in rural areas such as Suffolk or Sussex.
BT technologists believe pictures of VHS or Super VHS quality can be
delivered down telephone lines to 90 per cent of the 23m homes connected to
the BT network. The digitally compressed pictures which would go through a
special decoder could go down the telephone wire at the same time as a
conversation.
If the experiment succeeds BT would go ahead with the investment of several
billion pounds needed to create a national system.
Recently the Independent Television Commission said it thought that a
video-on-demand service would not need a special licence under broadcasting
legislation.
BT envisages a system where a menu is produced on a television screen and
viewers are able to call up the movie or programme of their choice.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Home starts jump by 13%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDERS taking advantage of the improvement in the housing market started
work on 13 per cent more new homes during the first eight months of this
year than in the same period last year.
Figures published yesterday by the Environment Department show that work had
begun on 125,600 homes by the end of August compared with 111,500 last year.
The rise outstripped the improvement in the rest of the housing market which
has been more sluggish. Conveyancing transactions recorded by the Inland
Revenue during the first eight months rose by just 2.3 per cent to a total
of 744,000.
Builders have continued to offer a range of sales incentives to boost
turn-over, which has meant that profit margins have remained low. Spring
sales rose sharply, only to fall back over the summer.
The department said starts on new homes by builders fell by 4 per cent
during the three months to the end of August compared with the previous
three months.
However, they were 10 per cent higher than in the corresponding period last
year. The department's figures have been adjusted to take account of
seasonal variations.
Builders are hoping sales will pick up after the summer holidays. They say
that comparisons with last autumn should be good because sales almost halted
during the sterling crisis.
Figures for August starts on new homes were 14,900 compared with 12,500 the
previous August.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Fears over combined heat and power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RISE of energy-efficient power generation systems could be jeopardised
by sharply higher gas prices to industrial consumers, the Combined Heat and
Power Association warned yesterday.
Mr David Green, its director, said the industry's strong growth in recent
years had been 'kick-started' by British Gas's low-cost interruptible
supplies. Interruptible users pay low prices but risk being cut off at times
of peak demand.
The association fears that moves to enhance competition by forcing British
Gas to give up parts of its non-interruptible market could lead it to raise
interruptible prices.
Mr Green said a 'narrow' focus on competition by the Department of Trade and
Industry in its review of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on
the future of British Gas could frustrate government environmental goals to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
A government target says CHP systems should account for 5,000MW, or about 8
per cent, of installed capacity by the year 2000. The CHP process produces
both heat and electricity.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Halifax reports 1% rise in house prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES recorded an annual increase last month for the first time since
January 1991, according to Halifax.
Britain's biggest building society said the average price of a house had
risen by 1 per cent to Pounds 63,214 during the 12 months to the end of
September. This compares with a year-on-year fall of 2.3 per cent in August.
Comparisons have been distorted by house price falls in August and September
last year when sterling was forced out of the European exchange rate
mechanism.
Halifax said if prices remained stable during the next two or three months
it would expect the annual rise in house prices to increase to between 2 and
3 per cent by the end of this year. This would still leave prices below the
Pounds 68,000 cost of an average house in 1991, the society said.
It warned that the recovery remained very fragile with many potential
purchasers still concerned about the state of the economy, particularly the
high level of unemployment.
This is supported by another survey, published yesterday by Nationwide
Building Society, which showed that average house prices had fallen by 1.8
per cent last month compared with August. Nationwide said its figures showed
prices had risen 2.5 per cent in the first nine months of this year.
The society's September figure, however, conflicted with the Halifax survey
which reported a small rise, of 0.3 per cent, compared with August. The
Halifax said its figures, unlike those from Nationwide, were adjusted to
take account of seasonal variations.
It said that after 'averaging out' various monthly rises and falls, prices
generally had remained flat since sterling left the exchange rate mechanism.
New house prices remained unchanged on the August figure and were still 1.4
per cent lower than during September last year, reflecting the determination
of housebuilders to increase volume sales as the market starts to recover.
The average cost of a new home last month was Pounds 68,000 compared with
Pounds 68,979 12 months earlier.
Some regions have seen house prices fall by more than 30 per cent since 1988
but Nationwide expects the recovery to gather pace next year and is
forecasting an average price rise, for all homes, of 5 per cent in 1993.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Acid rain target 'being beaten'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday said the UK was ahead of its international
commitments to reduce acid rain.
It said figures on harmful gas emissions showed that last year's output of
sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen was below the levels established by
the UK plan that implements targets set by the European Community's large
combustion plants directive.
Total emissions were 2.67m tonnes of sulphur dioxide and 701,645 tonnes of
nitrous oxides. Quotas for the year were 3.25m tonnes and 925,000 tonnes
respectively.
Long-term targets aim for a cut of 60 per cent on 1980 sulphur dioxide
levels by the year 2003, and 30 per cent on nitrous oxide levels by 1998.
The emissions cover power generating plants, refineries and other industry.
The UK received more relaxed emission quotas in the directive than other EC
countries because of the large size of its coal-fired power industry, and
the expense of cleaning it.
Much of last year's reduction was due to a fall in the use of coal-fired
power stations. Although two large stations are to add flue gas
desulphurisation equipment, the first of these, at Drax in South Yorkshire,
will not start until the end of this year.
The environmental lobby has criticised the reduction as inadequate, arguing
it is driven by regulation and not ecological necessity. Acid rain is said
to damage plants, animals and buildings. Tougher standards are being
negotiated by industrialised countries, and these are set to be in the
directive next year.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Restaurant bills 'close to deceit'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESTAURANTS are coming close to deceiving customers by adding unexpected
charges to final bills, says the 1994 Good Food Guide, published today by
the Consumers' Association.
Mr Tom Jaine, the guide's editor, says in an introduction that some of the
most popular restaurants, particularly in London, 'are guilty of some
shameful tricks, all designed to push up profits without the customer being
too aware of it'.
Among the practices highlighted by the guide is a restaurant in Soho,
London, which has a Pounds 1.50 cover charge for olives or bread which are
placed on tables without customers asking for them.
The guide also mentions an unnamed establishment which charges Pounds 3 for
a bottle of mineral water and imposes a cover charge for bread and butter
for which it provides no plates.
Mr Jaine says restaurant customers falsely assume that the price of the main
dish provides an indication of what they will end up paying. He adds: 'While
the recession may have forced proprietors to reduce their headline prices to
persuade customers through their doors, some of them load the other costs to
the point of virtual deceit. No wonder the public sometimes feels
restaurants are combat zones.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Portsmouth's municipal ferry port says it could be in jeopardy if the
government refuses its request to borrow Pounds 7m for expansion. The port
needs to reclaim land, improve facilities and increase berths for the new
super-ferries if business is not to be lost to other ports and the Channel
tunnel. The improvements would cost Pounds 20m by the end of the decade and
Pounds 7m in the financial year 1994-95. Because the port is owned by
Portsmouth district council it is subject to constraints on local government
spending and cannot borrow funds without government approval.

<TEXT>
A STRIKE ballot of Vauxhall's 9,000 manual workers is expected if the
company fails to improve its present two-year pay offer at today's
negotiating session with the unions, Robert Taylor writes.
Union officials have rejected the company's proposal for a 2.1 per cent pay
rise this year and 2.6 per cent in 1994.
Union officials said last night that they would be pointing out to Vauxhall
that it had made more than Pounds 1bn profit over the past three years.
Vauxhall said it had suffered a 13 per cent cut in its production because of
falling demand in the Continental market.

FT  06 OCT 93 / C4 loses Clockwork Orange test case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANNEL 4 Television was last night prevented from screening an arts
documentary which included excerpts of the film A Clockwork Orange after
Time-Warner, the owners of the film's copyright, won an injunction in the
first round of a test case of the latest copyright laws.
Channel 4 immediately lodged an appeal with the Court of Appeal against the
injunction.
The film has not been shown in Britain for 20 years since its director, Mr
Stanley Kubrick, voluntarily withdrew it from distribution.
However, Channel 4 sought to include the excerpts in a review of the film in
its programme Without Walls. Channel 4 argued that the 'fair dealings'
provisions of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 - which extended
copyright law to broadcasting - permitted the showing of illustrative clips
without Time-Warner's granting permission for their use.
Time-Warner argued that the excerpts accounted for almost half of the
25-minute programme and that the company would suffer financial damage if
the film were ever shown.
This is the first time the Act has been tested in the British courts when
applied to reviews or criticism of broadcast material.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Howe seeks policy information for case to Iraq probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD HOWE, the former chancellor and foreign secretary, has asked Whitehall
officials to supply documentary evidence of cases in which the government
has withheld information about UK foreign policy from parliament.
Lord Howe's request is related to his appearance, expected next January,
before the Scott arms-to-Iraq inquiry.
Lord Howe's office said yesterday that he was not prepared to make any
comment until he gave evidence to the inquiry.
'His position will become clear then,' a spokesman for Lord Howe said.
It has emerged that in recent weeks that Foreign Office departments have
been asked to broaden their research for current and former ministers
appearing before the Scott inquiry to include diplomacy during the 1980s in
countries other than Iraq.
According to senior Whitehall sources, departments have been asked to find
instances of government policy not being spelt out to parliament on the
grounds that officials and ministers at the time judged this to be in the
overriding public and national interest.
A possible example relates to secret diplomacy with Argentina in the years
after the Falklands war.
Within Whitehall there is a widely held view that officials and ministers
have been put on the defensive by Lord Justice Scott and his counsel Miss
Presiley Baxendale QC and need to put their case across more forcefully in
the coming weeks.
Lord Howe served as foreign secretary between 1983 and 1989. He announced
guidelines restricting arms exports to Iraq and Iran to parliament in
October 1985.
Documents made available to the Scott inquiry show the guidelines had been
secretly agreed to by ministers in December 1984.
Lord Howe's former junior minister at the Foreign Office, Mr William
Waldegrave, told the Scott inquiry last month that they were secretly
relaxed in 1988, but argued that this was a minimal change.
Information given to parliament in 1988 had been misleading. But he argued
that the withholding of information served the public interest because it
protected British hostages held in the Middle East.
The inquiry today takes evidence from Mr Ian McDonald, the head of the MoD
Defence Export Services Secretariat.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Stock Exchange stakes claim to settlements role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Stock Exchange intends to play a role in securities settlement in the
City of London even after a successor to its failed Taurus paperless
settlements system is in place.
The Bank of England, heading a panel to devise a replacement for Taurus, and
City officials have suggested that the Exchange's failure with Taurus has
cost it the confidence of institutional shareholders and market makers who
are in need of an efficient system quickly.
Mr Martin Hall, head of public policy at the Stock Exchange, speaking at a
conference in Birmingham, said that from July 18 next year the Exchange's
existing Talisman settlements system will move to 10-day rolling periods.
This will replace the two-week settlement system currently in operation. A
change to five-day settlements is planned for a few months later, also via
the Talisman system.
'So the Exchange is very much in the settlement business, and will
necessarily be the sole provider of settlement services for several years to
come,' Mr Hall said. Noting that the ownership, management and operation of
the new settlements system, to be known as Crest, have yet to be decided, Mr
Hall said: 'We do not expect in the long term to remain the sole providers,
but we certainly do not rule out a continuing involvement.'
The Exchange yesterday also announced it has introduced a new surveillance
mechanism to allow regulators to track equity-related transactions.
The system, known as Imas - Integrated Monitoring and Surveillance - has
been designed to detect 'unusual trading activities', according to Mr Keith
Robinson, head of market regulation. Speaking at the Exchange's first
Midlands and Western regional conference, Mr Robinson said the system would
monitor the time taken for trade transactions and how quickly they are
reported to regulators.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Receiverships at lowest level for four years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of companies placed in receivership fell to its lowest level for
four years last month, providing evidence that the 'credit crunch' which
normally accompanies recovery and stimulates company failures may not occur.
Only 184 receivership and administration orders were recorded in the London
and Edinburgh Gazettes, fewer than half those of the same month last year
and the lowest figure since the 135 reported in September 1989.
The figure was about a quarter down on the figures of between 229 and 253
reported in each of the previous five months. On present trends, total
receiverships for the year are likely to be 27 per cent down on those in
1992.
Mr Christopher Morris, national director of corporate special services for
accountants Touche Ross, said it was 'very encouraging for the British
economy'.
Past economic recoveries have tended to lead to a rise in failures as banks
refuse to extend further loans to businesses which have suffered from an
excessive debt burden during the recession.
However, banks have reported weak loan demand despite the emergence from
recession.
Mr Morris said that the lack of failures indicated a 'general cautiousness'
among both business owners and financiers.
He said Britain 'could well be set on a steady and controllable expansion of
trade if this trend continues, and may this time avoid the worst excesses of
the traditional economic cycle'.
Among industrial sectors, failures in building construction fell to 33,
compared with an average of 65 in the preceding 12 months. There were 10
failures in hotel and catering, which was half the recent monthly levels.
The worst affected region was Yorkshire/Humberside, which had 24 failures,
or 13 per cent of the total. This means the region has contributed 10 per
cent of company failures so far this year, a 2 percentage point increase on
the area's share last year.
The best-performing regions were the north-east, which had four failures,
Wales, which had six, and the west Midlands, which had seven failures.
Mr Morris said many receiverships and administrations were leading to
financial reconstructions rather than absolute failures with full loss of
employment. 'The strength and flexibility of the British insolvency system
results in many businesses that have suffered losses during the recession
being rescued and rehabilitated, as opposed to merely being closed down,' he
said.

As SDLP leader Mr John Hume prepares to brief the Irish government on

FT  06 OCT 93 / Ferry port warns Pounds 7m loan vital for development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PORTSMOUTH'S successful municipal ferry port could be in jeopardy if the
government refuses its request to borrow Pounds 7m for expansion.
The port needs to reclaim land, improve parking, port handling facilities
and increase berths for the new super-ferries, if business is not to be lost
to the trust port of Poole, Southampton and the Channel tunnel.
The improvements would cost Pounds 20m by the end of the decade and Pounds
7m in the financial year 1994-95.
Because the port is owned by the Portsmouth district council it is subject
to constraints on local government spending and cannot borrow funds for
capital spending without government approval.
The port says the Ministry of Transport is cutting municipal ports'
allocation in 1994-95 from Pounds 12m to Pounds 4m. Portsmouth's share would
be Pounds 1m.
About 255,000 freight vehicles a year use the port and the figure is growing
by 20 per cent a year. With just under 3m passengers annually and 810,000
cars, Portsmouth is the second largest passenger terminal in the UK after
Dover.
The port fears that without the expansion its main users Brittany Ferries
and P&amp;O Ferries could move elsewhere.
Rear Admiral Tony George, port manager, said: 'The developments are vital if
we are to expand. The new ferries which are coming on stream are like
hotels. We have also to improve our freight marshalling facilities if the
tunnel is not to take our business.'
The port is scheduled to make an operating surplus of more than Pounds 3m
this year from revenues of Pounds 14m. This goes to the district council and
if the government continues to refuse extra funds, some of it could be used
on the port.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Fishermen offer plan to replace time curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON MAITLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FISHERMEN in England and Wales yesterday proposed measures aimed at
persuading the government to abandon its controversial limits on the number
of days trawlers can spend at sea.
The measures did not include a proposal put forward last week by
representatives of Scotland's 8,000 fishermen that the government should
temporarily abandon the EC system of quotas on the type and quantity of
their catch.
The government has opted to restrict time at sea from next January as part
of its effort to comply with EC rules by cutting the capacity of the UK
fleet by 19 per cent by 1996.
Mr Barrie Deas, secretary of the National Federation of Fishermen's
Organisations, representing 6,000 fishermen in England, Wales, Northern
Ireland and the Channel Islands, said his organisation has put forward some
similar alternative proposals to those of the Scottish fishermen, notably on
increasing the size of mesh in nets and introducing compulsory square mesh
panels which allow young fish to escape.
The NFFO, which will seek judicial review of the limits on days at sea on
November 1, called for increases in minimum landing sizes for fish and
no-fishing zones to protect young and breeding fish.

FT  06 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Pressure over BR sell-off
reversal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WERE several strong calls yesterday for the government to reverse its
recent humiliating defeat on a central element of its plans to privatise
British Rail.
But Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, stopped short of saying that
the government would try to reverse an amendment to the rail privatisation
bill passed by the House of Lords in July. The amendment seeks to give BR a
greater role in bidding for the new franchises.
In July parliament's upper chamber insisted that BR should be allowed to bid
for rail franchises after privatisation alongside other groups. Proposers of
the amendment argued that BR managers should have an opportunity to bid for
the privatised net-work.
Mr Robin Morris (Morecambe and Lunesdale Conservatives), opening the
transport debate, claimed that the amendment was contrary to the aims of
rail privatisation.
'(The amendment) allows BR, financed by taxpayers' money, to compete against
its own management,' he said.
He claimed that rail restructuring would bring about smaller and more
manageable units and provide new opportunities.
In his speech Mr MacGregor carefully avoided mentioning the Lords'
amendment.
In recent days, ministers have privately acknowledged that it would be
difficult to defeat the amendment in the Commons because it has the support
of some Conservative MPs.
Mr MacGregor confined himself to saying that this matter would be considered
when the House came back from its recess. 'The original bill was right,' he
said.
Mr MacGregor said that the government had given a commitment to the Lords
that it would re-examine the arguments contained in their amendment. But he
was concerned that it might discourage the enthusiasm of BR's regional
managers to bid for franchises.
'There are some 30 management buy-outs in the offing for British rail,' he
said. 'A lot of regional managers are ready to get up and go.'
Touching on road policy in his speech, Mr MacGregor had said that the
government had not yet decided whether to ask motorists to pay more directly
for use of motorways.
But responses to a recent green paper on motorway tolling revealed majority
support among the organisations concerned for some form of charging if it
led to more resources being spent on roads.
He also reported that electronic tolling was much preferred to the
introduction of permits, for which there was little support.

FT  06 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Lamont's credibility was
undermined, says Clarke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE yesterday fuelled tension between himself and Mr Norman
Lamont by asserting bluntly that his predecessor as chancellor had lost all
credibility on economic policy before his removal earlier this year.
Mr Clarke said Mr Lamont had 'got himself into a dreadful situation where
nobody took the slightest notice of anything he said on economic policy.'
'He was subjected to a campaign of continual harassment about his credit
cards and all kinds of irrelevancies by people who presumably thought they
were entitled to do this because they believed he should have resigned after
Black Wednesday.'
Mr Clarke's remarks in the Bow Group magazine Crossbow came just two days
before both men are due to speak at the conference - Mr Clarke in the main
hall and Mr Lamont on the fringe.
Party managers are worried that Mr Lamont may be provoked into launching a
fresh attack on the government's policies after his recent endorsement of
rightwing opposition to tax increases.
Arguing that Mr Lamont was 'entitled to take the credit for the fact that
Britain is now recovering when the rest of Europe is not,' Mr Clarke said
the Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement his predecessor had
bequeathed was a 'big problem.'

FT  06 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Howard floats idea of
limit on benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANGES to the social security system to encourage 'responsibility', such as
limiting welfare benefits after the first child, were floated yesterday by
Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, yesterday.
Speaking to a fringe meeting, Mr Howard highlighted pilot schemes in the US
where, for example, New Jersey had capped the benefits available for second
and later children.
He told the meeting that policies across a range of areas - housing, moral
education at school and adoption law - should be examined to ensure that
they did not provide an incentive for irresponsible behaviour.
Mr Howard said that in addressing the breakdown of discipline and authority
the government must also argue strongly the case for the traditional family
and try to create a spirit of independence in communities badly affected by
crime.
In contrast to some of the messages coming from the Tory party about the
availability of welfare benefits, he said most girls 'probably don't get
pregnant to get a council house or to receive an income from the state' but
he said that for young men 'social security benefits all too often appear as
an entitlement'.
He argued that with few adult role models, children in one-parent families
were more likely to succumb to peer pressure. 'The children, instead of
learning the difference between right and wrong, may instead concentrate on
how not to get caught,' he said.
'And since the state is educating, housing and feeding their children, the
nature of parental responsibility may seem less immediate.'
Far too often, offenders had appeared before the court to receive repeated
conditional discharges and probation orders, Mr Howard said.
Disintegration of what it sees as traditional family values is one of the
issues the party is keen to address. Ministers are committed to ensuring
that so far as possible the welfare state does not provide incentives
towards 'irresponsible behaviour'.
Mr Howard is to give the keynote speech today on law and order.

FT  06 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Hurd says European tide
has turned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVES edged towards unity on Europe yesterday, as Mr Douglas Hurd,
the foreign secretary, spelt out the common ground within the party, and
Lord Tebbit, a former Tory chairman, welcomed the government's recent shift
towards a more Euro-sceptic position.
Mr Hurd told the conference that the tide of European opinion had turned,
and that the EC's future work would be directed towards the agenda put
forward by the UK government: a wider, more competitive Community, based on
free trade and co-operation.
Speaking after a debate that was curiously tame, given the passions Europe
has aroused over the past year, Mr Hurd underlined the importance of winning
more Conservative seats in the European elections next June. Most people, he
said, looked to the Conservatives to fight for Britain's interest in Europe.
'No other party is going to do that job. We have to do it. In all senses of
the word we are right in Europe,' he said.
Paying tribute to the European vision of the 1950s, and expressing
understanding that in the aftermath of the two world wars a strong role for
the nation states was not seen as inevitable, Mr Hurd said the aim of
preventing another western European war did not mean centralised decision
making in Brussels.
'It does not follow that the nation states should wither away, that would be
unnatural . . .History is against it and the peoples of Europe do not want
it'. Despite the outbreak of unity, Lord Tebbit's remarks to a fringe
meeting organised by the Thatcherite Conservative Way Forward remained
barbed, as he said it would have been better if Mr John Major's conversion
had occurred earlier.
'How much easier it would have been if Mr Major had worn those sceptics'
clothes at Maastricht,' he said.
Lord Tebbit rejected suggestions the party leadership had secured a truce
with the rebels, insisting that the right of the party had not altered its
stance. 'I think the Euro-sceptics have been proved right,' he said. 'I
think there will continue to be arguments but I welcome the switch (the
leadership) has made.'
Adopting a conciliatory tone, he said Mr Major's recent Economist article
setting out his vision of Europe was 'good', although he would have liked it
to take a stronger line on some issues. But he also served notice that
Conservative candidates in next year's European parliamentary elections
could not necessarily count on his support.

FT  06 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Mirror victorious over
Thatcher book
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SUNDAY TIMES last night failed in its attempt to get a High Court
injunction to prevent the Daily Mirror from publishing further information
from Downing Street Years, Baroness Thatcher's political biography.
Mr Andrew Neil, the Sunday Times editor, was last night in talks with
lawyers to see whether to mount an immediate appeal. If this were to fail
there could be further Daily Mirror revelations in advance of the five-part
serialisation of the 800-page memoirs which begins in the Sunday Times this
Sunday.
Yesterday the Daily Mirror published five pages of material apparently based
on the first volume of the memoirs, to be published by HarperCollins on
October 18.
Mr Neil said yesterday: 'The Daily Mirror has done me a favour today (in
terms of publicity). I just don't want them doing me any further favours.'
The Daily Mirror coverage had very few direct quotations from the book. The
paper said, however, that Lady Thatcher thought that Mr John Major, the
prime minister, was small-minded, politically naive and an intellectual
lightweight and that she had deliberately withheld her true opinion so that
he could succeed her.
There were no quotations marks around the descriptions of Mr Major but it is
clear the Sunday Times believes the Daily Mirror either has a copy of the
book or has talked to someone who has.
The Sunday Times conceded last night that at least some of the quotes in the
Daily Mirror coverage were genuine. Lady Thatcher's statement last night
made no specific denials of any of the Mirror's claims, though it was later
said on her behalf that nowhere in the book does she describe Mr Major as
small-minded, politically naive or an intellectual lightweight.
The Daily Mirror also alleges that:
Lady Thatcher believes she was politically 'mugged' by Lord Howe, the former
deputy prime minister.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the present chancellor, was, contrary to general belief,
one of the few who supported her during her leadership crisis.
On her last day in office Lady Thatcher found the door to her study locked
and the key removed from her keyring.
The Daily Mirror publication comes in spite of unprecedented security at
HarperCollins which has included a large brass lock on the office of Mr
Eddie Bell, the chief executive, and security advice from Mr John Stalker,
the former senior police officer.
The timing of the coverage in the newspaper could not have been more
politically explosive.
All the signs are that the former prime minister does have controversial
things to say in her book, which is already virtually guaranteed to be a
worldwide best seller with advance orders totalling more than 500,000.
The Sunday Times editor wanted to begin serialisation of the book last
Sunday but Lady Thatcher insisted that this should not happen until after
the party conference.

FT  06 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Loyalty to the Lady
splits party faithful - Tories from the shires tell Kevin Brown what they
think of the ex-leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR SOME, it will be like old times. Three years after she was
unceremoniously ditched by Conservative MPs, Baroness Thatcher arrives in
Blackpool today guaranteed an ecstatic welcome and a standing ovation from
the faithful.
The party leadership is betting that her appearance on the platform
alongside Mr John Major, the prime minister, will ram home the primary
conference message - that the disunity of the last year is over. But will
it?
A highly unscientific straw poll taken in the bars and tea-rooms of the
Winter Gardens conference centre suggests that many constituency
representatives would like the former prime minister to shut up, but few
expect her to.
It also revealed something less predictable: in spite of the widespread
reporting of Lady Thatcher's private view that Mr Major is a weak prime
minister, a sizeable number of delegates think it inconceivable that she
could be disloyal to the current high command.
'I think she is too much of a politician to say anything out of line. I
don't think she is in a position to criticise John Major because he is the
leader,' said Mr Ray Richardson, a businessman from the Black Country.
'I was a great supporter of Margaret Thatcher when she was in power, but my
view is she supports the prime minister. She's got to hasn't she?
'I think the very fact that Margaret Thatcher is coming to the conference
shows her backing for John Major. She is certainly not going to criticise
him because she is a strong ally of the Conservative party and the country.'
Others were not so sure, especially when reminded of Lady Thatcher's
forthcoming memoirs and her apparent desire to promote the succession
chances of Mr Michael Portillo, the rightwing chief secretary to the
Treasury.
'I thought she would be above (disloyalty),' said Mrs Peggy Jones from
Gower. 'I don't know if she is really saying these things or if it is just
the newspapers, but if she is saying them it would be disloyal.'
She added: 'I think she should make it clear that she is standing behind
John Major. She should say that she supports his policies.'
Mr Bernard McArdle, a Blackpool councillor, was convinced that the image of
a reunited party being projected by the leadership was not a facade, and
certain that the conference would launch Mr Major on a sustained recovery.
But he thought Lady Thatcher's memoirs, to be published later this month,
would probably be less than complimentary about many Conservative
politicians, including Mr Major.
'I would expect her to be critical because she is a very critical person.
She has always been a very straightforward, honest person, and I think she
will be critical of herself as well,' he said.
'But I don't think she will be disloyal. Some people might interpret some of
the things she says as disloyal, but loyalty to the party is in her blood.'
But what about her apparent manoeuverings on behalf of Mr Portillo?
'I would not put that past her. She is the mother of the party, isn't she?
There is a motherly instinct, and she doesn't want to see it all fail. She
wants to make sure there is someone else, to her liking, to make sure it
carries on.'
The corridors of the Winter Gardens are not exactly swarming with
unreconstructed Thatcherites, but, equally, you don't have to go far to find
one.
Mrs Pamela Windsor from East Surrey said she was 'devastated' by the exit of
the former leader, and nearly 'gave up politics to take up knitting or
something'.
Mrs Windsor thinks Mr Major is 'following the wrong policies,' and believes
that Lady Thatcher should have stayed in office for at least a further five
years.
She is also one of many representatives who profess sympathy for the
rightwing MPs whose critical 'noises off' have so upset Mr Major. 'Good luck
to them,' she said.
But could Lady Thatcher not best unify the party and protect her own legacy
by giving wholehearted support to Mr Major?
'If I had been her I would have been much more spiteful. I think she has
been very restrained,' she said.

FT  06 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Fresh sales effort for
British food
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW drive to boost food exports to Britain's EC partners was announced by
Mrs Gillian Shephard, minister of agriculture.
She said leading retailers would be co-operating with the government soon
after Christmas to highlight the most effective ways of ensuring that goods
were displayed in continental supermarkets.
Mrs Shephard underlined the importance of securing greater export
penetration as well as improving domestic market share when joining with
rank and file speakers in questioning the need for the Pounds 6bn deficit in
trade in foodstuffs incurred by Britain in 1992.
The 'food from Britain' organisation had been given a new remit to expand
its work on export promotion.
Warning that the home market should not be taken for granted, she said: 'No
one has to buy British. The invaders are not just waiting over the channel -
they are already there on the supermarket shelves'.
Mr Nicholas Soames, the food minister, had been assigned the catering
sector, and Mr Michael Jack, minister of state, would seek to improve the
performance of the horticultural industry.
Horticulture accounted for the most substantial part of the food trade
deficit.
Mrs Shephard said Mr Jack had assured her that 'anything the Dutch can do we
can do better - since half of all Dutch exports are agricultural, that is
quite a target.'
She was unable to dispel fears expressed during the debate that the promised
reform of land tenure to provide more tenancies for new entrants to farming
might be subject to further delay.
Mrs Shephard admitted that the effects of the delaying tactics by Tory
Euro-sceptics against the Maastricht bill could lead to new landlord and
tenant legislation being crowded out of the programme for the parliamentary
session due to open later this month.
In that event, she said, a new round of pre-legislative consultations,
including draft clauses of the proposed bill, would be undertaken with all
the interests concerned.

FT  06 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Rifkind says defence cuts
near limit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, won sustained applause when he
warned that expenditure cuts imposed on the three services were close to the
acceptable limit.
He said: 'We must at all costs avoid creating a hollow force - that is an
armed force that looks formidable but is, in fact, a paper tiger.'
Mr Rifkind declined to comment on his current negotiations with Mr Michael
Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury.
But he acknowledged the repeated expressions of anxiety made in a debate on
defence, which concerned the damaging effect likely to result from further
disruption on top of that already caused by the amalgamation of regiments
and other economies.
Mr Rifkind said it was clear that the conference was seeking assurances that
the government would not go too far 'in any economies that may be made'.
He stressed: 'It is the government's obligation to listen carefully to those
concerns', and suggested that any further cuts should be matched by a
scaling down of commitments.
In a BBC interview Mr Archie Hamilton, a former defence minister, said he
would be surprised if the Ministry of Defence emerged from current
negotiations with the Treasury with its budget intact.
Mr Rifkind joined Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, in warmly praising the
peacekeeping efforts of the British forces in Bosnia.
Mr Hurd forecast that the difficulties of intervening in Bosnia rather than
the clear objectives of the Gulf war were likely to typify future
international conflict.
He sharply contrasted the irresponsibility of opposition calls for action
and the government's need to weigh the effects of its decisions on the lives
of British forces as well as Bosnians.
'No government at any time proposed the only form of intervention which
could guarantee a solution, namely the despatch and indefinite stationing of
an international army to impose that solution.'
Giving the armed revolt in Russia as an example of continuing international
uncertainty, Mr Hurd gave strong support for President Yeltsin's actions in
defence of his democratic reforms.

FT  06 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: With friends like this .
. . - Conference Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WE ARE all friends again. Well, maybe. All right then, not really. But we
are making an effort.
So the 110th Conservative conference opened in Blackpool in a desperate
quest for public unity which did not last long. The colourful coverage in
the Daily Mirror of the sentiments expressed in Lady Thatcher's forthcoming
memoirs provided an awkward reminder of a harsher reality.
It did not matter how accurate the published details were - nor that one of
the few people who had actually read them insisted that, if her memoirs were
less than flattering, they were not damning.
Everyone knows what Lady Thatcher says in private about her successor. She
believes Mr John Major to be weak and indecisive. She frequently says as
much at her court-in-exile. She has attacked him publicly over Maastricht
and Bosnia. In private the charge sheet includes the European exchange rate
mechanism, public spending and taxation and, more generally, lack of
purpose. Everyone else knew back in 1990 that Mr Major was never really 'one
of us'. But she cannot forgive him.
Between the lines of her public statement of support last night was the
truth that Lady Thatcher does not want a challenge for the leadership
because she believes the ideologically-sound but inconveniently youthful Mr
Michael Portillo needs more time to emerge as heir apparent. And, as she
told the voters of Sir Teddy Taylor's Southend recently, 'Granny will always
be there'.
She admires Mr Kenneth Clarke as a politician cast in her own pugnacious
mould. But she knows that, more than any other potential leader, Mr Clarke -
when given the keys to 10 Downing Street - would erase the memory of her
revolution. Lady Thatcher's entrance to the Empress Ballroom on Thursday
will be the signal for public reconciliation. If the Conservatives are lucky
it will last until the weekend when the Sunday Times begins to serialise her
memoirs.
So it is a transparent truce. From the platform, ministers have decided to
emphasise the continuity between Thatcherism and Majorism. Then, chatting on
the edge of the ballroom, they speak bitterly of her refusal to shut up.
'She is a star', one commented. 'But why on earth cannot she retire
gracefully?'
Much of this goes over the heads of the conference delegates who yesterday
cheered Sir Norman Fowler's attacks on the BBC and stood to applaud his
calls for party unity. Many of them still adore Lady Thatcher and are loyal
to Mr Major. Most of them do not see the contradiction.
But they know something has gone wrong. There were echoes in Sir Norman's
oratory of the great 'fighting' speeches delivered by Mr Kenneth Baker in
the last months of the Thatcher era.
The wounds left by Maastricht have not healed. Mr Douglas Hurd offered an
eloquent exposition of the opportunity open to the Conservatives to unite
behind the common ambition of a wider, open and decentralised Europe.
He was promptly attacked from both sides. Lord Tebbit, said to regret still
that he did not stand against Mr Major three years ago, damned with faint
praise the prime minister's apparent conversion to the cause of
Euro-scepticism.
From the other side of the ditch, friends of Brussels warned that after the
battles of Maastricht they were not about to accept meekly
lowest-common-denominator Europeanism. Mr Major should take note. These are
people on whom his future depends.
So why the frantic bridge-building with the Tory right, the pretence that
Thatcher and Major are still good friends?
On one level it is an obvious tactic. Mr Major needs the support of the
party activists who still adore his predecessor. He is not sure that the
rift can ever be closed. But in that case, she rather than he must be seen
by the faithful as the antagonist - the great leader turned embittered
exile.
There is a more important objective. Mr Major needs desperately a window of
opportunity to rebuild his premiership. If the right does not challenge for
the leadership this year, he has a chance to recover.
He does not have much time. Loyal cabinet colleagues are becoming restless
with his preoccupation with what the papers say. They are urging him to
behave in a more prime ministerial fashion. They lament his inability to
stamp his authority on the government. They want him to concentrate on three
or four strategic objectives - rebuilding Britain's competitiveness,
restoring a grip on law and order, delivering and effective education
policy.
They fear the most damning label that can be pinned on any politician - not
up to the job - is sticking to Mr Major.
If the prime minister were strong, Lady Thatcher would be an irritating
irrelevance. So too would Lord Tebbit and the so-called barmies on the Tory
back benches.
But Mr Major can only confront them if he rekindles faith in his leadership
among his own supporters.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Campbell TV debates fail to impress voters: Canada's
Liberals need to take support from Quebec separatist parties to form a
majority government after the election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MS Kim Campbell, Canada's prime minister, was yesterday struggling to regain
her footing after a lacklustre performance in two televised debates before
the October 25 general election.
With less than three weeks to go to election day, the question uppermost in
commentators' minds is now whether the opposition Liberal party will garner
enough votes to form a majority government.
Recent opinion polls show the Tories slipping steadily behind the Liberals,
but also show strong support for two regional parties, the Bloc Quebecois in
Quebec and the populist Reform party, whose main strength is in western
Canada.
The televised debates, one in English and the other in French, were widely
seen as one of the last opportunities for the Conservatives to make an
impression on voters.
But the inexperienced Ms Campbell was thrown on the defensive several times
by her opponents, notably by Mr Lucien Bouchard, leader of the separatist
Bloc Quebecois, which has siphoned off a large chunk of Conservative support
in Quebec.
Quebec newspapers yesterday gave wide prominence to Ms Campbell's remark
immediately after Monday night's debate that 'only Quebeckers will swallow'
Mr Bouchard's budget deficit projections.
Callers to radio phone-in shows also appeared unconvinced by Ms Campbell's
promise to eliminate the CDollars 35.5bn (Pounds 17.4bn) budget deficit in
five years without raising taxes or cutting costly social-security
programmes.
The Bloc Quebecois is far ahead of the other two parties in the francophone
province, with a chance of winning 40 or more of Quebec's 75 seats in the
House of Commons.
The BQ's support comes partly from a hard core of Quebec separatists. But
the group's promise to put Quebec's interests first has also attracted
voters whose primary concerns are high unemployment and slipping living
standards.
But Mr Jean Chretien, the Liberals' leader, used the debates to make a
forceful plea to his fellow Quebeckers not to heed the BQ's promises.
'Canada has enabled the francophone community to survive in North America,'
Mr Chretien said.
The Liberals' ability to form a majority government will depend heavily on
their success in drawing support away from the BQ in Quebec over the next
two weeks.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Ecuador finally backs reforms for public sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLITT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   QUITO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ECUADOREAN Congress has finally approved public sector reforms vital to
President Sixto Duran Ballen's economic programme, after nearly eight months
of deliberations.
A last-minute attempt by the opposition to reopen debate on the contentious
package - passed last week and now awaiting the president's signature - is
unlikely to win the necessary two-thirds majority.
The law is central to reducing the size of the public sector, privatising
state-owned enterprises, opening key sectors of the economy, and
deregulating numerous economic activities.
Its passage was hampered by the government's lack of a majority, its
unpopularity in the country and the slow procedures of Congress, which sits
for only three days a week.
Companies owned partly or entirely by the state may now be sold, liquidated,
or merged with other companies. Strategic sectors of the economy hitherto
reserved for the state - such as the petroleum industry, mining,
electricity, telecommunications and water utilities - will also be open to
the private sector through concessions, although the defence industry
remains reserved.
The liberalisation of foreign investment regulations in January and the
reform of the securities market in May have already made such areas easier
for foreign investors.
However, Congress restricted the use of debt-to-equity swaps for
privatisations in key sectors and introduced an anti-trust clause to prevent
state monopolies being superseded by private monopolies.
Despite having created the legal foundation for privatising much of the
public sector, the current administration may manage to tackle only a
fraction of the 167 enterprises involving public investment, nearly half of
which are entirely state-owned.
There is still considerable opposition to privatisation by bureaucrats and
workers in the bloated state apparatus, and the government will face strikes
and tough negotiations.
The new law has given the president executive powers to reform or eliminate
inefficient and superfluous enterprises. But more specific legislation will
be necessary to regulate private enterprises operating in new sectors. The
executive placed 26 bills before Congress last month. Without a clear
majority, it may take the government some time to get these passed.
'If we can privatise a few big companies during the term of this
administration, we will have accomplished something,' said Mr Carlos
Larreategui, under-secretary of public administration. The government's
strategy is to tackle the big and controversial companies first. The smaller
ones, he added, will then become easier.
Public entities will be trimmed of excess staff through offers of settlement
payments to employees who have worked in the same institution for at least
two years and who resign voluntarily.
The revenue from the sale of public entities will have to be reinvested in
education, health, housing and other basic services.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Argentina makes a vice out of a necessity: The role of the
plain envelope where government officials earn too little to live on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY month Argentina's cabinet office sends out plain envelopes containing
the equivalent of Dollars 3,000-Dollars 4,000 in cash to 200-300 senior
political officials, in most cases tripling their salaries.
It is one of Argentina's worst-kept secrets that senior government officials
receive these large illegal cash payments and that they evade taxes. It does
little to credit the government's claim to be cleaning up the bureaucratic
machine.
Few officials can get by on their meagre salaries: President Carlos Menem
himself earns the equivalent of only Dollars 2,400 (Pounds 1,590) a month. A
minister gets Dollars 2,100 and officials at junior ministerial level
between Dollars 1,600 and Dollars 1,800. Nearly all top political appointees
therefore rely on additional payments known as the sobresueldo, the extra
salary.
It may be illegal, but the sobresueldo long ago became an established part
of public life and shows little sign of disappearing.
Although Mr Menem has raised civil servants' pay, he has repeatedly put off
raising the salaries of their political masters, thus perpetuating the
sobresueldo system. He is apparently worried about adverse public reaction
to a big 'increase' in salaries.
He is probably right: last year the media reacted in fury when economy
minister Domingo Cavallo admitted that he received the equivalent of Dollars
8,000 a month after tax from Fundacion Mediterranea, a business-funded
economic research foundation he led before entering politics.
It also pays smaller amounts to nearly all his aides, most of whom entered
government straight from the foundation.
Mr Cavallo said he could not afford to live on less than Dollars 10,000 a
month in Buenos Aires. By contrast, private- sector wages average Dollars
700 a month - barely enough to survive in one of the world's most expensive
cities.
Spurred on by an outraged media, prosecutors charged Mr Cavallo with
receiving illegal gifts. But a judge rejected the accusation after Mr
Cavallo argued that he and his team were on secondment to the government.
The extra salaries are paid out of the president's Dollars 196.5m a year of
'reserved funds', which are disbursed without any outside control.
Furthermore, income tax is not levied on the payments.
Some officials are unhappy about the parallel wage structure, not only
because sobresueldos are illegal, but because they contradict Mr Menem's
claim to be promoting clean government.
They are also uncomfortable about earning 'less' than their civil service
subordinates. Senior civil servants earn Dollars 3,000-Dollars 5,000 a
month, although some of them also get sobresueldos. Some officials continue
to receive their plain envelopes even after leaving government.
The practice is also widespread in Congress, where each party is assigned
'reserved funds' which they are free to spend as they please. Congressional
staff are paid only Dollars 1,500 a month, a legislator Dollars 5,000. Here
again, sobresueldos are paid, tax-free, to aides and staffers.
The government even pays them to journalists. Reporters get cash hand-outs,
roughly equivalent to their salaries, from the press offices of the
ministries they cover regularly. Mr Cavallo's aides suspect one reason for
the generally hostile press coverage was his order to ban these payments in
the economy ministry when he took office in 1991.
Companies habitually pay journalists for publishing favourable articles and
some reporters even receive large regular retainers. Companies also pay
politicians and civil servants. Sometimes they do so openly. In 1991, 73
local and multinational companies provided Dollars 300,000 to help modernise
the civil service by hiring trained professionals.
And some non-cash corporate 'contributions' are relatively innocuous. For
instance, Mr Martn Redrado, head of the CNV securities watchdog, openly
admits that it was the stock exchange that redecorated his new offices.
Most people receiving sobresueldos consider them more a necessary perk than
a bribe. Inevitably, though, the tradition opens the door to more serious
forms of corruption. Officials 'borrow' luxurious cars or apartments from
friendly businessmen. Companies consider it natural to make political
contributions to tax-exempt foundations set up by politicians as cash
conduits.
This 'black money' is an important weapon in every politician's arsenal. It
is used to reward close aides, buy journalists and media barons, pay
supporters and fund election campaigns.
Although Mr Cavallo's de-regulation and privatisation policies have
significantly curbed corruption, company executives still say bureaucrats
and members of Congress expect inducements to take - or not to take -
decisions affecting their companies. For instance, a trade association of
multinational companies recently rejected an approach by a congressional
official with an 'offer' to approve an intellectual property bill stalled in
Congress.

<TEXT>
A BANKRUPT Japanese company pleaded guilty, in a US federal court in Nevada
yesterday, to four criminal charges involving a fradulent scheme to oversell
memberships of a golf course, the Justice Department said, Reuter reports
from Washington.
It said Ken International, which developed golf courses in Japan and the US,
pleaded guilty to charges of money laundering and transferring fraudulent
proceeds through foreign commerce into the US.
The company and its sole shareholder, Mr Ken Mizuno, had conspired with
another Japanese company to sell too many memberships at the Ibaragi Country
Club in Japan.
Although the two companies had advertised that they would sell only 1,830
full memberships in the club, they sold 52,000 memberships, valued at
Dollars 800m (Pounds 530m), from 1988 to 1991. Of this amount, Ken
International sent Dollars 250m to the US.
As part of the plea-bargaining deal entered before a federal judge in Las
Vegas, Ken International agreed that it would forfeit assets of Dollars
265m, according to the US Justice Department.
According to court papers, Ken International in the US had engaged in
numerous financial transactions with the fraudulently obtained money, and
had sought to conceal or disguise the source of the funds.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Californian tax row near resolution: New law addresses
foreign protests at unitary system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Pete Wilson of California today will sign into law a bill to change
the state's controversial unitary system of taxation.
The new law, which addresses most of the complaints by foreign companies and
governments at the unitary system, sounds the bell for the last round in a
decade-old legal fight between California and Barclays Bank of the UK, which
has challenged the constitutionality of the state's tax system.
As soon as Mr Wilson has signed the bill, the US solicitor-general is
expected to file a brief with the US Supreme Court arguing that the new
legislation renders the Barclays complaint moot, and so the court should
leave in place a decision by California's supreme court in favour of the
state.
Barclays and the UK government will respond with briefs by the end of next
week, then the Supreme Court would be expected to announce whether it will
hear the case or dismiss it outright on November 1.
At stake is some Dollars 533m (Pounds 353m) of tax refunds California would
owe Barclays and other foreign-owned companies if it lost the case, as well
as an estimated Dollars 354m the state believes it would be able to assess
in taxation if it won.
Besides, the state could have another Dollars 3.1bn at risk if any Supreme
Court condemnation of unitary taxation were extended to US-owned companies.
The Clinton administration has been buffeted between its promise to back
California in the lawsuit and pressure from US businesses and foreign
governments, particularly the UK, to uphold the principles of the
international taxation system which are seen to be challenged by unitary
taxation.
California's new legislation might diminish the likelihood that the Supreme
Court will decide to hear the Barclays case, but the principal factor
prompting that legislation - the UK's threat to retaliate against US
companies - reinforces the Barclays arguments about the unconstitutionality
of unitary taxation.
All in all, lawyers on both sides believe the chances that the Supreme Court
will take the case are less than even.
One piquant element in the affair is the understanding that the principal
author of the brief from the solicitor-general's office is Mr Kent Jones,
who just a year ago wrote the Bush administration's brief against
California.

He had surrendered to authorities under a plea-bargaining arrangement.
The prosecutor-general's office yesterday said the deal had been agreed on
Monday night after weeks of negotiations with lawyers for Mr Ochoa. He was
accused of drug trafficking, illicit enrichment and illegal use of
airstrips.
Mr Ochoa also agreed to hand over properties and land worth Dollars 2m

crimes, the equivalent of Dollars 10,400.
Prosecutors had asked for a 20-year sentence for Mr Ochoa.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Resignation puts spotlight on Mexican media
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE limits to Mexico's new democratic reforms have been underlined by the
resignation of a leading independent radio commentator, who says he was told
not to interview prominent members of the leftist opposition party.
Mr Miguel Angel Granados Chapa, one of Mexico's best-known political
commentators, said the Interior Ministry put pressure on the radio station,
Radio Mil, to block his interviews with opposition figures, and implicitly
threatened to withdraw one of its radio licences if it refused.
Both the ministry and the radio station deny there was any political
pressure to censor Mr Granados Chapa. However, the allegations have fuelled
concerns that the government will put pressure on the media to ignore Mr
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the candidate of the leftist Party of Democratic
Revolution, in the run-up to next August's president election.
Opposition leaders in Mexico are only occasionally interviewed on radio, and
hardly at all on pro-government television. While there is a growing number
of independent newspapers, many are subsidised by government hand-outs and
advertisements that appear as articles, and as such are subject to political
interference.
The recently passed political reforms give opposition parties the right to
buy television advertisements, and set limits on campaign contributions, but
do not address government or media self-censorship.
On September 20 Mr Granados Chapa broadcast an interview with Mr Cardenas.
Immediately afterwards the owners of the radio station asked that subsequent
interviews be cleared with them, Mr Granados Chapa said. The radio
commentator resigned rather than accede to the request.
Mr Granados Chapa said the owners had been pressured into issuing the
instructions by the Interior Ministry.
Mr Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido, interior minister, said no pressure was put
on Radio Mil to block interviews with the opposition, and insisted that
radio and other media were free to interview anyone.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton won applause yesterday for his healthcare reform plan
from one of the US's most potent lobbying groups: the elderly.
Mr Clinton was repeatedly cheered as he promised a meeting of the American
Association of Retired Persons in Culver City, California, that his proposed
reforms would preserve and make better the existing Medicare system under
which the government provides health coverage to the elderly.
'There's one thing I want to say over and over again to the AARP membership
of this nation, and that is that our plan maintains the Medicare programme,'
Mr Clinton said.
The president also won warm applause for two elements of the plan which have
been crucial in winning the support of the AARP: the inclusion of the cost
of prescription drugs in Medicare coverage, and an expansion of coverage for
long-term care.
The long-term care benefit, which is intended to allow elderly people to
receive nursing care at home, would be phased in between the years 1996 and
2000, Mr Clinton said.
'We're not going to be able to do all of this at once. We have to work in
the system and make sure we have the funding before we undertake programmes
we can't pay for,' he cautioned.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Senior minister calls for impeachment of judges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Argentine economy minister, Mr Domingo Cavallo, is to call for the
impeachment in Congress of two Supreme Court judges, who have accused their
colleagues of having suppressed a politically sensitive judgment, writes
John Barham from Buenos Aires.
However, Justice Augusto Belluscio, one of the two judges involved, plans to
sue Mr Cavallo - who last week accused him of corruption - for slander.
The justice has called on four of his eight colleagues to resign so as to
restore the Supreme Court's political independence.
A judge at a lower level has begun to investigate the allegations by Justice
Belluscio that first gave rise to the mud-slinging, namely that he and his
supreme court colleague, Justice Enrique Petracchi, claimed that
pro-government colleagues had attempted to suppress a judgment which could
have cost the central bank anywhere between Dollars 12m (Pounds 7.95m) and
Dollars 2bn.
Mr Cavallo then claimed that the two judges had tried to use the scandal to
damage the government in the approach to congressional elections last
Sunday, when the ruling Peronist party achieved considerable gains.
The fracas underlines the fragility of Argentina's legal system.
Mr Maximo Bomchil, a leading Buenos Aires lawyer, said yesterday: 'There is
a crisis of justice in Argentina which we have never seen before. This
deterioration is reflected in the Supreme Court.'

TAIWANESE opponents of a joint venture deal with British Aerospace to build
regional jet aircraft in Taiwan scored a success yesterday when the minister
sponsoring the deal said he might quit as a director of Taiwan Aerospace
Corporation, BAe's joint venture partner.
Mr Yang Shih-chien, deputy minister of economic affairs, said: 'It would not
be bad to have a more detached position.' His statement comes a week after
the resignation of Mr Denny Ko, TAC's president and the man who signed the
original joint venture agreement with BAe in January 1993.
Opposition politicians, who had called for Mr Yang's resignation from TAC's
board, yesterday renewed their attacks on the proposed joint venture, Avro.
They accused BAe of not guaranteeing technology transfer for the development
of a new model, the RJX.
The deal is part of BAe's strategy to improve profitability - the RJ series
of aircraft, which would be built partly in Taiwan, loses money for the
company.
The latest attack and Mr Yang's statement will be the backdrop to a new
round of talks between BAe and Taiwan later this month.
These are aimed at finalising the arrangements for the transfer to Taiwan of
technology and development expertise, and outstanding legal issues.
But opposition politicians and bank lenders have attacked the joint venture
as politically, rather than commercially, inspired.

THE Clinton White House yesterday produced an impressive lobbying display,
demonstrating that although the North American Free Trade Agreement may be
down it can by no means be counted out.
Called to the White House were the top executives of the big three US motor
companies and dozens of their suppliers. After pep talks from Vice-
President Al Gore, Treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen and 'Nafta tsar' William
Daley - put in charge of lobbying by President Bill Clinton - the executives
were bussed to Congress to talk to wavering congressmen about the virtues of
the pact.
Along the way they were marched to press briefings, where they dutifully
reported that they would be hiring new workers if the agreement was passed,
but that jobs would be lost if it failed.
Mr Robert Eaton, chairman of Chrysler Corporation, said that the Mexican car
market would grow by 36 per cent between now and the year 2000. 'We're going
to be in that market, I can guarantee you,' he said. 'If Nafta doesn't pass,
we'll have to tool those vehicles down there.'
Mexico requires motor companies to export two cars for every vehicle
imported. This would end under Nafta.
US trade officials say American car exports to Mexico would rise from 1,000
to 60,000 in Nafta's first year of operation. But the pact's opponents say
US carmakers and their suppliers willl move production facilities to Mexico
to take advantage of the cheaper labour.

FT  06 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Steel producers in sight of pact - US
industry groups optimistic about multilateral agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REPRESENTATIVES of steel-producing countries, meeting this week in Geneva,
seem finally on the road to agreement on the multilateral steel agreement
which has eluded them in almost four years of negotiations.
'The ultimate deal is still at least a month away,' said one observer close
to the US negotiators. 'But that is to be expected. They are changing the
way governments intervene in steel production.' It is a complex task.
US producers of specialty steel are anxious for a deal. Mr Skip Hartquist,
one of their lawyers, said: 'The elements are there to reach an agreement.
However, I'm still sceptical that the Europeans really want a deal.'
The optimism by US industry groups stems in part from the seriousness with
which Washington is addressing the MSA talks. A flurry of meetings last week
made clear that the Clinton administration will not tie the fortunes of the
MSA - or indeed the Uruguay Round - to the whims of the big integrated steel
companies.
Last Tuesday a delegation of steel-using manufacturers met Mr Mickey Kantor,
the US trade representative, and later in the day they went to the White
House to see Mr W. Bowman Cutter of the National Economic Council.
The users stated their opposition to a steel import monitoring programme
requested by the big steel companies. Mr Jon Jenson, for the users' group,
said monitoring was unnecessary: steel demand and prices were firm, imports
stable, and capacity utilisation high.
He warned that such a scheme would 'bully our trading partners into limiting
shipments and raising prices of steel needed by US manufacturers to produce
world competitive prices'. Furthermore, it would cripple the
administration's efforts to negotiate an MSA.
The steel users also expressed concern over the request by the big US
producers that the administration quickly replace Mrs Anne Brunsdale, an
outgoing International Trade Commissioner, with a steel industry advocate.
The users, however, urged against politicisation of the ITC seat which
'would undermine the integrity of US trade law'.
Later, top executives from LTV, USX and Bethlehem Steel - prominent among
the 'Big Steel' producers - met Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, and
Mr Kantor. They were joined, at the administration's invitation, by Mr
Kenneth Iverson, chairman of Nucor Corporation, the country's largest
minimill producer and an aggressive free trader.
Mr Iverson's presence signalled the administration's determination to listen
to viewpoints other than those of the integrated producers, and in the end
the officials rejected the monitoring programme and said no decision had yet
been made about Mrs Brunsdale's successor.
Before the MSA talks broke off in March 1992 the negotiators had whittled
the number of permissible steel aids to four: environmental, research and
development, plant closing and worker retraining.
US steel companies, however, refused to give up the protection they could
glean from the US anti-dumping regime. In fact, they would not even agree to
consultations on trade cases before they were filed.
Although Big Steel was perfectly prepared to do without an MSA and seek
protection under US trade laws, there were numerous US parties more willing
to compromise to get an MSA, including the two largest minimill producers.

FT  06 OCT 93 / World Trade News: UK-Peruvian accord marks investment drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor

<TEXT>
PERU and Britain signed this week a mutual investment protection and
promotion agreement. The accord was signed in London by the Peruvian foreign
minister, Mr Efrain Goldenberg, who is leading a business delegation from
Lima to Europe.
The agreement is part of an effort by the government of President Alberto
Fujimori to open the country to foreign investment. The aim is also to
stimulate foreign interest in a sweeping Peruvian privatisation programme
and to persuade foreign companies to look again at the country following
gains by the government against terrorists.
The group, which includes legislators, businessmen, government officials and
stock exchange representatives, moves on today to France and then to
Germany. Members of the group said there was a growing international
interest in the stock exchange - the capitalisation of which has doubled
this year - and in direct investment, particularly in mining.
Companies from neighbouring Chile are among those looking at the
privatisation of the country's electricity utilities. The proposed
privatisations also include state mining assets and the telephone company.
Mr Fujimori said last week the leader of the guerrilla group Sendero
Luminoso, Abimael Guzman, had requested a peace accord with the government.
However, despite this, bombings by Sendero have over the last week blacked
out some areas of the capital.

FT  06 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Norway seeks US go-ahead for whaling
</HEADLINE>

NORWAY said yesterday it would seek US agreement for a limited resumption of
commercial whaling, after a decision by President Bill Clinton to delay
imposing trade sanctions against Oslo for breaking an international ban on
such whaling.
The president said on Monday that Norway's resumption this year of
commercial hunting of Minke whales, defying a 1985 International Whaling
Commission moratorium, merited sanctions under US law.
However, Mr Clinton told Congress that US objectives would be best achieved
by delaying such a move 'until we have exhausted all good-faith efforts to
convince Norway to follow agreed conservation measures'. Mrs Gro Harlem
Brundtland, Norwegian prime minister, responded by saying that Norway would
set no commercial quotas for its whalers for next year until after the next
meeting of the IWC in Mexico next May.
Even so, officials in Olso made clear that Norway would try to persuade the
US at the IWC meeting to support a resumption of limited commercial whale
catches. 'That is definitely our purpose,' a Foreign Ministry official said.
Norway decided to defy the IWC moratorium earlier this year after the
commission had voted to keep it in place, despite a recommendation by its
scientific committee for a limited harvesting of the Minke whale. For the
1993 season, Oslo allowed its whalers a commercial quota of 160 Minke, of
which 156 were caught.
Mrs Brundtland and Mr Johan Joergan Holst, foreign minister, have lobbied
hard in Washington to avoid sanctions. Their efforts seem to have been
helped by the goodwill which Norway has amassed through its mediation which
led to the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement last month.
Norway, with annual exports to the US worth about Dollars 2bn (Pounds
1.32bn), had feared retaliation against its fish exports, worth some Dollars
70m. Its salmon exports to the US are subject to anti-dumping duties.

FT  06 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Hungary sets up investment promotion
agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNGARY yesterday set up eastern Europe's first independent investment
promotion agency, marking a new maturity of the region's solicitation of
international investors.
In 1990 western business interest in the former communist countries of the
region was feverish and the new democratic governments could afford to wait
for approaches. But recession in eastern and western Europe has inhibited
capital flows and sharpened competition for investment.
Hungary has attracted more than Dollars 5.5bn (Pounds 3.64bn) of foreign
direct investment since 1989, and claims this represents more than half the
total put into east Europe.
However, foreign investment in Hungary peaked in 1991 at Dollars 1.7bn and
is forecast to slow to Dollars 1.5bn this year.
'The beautiful days are over and we have to struggle with a new and more
difficult environment,' said Mr Bela Kadar, Hungarian minister for
international economic relations.
Yesterday, ITD Hungary, an investment and trade development agency modelled
partly on those of Scotland and Ireland, was founded. ITD Hungary said it
would take a 'targeted and proactive' approach. 'We have learned that new
and more sophisticated methods are required to attract quality, greenfield
investment.'
ITD aims to provide a one-stop shop for western investors, who have had to
deal directly with overlapping branches of government. The new agency also
plans to focus on drawing western investors into the motor components, food
processing and tourism sectors.
Hungary puts particular emphasis on motor components because of the
country's strong combination of developed skills and wages that are low
compared with western levels.
Until the latest initiatives, the main device to promote foreign investment
has been the tax incentive. Hungary granted tax holidays for five years to
joint ventures in preferred sectors.
But the current law is to expire at year-end. Also, complaints about
discrimination against domestic investors and Finance Ministry concerns at
the mortgaging of future tax revenue have induced a change in regulations.
The latest draft proposes tax relief for reinvested dividends and for
companies in high-technology sectors, but on a largely discretionary basis.
Whatever the outcome, Hungary's investment regime will remain more generous
than those in Poland and the Czech Republic, which have phased out almost
all tax advantages for foreign investors.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Cutting the links could be a long job: Individual Australian
states 'might retain the monarch if they wished'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CANBERRA

<TEXT>
WANTED: an eminent Australian, aged 35-plus, with no political predilections
and a clear diary after the year 2000.
The committee advising Australia's federal government on how to go about
replacing the British monarch with an Australian head of state yesterday
concluded the change could be effected with little alteration to the
country's constitution.
The Queen and her governor-general - whose job is to represent the British
monarch as head of state in Australia - could be replaced by an apolitical
Australian figurehead.
But the Republic Advisory Committee also acknowledged that it 'would be
legally possible' for the constitution to permit individual Australian
states to retain the British monarch as their head of government, should
they wish. It suggested state powers be clarified in this regard, depending
on whether or not such a possibility was thought desirable.
Mr Malcolm Turnbull, the lawyer-cum-merchant banker who chaired the Republic
Advisory Committee, later admitted cutting Australia's constitutional ties
to Britain could be a long process, involving several referenda.
'Will we be a republic in 2001? That is going to require a lot of work,' he
told the National Press Club in Canberra. 'It's not something that is going
to fall into the republicans' lap like an overripe fruit.'
The Turnbull committee was not asked to consider the merits of republicanism
 -merely to look at the legal and constitutional implications of ousting the
existing system.
This dampened opposition to the report itself, although the government's
critics fired a few salvoes regardless. 'The real question is not how we
achieve change but whether such change is either warranted or desirable,'
snapped Mr John Hewson, opposition leader.
What the committee did consider, briefly, was whether a head of state was
necessary - no minor question, since the annual cost is put at about
ADollars 11m (Pounds 4.7m). It concluded that for 'symbolic' reasons, as
well as for the convenience of having someone to perform ceremonial duties,
strong advantages attached to retaining one.
'Parliament can provide for as lavish, or as spartan, a life-style for the
(head of state) as it wishes,' added the report. From this premise, the
committee went on to enumerate potential qualifications for the job, duties
involved, and who should elect - and if necessary - dismiss the head of
state. There were few firm conclusions, but a long list of the options
available.
The committee, however, spent some time debating what powers an Australian
head of state should have if the Senate refused to support a government
money bill. This happened in 1975, prompting the governor-general to
exercise his powers to dismiss the prime minister, and an election was duly
called. The possibility of a repeat scenario has been mooted recently,
because the government's budget has been stalled in the Senate for almost
two months, but few observers think this a likely outcome.
Tempers flared in Canberra yesterday, where the government is still
struggling to get its budget proposals, first unveiled in mid-August,
through the Senate. Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, cut question time
short and left the chamber, after the opposition heckled Mr Ralph Willis,
finance minister.
The Turnbull committee decided there were several possibilities: to continue
existing conventions; give the new 'head of state' formal powers of
dismissal if the government breached the constitution (by spending money it
was not authorised to raise); to provide in the constitution for an
automatic dissolution of both houses of parliament in this situation, or
remove the senate's power to reject or delay money bills. Tactfully, the
committee gave no hint of its preferred answer.
Union leaders in Canberra yesterday reached agreement with the government on
an industrial relations reform package, which could significantly extend
devolved wage-fixing, or 'enterprise bargaining'. The two sides seemed
yesterday to have reached a compromise on the issue of non-union employees
entering enterprise agreements.

PAKISTAN goes to the polls today with opinion surveys showing the two main
contenders in the general election running almost neck and neck.
Ms Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister, was judged by many observers
to be slightly ahead of Mr Mohammed Nawaz Sharif, a successor in office who
resigned this summer after months of political turmoil.
But, given the rudimentary state of opinion polling in Pakistan, few
independent forecasters predicted the results with any certainty
Mr Farhad Zaidi, editor of the Moslem daily newspaper, said yesterday that
Ms Bhutto's Pakistan People's party (PPP) would 'probably' win Punjab
province, the richest and most populous of Pakistan's four provinces and so
would 'probably' win overall.
The general election is being held after Mr Sharif was persuaded by army
generals to resign in July after a power struggle with President Ghulam
Ishaq Khan, who also quit.
The main parties will have to contend with the Pakistan Islamic Front, an
alliance of Islamic parties. Its performance will indicate the extent of
support for fundamentalism.
The speed with which the army and bureaucracy ended the last two governments
 -Ms Bhutto's in 1990 and Mr Sharif's this year - has caused widespread
disillusion with electoral politics. One opinion poll has shown that Mr
Moeen Qureshi, the interim prime minister who has announced radical economic
reforms, has an 85 per cent support rating - more than Ms Bhutto and Mr
Nawaz Sharif combined.
Pakistan's caretaker cabinet yesterday approved draft ordinances to stop MPs
switching sides after being elected on the platform of a political party and
to free state television from state control, Reuter adds from Islamabad. A
flurry of floor-crossing had undermined Mr Sharif's government.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Rabin and Arafat to hold Cairo talks
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BARELY three weeks after reluctantly shaking hands with Mr Yassir Arafat on
the White House lawn, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, is due in
Cairo today to hold a first working meeting with the Palestine Liberation
Organisation leader to discuss the logistics of the autonomy plan for the
occupied territories.
At the hastily arranged meeting the two are expected to try to agree on a
venue for lower-level talks next week on the autonomy details, as well as to
discuss the escalating tension in the occupied territories since the joint
declaration of principles on autonomy was signed in Washington on September
13.
PLO officials in Tunis said Mr Arafat would specifically broach the issues
of Palestinian refugees, 'removal of Jerusalem's isolation' from the peace
process and 'the end to daily repressive measures' in Gaza and the West
Bank.
Mr Arafat, who flew into Cairo yesterday afternoon, is certain to reiterate
his protests about the recently intensified Israeli army crackdown on
violent Palestinian activists in the territories. In Gaza yesterday, Israeli
undercover troops shot dead a gunman loyal to Mr Arafat's mainstream Fatah
faction of the PLO. Witnesses said he had dropped his weapon and was stuck
on a barbed wire fence when the soldiers opened fire.
Two other Palestinians were killed last weekend, several dozen have been
arrested, and this has in turn triggered a number of attacks on Israeli
targets, including the suicide bombing of an Israeli bus in the West Bank on
Monday.
Mr Arafat wrote to complain to Mr Rabin at the weekend about the military
operations and said on Monday in Algiers that Israel had offered to meet the
PLO to 'get the situation in hand'. Mr Rabin is understood then to have
suggested today's quickly-organised meeting in Cairo.
The PLO said it was hoped the Rabin-Arafat meeting, arranged at the Israeli
prime minister's initiative, would mark 'a new starting point for the
negotiations, after the spirit of the peace accord was violated by the
Israeli army's repressive measures'.
Israeli officials said merely that Mr Rabin wanted to meet Mr Arafat in
person 'to dispel any illusions or misunderstandings' relating to the
autonomy deal and 'smooth the start' of next week's negotiations. Mr Rabin
has repeatedly dismissed PLO charges the offensive against 'wanted'
Palestinians undermines the accord, arguing it is in the interests of both
sides that violent opponents of the accord be subdued.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said in Cairo he would join the meeting and
'if anything is needed, we are ready to help'.
Today marks the 20th anniversary of the start of the 1973 Arab-Israeli war,
the last conflict between Egypt and Israel before Mr Mubarak's predecessor,
the late Mr Anwar Sadat, embarked on the path that led to the 1979
Israeli-Egyptian peace accord.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Growth of Japan surplus slackens
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S current account surplus expanded to Dollars 7.23bn (Pounds 4.77bn)
in August, slightly less than the market had expected. This represented a
slower growth of the surplus.
The August current account surplus is compared with Dollars 6.73bn in the
equivalent month of 1992 and still puts Japan on track to exceed last year's
surplus of Dollars 117.55bn, a big factor in strained trade relations with
the US.
Tokyo economists are expected to reduce their consensus forecast for a
Dollars 144bn surplus this year, in the light of the new figures.
'Import volumes are down, but export volumes are down a little more,' said
Mr James Vestal, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Japan. He
forecasts a Dollars 133bn surplus for the year.
In yen terms, imports fell by 10 per cent and exports by 13 per cent. The
dollar trade surplus accordingly fell slightly, from Dollars 9.08bn in
August 1992 to Dollars 8.97bn in August this year.
Imports can be expected to go on falling, on the evidence of the weakness of
domestic demand highlighted by the latest statistics.
An Industrial Bank of Japan survey shows that companies plan to reduce
investment on plant and equipment by 2.3 per cent this year, the second year
of decline. Manufacturers, saddled with over-capacity built up during the
buoyant growth of the end of the 1980s, will cut capital investment more
heavily than service industries, said the bank's survey of 3,678 companies.
Leasing contracts concluded in August fell by an annualised 13 per cent, the
17th month of decline, the Japan Leasing Association announced yesterday.
Machine tool orders, another bellwether of the industrial economy, fell by
19.9 per cent to Y40.6bn (Pounds 253m), the lowest since this series of
records began 10 years ago, the Japan machine tool builders' industry
association said.

NORTH and South Korea yesterday held their first consultations since January
as Pyongyang faced a possible mid-October deadline to resolve the issue of
nuclear inspections.
North Korea proposed the meeting after the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) last week declared Pyongyang was violating the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty by not allowing inspections of nuclear facilities.
Mr Han Sung-joo, the South Korean foreign minister, has suggested that North
Korea has only about two weeks to achieve progress in nuclear inspection
talks with the IAEA and South Korea before the issue is transferred to the
UN Security Council, which could impose economic sanctions.
But North Korea refused to make concessions at yesterday's meeting at the
truce village of Panmunjom, which was called to discuss the exchange of
presidential special envoys.
Pyongyang demanded that South Korea halt joint military exercises with the
US and stop seeking international support in dealing with the North Korean
nuclear issue before the meeting of presidential envoys took place.
Seoul has rejected those conditions unless Pyongyang first agrees to allow
full nuclear inspections by both the IAEA and South Korea. South Korea also
proposed the presidential representatives should first discuss the nuclear
issue before other bilateral matters are negotiated.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Hosni Mubarak won predictable backing to remain Egypt's head of
state for a further six years in Monday's referendum, with official results
yesterday showing 95 per cent of voters supported him, Mark Nicholson
reports from Cairo.
Mr Hassan al-Alfi, interior minister, told reporters that 15.1m Egyptians
voted for Mr Mubarak, who was the sole candidate, and just 583,467 against.
The turnout was put at 84 per cent of 18.9m eligible voters. Mr Alfi said
226,020 ballots were spoiled, giving Mr Mubarak more than 96 per cent of
valid votes cast.
Both the result and turnout are in line with figures given after the
previous referendums which returned Mr Mubarak to his first two terms as
Egypt's leader, a role he has held since replacing the assassinated Mr Anwar
Sadat in 1981. The result of the October 1987 referendum was 97 per cent in
favour, with an 88 per cent turnout.
While the referendum was, as one diplomat put it, 'not so much an election
as a chance to pledge allegiance', many journalists and diplomats who toured
polling stations on Monday considered that official turnout figures strained
credibility.
Several stations visited in and around Cairo were receiving barely a trickle
of voters and, even allowing that many public sector employers bussed voters
from work to the polling stations at the end of the day, it appeared in many
places that a majority of locals had not voted at all.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Fall in NZ budget deficit forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MS RUTH Richardson, New Zealand finance minister, yesterday forecast a sharp
reduction in the budget deficit to NZDollars 1.44bn (Pounds 522m) in the
year to June 30, down from the NZDollars 2.28bn she predicted in her August
budget.
Ms Richardson made the forecast - and a series of others which she said
proved that the economy was improving - in the so-called 'opening of the
books exercise'. This detailed mini-budget statement was issued a a month
before the November 6 general election.
Since it was elected three years ago the pro-business National party
government has consistently claimed that the previous Labour government
deliberately kept secret the parlous state of the finances of the then
state-owned Bank of New Zealand.
In the last budget Ms Richardson said she would legislate to ensure every
government would issue an 'honest' statement on the economic health of the
country.
However the legislative timetable prevented the law being passed, and
opposition parties say the exercise has been turned into a political one
staged to gain votes. Dr Michael Cullen, Labour finance spokesman, had
predicted the budget deficit announced yesterday would be below that
announced on budget night.
Ms Richardson said the improved fiscal outlook since the budget arose from
higher than expected tax receipts since June, sharp falls in local and
international interest rates and a rise in the exchange rate. 'These factors
contribute to a substantial reduction in debt servicing payments,' she said.
She added that there had also been a sharp fall in social welfare payments
due to a lower number of unemployed.
The economy was expected to grow by 2.9 per cent in 1993-94 and up to 3.5
per cent in 1995-96, Ms Richardson said. The budget deficit would steadily
shrink over the coming years, and would be almost eradicated in three years'
time with a deficit of just NZDollars 54m.
Tax income had picked up sharply since the budget, and government spending
as a percentage of gross domestic product would fall from 37.9 per cent this
year to 34.6 per cent in 1995-96.
Net public debt as a percentage of GDP would fall from 47.9 per cent in
1992-93 to 44.6 per cent in 1995-96.
Ms Richardson said business investment was projected to grow by 12 per cent
this year. There was also high levels of consumer confidence and spending
and some lift in house prices was expected.
Inflation would remain within the range of nil to 2 per cent.

INDIA'S Central Bureau of Investigation yesterday filed charges against
leaders of the Hindu Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), accusing them of
instigating the destruction of the mosque at Ayodhya last December.
The charges against Mr Lal Krishna Advani, BJP leader, and nearly 40 others
were filed in a special magistrate's court at Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, where
Ayodhya is located. They come just weeks before regional elections are held
in four Indian states. The elected BJP governments of these states - Uttar
Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Himachal Pradesh - were dismissed in
the aftermath of the Ayodhya incident, when nearly 2,000 people lost their
lives in religious riots across the country.
The bureau said yesterday the Hindu party leaders had been charged with
offences including criminal conspiracy, intentional destruction and defiling
of a place of worship, criminal trespass, and intimidation of public
servants. The defendants 'participated in this conspiracy, or were
instrumental. . .in this conspiracy which resulted in the demolition of the
disputed structure'.
The BJP said the charges were 'a desperate move by a desperate government to
stall the BJP's growing popularity'.

MALAWIAN President Kamuzu Banda was making good progress in a Johannesburg
hospital yesterday after an operation to remove excess fluid from the brain,
a hospital spokesman said, Reuter reports from Johannesburg.
Dr Banda, believed by diplomats to be in his 90s, was flown to Johannesburg
from Malawi on Saturday and underwent surgery on Sunday. 'The operation was
performed in order to remove excess fluid from the brain. His physical
condition is satisfactory and a good prognosis is expected,' the spokesman
said.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Premier attacked over war apology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PREMIER Morihiro Hosokawa of Japan yesterday came under fire in parliament
for extending his recent apologies for Japan's war record to include allied
as well as Asian victims.
Mr Shintaro Ishihara, a staunch nationalist in the opposition Liberal
Democratic party, told the lower house: 'Japan does feel guilty for what it
did in Asian countries, but there is no need for us to apologise to the
allied countries that won the war, like Britain, the US, Holland and
France.'
Mr Hosokawa has aroused the anger of traditionalists in the LDP by facing
Japan's wartime responsibilities more explicitly than any prime minister.
Most, but not all, his supporters in the seven-party coalition see this as
essential to Japan's attempts to take a more prominent part in international
diplomacy.
But Mr Hosokawa's apologies for Japan's wartime aggression, first voiced
soon after he became prime minister in early August, have prompted protests
both from the opposition and inside his own coalition. 'There were many
people from the allied countries in Asia during the war and they endured
great pain. It is natural that they too be included,' Mr Hosokawa argued
yesterday.
Mr Ishihara's attack is significant because he is a popular symbol of
nationalist sentiment, as author of a best-seller, The Japan That Can Say
No.
In an emotional speech, Mr Ishihara declared: 'Japan also suffered in the
war. Many were killed in the atomic bombing but we've not heard one word of
apology. . . You have erred in your war remarks and I demand that you admit
it.' Mr Hosokawa countered that he was fully aware of Japan's wartime
sufferings.
Other LDP members of parliament alleged Mr Hosokawa's apologies had
triggered compensation claims from former British prisoners of war, and from
Asian women forced into wartime prostitution. The government's response is
that compensation was legally settled in the post-war San Francisco peace
treaty.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Ozone hole is getting bigger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Antarctic ozone hole is deeper than ever this year, scientists from the
British Antarctic Survey reported yesterday. Two-thirds of the atmosphere's
ozone layer, which protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation,
has been destroyed by man-made chemicals, mainly chlorofluorocarbons, over
most of the Antarctic continent.
Mr Jonathan Shanklin, a meteorologist at BAS headquarters in Cambridge, said
recent observations from Scott and Halley research stations confounded
predictions there would be some improvement this year on last year's record
ozone destruction.
'This demonstrates once again how little we know about the atmosphere,' Mr
Shanklin said. 'But it also shows how important it is to stop putting CFCs
and other chlorine-containing chem-icals into the atmosphere.'
CFC production is due to stop in industrialised countries by the end of 1994
but their concentration in the atmosphere may not fall until early next
century.
The hole has been a seasonal phenomenon since the late 1970s, appearing
early in the spring as the sun's rays first strike the cocktail of
ozone-destroying chemicals built up over the pole during the long Antarctic
winter. It is deepest in October, then breaks up.
The hole is not yet affecting any populated regions, but is likely to
increase ultraviolet radiation temporarily over southern Chile and Argentina
over the next two months.
A similar but shallower seasonal hole has begun to form over the northern
hemisphere. A record 20 per cent of Arctic ozone was lost this year. The
main effect of ozone loss on human health is to increase cancer risk through
ultraviolet exposure.

<TEXT>
DENMARK'S four-party coalition government, led by Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen,
the Social Democratic party leader, yesterday appeared set to lose its
one-vote majority in the Folketing (parliament).
Mrs Inger Stilling Pedersen, of the coalition Christian People's party, said
that unless the government agreed to pay mothers for staying at home to care
for children, she would resign from her party and become an independent.
Mr Rasmussen, whose government was formed in January, took the threat to his
government calmly, saying that if Mrs Pedersen carried out her plan to
become an independent he would carry on as head of a minority coalition.
Mrs Pedersen's threat to the government followed the opening of a new
session of the Folketing yesterday with a state-of-the-nation speech by the
prime minister.
Mr Rasmussen's coalition has had bad opinion poll ratings recently, causing
friction among the coalition parties. In addition to the Social Democrats
and the Christian People's party these comprise Radical Liberals and the
Centre Democrats.
The next election to the Folketing must be held at the latest in December
next year.
In his state-of-the-nation speech Mr Rasmussen said that the government's
priorities were to fight unemployment, now running at just over 12 per cent,
and to maintain and improve the welfare state.
He promised improvements in the care of the elderly, in the health and
hospital services and in child-care institutions. He also said there would
be a substantial expansion in post-school educational opportunities.
Denmark's current account surplus and its low inflation made such a
programme possible, he said.

   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Des O'Malley has resigned as leader of the opposition Progressive
Democrat party in Ireland, to 'make way for new blood'. He said he was under
no political or personal pressure to do so.
Mr O'Malley, 54, said he would stand for election one more time before
quitting politics altogether. He did not say what his long-term plans were.
A long-time opponent of Mr Charles Haughey within Fianna Fail, he split with
the party leader in 1984, when Mr Haughey had him expelled for publicly
differing with him on Northern Ireland, the contraception issue and internal
party democracy.
He founded the Progressive Democrats (PDs) in 1985, presenting it as the
party of high standards and open government. The party has since had an
influential minority voice holding the balance of power with six out of 166
Dail seats in the coalition government from 1989 to 1992.
It was Mr O'Malley's decision to withdraw his party's support from Fianna
Fail in January 1992, as a series of political and business scandals began
to wash over Mr Haughey, then the prime minister, that precipitated Mr
Haughey's resignation and the formation of a new Fianna Fail-PD coalition,
under the leadership of Mr Albert Reynolds.
Mr O'Malley has been one of the principal proponents of dropping the
republic's constitutional claim to Northern Ireland and, as a member of the
government negotiating team to the 'round-table' talks on the province
during 1992, clashed with his Fianna Fail colleagues in the negotiations,
who insist that any constitutional change should only be made as part of an
overall settlement.
He then fell out with Mr Reynolds over contrasting evidence the two men gave
to the tribunal of inquiry into the beef industry between June and October
of 1992.
It was this disagreement which led to the collapse of the coalition and a
general election.
The tribunal, which was set up to investigate allegations of fraud,
malpractice and political favouritism in Ireland's huge beef industry,
concluded last summer after sitting for two years.
A report of its findings is expected later this year.

FT  06 OCT 93 / France's job creation bill passes hurdle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S National Assembly last night approved a wide series of job creation
measures, including an effective cut in the minimum wage for young workers
and a progressive shift in welfare costs from company payrolls and onto the
state budget.
The draft five-year employment law now goes to the Senate for approval.
The overall thrust of the law is to introduce more flexibility into France's
labour market, from which 3.22m unemployed, or 11.7 per cent of the
potential workforce, now find themselves excluded.
But, despite Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's claim last week to be 'open
to experiment', the government has not proved itself very radical in any one
direction.
None the less, the centre-right government has quietly put a dent in the
country's so-called Smic minimum wage, which has risen twice as fast as real
wages over the past 20 years and thus been blamed for pricing less-skilled,
and often younger, workers out of the job market. Henceforth, employers
would be able to pay an 18-26 year-old only 90 per cent of the Smic -
currently around FFr5,500 (Pounds 641) a month, but amounting to more than
FFr8,000 with welfare charges included - provided they provided him or her
with a training instructor.
The draft law also provides for a more flexible formula for Sunday trading,
top-up payments to people who take a job paying less than their unemployment
entitlement, and reduced social welfare charges for companies which take on
new workers.
But over the longer term, the bill aims to take the cost of family
allowances for lower-paid workers (less than 1.5 times the Smic) off company
payrolls and onto the state budget by 1998. This would be an historic shift,
bringing France more into line with most other EC countries which finance
more of their welfare state out of general taxation.
Steering a middle course, the government has eschewed any frontal attack on
the Smic that would infuriate the unions as well as imposing by legislation
any reduction in the current 39-hour regular working week that would anger
its business lobby. But it is no longer the Socialist opposition and the
unions who are touting the notion of spreading available work around more
people by cutting working hours.
A Gaullist RPR amendment to reduce welfare costs for companies cutting their
work week to 32 hours was defeated. But as Ms Segolene Royal, a former
Socialist minister, said 'the taboo (about shorter working hours) is now
broken'. As it is, the draft bill encourages the two sides of industry to
negotiate a possible reduction in working hours, provided these are set in
more flexible annual, rather than weekly, limits.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Greek Elections: Greek socialists plan 'social contract' -
Mr Papandreou's party is confident of victory and seeks a fresh start,
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE

<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GREECE'S oppositions socialists are so confident of victory in Sunday's
election that they are already discussing the outline of a 'social contract'
with workers and employers. Early in the campaign, Mr Andreas Papandreou,
leader of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok), held a well-publicised
meeting with members of the Confederation of Greek Industry several days
before his scheduled talks with trade union and agricultural co-operative
leaders.
'There has to be a social partnership. If we're to bring down inflation,
there must be agreement on wages, and not just for a single year. But we
also need a framework for holding prices down,' says Mr Gerasimos Arsenis,
Pasok's economics spokesman. Polls show the socialists maintaining the
three- to five-percentage point lead they held at the start of the campaign.
Even if Pasok's lead over the conservative New Democracy party were to
shrink to one percentage point, as smaller left-wing parties gain support,
Pasok would still win an outright majority because the electoral law heavily
favours the front-running party.
Much has changed since Pasok's first term in office in the 1980s when Mr
Arsenis, then economy minister, was given a mandate to nationalise several
of Greece's biggest private companies through forced capitalisations of debt
owed by state-owned banks.
The result was a prolonged freeze on private sector investment, contributing
to a significant loss of competitiveness in Greek industry just as the
European Community single market approached. This time, Pasok economists
assert, the emphasis would be on promoting development, but not at the
expense of fiscal discipline imposed by the conservatives, which has brought
the government borrowing requirement down from around 17 per cent of gross
domestic product in 1990 to 8.7 per cent last year.
Mr Papandreou has avoided disclosing details of his policy plans beyond
calling for 'a crusade against inflation'. However, he has pledged that a
socialist government would not devalue the drachma, introduce new taxes or
continue the conservatives' privatisation programme.
Privatisation revenues this year were forecast at Dr330bn (Pounds 933m) from
the projected sale of 49 per cent of the state telecoms monopoly, together
with management rights, and of two oil refineries. The socialists say that
public utilities will remain under state control, but they do not rule out
floating some state enterprises on the Athens Stock Exchange.
Pasok's promises raise questions about how the party would cope with a
revenue shortfall this year that the conservatives admit could reach
Dr800bn, equivalent to 6.5 per cent of GDP. The socialists claim that the
shortfall, mainly caused by slower than expected growth in tax receipts,
together with the government's failure to improve collection of tax arrears,
could reach Dr1,000bn by December.
Under the circumstances, a Pasok government would have little margin for
rewarding voters by raising public sector wages, frozen for the past three
years, or increasing pensions. Moreover, the campaign against tax evasion,
estimated to cost the government more than Dr350bn a year in lost revenues,
would have to be stepped up. The socialists' commitment to meeting the
Maastricht targets for economic convergence rule out a return to the
free-spending habits of the 1980s, which helped push the public debt up to
116 per cent of GDP last year.
There is little room for manoeuvre as Greece will be unable to meet this
year's convergence targets.
The growth forecast has already been halved to 1 per cent of GDP, and
inflation for 1993 will remain at about 12 per cent, against a target of
less than 10 per cent.
While there is no official linkage between Maastricht and transfers from EC
structural funds, Mr Papandreou is well aware that if the economy starts
slipping backwards, Greece's partners will call for restrictions on
payments.

<TEXT>
FIGHTING spread across former Yugoslavia yesterday, as Serb leaders accused
the new six-month United Nations mandate for its forces in Bosnia, Croatia
and Macedonia of destroying any chance of peace.
Mr Vladislav Jovanovic, the Yugoslav foreign minister, said the mandate gave
the go-ahead to Zagreb to clamp down on Serb communities in Croatia.
'Singling out Yugoslavia is a roundabout way to enable Croatia to continue
undermining the plan and its aggressive behaviour towards the UN protected
areas,' he told Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency.
In contrast, Croatia praised the Security Council decision. In vaguely
worded terms, it threatens to link the lifting of sanctions on Serbia with
ending the Serbo-Croat conflict in Croatia. Mr Mate Granic, Croatian foreign
minister, said: 'The republic of Croatia has all reasons to be satisfied
with Resolution 871, its general tone and individual provisions.'
However, the resolution fell short of Zagreb's demands to give more muscle
to the 15,000 peacekeepers posted in Croatia. Mr Franjo Tudjman, the
president of Croatia, is frustrated with the UN's failure to force Serb
rebels to renounce their self-styled state, which covers about one-third of
Croatian territory.
Mr Jovanovic later tried to downplay the blow dealt by the terms of the UN
mandate as containing 'only general references to the normalisation of the
situation'.
The UN 17 months ago imposed sanctions on the rump Yugoslav state for the
violent carve-up of neighbouring Bosnia. International mediators have used
the lure of easing sanctions to tempt Serb officials into handing over land
seized during the war in Bosnia.

MR Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Danish prime minister, yesterday made a strong
commitment to maintain and improve the welfare state in a
state-of-the-nation speech at the opening of a new session of the Folketing
(parliament).
Mr Rasmussen, the Social Democratic head of a four-party centre-left
majority coalition, became prime minister in January this year.
He described unemployment, running at a rate of more than 12 per cent, as a
problem which is 'a real threat to the common well-being and the
individual's welfare'. He promised an action plan to help 'the outcasts, the
lonely and the mentally handicapped'.
A strongly expansive fiscal policy, announced earlier this year, was the
government's attempt to get the economy moving and bring down the jobless
total, he said. Mr Rasmussen, who is down in the opinion polls, promised
improvements in health and hospital services, improved services for the
elderly, better opportunities for early retirement for older workers, more
day-care institutions for small children and a steady expansion of places
for post-school job training.
'Can we really afford all the improvements I have named?' he asked.
'Yes. We have a surplus on the current balance of payments and low
inflation. We have the room for manoeuvre,' he said.
'An expensive speech,' was the comment by the opposition Liberal party's
economic policy spokesman, Mr Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the former economy
minister.
He accused the government of using promises of more public expenditure to
buy voters ahead of the next election, which must be held before the end of
1994.

<TEXT>
ILVA, the loss-making, state-run steel group, has unveiled plans to axe over
a quarter of its 40,000-strong workforce in response to EC pressure to cut
Italy's over-capacity and end state subsidies.
The job cuts are part of Ilva's plan to split the group into two companies -
flat products and special steels - in order to privatise.
The project is due to be decided at the end of the month by the Ilva board,
headed by Mr Hayao Nakamura, the Japanese executive brought in earlier this
year to reorganise the group.
According to the plan, 11,600 jobs will be lost between 1994-96, the bulk of
which will come from the workforce producing flat products at Taranto,
Europe's largest steel plant, and Novi Ligure, near Genoa. Some 5,000
workers already laid off will not be rehired.
This is a far more radical solution than originally envisaged. It has been
drawn up in the past three months after the government recognised the EC
would only be satisfied with a clear commitment to rationalise Ilva.
The trades unions have been warned well in advance and their protests are
likely to be directed less at the job cuts than at the redundancy terms,
retraining and investments in fresh employment - especially in the Taranto
area of southern Italy.
The German government was likely to oppose a restructuring plan for the
Spanish steel industry, backed by the European Commission, unless it was
radically changed, officials in Bonn confirmed yesterday, writes Ariane
Genillard in Bonn. Senior officials said the plan, which EC industry
ministers will be asked to approve in November, was 'completely unacceptable
in its present form'.
The plan foresees state aid amounting to Ecu2.77bn (Pounds 2.14bn). German
officials say these state subsidies remain 'much too high'.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Bonn braced for ruling on treaty: The court verdict on
Maastricht is expected next Tuesday
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARRING last-minute flood or pestilence, Germany's constitutional court will
rule next Tuesday on whether the Maastricht treaty on European union is in
conformity with the country's basic law.
The date has been confirmed by senior officials of the court, while
reserving the right to change it at the last minute if the eight learned
red-robed judges in the court's second senate so decide.
Whatever happens, both supporters and opponents of the Maastricht treaty are
on tenterhooks - the decision could allow Germany to ratify the treaty, or
ratify with strings attached. The question is just how tough the conditions
would be.
The concern in government circles in Bonn is that the court may attach
strict conditions, severely restricting Germany's room for manoeuvre in any
future negotiations on further integration in the European Community.
Such restrictions would be profoundly embarrassing for Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, as one of the most enthusiastic proponents of Maastricht, but not
necessarily fatal for the ratification process.
Opponents of the treaty, who have tabled 20 separate complaints before the
constitutional court, still hope, but do not really expect, that the court
may yet decide that the entire treaty be declared void under the
constitution.
'We are in suspense,' says Mr Manfred Brunner, former chef de cabinet to Mr
Martin Bangemann, the senior German commissioner in Brussels, and now the
treaty's most prominent opponent before the court. 'At the very least, I
cannot believe that the constitutional court will accept the automatic
process leading to the final phase of European economic and monetary union.'
Mr Brunner, who was sacked from his job in Brussels for campaigning against
the treaty, hopes the court may decide there should be no final move to Emu
without a referendum in Germany. Given opposition to a single European
currency - 71 per cent were against the abolition of the D-Mark in the
latest opinion poll - such a referendum would probably reject German
participation in Emu.
Such a drastic condition imposed by the court is still regarded as unlikely.
The Foreign Ministry sees three possible outcomes:
that the Maastricht treaty is constitutionally acceptable, but that any
future steps to transfer national sovereignty to EC institutions must be
subject to more restrictive conditions;
that the treaty must be subject to specific legally-binding
'interpretations' to ensure that it is in conformity with the constitution;
that the deposition of Germany's ratification documents in Rome must be
accompanied by unilateral declarations stating that they apply to Germany
only to the extent permitted by the country's written constitution.
If the court does decide on the last course of action, it could present a
difficulty to the government, for no other EC member state has sought
unilaterally to define the application of the treaty.
'We have made it clear to the court that we cannot reopen the treaty,' a
senior government official said yesterday.
'But nobody has deposited such unilateral declarations before.'
The other EC member states would almost certainly have to decide if special
German conditions would amount to a form of treaty amendment.
The main grounds of challenge to the treaty tabled by Mr Brunner and other
challengers, including Green members of the European Parliament and a senior
Justice Ministry official, are that it offends inalienable rights in the
German constitution by transferring national sovereignty to institutions
over which ordinary German citizens have no control.
Mr Brunner also complains that a new article in the German constitution, on
future transfers of sovereignty to Brussels to build a real European union,
fails to contain adequate constitutional safeguards.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Twelve progress on packaging waste disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
EC environment ministers moved closer yesterday to agreeing Community-wide
rules on packaging waste. A majority of the Twelve inclined towards setting
flexible, five-year targets for overall recovery of waste, instead of
ambitious five- and 10-year goals for each type of waste, with prescribed
portions which had to be recycled.
The shift in opinion is partly a result of Germany's experience with its own
recycling legislation, which has sent subsidised German waste exports
flooding into other EC states. The UK, France, The Netherlands, Denmark,
Belgium, Spain, Ireland and Italy have all complained bitterly that
Germany's dumping of waste because of its lack of capacity to deal with its
high targets is stifling their own infant recycling industries, particularly
for plastics, paper and board.
The German minister, Mr Klaus Topfer, began yesterday's discussions by
offering bilateral negotiations to deal with the problem, after France
threatened an import ban at the last environment ministers' meeting in June.
Mr Timothy Yeo, the UK's junior environment minister, said 'clearly we will
pursue (negotiations with Germany) at official level'. The air thus cleared,
ministers agreed in principle that setting ambitious percentages for
different types of recovery - re-use, recycling, incineration and so on -
could quickly lead the EC into the German waste mountain problem.
The proposal had been for 60 per cent recovery of waste over five years,
with 40 per cent recycling, and 90 per cent after 10 years, with 60 per cent
recycling. Ministers now appear likely to settle on the first overall
figure, with equivalence of recovery methods that would be decided at
national level, and to have a review after five years rather than set a
10-year target now.
The Belgian presidency made little headway yesterday in softening UK
opposition to the mixed carbon and energy tax proposal, which has been mired
in controversy for the past 18 months.
The European Commission yesterday attempted to buy a new lease of life for
the tax, which would reach Dollars 10 per barrel of oil equivalent by 2000.
It offered a detailed formula to phase in the levy for the poorest four
member states. But Mr Yeo reaffirmed that 'we are not willing to accept (an
energy tax) imposed by the Community.' He acknowledged, however, that 'this
is an issue which is not going to go away.'

THE European Community yesterday said it was sticking to its optimistic
schedule of bringing Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway into the Community
by January 1995, just as it became clear at ministerial negotiations in
Luxembourg that the hardest part of the enlargement talks has yet to begin.
EC foreign ministers said they expected the negotiations with the four
applicants to be concluded by next March at the latest, for entry by 1995.
They have called an extra ministerial session with the four for next month,
to try to make this date feasible. Privately, however, EC officials
acknowledge that dates may slip. A conclusion by March would in any case be
very tight, since all four countries have to hold referendums on entry.
'It's a question of political will,' one EC negotiator said, and of the
applicants 'defining a decent period of resistance' to EC demands, for fear
that their increasingly Euro-sceptical peoples will see their governments as
a push-over in the negotiations if they settle contentious issues too
quickly.
Sweden is so far top of the class, having closed 10 of the 29 negotiating
chapters for accession; Norway, which joined the negotiations some months
after the others started in February, has only settled seven chapters. The
areas agreed concern issues such as company law, social policy, and freedom
of movement for workers. They mark the conclusion of a second round in the
talks, after the four-month review of applicant country legislation
concluded in June.
In the third round, the Commission is expected to come up with draft
proposals to resolve the most difficult issues in the next four to six
weeks. All four want special regimes to continue paying lavish subsidies to
their Arctic and alpine farmers, and in the Scandinavian case, to finance
regional policies to keep their northern territories populated.
All four also want to retain restrictions on foreigners buying holiday homes
in their countries and to keep their generally higher environmental
standards, which the EC may argue could constitute barriers to trade.
Norway, in addition, has made clear it intends to keep control of its rich
energy and fisheries resources, while Austria wants to carry over unchanged
into its accession accord to the transit treaty regulating environmentally
the flow of EC trucks through its alpine passes, agreed for the European
Economic Area.
If all these issues are resolved, the 12 and the four still have to agree on
how the applicants fit into the foreign policy, security and home affairs
arrangements of Maastricht, and on how much they should pay into the EC
budget.

<TEXT>
INVESTMENT in the western German construction industry has fallen for the
first time in six years, figures from the industry's chief trade association
showed yesterday.
According to the Hauptverband der Deutschen Bauindustrie, investment fell by
a real 0.2 per cent in the first six months of the year compared with the
same period last year. The last fall was in 1987, the association said.
Although the drop is small, it shows the construction sector - typically
viewed as the most robust industrial sector in Germany amid the country's
worst recession since the second world war - is not immune to the downturn
afflicting the manufacturing sector.
The small drop in total investment conceals a pronounced fall in
construction for the industrial sector - orders were down by nearly 10 per
cent.
Public sector construction also fell. This was as a result of the pressure
on central and local government to curb expenditure.

FOUR fifths of Russians do not expect privatisation to make any difference
to their standard of living, according to the findings of a survey from the
Centre for the Study of Public Policy which presents some ominous findings
for western reformers pushing for faster economic change in Russia.
The survey, which questioned nearly 2,000 Russians across the country this
summer, says most think privatisation is having a bad effect on the economy
overall.
Only half of those questioned saw the connection between privatisation and
more goods in the shops.
Although a majority of Russians have already laid plans to invest the
privatisation vouchers issued to them, they remain uncertain about the
implications of privatisation for their work place and how it might affect
their economic behaviour.
Professor Richard Rose of Strathclyde University, author of the study, says:
'The idea of privatisation appears to have penetrated the consciousness of
the great majority of Russians in the way that a 'free gift offer' might. .
. . Most Russians appear to be participating in privatisation without yet
feeling confident that they know what difference it will make.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE following is a declaration by journalists of the Liberal Sevodnya
(Today) newspaper, which was kept out of yesterday's edition by Russia's new
censors:
'AFTER the crushing of the armed uprising by the nationalist-Communist
opposition, the ban on opposition newspapers cannot be considered an
appropriate measure either from a legal, political or moral point of view.
'If the problem is one of genuine subversive activity, then the authorities
can use temporary censorship, allowed for under the state of emergency law,
as well as taking legal action provided for by the press law. . . . the
absurd and harmful orders closing down the opposition press deprives us of
the moral right to support the present political authorities.
'In present conditions, only guaranteed freedom of speech can save the
regime from degeneration and arbitrary rule. Opposition newspapers must be
reinstated immediately.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHIEF villain of the Communist regime - the censor - has returned to
Russia's political stage.
It appeared yesterday that media censorship was part of the state of
emergency declared by President Boris Yeltsin on Sunday night, covering even
some newspapers that have generally supported him.
An article describing panic in the Kremlin on the night of the rebellion by
President Yeltsin's enemies was one of the articles removed by the censor
who visited the offices of Russia's independent Sevodnya newspaper.
Along with this came the banning of at least eight 'opposition' newspapers,
such as Communist Pravda, and the extremist Den (Day).
The other item removed by the censor from yesterday's edition of Sevodnya
was a protest against the closing down of newspapers.
Mr Dmitry Ostalsky, Sevodnya's editor, said yesterday that while he accepted
the right of the censor to edit copy for the sake of a temporary state of
emergency, the rapid restoration of a pluralistic and independent media was
essential for the conduct of fair elections scheduled in December.
'Nobody will take seriously the results of any elections conducted in a
state of emergency,' he said.
Fully in favour of Mr Yeltsin's radical economic reforms, Sevodnya, founded
by Mr Vladimir Gussinsky, chairman of the Most (Bridge) banking and
construction group, is one of the first of the financially independent media
in Russia. Unlike many other papers, it is not even restricted by dependence
on state subsidies.
His views were shared by many in the president's own entourage and among
supporters of his reforms, in the first serious public split over how to
move from Mr Yeltsin's week-long state of emergency to new democratic
elections.
Mr Mikhail Poltoranin, a presidential aide who had been standing in as
information minister, resigned yesterday, apparently in protest at the
censorship. His functions are to be taken over by Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the
first deputy prime minister.
Miss Alla Yarushinskaya, a member of the president's advisory council, told
a radio interviewer that she had 'not joined the defenders of Ostankino TV
centre to see political censorship imposed the next day on newspapers'.
The ban, cited as necessary for maintaining order, even included
middle-of-the-road papers such as Rabochaya Tribuna (Workers Tribune),
funded by a union of industrialists and a large trade union confederation.
'This newspaper has done its best to keep workers off the streets,' said Mr
Alexander Vladislavlev, deputy head of the industrialists' union. The
union's president, Mr Arkady Volsky, meanwhile, went to see the prime
minister to have the ban lifted on Rabochaya Tribuna.
'We must do our best to preserve immediately the young shoots of democracy,'
said Mr Vladislavlev in an interview yesterday. He is also chairman of the
Renewal party, which plans to take part in the December elections.
Mr Yeltsin must move quickly to demonstrate whether the censorship exercised
so far is part of a deliberate policy, or a temporary accident, like some of
the other consequences of his state of emergency.
Some of the bannings were clearly directed at nationalist and Communist
media outlets opposed to Mr Yeltsin. Yesterday, for example, the '600
Seconds' television programme was suspended. The Information Ministry in
Moscow said it had been stopped because it had 'whipped up national, class,
social and religious intolerance'. The show is presented by Mr Alexander
Nevzorov, a hardline nationalist journalist. The programme is popular over
large areas of western Russia.
Three pro-Yeltsin state-funded newspapers were kept off the streets because
their printing house was strafed with bullets. The government's newspaper,
Rossiisskaya Vesti, was seized by the government's own security forces -
presumably by mistake. Others still could not be delivered to addresses near
the White House because the nearby bridge was cut off by tanks involved in
the mopping-up operation.

 -Two regional governors lose their jobs in battle of wills

<TEXT>
WHEN BUSINESSMEN in Russia's Novosibirsk region wrote to President Boris
Yeltsin complaining about the threatened sacking of the local governor, the
reply came from an official in the president's office.
The fact that the letter was not answered by Mr Yeltsin himself was seen as
an example of arbitrary rule from the president in Moscow.
'It's like when the politburo in Communist times controlled everything,
including the government,' Mr Vyacheslav Tyabotin, a spokesman for the
Novosibirsk regional administration, told the Financial Times yesterday.
Having overcome his opponents in Moscow with a show of force, President
Yeltsin has a fine line to tread between dictatorial high-handedness and
reformist determination. It will be difficult enough to find a balance
between vital political reforms devolving power to the regions while
retaining for Moscow enough power to maintain a single financial policy and
a universal tax system.
The sackings yesterday of two powerful regional governors opposed to Mr
Yeltsin was the first salvo in the president's battle to impose his will on
the regions, even though most of the other 88 regional governors support
him.
The two governors sacked - Mr Vitaly Mukha, Novosibirsk regional head, and
Mr A Surat, Amur governor - lost their jobs because they had opposed the
president's dissolution of parliament, a Kremlin statement said.
Mr Yeltsin's previous attempt to fire Mr Mukha failed after the regional
council refused to let him go. On Monday the regional administration
condemned violence by both sides in Moscow, calling for early elections of
president and parliament and urging the inhabitants of this Siberian
province to stay away from rallies and strikes.
Calm has been observed so far, but it is unclear whether some regions will
take protest action against the president's attempts to impose his will on
them directly.
Mr Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, the president of Russia's republic of Kalmykia, last
week hosted a meeting at which regional leaders, most of them from councils,
discussed the possibility of economic sanctions - such as closing railways
and pipelines - to forestall such action.
Having tried to broker peace talks between Mr Yeltsin and Mr Alexander
Rutskoi, the vice-president, Mr Ilyumzhinov has also been given a heavy hint
to fall into line in future: Mr Yeltsin's anti-corruption committee leaked a
report on Monday that he may have been involved in corrupt deals related to
the vice-president.
In a second salvo, a presidential aide said that Mr Yeltsin was considering
whether to dissolve all regional councils, or only those which had opposed
his orders for new elections.
Only half of the councils have come out in support of Mr Yeltsin's decree
dissolving parliament last week and calling new elections. They have all
been concerned to prevent bloodshed from spilling into the regions, but a
meeting of the Federation Council - to represent regional leaders - was
postponed yesterday while the president decides whether the local councils
should be represented on it and, if so, which councils.
Many have toed a cautious line, refraining from voting outright against Mr
Yeltsin's instructions.
The regional council in the Urals region of Perm for instance failed to
obtain a quorum to condemn the dissolution of parliament. But a spokesman
for the Perm administration said yesterday that their 'ambiguous statement'
after events in Moscow suggested they were not completely loyal.
In the mining Kuzbass region, a local administration spokesman said that the
council and administration were working together to prevent Moscow's
violence from spreading locally.
If Mr Yeltsin calls for re-election of the soviets, or councils - without a
reform of their role - he could find himself with the same people in charge
of unreformed legislatures.
Mr Yuri Luzhkov, the mayor of Moscow who helped put down the uprising
against Mr Yeltsin, set the example yesterday by dissolving Moscow's city
and district councils and saying they would be replaced by a single new-look
city council which would not meddle in his day-to-day running of the city.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin is to go ahead with a three-day visit to Tokyo from
next Monday, a move which is likely to improve sensitive relations with
Japan.
His cancellation of two visits to Tokyo during the past year has blocked
progress on a dispute over four islands off northern Japan which were seized
by Soviet troops at the end of the second world war. The cancellations also
risked a snub to Japan, Russia's third largest aid donor.
Tokyo yesterday voiced formal regret about the bloodshed in Moscow, but said
it would continue to provide financial assistance to Russia.
'We must support (Mr Yeltsin's) way of thinking, which should be good for
the world economy as well as world peace,' said Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance
minister.
Japan has provided Dollars 5bn to Russia since the Soviet Union collapsed.
But it says larger-scale economic aid depends on progress on the islands
question. Russia and Japan have yet to sign a formal second world war peace
treaty because of the this. Their return to Japan is becoming an increasing
issue of national pride, as Tokyo becomes more confident in international
affairs.
'I think it is the right way, to follow the existing policy, to expand
economic and political ties at the same pace,' said Mr Morihiro Hosokawa,
the prime minister.
Given Mr Yeltsin's problems at home, Japanese officials do not expect to
make great progress on the dispute. But they value the opportunity to keep
negotiations going.
A Russian delegation is expected to visit Tokyo today to prepare the ground.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Crisis in Russia: Change of economic course in wind - Russia
looks to IMF and World Bank for speedy help
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government expects accelerated assistance from the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank before the end of the year, with the
Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 993m) second tranche of the IMF's systemic
transformation facility likely to be paid next month.
Meetings last week in Washington between Mr Boris Fyodorov, finance
minister, and the leadership of the Fund and the Bank encouraged both
institutions to hope for a decisive change of course in an economic policy
which had gone badly off course in the past three months. Inflation reached
around 27 per cent in August and about 20 per cent the following month,
according to figures released yesterday by the government's Economic Reform
Centre.
Mr Fyodorov told both institutions he expected that results of a tighter
financial and budgetary policy would be obvious by the end of this month.
The governments of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries want to
support President Boris Yeltsin in the run-up to the parliamentary elections
scheduled for December. They are also keen that the elections take place no
later than December so that the period in which he can indulge in a
pre-election spending spree to bolster his popularity is kept to a minimum.
Mr Sergei Vassiliev, head of the Economic Reform Centre, said the
administration was preparing a raft of measures under the heading of a 'Plan
for Economic Work in 1994'. These would centre on liberalisation of trade
and energy prices, speeding up privatisation and protecting private
property, with 'post-privatisation' reforms designed to make enterprises now
in the private sector more efficient, and to streamline the relationship
between the federal and regional budgets.
The absence of the parliament, he said, gave the government a certain
freedom of action, But 'on the other hand, elections to the new parliament
mean that the government cannot plan properly in this period'.
Emphasising the seriousness of the present economic situation, Professor
Richard Layard, an adviser to the government, said yesterday that the rise
of central bank credits in the third quarter was likely to be around 40 per
cent, against a target of 20 per cent.
He said that an extra cause of alarm was that the velocity of money
transactions - the rate at which money changes hands - had risen sharply.
Between October last year and this August, money had increased 4.45 times
while prices had increased 7.78 times.
'This means that people are spending their money much faster than before.
This was always the great worry - that in an inflationary situation people
don't want to hold on to their money. It's dangerous because even if you
manage to stick to the credit targets, you don't necessarily check
inflation.'
He said that measures to restrict credits and bring down the budget deficit
'would be very hard - but inflation is also very hard on people'.
Reformers in the government are now pressing hard for the resignation of Mr
Viktor Gerashchenko, central bank chairman. Mr Andrei Illarionov, economic
adviser to Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, said yesterday that
since the bank had been brought under government control on September 21
following the banning of parliament, it had refused to carry out an order to
remit its profits to the government.
Mr Illarionov, in a detailed critique of the bank, said yesterday that its
'senseless' decision in July to declare invalid all pre-1993 cash roubles
had increased inflation in August by up to 15 per cent, and in September by
around 7 per cent as cash flooded back into Russia from former Soviet
republics still using the rouble.
The bank's announcement on Monday that transactions in foreign currency were
to be declared invalid from January 1 was not backed by the government, and
was impossible to implement.
Mr Vassiliev said the economy was now extensively dollarised: between a
third and a half of cash money circulating or on deposit was now in dollars.
'The central bank's action is stupid, and they must change it,' he said.
Mr Vladimir Vinogradov, head of the Moscow Bankers' Association, called the
decision 'premature and another mistake by the central bank'. There was, he
said, no point in banning foreign currency until trust was restored in the
rouble.
The scanty good news is that privatisation continues at a rapid rate.
According to figures from the Centre for Economic Performance, some 20 per
cent of workers now work for companies in the private sector. Prof Layard
said that between 3 and 4 per cent of Russian industry was being privatised
each month.
'This is the fastest rate of privatisation in human history.
'In one month the Russian government is privatising more than Mrs Thatcher
(former British prime minister) did in 10 years.'

FT  06 OCT 93 / BR stations may be run by private sector under leasing plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL JOHNSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DETAILED PLANS to lease out railway stations, transforming them from the
'Cinderellas' of British Rail by attracting private sector capital, were
published yesterday by Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary.
British Rail is to transfer the freehold of its 2,500 stations to Railtrack,
the state-owned subsidiary, in April next year, Mr MacGregor told the
Conservative party conference in Blackpool.
Railtrack is expected to lease most stations to franchised train operators,
but hive off the biggest mainline stations - which have extensive
landholdings and development potential - to independent operators on leases
of up to 125 years.
'These proposals are designed to bring in private sector finance and
expertise to exploit their development and commercial trading potential,' Mr
MacGregor said.
Although income from station trading rose by 20 per cent to Pounds 41m out
of the BR Property Board's Pounds 139m gross income from letting in 1992-93,
Railtrack might find it difficult to persuade companies to buy leases for
all 2,500.
The government hopes that the 'vast majority' of stations will be taken on
by the franchised passenger operators.
But Sea Containers, which is keen to win the franchise for the Great Western
main line, yesterday said it would not be interested in the lease, even for
an important regional station such as Bristol Temple Meads.
Railtrack is more likely to attract private sector interest for terminals in
London and the largest UK cities.
Ms Sarah Mansfield, general manager of L&amp;R Leisure group, which already owns
the lease for one of two stations in Windsor, Berkshire, said the company
would be interested in stations such as Oxford and York.
The Central Transport Consultative Committee, the rail users' watchdog, said
it was important to maintain the balance between commercialisation and
providing 'rail-based facilities', such as timetables and passenger
announcements.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Thatcher leak undercuts move to boost Major: Conservative
attempts to create a public display of unity at conference are undermined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH CRACKS appeared last night in the Conservative party's effort to
underpin Mr John Major's leadership after the disclosure of further
criticism of the prime minister by Lady Thatcher.
Despite a subsequent damage-limitation exercise, the first day of the
party's Blackpool conference was overshadowed by the leak of excerpts from
Lady Thatcher's forthcoming memoirs revealing her less-than-flattering
opinion of Mr Major.
The furore surrounding the leak, published in the Daily Mirror, forced a
public statement last night from the former prime minister in which she
recalled that she had backed Mr Major for the leadership when she resigned
in November 1990.
The Sunday Times, which has bought the serialisation rights to the memoirs,
The Downing Street Years, last night failed in an attempt to get a High
Court injunction preventing further publication of information from the book
and this morning the Daily Mirror printed what it said were more leaked
extracts.
Lady Thatcher's statement added that she wanted to confirm 'that she would
do the thing again today and that she continues to support John Major as
leader of the party and as prime minister'. Her friends then flatly denied
reports that she had referred in the book to her successor as
'intellectually lightweight', 'politically naive' or 'small-minded'.
Beyond those phrases there was little sensational in the leaked report. But
the memoirs are understood to reflect Lady Thatcher's view - expressed
frequently to confidants - that Mr Major has failed to display firm
leadership. One senior Conservative who has seen a manuscript of the memoirs
described the report as 'exaggerated but broadly accurate'.
The row destabilised attempts by the party leadership to create a public
display of unity during what is seen as a critical week in Mr Major's
efforts to restore his political authority.
With Lady Thatcher due to arrive in Blackpool today and appear alongside Mr
Major tomorrow, senior ministers maintained a public display of indifference
to her alleged criticisms. Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, led calls
for the party to bury its divisions.
But privately there was anger at Lady Thatcher's continued refusal to give
full support to her successor. Party officials said if attempts at
bridge-building failed they were determined that she rather than Mr Major
should bear the blame for any public breach.
The anxious mood of the conference was reinforced by a warning from Lord
Tebbit, a leading Eurosceptic, that support for Mr Major from the party's
right wing would depend upon him sticking to an aggressively anti-federalist
approach to Europe.
In a speech designed to prevent a renewed outbreak of the party's civil war
over Europe, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said Conservatives now
had the opportunity to unite behind a policy which would defend Britain's
identity in Europe.
But the tensions below the surface were underlined by Lord Tebbit's
deliberately faint praise for Mr Major and by a warning from the party's
pro-European wing that they would not tolerate concessions to the sceptics.
Meanwhile, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, was said to be determined to
keep open the option of further tax increases in his November Budget.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Pressure grows in US for troops to leave Somalia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton cut short a West Coast trip to fly back to Washington
yesterday for discussions with senior advisers on the next US moves in
Somalia. The decision comes in the face of growing domestic pressure for an
early withdrawal of US troops from the country.
As General Mohammed Farah Aideed, the Somali warlord, taunted the US in
radio broadcasts, the US public and its politicians recoiled from graphic
television pictures of US servicemen killed or captured in Mogadishu on
Sunday.
The weight of political pronouncements was heavily in favour of US
disengagement from Somalia. Senators as philosophically different as Bill
Bradley, the New Jersey Democrat, and John McCain, the Arizona Republican,
urged the president to bring US troops home.
Last week the House followed the Senate in passing a non-binding resolution
requiring Mr Clinton to seek Congressional approval by November 15 for
continued deployment of US forces. On Monday, demonstrating comparable
concern, the Senate appropriations committee voted to delete all the funding
requested by the administration for peacekeeping purposes.
Some senior voices, including Senator Sam Nunn, Democratic chairman of the
armed services committee, and Senator Richard Lugar, the Republican foreign
policy expert from Indiana, argued that continued deployment for protective
purposes was necessary while a more definitive policy was worked out.
On Monday Mr Clinton dispatched reinforcements to Mogadishu after the
heaviest losses in the 10-month US presence in Somalia. He warned Gen Aideed
of the severe consequences of harming any of the captured servicemen.
The president also said on Monday that US troops were now more vulnerable
because there were fewer of them - about 4,000 compared to a peak of nearly
30,000 - and because Somalis, no longer starving, seemed more susceptible to
the exhortations of warlords like Gen Aideed.
Mr Clinton and Mr Les Aspin, his defence secretary, said the reinforcements
were essentially protective in nature. But neither denied that it remained a
US objective to capture Gen Aideed and his leading supporters.
The Pentagon said yesterday the reinforcements would include US Rangers,
Bradley armoured vehicles, M1 tanks and MH6 and AH6 helicopters. A
spokeswoman said: 'We just want to make the point that we are not escalating
here.' The Pentagon said a 'handful' of its troops were still unaccounted
for but said it had evidence of only one person held by Gen Aideed's forces.
US policy remains ultimately to withdraw from Somalia, on the grounds that
the humanitarian mission has been completed. UN contingents are then
supposed to keep the peace and encourage the process of reconciliation and
nation building by the Somalis.

FT  06 OCT 93 / Yeltsin purges political opponents: Emergency restrictions
on media provoke a public outcry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday purged opponents in Moscow and in the
regions amid a public outcry over emergency restrictions on the media and,
separately, allegations that arrested demonstrators had been severely
beaten.
Mr Yeltsin, who declared a week-long state of emergency in Moscow after the
army crushed an armed uprising by supporters of the parliament, sacked the
prosecutor-general, Mr Valentin Stepankov, and two regional governors.
He also postponed a meeting of regional leaders, who had been expected to
set up a new Federation Council, to give himself more time to purge disloyal
officials in the provinces. Restrictions on the media, including bannings
and censorship, caused a storm of protest and the resignation of Mr
Yeltsin's media aide, Mr Mikhail Poltoranin.
At least 150 people were killed in the two days of violence, according to Mr
Oleg Soskovets, first deputy prime minister. Separately it emerged that
1,500 people, rounded up after elite troops stormed the White House, were
being held in detention centres around Moscow.
Apart from the rebellion's top leaders, such as Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the
former vice-president, and Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker,
who were in Lefortovo jail, those in custody included deputies who had
stayed in the White House, as well as snipers and demonstrators who had
stormed the mayor's office and the television centre on Sunday night.
One of those detained and then released, Mr Boris Kagarlitsky, a well-known
writer and member of the Moscow city council, said yesterday that many
demonstrators and bystanders had been severely beaten to force confessions
while in police custody.
'We were handcuffed and beaten with Kalashnikovs to make us sign a
confession. We were not blindfolded, but told to face the wall, and if we
turned around we were kicked,' he said, adding that their official charge
was stealing a police car.
The deputies were finally released, one with a broken rib, when an
international human rights group learnt of their arrest and telephoned
police stations directly.
However, Mr Kagarlitsky, 35, said that at least two more deputies from the
Moscow city council were still being held.
'I was a dissident under Brezhnev and jailed for 13 months then. But I was
never beaten like that then,' he said.
Mr Yeltsin's onslaught also turned to the regions. According to his original
plan when he dissolved the Russian parliament two weeks ago, the Federation
Council was to become the un-elected upper chamber of a new parliament. It
was due to comprise the chiefs of the regional administrations and councils
in each of Russia's 88 regions.
But Mr Pyotr Philipov, a presidential aide, said Mr Yeltsin was now
considering whether to dissolve all councils. The aim would be to replace
them with new-style councils with less influence over the day to day running
of regional affairs.
Opposition political pro-communist parties, banned on Monday, yesterday
vowed to fight on, but claimed they would be prevented from registering for
the parliamentary elections.
The Russian Communist party, the largest of the parties, disputed that it
had been banned and insisted it would operate as normal.

FT  05 OCT 93 / International Company News: SAS directors reaffirm support
for Alcazar project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE directors of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) were forced yesterday to
reaffirm their support for the Alcazar project to combine forces with KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair and Austrian Airlines following media reports
in Scandinavia alleging opposition to the alliance at the highest levels in
SAS.
SAS said the Alcazar negotiating team, led by Mr Jan Carlzon, who resigned
as SAS president and chief executive last week, had the full support of the
board and new management. 'SAS's position in favour of Alcazar is unchanged.
The organisation changes made by SAS last week combine the purpose of
completing the Alcazar negotiations in a manner satisfactory to SAS and the
purpose of improving SAS's profitability,' SAS said.
Newspaper reports in Denmark, Norway and Sweden have suggested Mr Carlzon
was pushed out because of SAS's poor financial condition and scepticism over
the viability of the Alcazar project. They have alleged splits between the
Danish, Norwegian and Swedish camps within the three-cornered airline.
Specifically, they alleged that Mr Tage Andersen, the Danish chairman of
SAS, had been at odds over Alcazar for some time with Mr Carlzon, a Swede
and one of its most enthusiastic proponents. SAS blames the reports on
mischievous attempts to exploit tensions between the different nationalities
within the airline.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Falling under the spell of the frontier spirit: The creation
of a giant 'super-regional'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Chock-full of capital and with little in the way of new loan growth to look
forward to on their home turf, America's stronger regional banks have been
on a buying spree lately. Their ambition: the creation of the US's first
true nationwide banking groups as they hunt for new sources of revenue.
Mr Victor Riley, the 62-year-old chairman of KeyCorp whose career will be
capped by a merger with Society Corp, yesterday summed up the mood: 'It was
apparent that a continuation of expense reduction is not something that
either of us could live on forever.'
The hunt for higher revenues has taken banks into new markets and new
product areas. By linking their branch systems, many hope to create bigger
networks selling a broader range of products, such as mutual funds and other
investment-related services.
Inevitably, the demand has pushed up the price of banks with good
distribution systems and sound balance sheets. The average purchase price
for US banks has crept up to 2.5 times net asset value - a substantial
premium over the valuation put by the stock market on the banking industry,
which is below 2 times net assets, says Mr John Leonard, a regional banking
analyst at Salomon.
With such a premium, will the shareholders of expansion-minded banks end up
disappointed? No bank has yet proved that it can make a success of running a
nationwide business handling a wide range of products, says Thomas Brown, a
banking analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
The KeyCorp/Society transaction, structured as a merger, does not involve
the payment of a premium to either company's shareholders.
However, it is based on the ambitious assumption that KeyCorp's branch
network, built mainly around small businesses and individual customers, can
be used to generate more business for Society's 'products'. These are based
on specialised corporate lending and asset management for medium-sized
businesses.
Meanwhile, there appear to be few obstacles to the quickening pace of US
regional bank mergers. Though some states - such as Missouri and Minnesota -
still put restrictions on interstate banking, most have relaxed their rules.
The biggest single obstacle remains the Southeast Compact: an agreement
between 13 south-eastern states requiring banks in the region to maintain at
least 80 per cent of their deposits there. Some, like South Carolina-based
NationsBank, have reached further afield into other states, such as Texas,
only because the compact does not apply to takeovers of banks which are
receiving federal government support.
Against this background, the pace of bank mergers has been picking up. While
two big deals hogged the headlines at the start of the decade -
BankAmerica's takeover of Security Pacific and Chemical's merger with
Manufacturers Hanover - smaller regional transactions have been
accelerating.
Last year, bank mergers worth Dollars 8.5bn were announced; this year, the
figure will be considerably higher. 'There have been a lot of acquisitions
in the Dollars 3bn to Dollars 5bn range,' says Mr Leonard at Salomon.
NationsBank and Banc One, from Ohio, have set the pace through acquisition
in recent years, but there is a growing queue to follow them. The
KeyCorp/Society merger will create a third geographically diverse
'super-regional' banking group. The question now: who will be next?
Fleet Financial and PNC - among the US's top 15 banks in terms of assets -
are the two most frequently singled out as likely merger candidates, either
with each other or with other banks. Each has a strong local base (Fleet in
New England, PNC in Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Ohio), a healthy balance
sheet and a good return on capital. Each also has a management which has
expressed interest in expansion.
BankAmerica, the US's second-biggest bank with an extensive presence in the
west, is also waiting in the wings. However, the difficulty it is
experiencing in swallowing Security Pacific and the recession in California
are widely expected to keep it on the sidelines.
With this growing list of merger candidates, it was not surprising yesterday
to see KeyCorp and Society injecting a poison pill into their deal to
dissuade rival suitors.
Unsolicited bids among US banks have not been a feature of the latest
takeover wave. But as the pace picks up and the list of attractive merger
candidates shrinks, an unwanted bid looks increasingly likely.

<TEXT>
FIGHTING between Croats and Moslems worsened yesterday while international
negotiators struggled to forge an agreement on keeping UN troops in
ex-Yugoslavia, Reuter reports from Sarajevo.
A spokesman for the United Nations Protection Force (Unprofor) said Bosnian
Croats had launched an offensive against Moslems in Kiseljak, in central
Bosnia about 35km west of Sarajevo.
Col Bill Aikman also told reporters in Sarajevo that parts of the disputed
southern town of Mostar had come under mortar fire despite a ceasefire
signed at the weekend between Croats and Moslems. Two civilians died in the
shelling, Sarajevo's Moslem-controlled radio reported yesterday.
European Community foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg were discussing
the deadlock in peace talks, prompted when the Moslem-led Bosnian government
effectively rejected the latest Geneva peace plan by demanding more
concessions on land.
Peace mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg said they had not
given up hopes for an end to the war in Bosnia, but a settlement looked far
away.

FT  05 OCT 93 / VW chief tries to soothe Spanish: Piech to stress the need
for rationalisation at Seat subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLKSWAGEN'S chairman, Mr Ferdinand Piech, will travel to Spain tomorrow in
an attempt to soothe political and union fears over the outcome of the
crisis at the group's local subsidiary, Seat.
Although he is not prepared to offer any further cash aid beyond the recent
DM1.5bn (Dollars 920m) emergency injection, he will attempt to convince
political leaders of an urgent need for rationalisation.
Seat expects a deficit of DM1.25bn this year, and even if demand for cars
improves, further substantial losses are inevitable next year without
change, group officials said.
The aim of the visit was to find a solution acceptable to all sides, a
spokesman said last night after a VW board meeting. A company statement
added that no decisions had yet been taken over the future of Seat's
factories and there was no question of the company losing its independence
'as a brand within the group'. It was necessary to bring Seat up to
internationally competitive standards, especially in terms of employment
levels.
Spanish media have charged VW with imperialism and trying to protect German
jobs at the expense of Seat workers. Yesterday's newspapers carried reports
that VW wanted to move key decision-making responsibilities from Spain to VW
headquarters in Germany.
The outcry started last week after the resignation of Mr Juan Antonio Daz
Alvarez, the Seat chairman. He lost his job after being told by the VW board
that his rationalisation plans, including around 5,000 job cuts, were 'too
soft'.
Mr Piech is due to meet leaders of national and regional governments in
Madrid and Catalonia, and have further talks with union officials anxious
about the future of the Seat site in the Zona Franca, Barcelona, which
employs about 10,500 people.
Mr Piech, who will travel with Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the
group's Spanish-born production director, was yesterday warned to keep his
promise that unions would be involved in decision-making.
Mr Enrique Montoya, a leader of the UGT union, who met Mr Piech last Friday,
said he believed the union voice would be heard. But if decisions were taken
without union participation, there would be 'protests of unprecedented
intensity', he added.

FT  05 OCT 93 / BNP shares set at FFr240 in attempt to draw investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN RIDDING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government yesterday set a lower than expected price of FFr240 on
shares in Banque Nationale de Paris, the country's third largest bank, in an
attempt to draw investors to the first issue in its ambitious privatisation
programme.
Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said that the issue, which will
be offered to investors from today, 'is aimed primarily at French
households'.
Market analysts in Paris said that the price of the issue, which values the
bank at about FFr43bn (Dollars 7.5bn), was at least FFr10 per share lower
than they had forecast. They said it demonstrated the desire of the
centre-right government of Mr Edouard Balladur to guarantee a successful
start to its plan to privatise 21 state-owned groups.
'They want to begin with a bang' explained Mr David Harrington, French
market analyst at James Capel in Paris.
Mr Alphandery also gave details of a group of stable investors which will
hold about 30 per cent of BNP's shares after privatisation. Most of these
shareholders will be French financial and industrial groups, but they will
also include General Electric of the US, BAT Industries of the UK, Roche
Holding of Switzerland, Dresdner Bank of Germany and the Kuwait Investment
Authority.
According to Mr Alphandery, the price was slightly above the minimum level
of FFr235.5 set by the privatisation commission, an independent body formed
to establish the terms and conditions of the privatisation issues.
He said it was 'a medium-term' price which had been calculated on the basis
of analysis of BNP's earnings performance and business strategy.
Under the terms of the BNP issue, which will close on the evening of October
12, 72m shares will be offered for sale. Of these, 37.5m will be reserved
for individual investors and 34.6m for institutional investors. The tranche
allocated to individual investors can be increased to 47m shares if demand
is strong.
Of the core investors, Union des Assurances de Paris, the state-owned
insurance group, which is also on the privatisation list, will raise its
holding in BNP from 10 per cent to 15 per cent. A group of 15 other
industrial and financial groups will hold a further 15 per cent of BNP's
shares.
Chief among these 15 investors are Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group, which will
be privatised by the middle of next year, and Saint-Gobain, the glass and
building materials group - which will each hold about 2 per cent. Like the
rest of the 15 investors they will pay a premium of 4 per cent.
Other core investors include Dresdner Bank, a strategic partner of BNP,
which will hold about 1 per cent of the shares. The two banks eventually
plan to take a 10 per cent stake in each other.
The privatisation of BNP will raise about FFr28bn for the government. The
target for the year as a whole is FFr40bn. The balance will be raised
through the sale of the next companies on the list, Rhone Poulenc, the
chemicals group, and Banque Hervet, a small retail bank.

FT  05 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ladbroke doldrums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and SAQIB QURESHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Negative press comment kept Ladbroke in the doldrums, the shares closing 5
down at 178p ex-dividend in busy turnover of 6.3m. The company last weekend
warned newspapers not to repeat allegations believed to be already the
subject of an injunction at another Sunday newspaper.
Yesterday, the leisure sector was abuzz with talk over the affair, with most
analysts agreeing that the whole episode had been blown up out of all
proportion. 'Ladbroke is always prone to this kind of rumour,' was the
almost universal view. Ladbroke shares weakened last week, mostly on the
back of poor figures from rival hotelier Forte, whose shares rose 8
yesterday to 226p ex-dividend.
Shares in BP bucked the market trend finishing a penny lighter at 328 1/2 p
on volume of 7.1m as market watchers came to the view that last week's
advance in the wake of OPEC agreements, had been overdone. However, Shell
Transport continued in favour and the shares put on 6 to 681 1/2 p. Also in
demand was Enterprise Oil, where last week's recommendation from Nomura
continued to boost trading. The shares put on another 6 to 476p.
Among banking stocks, Bank of Scotland were wanted ahead of tomorrow's
interim figures and the shares hardened 5 to 182p.
Investors in Standard Chartered continued to be cheered by Friday's news
that the bank had been paid Pounds 25.9m in settlement of its claim against
National Housing Bank of India and the shares gained another 16 to 984p.
Shares in financial services and banking group London Scottish Bank tumbled
10 to 89p, making it the day's biggest retreat in the market, after news
that the group had terminated talks that could have led to an offer.
Speculation that Lucas Industries would announce a new chairman when it
reports figures next Monday, once again did the rounds in the market. The
shares advanced 7 to 156p, in trade of 2.4m with the name of Mr George
Simpson, currently deputy Chairman at British Aerospace and head of its
Rover subsidiary, mentioned as the most likely candidate.
Weekend press reports that Johnson Matthey, the world's largest platinum
metals group, and Cookson Group were planning to merge their interests in
metals, encouraged demand for both stocks. The former gained 4 to 483p,
while the latter moved 6 ahead to 202p, as one analyst said that 'such a
move makes sense and it would result in synergy for both groups.'
Securities house BZW was reported to have recommended TI Group, where the
shares put on 4 to 350p. Fears of litigation in the US dampened enthusiasm
for T&amp;N and the shares finished 5 lower at 183 1/2 p. The strong market
trend helped Glynwed bounce from the recent doldrums and the shares hardened
7 to 316p.
A squeeze in UK airports operator BAA saw the shares advance 14 to 869p.
However, nervous trading ahead of today's publication of September traffic
data, depressed British Airways, leaving the shares 2 1/2 lighter at 359p.
Sentiment was also weakened by talk that the UK government was considering
charging VAT on domestic UK flights.
Shares in tobacco and financial services group BAT remained under a cloud
following last week's poorly received visit to its US operations by UK
analysts. They closed 2 down at 461p, after trade of 5.8m.
International conglomerate Hanson, recently the subject of a spate of
profits downgradings and sell advice, bounced 6 1/2 to to 260p in strong
business of 14m shares. Dealers suggested the UK selling had dried up
leaving US demand to underpin the day's advance.
Weekend reports of impending changes to the board of Lonrho, the
international trading group, boosted the company's shares and they firmed 3
to 124p.
NatWest Securities was reported to have recommended Royal Insurance and the
shares gained 6 to 326p.
News that building materials group Heywood Williams has increased sales
points from 90 to 140 upon completion of a Pounds 11m deal was followed by a
fall in the shares of a couple of pence to 343p. Post-tax profits of Pounds
0.6m for the 7 months to July 1993 were also welcomed.
Light trading ahead of forthcoming annual results edged construction group
Wolseley 17 to 675p; analysts expect profits of Pounds 120m.
ICI chairman Sir Denys Henderson's cautious comments in Rome concerning the
future of the European chemicals industry left ICI shares unchanged at 716p.
Hoare Govett suggested that the stock is overvalued since, 'the rating of
the shares more than discounts cyclical recovery'.
Avon Rubber shares fell 3 to 510p with views on short term prospects clouded
by reports of poor car sales in Europe. Inchcape was appointed by Jaguar to
set up 3 dealerships in China, the shares remaining unchanged at 519p.
Textiles group Coats Viyella continued to impress analysts favourably and
the shares rose 4 to 258p.

Shares in British Gas trailed the market closing a penny lower at 325 1/2 p,
following volume of 5.9m, after analysts at Nomura urged investors to sell
the stock.
The new oils and gas team at the securities house believe the outlook for
the stock remains uncertain as 'it looks increasingly unlikely that the
government will accept the recent Monopolies and Mergers Commission report
on the break up of British Gas.'
Sentiment was further dented by news from the company that it expects its
share of the firm contract gas supply market to drop to 55 per cent by the
end of next year from its current level of around 68 per cent.

FT  05 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Utilities wanted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and SAQIB QURESHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Utilities were in demand on yield considerations. Water stocks received an
additional boost as broker SG Warburg moved from 'neutral' to 'overweight'.
Warburg cited several reasons for the move including, the sector's 'safe
premium yields as base rates remain on a downward trend.' The broker also
liked the defensive earnings appeal of the sector and the possible boost to
dividend growth and non-consumer stocks in next month's budget should the
chancellor increase taxes on consumer goods.
Among the strong performances across the sector, Severn Trent gained 11 to
542p and Southern 17 to 569p. Both are tipped by Warburg. Elsewhere, Welsh
put on 16 to 620p and South West 15 to 575p.
However, the market appears divided over the appeal of the sector. With an
eye on next month's Ofwat report, NatWest Securities on Friday moved three
water stocks to an 'underperform' recommendation, arguing that 'regulatory
worries will pre-dominate' over the next 10 months.

FT  05 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Shift on food retailers

<TEXT>
FOOD retail shares bounced forward as BZW, one of the sector's leading
brokers, joined the growing band of commentators to believe that the share
price falls of recent months have been overdone. The broker moved from
'sell' to 'hold' on two of the sector's biggest stocks and adopted a more
positive view on the sector as a whole.
Mr Bill Curry at BZW said: 'Since we turned sellers in early March, the
sector has under-performed by 30 per cent. But we believe there is now
evidence of food price stability creeping back into the sector.' The broker
moved Tesco, up 9 1/2 to 200p ex-dividend, and Argyll, ahead 10 1/2 at 298
1/2 p, to a hold, and retained the same recommendation on J Sainsbury, 12
1/2 forward at 428 1/2 p.
To encourage investors, BZW also launched a food retail warrant
incorporating a basket of stocks by market capitalisation. The Pounds 100m
launch is one of the first to include solely UK traded stocks.

FT  05 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERIVATIVES markets had one of their most successful sessions for many
weeks, writes Terry Byland. The apparent restoration of President Yeltsin's
authority brought a swift turnround in sentiment in UK equities and, with
few institutions willing to sell either stock or futures, prices were
squeezed sharply.
With international tensions seemingly easier, traders turned attention to
prospects for UK base rate cuts. The December contract on the Footsie opened
firmly and soon restored the 39 point premium over cash not seen since the
beginning of last week. Since the contract can at present be arbitraged at
any premium of around 31 points, there was room yesterday for substantial
trading between futures and stocks.
Trading gathered pace at mid-session when the December contract broke
through the 3,100 mark to reach 3,107 at the official close. With Fair Value
premium now around 21, the contract was finally around 40 points premium to
cash. However, turnover was less exciting at 11,724 contracts, a respectable
figure but well below totals achieved on several days last week.
Traded options activity jumped to 26,043 contracts, with the FT-SE contract
at 11,137 against 7,207 on Friday. The Euro FT-SE headed the individual
contracts list with 3,327 deals, Also active were Rolls-Royce at 1,214,
Thames Water (1,110) and Shell (1,099).

FT  05 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Futures lead 28 point FT-SE advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK stock market advanced strongly yesterday as President Boris Yeltsin's
re-establishment of his authority in Russia enabled investors to turn their
attention back to the underlying investment fundamentals in London stocks.
The lead came from stock index futures, where the December contract on the
FT-SE Index closed within eight points of the all-time high reached at the
end of August.
Market strategists were surprised by the 28 point rebound in the Footsie
Index. However, they pointed out that yesterday was the first day of a new
equity account which features Thursday's speech to the UK Conservative party
conference by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer.
While the City of London expects that any cut in domestic base rates or
similar economic boost is likely to be postponed until the budget in
November, it still hopes that Mr Clarke will deliver a confidence-boosting
speech this week.
Mr Marcus Grubb at Salomon Brothers International expects the chancellor to
cut rates by as much as 1 per cent to offset revenue raising in the budget.
'UK equities now represent good value compared to other international equity
markets,' he says. Salomon is switching to an overweight position in the UK
and raising its year-end Footsie target to 3,200, catching up with several
other UK equity analysts.
Equities opened lower, restrained at first by ex dividend quotations in a
number of leading stocks but also by the increasingly ominous reports of
military clashes in Moscow. However, the relatively calm reaction from other
European bourses, as well as the oil and currency sector, helped London to
steady and then to improve as stock index futures opened.
Turnover was sluggish at first, and share gains were modest until
mid-session, when the stock market responded vigorously to a soaring premium
on the Footsie December future and also firmness in UK government bonds.
Good M0 money supply and consumer lending data also helped confidence.
London was undeterred by a slow start on Wall Street or by a lower dollar
which restrained the blue chip internationals. Neither oils nor
pharmaceuticals could maintain the strength shown last week, although there
was heavy arbitraging between stock index futures and the underlying blue
chip stocks. Leadership of the market was taken up by the banking and retail
sectors which have most to gain from lower interest rates.
At the close, the FT-SE Index was 28.4 ahead at 3,067.7 after its best daily
performance since August 25. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, covering the range of
smaller stocks, closed 12.6 up at 3,439.3.
In spite of the quickening of pace in the second half of the session, Seaq
trading volume, at 552.3m shares, remained well short of Friday's total of
just over 636m. The focus on blue chip arbitrage dealing reduced to around
55 per cent the contribution to the total of deals in non-Footsie stocks.
With the dramatic news from Moscow taking up most of the attention in the
dealing rooms, there were fewer individual stock features than the rise in
the market suggested. But a good take-up for the Pounds 324m rights issue
from Cadbury Schweppes indicated a buoyant undertone.

FT  05 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow uncertain over Russian
developments

Wall Street
US share prices were mixed in light trading yesterday as investors attempted
to digest the implications for financial markets of the political crisis in
Russia, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 3.35 at 3,577.76.
The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended 0.06 higher at 461.34,
while the Amex composite finished 0.03 at 461.56, and the Nasdaq composite
up 1.60 at 764.83. Trading volume on the NYSE was 227m shares.
Traders and investors arrived at work yesterday morning in a nervous mood,
unsure of how the world's financial markets would react to the political
turmoil in Russia, where President Boris Yeltsin's battle with anti-reform
hardliners appeared to be reaching a violent and dramatic conclusion.
Traditionally, this kind of political crisis unsettles equity market
investors, but boost US bond prices, which are seen as a safe haven in times
of trouble. As expected, bonds firmed at the opening yesterday morning, but
demand was not that strong, and by late afternoon Treasury prices were
flat-to-lower.
Equity investors, meanwhile, were reassured by the confidence of overseas
markets, which were mostly firmer overnight. The modest reaction from the US
bond market also appeared to underline the view of most financial analysts -
that the turmoil in Russia would not have any serious economic or political
impact outside that country's borders.
Once it was clear by mid-morning in the US that army forces loyal to Mr
Yeltsin had regained control of the Parliament building in Moscow, and that
the rebels had surrendered, investors were able to devote some attention to
domestic matters. As it was, the day's main economic news - a 1.1 per cent
decline in August construction orders - was bearish for stocks, and
contributed to some of the day's declines.
Among individual issues, HCA-Hospital jumped Dollars 6 1/8 to Dollars 29 in
a volume of 5.8m shares after the company agreed to be taken over by
Columbia Healthcare in a stock swap which values the deal at Dollars 5.7bn.
Columbia fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 28 7/8 in volume of 3m shares on the
news.
In other merger-related movements, KeyCorp fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 37 1/2
and Society Corp ended steady at Dollars 32 1/2 after the two regional
banking groups agreed to join forces in a Dollars 3.9bn stock swap.
The technology sector was in strong demand. Compaq rose Dollars 1 1/8 to
Dollars 58 3/4 , Motorola firmed Dollars 1 to Dollars 101, Hewlett-Packard
rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 69 1/8 , IBM added Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 44
1/4 , and Digital Equipment rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 36 7/8 . Canada
TORONTO prices closed broadly mixed in relatively light trading, as a surge
by gold issues helped lift the 300 composite index to 4,002.3 at the close,
according to preliminary data. The TSE-300 composite index rose 13.81
points, or 0.35 per cent. Volume was 38.43m shares, compared with 41.36m
last Friday.
Industrial products rose 1 per cent.

FT  05 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses improve as Moscow
hardliners give up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES seemed relatively unperturbed by the overnight strife in Moscow but,
nevertheless, they showed signs of improvement in the afternoon as Russian
hardliners began surrendering and leaving the White House, writes Our
Markets Staff.
At Goldman Sachs, Mr Sushil Wadhwani and Mr Mushtaq Shah said that it made
sense partially to inoculate portfolios against 'Russian risk', recommending
a 3.5 per cent weighting in commodities, and retaining one of 9 per cent in
cash.
FRANKFURT, clearly, wanted to go up all day. Over the offical session, the
DAX index rose 11.63 to 1,923.72 as German stock market turnover improved
from DM4.4bn to DM5.25bn, and in the afternoon the Ibis-indicated DAX
climbed another 11.51 to 1,935.23.
Commentators put the morning gains down, not to any wave of investment
buying, but to traders covering short positions as share price held firm;
there was more business later but traders, rather than investors, still held
sway.
Interest in Daimler remained high, the shares climbing DM9 to DM746 ahead of
today's listing in New York. Lufthansa rose another DM3.50 to DM163.50.
It confirmed the United Airlines pact, and forecast that its restructuring
programme would to enable it to halve its losses in 1993, and make a return
to profits possible in 1994.
Metallgesellschaft jumped DM10 to DM364. It said yesterday that it was
selling a stake of around four percent in Metall Mining Corp to Minorco, and
that the deal would help promote the joint development of mining projects.
MILAN's Comit index dipped 3.79 to 590.52 in volume depressed by a two hour
halt to screen-based trading during the morning as a result of technical
problems.
Fiat surprised some analysts with a further L290, or 5 per cent gain to
L6,080 in the wake of last week's record capital call and amid continued
speculation about possible alliances.
Rinascente, the retailer, and Ifil, the Agnelli family holding company, were
relisted after further details emerged about Fiat's complex plan to sell its
58 per cent share in Rinascente to its own shareholders and a public buy
offer by Ifil.
Rinascente added L270 or 2.8 per cent to L9,886 after a day's high of
L10,278, amid speculation that a higher tender bid for Rinascente might be
launched.
Ifil shed L484 or 7.8 per cent to L5,758, ahead of a post-bourse
presentation to analysts: it was suspended temporarily, shortly after the
opening, as the price slumped by more than 12 per cent.
PARIS saw the BNP privatisation price set at FFr240 per share, regarded as
cheap and no threat to overall sentiment, as afternoon short covering took
the CAC 40 index to a close 11.94 higher at 2,128.66.
Rhone-Poulenc was easier, however, falling FFr6.50 to FFr153. Some analysts
reckoned that if the BNP price was on the low side, Rhone could be floated
at a discount to the market. Peugeot rose FFr8 to FFr665 after
underperforming the market in recent weeks, and in spite of a 18 per cent
fall in September car sales.
Turnover was estimated at about FFr3bn, the same as last Friday's level.
ZURICH trading was restrained as the SMI index rose 8.7 to 2,490.3. Swiss Re
registered rose SFr45 to SFr3,340 on last Friday's results, and Winterthur
registered advanced SFr13 to SFr664.
Swissair added SFr15 to SFr690 amid unconfirmed reports that the airline was
considering paying a special dividend to lower the company's valuation ahead
of the Alcazar alliance. However, analysts noted that such a move was only
one of the options available to the group.
SMH, watchmaker, shed SFr7 to SFr205 amid heavy US selling on worries about
the profits outlook. James Capel in London, downgrading the stock to 'hold',
said it was revising down expectations for sales growth to 8 per cent and
its 1993 net profit forecast was being trimmed from SFr485m to SFr460m.
Ascom, the telecommunications group, surged 6.4 per cent at one stage after
domestic newspapers reported that the Swiss army was considering purchasing
a SFr800m telecommunications system by 1995m. But the shares settled back to
finish SFr20 higher at SFr1,120 as the company said that while it had a good
chance of winning the contract, it was at present only heading a research
project for the army.
AMSTERDAM overcame an unsteady start to finish firmer with the CBS Tendency
index adding 0.5 to 125.7. Royal Dutch rose 40 cents to Fl 188.60 after the
European Commission said it had cleared the sale of Shell's crop protection
business to American Cyanamid.
STOCKHOLM recovered on government proposals to halve capital gains tax on
share sales, and cut taxes on didivends and corporate profits. The
Affarsvarlden General index closed just 0.2 down at 1,299.0, although
Trelleborg B, volatile on the prospect of a Russian effect on metal prices,
rose by SKr5, or 13 per cent to SKr42.50.
OSLO took to the Russian news and the all share index rose 8.23 to 555.87;
HELSINKI went along, the Hex index closing 14.01 higher at 1,421.91.
TEL AVIV, in addition to hopes of a Russian solution, talked of a technical
correction after three days of profit taking as the Mishtanim index gained
4.22, or 1.9 per cent to 229.16.

FT  05 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Belgium visits the top of the table
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two of last week's global equity leaders, Finland and Malaysia, lead the
World Index performance tables this year but the third - Belgium - is a more
occasional visitor.
The Brussels equity market started this year well, notes Mr Thierry
Quincerot at Williams de Broe in London but, in April and May, it was
punished for its earlier speculation; fears were provoked by a domestic
political crisis which came to a head in March.
Last week, however, and in spite of denials from the top, stories circulated
that the government was about to let the Belgian franc float; there were
good results from Electrabel and Tractebel, two of the country's heavily
weighted utility groups; and even an initially bearish reaction to losses
from the Luxembourg-based steelmaker, Arbed, was more than recovered by
Friday.
In the east, the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange's composite index hit yet
another high last Friday, supported by expectations of an expansionary
budget at the end of this month. Mr David Bates, of Asia Equity, says that
last week's cut in the Malaysia's monthly inflation rate has domestic
investors believing that the corporation tax rate could be cut from 34 to 32
per cent.
Mr Bates adds that November's ruling party elections are expected to
indicate continuity in present government policies, and that the market has
a lot of liqudity with which to chase prices up. However, he reckons, it has
to be the dearest in the region on a 1994 p/e ratio of 21, and on estimated
10 per cent earnings per share growth - the slowest in Asia at the moment.
Finland tops the world rankings in local currency terms although, measured
by the dollar, it is outpaced by Malaysia which has a harder currency, and
which accelerated in the third quarter. Goldman Sachs still likes the
Helsinki market for its prospects of profit recovery, lower interest rates,
and on technical grounds.

FT  05 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei lower as Hong
Kong closes at record high

THE turmoil in Russia undermined enthusiasm for stocks, and the Nikkei index
closed marginally lower as investors remained on the sidelines, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei fell 18.70 to 20,264.43 with most investors reluctant to take
large positions until the response of other markets to the Russian crisis
became clear.
The index fell to the day's low of 20,151.32 in the morning session, in
tandem with the futures market which lost ground on news of the military
confrontation in Moscow. However, late arbitrage linked buying supported
share prices and the Nikkei rose to the day's high of 20,283.93 on late
bargain hunting.
Volume fell to 180m shares from 362m. Declines led advances by 591 to 372,
with 214 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks edged down
0.06 to 1,634.03 while, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.78 to
1,263.23.
Index-linked buying by institutional investors supported share prices. One
trader said that the Nikkei would have advanced further in a continuation of
Friday's strong performance, were it not for the Russian situation.
Investors' interest centred on semiconductor-related issues following
reports that electronics manufacturers were boosting output of 16-megabit
chips. Nikon rose Y25 to Y915 and Tokyo Electron gained Y110 to Y3,030.
Sharp jumped Y70 to Y1,550 on firm shipments of its camcorder. Other
consumer electronics makers were also strong, with Sony up Y50 to Y4,610 and
Matsushita Electronic Industrial gaining Y20 to Y1,450.
Investigations by the Fair Trading Commission of menswear discount retailers
triggered heavy selling of Aoki International and Aoyama Trading. Aoki fell
Y100 to Y5,500, and Aoyama failed to trade due to the lack of buyers.
Pharmaceuticals were lower on profit-taking following the recent bout of
buying ahead of annual medical conventions. Sankyo fell Y10 to Y3,000 and
Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical lost Y40 to Y2,410.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 35.92 to 22,251.94 in volume of 18.1m shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets found a diverse series of influences on trading.
HONG KONG shrugged off the latest inconclusive round of Sino-British talks
on the colony's future as foreign demand, beginning with US institutions and
spilling over to UK and Chinese funds, took shares to a record high close.
The Hang Seng index added 68.10 or 0.9 per cent to 7,744.32, after an
intraday high of 7,763.87, in relatively thin turnover of HKDollars 3.72m.
AUSTRALIA saw the political turmoil in Russia fuel a sharp rise in gold
stocks and push the overall market to a higher close, but with a holiday in
New South Wales, trade was otherwise dull. The All Ordinaries index added
4.2 to 1,977.0 in turnover of ADollars 165.31m.
The gold marker surged 42.5 to 2,006.6 with North Flinders rising 20 cents
to ADollars 12.50, Newcrest up 17 cents to ADollars 4.02, Plutonic up 10
cents to ADollars 7.00, and Homestake up 7 cents to ADollars 1.65.
MANILA turned sharply lower as banks with big common trust fund (CTF)
holdings sold shares to meet a new 10 per cent reserve requirement, which
took effect yesterday.
The composite index shed 55.01 or 2.8 per cent to 1,904.54.
The peso's fall last week prompted the central bank to impose capital
requirements on CTFs, which pool small deposits for investment in
high-yielding securities like T-bills and stocks.
NEW ZEALAND, devoid of any strong overall influence, meandered through thin
trade to a slightly higher close. The NZSE 40 capital index rose 6.35 to
1,946.36 in turnover of NZDollars 18.7m.
TAIWAN closed narrowly mixed after late bargain-hunting emerged to offset
early losses triggered by Russia's political crisis. The composite index
ended 1.62 lower at 3,808.24, after an intra-day low of 3,785, in very slow
turnover of TDollars 9.72bn.
SEOUL fell prey to a wave of profit-taking in reaction to last week's
pre-Chusok holiday rally, although some late bargain-hunting helped prices
up from their lowest levels.
The composite stock index shed 4.50 to 715.05.
SINGAPORE, easier for much of the day, picked up towards the close as hopes
rose for political stability in Russia. The Straits Times Industrial index
finished 4.97 higher to 2,023.07 after trading in negative territory for
much of the day.
KARACHI closed sharply higher on rumours that the former reformist prime
minister, Mr Nawaz Sharif may win in tomorrow's general elections. The KSE
index rose 14.68 to 1,357.05.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: D-Mark bucks Russian crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS RUSSIA stood on the brink of revolution yesterday the hard currency which
would be most threatened by political collapse in eastern Europe, the German
D-Mark, rose steadily throughout the day, writes Peter John
The preference for travel rather than the final destination is one of the
classic market cliches and the reverse is true in the case of bad news. With
the D-Mark, international financial dealers had seen Russia approach the
brink less than a month beforehand and become hardened against the
possibility of chaos.
There was a general belief that President Yeltsin would win through this
time as he had before, providing stability at best and 'devil-you-know'
credibility at worst. Support for the German currency was further helped by
encouraging domestic economic data and the poor economic situation elsewhere
in Europe.
Nevertheless, the D-Mark began the week with the inevitable knee-jerk
selling that took it down by more than two pfennigs to DM1.6550 against the
dollar when dealing began in the Far East. By the time European traders were
at their desks, however, it had already recovered to DM1.6480.
Then, the latest West German industrial production statistics showed that
production was not deteriorating. Also, the siege of the Russian Parliament
building appeared to be going President Yeltsin's way. The currency regained
all its earlier losses and moved ahead to DM1.6190 at best before closing at
DM1.6240 up from DM1.6310 on Friday.
Economists said that while Germany would obviously suffer from problems in
Russia the fundamental economic situation in the rest of Western Europe gave
no impetus for switching funds.
Belgium is saddled with heavy debt and concerns of a currency split with
Luxembourg. France is bedevilled with expectations of further rate cuts
which may be good for the economy but are negative for the currency and have
already been discounted in the market. Italy is gripped by political
concerns and there growing militancy of the northern right-wing groups.
Finally, there was a technical element to the strength of the D-Mark. The
last Russian crisis came at the end of the week; dealers who had already
balanced their books were subsequently caught and the currency was squeezed.
Yesterday, traders were prepared to take a more adventurous stance and less
inclined to sell.
Elsewhere, sterling avoided being shaken by either the D-Mark's earlier
weakness or the dollar's strength and held its ground throughout the day.
The pound closed at DM2.46, up from DM2.4550 previously and at Dollars
1.5150, up from Dollars 1.5055 previously.
The French franc was steady against the D-Mark with some dealers saying the
Bank of France had been taking advantage of the D-Mark's weakness to rebuild
its reserves.

FT  05 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Shortage taken out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREAT of revolution in Russia left Britain's domestic financial concerns in
a very parochial light yesterday. Consequently short sterling was sidelined
while the Bank of England's operations proceeded effortlessly writes Peter
John.
The week started with a continuation of the recent tradition of heavy cash
shortages, which have been the result of the government's unusually large
funding programme. A shortfall of over Pounds 1bn has become the norm and
yesterday's early forecast of Pounds 1.05bn came well below some bank
estimates.
Contrary to the tight conditions of the past few days there was such a
willingness to meet the shortage that overnight money rates, sometimes
squeezed as high as 8 per cent in recent weeks, fell as low as 3 per cent.
As one dealer said: 'You can't get much lower than that without giving it
away.'
Increased liquidity in the market was underlined by the high level of bills
for repurchase which were expected to drain Pounds 1.84bn from the system.
Added to these were Treasury bills and paper maturing in official hands,
which were expected to drain Pounds 1.21bn. Partly offsetting these,
Exchequer transactions added Pounds 1.03bn, a fall in note circulation
injected Pounds 900m and bankers' balances above target added Pounds 80m.
Most of the shortage was dealt with early in the day with the central bank
providing the money market with Pounds 900m of early assistance via bills
for resale to the market on October 25 at an established 5 29/32 per cent.
Later the bank provided an extra Pounds 100m. In the afternoon, the shortage
was revised to Pounds 1.31bn and the central bank provided a further Pounds
315m.
Short sterling traded within a very narrow range, opening at 94.35 and
ending the day only three basis points higher at 94.38 on turnover of just
under 11,000 contracts. The December contract was already discounting a cut
of almost half a percentage point off the base rate and dealers are expected
to hold it at current levels until the November budget unless a change is
announced sooner.
German call money was steady at around 6.95 per cent as the market gradually
steadied after a cash crunch late last week, which had been relieved by the
injection of extra short-term funds by the Bundesbank.
